Dilophosaurus

Dilophosaurus ( ) is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="theropod">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived in what is now North America during the <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Early Jurassic</a>, about 193million years ago. Three skeletons were discovered in <a href="northern%20Arizona">northern Arizona</a> in 1940, and the two best preserved were collected in 1942. The most complete specimen became the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of a new species in the genus "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>", named "M.wetherilli" by <a href="Samuel%20P.%20Welles">Samuel P. Welles</a> in 1954. Welles found a larger skeleton belonging to the same species in 1964. Realizing it bore crests on its skull, he assigned the species to the new genus "Dilophosaurus" in 1970, as Dilophosaurus wetherilli. The genus name means "two-crested lizard", and the species name honors John Wetherill, a <a href="Navajo">Navajo</a> councilor. Further specimens have since been found, including an infant. Footprints have also been attributed to the animal, including resting traces. Another species, "Dilophosaurus sinensis" from China, was named in 1993, but was later found to belong to the genus "<a href="Sinosaurus">Sinosaurus</a>".

At about in length, with a weight of about , "Dilophosaurus" was one of the earliest large predatory dinosaurs, though it was smaller than some later theropods. It was slender and lightly built, and the skull was proportionally large, but delicate. The snout was narrow, and the upper jaw had a gap or kink below the nostril. It had a pair of longitudinal, plate-shaped crests on its skull, similar to a <a href="cassowary">cassowary</a> with two crests. The <a href="mandible">mandible</a> was slender and delicate at the front, but deep at the back. The teeth were long, curved, thin, and compressed sideways. Those in the lower jaw were much smaller than those of the upper jaw. Most of the teeth had <a href="serration">serration</a>s at their front and back edges. The neck was long, and its vertebrae were hollow, and very light. The arms were powerful, with a long and slender upper arm bone. The hands had four fingers: the first was short but strong and bore a large claw, the two following fingers were longer and slenderer with smaller claws, and the fourth was <a href="vestigial">vestigial</a>. The thigh bone was massive, the feet were stout, and the toes bore large claws.

"Dilophosaurus" is a member of the family <a href="Dilophosauridae">Dilophosauridae</a> along with "<a href="Dracovenator">Dracovenator</a>", a group placed between the <a href="Coelophysidae">Coelophysidae</a> and later theropods. "Dilophosaurus" would have been active and bipedal, and may have hunted large animals; it could also have fed on smaller animals and fish. The function of the crests is unknown; they were too weak for battle, but may have been used in <a href="visual%20display">visual display</a>, such as <a href="species%20recognition">species recognition</a> and <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>. It may have grown rapidly, attaining a growth rate of per year early in life. The holotype specimen had multiple <a href="paleopathologies">paleopathologies</a>, including healed injuries and signs of a developmental anomaly. "Dilophosaurus" is known from the <a href="Kayenta%20Formation">Kayenta Formation</a>, and lived alongside dinosaurs such as "<a href="Coelophysis%20kayentakatae">Megapnosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Sarahsaurus">Sarahsaurus</a>". "Dilophosaurus" was featured in the novel "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28novel%29">Jurassic Park</a>" and its <a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">movie adaptation</a>, wherein it was given the fictional abilities to spit venom and expand a cowl on its neck, as well as being smaller than the real animal. It was designated as the <a href="state%20dinosaur">state dinosaur</a> of <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> in 2017.

"Dilophosaurus" was one of the earliest large predatory <a href="dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a>, a medium-sized <a href="theropod">theropod</a>, though small compared to some of the later theropods. Slender and lightly built, its size was comparable to that of a <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>. The largest known specimen weighed about , measured about in length, and its skull was long. The smaller <a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen weighed about , was long, with a hip height of about , and its skull was long. A resting trace of a theropod similar to "Dilophosaurus" and "<a href="Liliensternus">Liliensternus</a>" has been interpreted by some researchers as showing impressions of feathers around the belly and feet, similar to <a href="down%20%28feather%29">down</a>. Other researchers instead interpret these impressions as <a href="sedimentological">sedimentological</a> artifacts created as the dinosaur moved, though this interpretation does not rule out that the track-maker could have borne feathers.

The skull of "Dilophosaurus" was large in proportion to the overall skeleton, yet delicate. The snout was narrow in front view, becoming narrower towards the rounded top. The <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> (front bone of the upper jaw) was long and low when seen from the side, and its outer surface became less convex from snout to naris (bony nostril). The nostrils were placed further back than in most other theropods. The premaxilla was weakly attached to the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (the following bone of the upper jaw), only connecting at the middle of the palate, with no connection at the side. Hindwards and below, the premaxilla formed a wall for a gap between itself and the maxilla called the subnarial gap (also termed a "kink"). Such a gap is also present in <a href="coelophysoids">coelophysoids</a>. The subnarial gap resulted in a <a href="diastema">diastema</a>, a gap in the tooth row (which has also been called a "notch"). Within the subnarial gap was a deep excavation behind the toothrow of the premaxilla, called the subnarial pit, which was walled by a downwards keel of the premaxilla. The outer surface of the premaxilla was covered in <a href="foramina">foramina</a> (openings) of varying sizes. The upper of the two backwards extending processes of the premaxilla was long and low, and formed most of the upper border of the elongated naris. It had a dip towards the font, which made the area by its base concave in profile. The underside of the premaxilla containing the <a href="Dental%20alveolus">alveoli</a> (tooth sockets) was oval. The maxilla was shallow, and was depressed around the <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a> (a large opening in front of the eye), forming a recess that was rounded towards the front, and smoother than the rest of the maxilla. A foramen called the preantorbital fenestra opened into this recess at the front bend. Large foramina ran on the side of the maxilla, above the alveoli. A deep nutrient groove ran backwards from the subnarial pit along the base of the <a href="interdental%20plates">interdental plates</a> (or rugosae) of the maxilla.

"Dilophosaurus" bore a pair of high, thin, and arched (or plate-shaped) crests longitudinally on the skull roof. The crests were formed significantly by the <a href="lacrimal%20bones">lacrimal bones</a> and partially by the <a href="nasal%20bones">nasal bones</a>. The crests extended upwards and gave the appearance of a <a href="cassowary">cassowary</a> with two crests. As a distinct feature, each crest also had a finger-like backwards projection. The upper surface of the nasal bone between the crests was concave, and the nasal part of the crest overlapped the lacrimal part. As only one specimen preserves the shape of the crests, it is unknown if they differed in other individuals. The lacrimal bone had a unique thickened upper rim, where it formed the upper border at the back of the antorbital fenestra. The <a href="prefrontal%20bone">prefrontal bone</a> formed the roof of the <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye socket), and had an L-shaped bar that made part of the upper surface of the orbit concave. The orbit was oval, and narrow towards the bottom. The <a href="jugal%20bone">jugal bone</a> had two upwards pointing processes, the first of which formed part of the lower margin of the antorbital fenestra, and part of the lower margin of the orbit. A projection from the <a href="quadrate%20bone">quadrate bone</a> into the <a href="lateral%20temporal%20fenestra">lateral temporal fenestra</a> (opening behind the eye) gave this a <a href="reniform">reniform</a> (kidney-shaped) outline. The <a href="foramen%20magnum">foramen magnum</a> (the large opening at the back of the <a href="braincase">braincase</a>) was about half the breadth of the occipital condyle, which was itself <a href="wikt%3Acordiform">cordiform</a> (heart-shaped), and had a short neck and a groove on the side.

The <a href="mandible">mandible</a> was slender and delicate at the front, but the articular region (where it connected with the skull) was massive, and the mandible was deep around the <a href="mandibular%20fenestra">mandibular fenestra</a> (an opening on its side). The mandibular fenestra was small in "Dilophosaurus", compared to that of coelophysoids. The <a href="wikt%3Aretroarticular">retroarticular</a> process of the mandible (a backwards projection) was long, and the <a href="surangular">surangular</a> shelf was strongly horizontal. The <a href="dentary%20bone">dentary bone</a> (the front part of the mandible where most of the teeth there were attached) had an up-curved rather than pointed chin. The chin had a large foramen at the tip, and a row of small foramina ran in rough parallel with the upper edge of the dentary. On the inner side, the <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a> (where the two halves of the lower jaw connected) was flat and smooth, and showed no sign of being fused with its opposite half. A <a href="Meckelian%20foramen">Meckelian foramen</a> ran along the outer side of the dentary.

"Dilophosaurus" had four teeth in each premaxilla, twelve in each maxilla, and seventeen in each dentary. The teeth were generally long, thin, and recurved, with relatively small bases. They were compressed sideways, oval in cross-section at the base, lenticular (lens-shaped) above, and slightly concave on their outer and inner sides. The largest tooth of the maxilla was either in or near the fourth alveolus, and the height of the tooth crowns decreased hind wards. The first tooth of the maxilla pointed slightly forwards from its alveolus because the lower border of the prexamilla process (which projected backwards towards the maxilla) was upturned. The teeth of the dentary were much smaller than those of the maxilla. The third or fourth tooth in the dentary of "Dilophosaurus" and some coelophysoids was the largest there, and seems to have fit into the subnarial gap of the upper jaw. Most of the teeth had serrations on the front and back edges, which were offset by vertical grooves, and were smaller at the front. There were 31 to 41 serrations on the front edges, and 29 to 33 on the back. At least the second and third teeth of the premaxilla had serrations, but the fourth tooth did not. The teeth were covered in a thin layer of <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, thick, which extended far towards their bases. The alveoli were elliptical to almost circular, and all were larger than the bases of the teeth they contained, which may therefore have been loosely held in the jaws. Though the number of alveoli in the dentary would seem to indicate that the teeth were very crowded, they were rather far apart, due to the larger size of their alveoli. The jaws contained <a href="replacement%20teeth">replacement teeth</a> at various stages of eruption. The interdental plates between the teeth were very low.

"Dilophosaurus" had 10 cervical (neck), 14dorsal (back), and 45caudal (tail) vertebrae. It had a long neck, which was probably flexed nearly 90° by the skull and by the shoulder, holding the skull in a horizontal posture. The cervical vertebrae were unusually light; their centra (the "bodies" of the vertebrae) were hollowed out by <a href="wikt%3Apleurocoel">pleurocoels</a> (depressions on the sides) and centrocoels (cavities on the inside). The arches of the cervical vertebrae also had chonoses, conical recesses so large that the bones separating them were sometimes paper-thin. The centra were plano-concave, flat to weakly convex at the front and deeply cupped (or concave) at the back, similar to "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>". This indicates that the neck was flexible, though it had long, overlapping cervical ribs which were fused to the centra. The cervical ribs were slender and may have bent easily. The <a href="atlas%20bone">atlas bone</a> (the first cervical vertebra which attaches to the skull) had a small, cubic centrum, and had a concavity at the front where it formed a cup for the <a href="occipital%20condyle">occipital condyle</a> (protuberance that connects with the atlas vertebra) at the back of the skull. The <a href="axis%20bone">axis bone</a> (the second cervical vertebra) had a heavy spine, and its <a href="postzygapophyses">postzygapophyses</a> (the processes of the vertebrae that articulated with the prezygapophyses of a following vertebrae) were met by long prezygapophyses that curved upwards from the third cervical vertebra. The centra and spines of the cervical vertebrae were long and low, and the spines had caps that gave the appearance of a <a href="Maltese%20cross">Maltese cross</a> (cruciform) when seen from above, a distinctive feature of this dinosaur. The neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae were also low and expanded front and back, which formed strong attachments for <a href="ligaments">ligaments</a>. The <a href="sacral%20vertebrae">sacral vertebrae</a> which occupied the length of the <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> blade did not appear to be fused. The centra of the caudal vertebrae were very consistent in length, but their diameter became smaller towards the back, and they went from elliptical to circular in cross-section.

The <a href="scapulae">scapulae</a> (shoulder blades) were moderate in length and concave on their inner sides to follow the body's curvature. The scapulae were wide, particularly the upper part, which was rectangular (or squared off), a unique feature. The <a href="coracoids">coracoids</a> were elliptical, and not fused to the scapulae. The arms were powerful, and had deep pits and stout processes for attachment of muscles and ligaments. The <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone) was large and slender, with stout epipodials, and the <a href="ulna%20bone">ulna</a> (lower arm bone) was stout and straight, with a stout <a href="olecranon">olecranon</a>. The hands had four fingers: the first was shorter but stronger than the following two fingers, with a large claw, and the two following fingers were longer and slenderer, with smaller claws. The third finger was reduced, and the fourth was <a href="vestigial">vestigial</a> (retained, but without function). The <a href="Iliac%20crest">crest</a> of the ilium was highest over the ilial <a href="Peduncle%20%28anatomy%29">peduncle</a> (the downwards process of the ilium), and its outer side was concave. The foot of the <a href="pubic%20bone">pubic bone</a> was only slightly expanded, whereas the lower end was much more expanded on the <a href="ischium">ischium</a>, which also had a very thin shaft. The hind legs were large, with a slighter longer <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh bone) than <a href="tibia">tibia</a> (lower leg bone), the opposite of, for example, "<a href="Coelophysis">Coelophysis</a>". The femur was massive; its shaft was <a href="Sigmoid%20function">sigmoid</a>-shaped (curved like an S), and its <a href="greater%20trochanter">greater trochanter</a> was centered on the shaft. The tibia had a developed <a href="Tuberosity%20of%20the%20tibia">tuberosity</a> and was expanded at the lower end. The <a href="astragalus%20bone">astragalus bone</a> (ankle bone) was separated from the tibia and the <a href="calcaneum">calcaneum</a>, and formed half of the socket for the fibula. It had long, stout feet with three well-developed toes that bore large claws. The third toe was the stoutest, and the smaller first toe (the <a href="hallux">hallux</a>) was kept off the ground.

In the summer of 1942, the American paleontologist <a href="Charles%20L.%20Camp">Charles L. Camp</a> led a field party from the <a href="University%20of%20California%20Museum%20of%20Paleontology">University of California Museum of Paleontology</a> (UCMP) in search of fossil <a href="vertebrates">vertebrates</a> in <a href="Navajo%20County">Navajo County</a> in <a href="northern%20Arizona">northern Arizona</a>. Word of this was spread among the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> there, and the <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo</a> Jesse Williams brought three members of the expedition to some fossil bones he had discovered in 1940. The area was part of the <a href="Kayenta%20Formation">Kayenta Formation</a>, about north of <a href="Cameron%2C%20Arizona">Cameron</a> near <a href="Tuba%20City">Tuba City</a> in the <a href="Navajo%20Indian%20Reservation">Navajo Indian Reservation</a>. Three dinosaur skeletons were found in purplish <a href="shale">shale</a>, arranged in a triangle, about long at one side. The first was nearly complete, lacking only the front of the skull, parts of the pelvis, and some vertebrae. The second was very eroded, included the front of the skull, lower jaws, some vertebrae, limb bones, and an articulated hand. The third was so eroded that it consisted only of vertebra fragments. The first good skeleton was encased in a block of plaster after ten days of work and loaded onto a truck, the second skeleton was easily collected as it was almost entirely weathered out of the ground, but the third skeleton was almost gone.

The nearly complete first specimen was cleaned and mounted at the UCMP under supervision of the American paleontologist <a href="Wann%20Langston%20Jr.">Wann Langston Jr.</a>, a process that took three men two years. The skeleton was wall-mounted in <a href="bas%20relief">bas relief</a>, with the tail curved upwards, the neck straightened, and the left leg moved up for visibility, but the rest of the skeleton was kept in its burial position. As the skull was crushed, it was reconstructed based on the back of the skull of the first specimen and the front of the second. The pelvis was reconstructed after that of "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", and the feet were also reconstructed. At the time, it was one of the best-preserved skeletons of a theropod dinosaur, though incomplete. In 1954 the American paleontologist <a href="Samuel%20P.%20Welles">Samuel P. Welles</a>, who was part of the group that excavated the skeletons, preliminarily described and named this dinosaur as a new species in the existing genus "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>", "M.wetherilli". The nearly complete specimen (catalogued as UCMP37302) became the holotype, and the second specimen (UCMP37303) was included in the hypodigm (the sample of specimens that defines a <a href="taxon">taxon</a>) of the species. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> honored John Wetherill, a Navajo councilor whom Welles described as an "explorer, friend of scientists, and trusted trader". It was Wetherill's nephew, Milton, who had first informed the expedition of the fossils. Welles placed the new species in "Megalosaurus" due to the similar limb proportions of it and "M.bucklandii", and because he did not find great differences between them. At the time, "Megalosaurus" was used as a "<a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxon</a>", wherein many species of theropod were placed, regardless of their age or locality.

Welles returned to Tuba City in 1964 to determine the age of the Kayenta Formation (it had been suggested to be <a href="Late%20Triassic">Late Triassic</a> in age, whereas Welles thought it was <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Early</a> to <a href="Middle%20Jurassic">Middle Jurassic</a>), and discovered another skeleton about south of where the 1942 specimens had been found. The nearly complete specimen (catalogued as UCMP77270) was collected with the help of William Breed of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Northern%20Arizona">Museum of Northern Arizona</a> and others. During preparation of this specimen, it became clear that it was a larger individual of "M.wetherilli", and that it would have had two crests on the top of its skull. Being a thin plate of bone, one crest was originally thought to be part of the missing left side of the skull which had been pulled out of its position by a scavenger. When it became apparent that it was a crest, it was also realized that there would have been a corresponding crest on the left side, since the right crest was right of the midline, and was concave along its middle length. This discovery led to reexamination of the holotype specimen, which was found to have bases of two thin, upwards extended bones, which were crushed together. These also represented crests, but it had formerly been assumed they were part of a misplaced cheek bone. It was also concluded that the two 1942 specimens were <a href="juvenile%20%28organism%29">juveniles</a>, while the 1964 specimen was an adult, about one third larger than the others. Welles later recalled that he thought the crests were as unexpected as finding "wings on a worm".
Welles and an assistant subsequently corrected the wall mount of the holotype specimen based on the new skeleton, by restoring the crests, redoing the pelvis, making the neck ribs longer, and placing them closer together. After studying the skeletons of North American and European theropods, Welles realized that the dinosaur did not belong to "Megalosaurus", and needed a new genus name. At this time, no other theropods with large longitudal crests on their heads were known, and the dinosaur had therefore gained the interest of paleontologists. A mold of the holotype specimen was made, and fiberglass casts of it were distributed to various exhibits; to make labeling these casts easier, Welles decided to name the new genus in a brief note, rather than wait until the publication of a detailed description. In 1970 Welles coined the new genus name "Dilophosaurus", from the Greek words di (δι) meaning "two", lophos (λόφος) meaning "crest", and sauros (σαυρος) meaning "lizard"; "two-crested lizard". Welles published a detailed <a href="osteological">osteological</a> description of "Dilophosaurus" in 1984, but the 1964 specimen has not yet been properly described. "Dilophosaurus" was the first well-known theropod from the Early Jurassic, and remains one of the best-preserved examples of that age.

In 2001 the American paleontologist <a href="Robert%20J.%20Gay">Robert J. Gay</a> identified the remains of at least three new "Dilophosaurus" specimens (this number is based on the presence of three pubic bone fragments and two differentially sized femora) in the collections of the Museum of Northern Arizona. The specimens were found in 1978 in the Rock Head Quadrangle, away from where the original specimens were found, and had been labeled as a "large theropod". Though most of the material is damaged, it is significant in including elements not preserved in the earlier specimens, including part of the pelvis and several ribs. Some elements in the collection belonged to an infant specimen (MNAP1.3181), the youngest known example of this genus, and one of the earliest known infant theropods from North America, only preceded by some "Coelophysis" specimens. The juvenile specimen includes a partial humerus, a partial fibula, and a tooth fragment. In 2005 the American paleontologist Ronald S. Tykoski assigned a specimen (TMM43646-140) from Gold Spring, Arizona, to "Dilophosaurus", but in 2012 the American paleontologist Matthew T. Carrano and colleagues found it to differ in some details.

In 1984 Welles suggested that the 1964 specimen (UCMP77270) did not belong to "Dilophosaurus", but to a new genus, based on differences in the skull, vertebrae, and femora. He maintained that both genera bore crests, but that the exact shape of these was unknown in "Dilophosaurus". Welles died in 1997, before he could name this supposed new dinosaur, but the idea that the two were separate genera has generally been ignored or forgotten since. In 1999 the American amateur paleontologist Stephan Pickering privately published the new name "Dilophosaurus" "breedorum" based on the 1964 specimen, named in honor of Breed, who had assisted in collecting it. This name is considered a <a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>, an invalidly published name, and Gay pointed out in 2005 that there are no significant differences between "D". "breedorum" and other "D.wetherilli" specimens. Carrano and colleagues found differences between the 1964 specimen and the holotype specimen, but attributed them to variation between individuals rather than species.

A nearly complete theropod skeleton (KMV8701) was discovered in the <a href="Lufeng%20Formation">Lufeng Formation</a>, in <a href="Yunnan%20Province">Yunnan Province</a>, China, in 1987. It is similar to "Dilophosaurus", with a pair of crests and a gap separating the premaxilla from the maxilla, but differs in some details. The Chinese paleontologist Shaojin Hu named it as a new species of "Dilophosaurus" in 1993, "D.sinensis" (from Greek "Sinai", referring to China). In 1998 the American paleontologist Matthew C. Lamanna and colleagues found "D.sinensis" to be identical to "<a href="Sinosaurus%20triassicus">Sinosaurus triassicus</a>", a theropod from the same formation, named in 1940. This conclusion was confirmed by the Chinese paleontologist Lida Xing and colleagues in 2013, and though the Chinese paleontologist Guo-Fu Wang and colleagues agreed the species belonged in "Sinosaurus" in 2017, they suggested it may be a separate species, "S.sinensis".

Various <a href="ichnotaxa">ichnotaxa</a> (taxa based on <a href="trace%20fossils">trace fossils</a>) have been attributed to "Dilophosaurus" or similar theropods. In 1971 Welles reported dinosaur footprints from the Kayenta Formation of northern Arizona, on two levels and below where the original "Dilophosaurus" specimens were found. The lower footprints were <a href="tridactyl">tridactyl</a> (three-toed), and could have been made by "Dilophosaurus"; Welles created the new ichnogenus and species "Dilophosauripus williamsi" based on them, in honor of Williams, the discoverer of the first "Dilophosaurus" skeletons. The type specimen is a cast of a large footprint catalogued as UCMP79690-4, with casts of three other prints included in the hypodigm. In 1984 Welles conceded that there was no way to prove or disprove that the footprints belonged to "Dilophosaurus". In 1996 the American paleontologists Michael Morales and Scott Bulkey reported a trackway of the ichnogenus "<a href="Eubrontes">Eubrontes</a>" from the Kayenta Formation made by a very large theropod. They noted it could have been made by a very large "Dilophosaurus" individual, but found that unlikely, as they estimated the trackmaker would have been tall at the hips, compared to the of "Dilophosaurus".

The Polish paleontologist Gerard Gierliński examined tridactyl footprints from the <a href="Holy%20Cross%20Mountains">Holy Cross Mountains</a> in <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and concluded in 1991 that they belonged to a theropod like "Dilophosaurus". He named the new ichnospecies "<a href="Grallator">Grallator</a>" ("Eubrontes") "soltykovensis" based on them, with a cast of footprint MGIW1560.11.12 as the holotype. In 1994 Gierliński also assigned footprints from the <a href="H%C3%B6gan%C3%A4s%20Formation">Höganäs Formation</a> in Sweden discovered in 1974 to "G.(E.) soltykovensis". In 1996, Gierliński attributed track AC1/7 from the <a href="Turners%20Falls%20Formation">Turners Falls Formation</a> of Massachusetts, a resting trace he believed to show feather impressions, to a theropod similar to "Dilophosaurus" and "Liliensternus", and assigned it to the ichnotaxon "Grallator minisculus". The Czech paleontologist Martin Kundrát agreed that the track showed feather impressions in 2004, but this interpretation was disputed by the American paleontologists Martin Lockley and colleagues in 2003 and Anthony J. Martin and colleagues in 2004, who considered them as sedimentological artifacts. Martin and colleagues also reassigned the track to the ichnotaxon "<a href="Fulicopus">Fulicopus</a> lyellii".

The American paleontologist Robert E. Weems proposed in 2003 that "Eubrontes" tracks were not produced by a theropod but by a <a href="sauropodomorph">sauropodomorph</a> similar to "<a href="Plateosaurus">Plateosaurus</a>", excluding "Dilophosaurus" as a possible trackmaker. Instead, Weems proposed "<a href="Kayentapus%20hopii">Kayentapus hopii</a>", another ichnotaxon named by Welles in 1971, as the best match for "Dilophosaurus". The attribution to "Dilophosaurus" was primarily based on the wide angle between digit impressions three and four shown by these tracks, and the observation that the foot of the holotype specimen shows a similarly splayed-out fourth digit. Also in 2003, the American paleontologist Emma Rainforth argued that the splay in the holotype foot was merely the result of distortion, and that "Eubrontes" would indeed be a good match for "Dilophosaurus". The American paleontologist <a href="Spencer%20G.%20Lucas">Spencer G. Lucas</a> and colleagues stated in 2006 that there was virtually uiversal agreement that "Eubrontes" tracks were made by a theropod like "Dilophosaurus", and that they and other researchers dismissed Weems claims.

In 2006, Weems defended his 2003 assessment of "Eubrontes", and proposed an animal like "Dilophosaurus" as possible trackmaker of numerous "Kayentapus" trackways of the Culpeper Quarry in Virginia. Weems suggested rounded impressions associated with some of these trackways to represent hand impressions lacking digit traces, which he interpreted as a trace of quadrupedal movement. In 2009 the American paleontologists Andrew R.C. Milner and colleagues used the <a href="new%20combination">new combination</a> "Kayentapus soltykovensis", and suggested that "Dilophosauripus" may not be distinct from "Eubrontes" and "Kayentapus". They suggested that the long claw marks that were used to distinguish "Dilophosauripus" may be an artifact of dragging. They found that "Gigandipus" and "Anchisauripus" tracks may likewise also just represent variations of "Eubrontes". They pointed out that differences between ichnotaxa may reflect how the track-maker interacted with the substrate rather than taxonomy. They also found "Dilophosaurus" a suitable match for a "Eubrontes" <a href="trackway">trackway</a> and resting trace (SGDS.18.T1) from the <a href="St.%20George%20Dinosaur%20Discovery%20Site">St.George Dinosaur Discovery Site</a> in the <a href="Moenave%20Formation">Moenave Formation</a> of Utah, though the dinosaur itself is not known from the formation, which is slightly older than the Kayenta Formation. Weems stated in 2019 that "Eubrontes" tracks do not reflect the gracile feet of "Dilophosaurus", and argued they were instead made by the bipedal sauropodopormph "<a href="Anchisaurus">Anchisaurus</a>".

Welles thought "Dilophosaurus" a <a href="megalosaur">megalosaur</a> in 1954, but revised his opinion in 1970 after discovering that it had crests. By 1974, Welles and the American paleontologist Robert A. Long found "Dilophosaurus" to be a <a href="ceratosauroid">ceratosauroid</a>. In 1984 Welles found that "Dilophosaurus" exhibited features of both <a href="coelurosauria">coelurosauria</a> and <a href="carnosauria">carnosauria</a>, the two main groups into which theropods had hitherto been divided, based on body size, and he suggested this division was inaccurate. He found "Dilophosaurus" to be closest to those theropods that were usually placed in the family <a href="Halticosauridae">Halticosauridae</a>, particularly "Liliensternus".

In 1988 the American paleontologist <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> classified the halticosaurs as a subfamily of the family <a href="Coelophysidae">Coelophysidae</a>, and suggested that "Dilophosaurus" could have been a direct descendant of "Coelophysis". Paul also considered the possibility that <a href="spinosaurs">spinosaurs</a> were late surviving dilophosaurs, based on similarity of the kinked snout, nostril position, and slender teeth of "<a href="Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a>". In 1994 the American paleontologist <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz">Thomas R. Holtz</a> placed "Dilophosaurus" in the group Coelophysoidea, along with but separate from Coelophysidae. He placed Coelophysoidea itself in the group Ceratosauria. In 2000 the American paleontologist James H. Madsen and Welles divided Ceratosauria into the families <a href="Ceratosauridae">Ceratosauridae</a> and <a href="Dilophosauridae">Dilophosauridae</a>, with "Dilophosaurus" as the sole member of the latter family.

Lamanna and colleagues pointed out in 1998 that since "Dilophosaurus" was discovered to have had crests on its skull, other similarly crested theropods have been discovered (including "Sinosaurus"), and that this feature is therefore not unique to the genus, and of limited use for determining interrelationships within their group. The Australian paleontologist Adam M. Yates described the new genus "<a href="Dracovenator">Dracovenator</a>" from South Africa in 2005, and found it closely related to "Dilophosaurus" and "<a href="Zupaysaurus">Zupaysaurus</a>". His <a href="cladistic%20analysis">cladistic analysis</a> suggested they did not belong in Coelophysoidea, but rather in <a href="Neotheropoda">Neotheropoda</a>, a more <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> (or "advanced") group. He proposed that if "Dilophosaurus" was more derived than Coelophysoidea, the features it shared with this group may have been inherited from <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (or "primitive") theropods, indicating that theropods may have passed through a "coelophysoid stage" in their early evolution.

In 2007 the American paleontologist Nathan D. Smith and colleagues found the crested theropod "<a href="Cryolophosaurus">Cryolophosaurus</a>" to be the <a href="sister%20species">sister species</a> of "Dilophosaurus", and grouped them with "Dracovenator" and "Sinosaurus". This clade was more derived than Coelophysoidea, but more basal than Ceratosauria, thereby placing basal theropods in a ladder-like arrangement. In 2012 Carrano and colleagues found that the group of crested theropods proposed by Smith and colleagues was based on features that relate to the presence of such crests, but that the features of the rest of the skeleton were less consistent. They instead found that "Dilophosaurus" was a coelophysoid, with "Cryolophosaurus" and "Sinosaurus" being more derived, as basal members of the group <a href="Tetanurae">Tetanurae</a>.

The Belgian paleontologist Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues defined Dilophosauridae to include "Dilophosaurus" and "Dracovenator" in 2015, and noted that while there is general uncertainty about the placement of this group, it appears to be slightly more derived than Coelophysoidea, and the sister group to <a href="Averostra">Averostra</a>. Dilophosauridae shares features with Coelophysoidea such as the subnarial gap and the front teeth of the maxilla pointing forwards, while features shared with Averostra include a fenestra at the front of the maxilla and a reduced number of teeth in the maxilla. They suggested that the cranial crests of "Cryolophosaurus" and "Sinosaurus" had either <a href="evolved%20convergently">evolved convergently</a>, or were a feature inherited from a common ancestor. The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> is based on that published by Hendrickx and colleagues, itself based on earlier studies:

Welles envisioned "Dilophosaurus" as an active, clearly bipedal animal, similar to an enlarged <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>. He found the forelimbs to have been powerful weapons, strong and flexible, and not used for locomotion. He noted that the hands were capable of grasping and slashing, of meeting each other, and reaching two thirds up the neck. He proposed that in a sitting posture, the animal would rest on the large "foot" of its ischium, as well as its tail and feet. In 1990 the American paleontologists Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas suggested that the weak pelvis of "Dilophosaurus" could have been an adaptation for an aquatic life-style, where the water would help support its weight, and that it could have been an efficient swimmer. They found it doubtful that it would have been restricted to a watery environment, though, due to the strength and proportions of its hind-limbs, which would have made it fleet-footed and agile during bipedal locomotion.

In 2005 the American paleontologists Phil Senter and James H. Robins examined the range of motion in the forelimbs of "Dilophosaurus" and other theropods. They found that "Dilophosaurus" would have been able to draw its humerus backwards until it was almost parallel with the scapula, but could not move it forwards to a more than vertical orientation. The elbow could approach full extension and flexion at a right angle, but not achieve it completely. The fingers do not appear to have been voluntarily hyperextensible (able to extend backwards, beyond their normal range), but they may have been passively hyperextensible, to resist dislocation during violent movements by captured prey. A 2015 article by Senter and Robins gave recommendations for how to reconstruct the forelimb posture in bipedal dinosaurs, based on examination of various taxa, including "Dilophosaurus". The scapulae were held very horizontally, the resting orientation of the elbow would have been close to a right angle, and the orientation of the hand would not have deviated much from that of the lower arm.

The "Dilophosauripus" footprints reported by Welles in 1971 were all on the same level, and were described as a "chicken yard hodge-podge" of footprints, with few forming a trackway. The footprints had been imprinted in mud, which allowed the feet to sink down . The prints were sloppy, and the varying breadth of the toe prints indicates that mud had clung to the feet. The impressions varied according to differences in the substrate and the manner in which they were made; sometimes the foot was planted directly, but there was often a backwards or forwards slip as the foot came down. The positions and angles of the toes also varied considerably, which indicates they must have been quite flexible. The "Dilophosauripus" footprints had an offset second toe with a thick base, and very long, straight claws that were in line with the axes of the toe-pads. One of the footprints was missing the claw of the second toe, perhaps due to injury. In 1984 Welles interpreted the fact that three individuals were found closely together, and the presence of criss-crossed trackways nearby, as indications that "Dilophosaurus" traveled in groups. Gay agreed that they may have traveled in small groups, but noted that there was no direct evidence for this, and that <a href="flash%20floods">flash floods</a> could have picked up scattered bones from different individuals and deposited them together.

Milner and colleagues examined the Utah trackway SGDS.18.T1 in 2009, which consists of typical footprints with tail drags and a more unusual resting trace, deposited in <a href="lacustrine">lacustrine</a> beach <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>. The trackway began with the animal first oriented approximately in parallel with the shoreline, and then stopping by a <a href="berm">berm</a> with both feet in parallel, whereafter it lowered its body, and brought its <a href="metatarsals">metatarsals</a> and the <a href="callosity">callosity</a> around its ischium to the ground; this created impressions of symmetrical "heels" and circular impressions of the ischium. The part of the tail closest to the body was kept off the ground, whereas the end further away from the body made contact with the ground. The fact that the animal rested on a slope is what enabled it to bring both hands to the ground close to the feet. After resting, the dinosaur shuffled forwards, and left new impressions with its feet, metatarsals, and ischium, but not the hands. The right foot now stepped on the print of the right hand, and the second claw of the left foot made a drag mark from the first resting position to the next. After some time, the animal stood up and moved forwards, with the left foot first, and once fully erect, it walked across the rest of the exposed surface, while leaving thin drag marks with the end of the tail.

Crouching is a rarely captured behavior of theropods, and SGDS.18.T1 is the only such track with unambiguous impressions of theropod hands, which provides valuable information about how they used their forelimbs. The crouching posture was found to be very similar to that of modern birds, and shows that early theropods held the palms of their hands facing medially, towards each other. As such a posture therefore evolved early in the lineage, it may have characterized all theropods. Theropods are often depicted with their palms facing downwards, but studies of their functional anatomy have shown that they, like birds, were unable to <a href="pronate">pronate</a> or <a href="supinate">supinate</a> their arms (crossing the <a href="radius%20bone">radius</a> and ulna bones of the lower arm to turn the hand). The track showed that the legs were held symmetrically with the body weight distributed between the feet and the metatarsals, which is also a feature seen in birds such as <a href="ratites">ratites</a>. Milner and colleagues also dismissed the idea that the "Kayentapus minor" track reported by Weems showed a palm imprint made by a quadrupedally walking theropod. Weems had proposed the trackmaker would have been able to move quadrupedally when walking slowly, while the digits would have been habitually hyperextended so only the palms touched the ground. Milner and colleagues found the inferred pose unnecessary, and suggested the track was instead made in a similar way as SGDS.18.T1, but without leaving traces of the digits.

Welles found that "Dilophosaurus" did not have a powerful bite, due to weakness caused by the subnarial gap. He thought that it used its front premaxillary teeth for plucking and tearing rather than biting, and the maxillary teeth further back for piercing and slicing. He thought that it was probably a scavenger rather than a predator, and that if it did kill large animals, it would have done so with its hands and feet rather than its jaws. Welles did not find evidence of <a href="cranial%20kinesis">cranial kinesis</a> in the skull of "Dilophosaurus", a feature which allows individual bones of the skull to move in relation to each other.

In 1986 the American paleontologist <a href="Robert%20T.%20Bakker">Robert T. Bakker</a> instead found "Dilophosaurus", with its massive neck and skull and large upper teeth, to have been adapted for killing large prey, and strong enough to attack any Early Jurassic herbivores. In 1988 Paul dismissed the idea that "Dilophosaurus" was a scavenger, and claimed that strictly scavenging terrestrial animals are a myth. He stated that the snout of "Dilophosaurus" was better braced than had been thought previously, and that the very large, slender maxillary teeth were more lethal than the claws. Paul suggested that it hunted large animals such as <a href="prosauropods">prosauropods</a>, and that it was more capable of snapping small animals than other theropods of a similar size. Paul also depicted "Dilophosaurus" bouncing on its tail while lashing out at an enemy, similar to a <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>.

A 2005 <a href="Euler%E2%80%93Bernoulli%20beam%20theory">beam-theory</a> study by the Canadian palaeontologist François Therrien and colleagues found that the <a href="bite%20force">bite force</a> in the mandible of "Dilophosaurus" decreased rapidly hind wards in the tooth-throw. This indicates that the front of the mandible, with its upturned chin, "<a href="Rosette%20%28design%29">rosette</a>" of teeth, and strengthened symphysal region (similar to spinosaurids), was used to capture and manipulate prey, probably of relatively smaller size. The properties of its mandibular symphysis was similar to those of <a href="felids">felids</a> and crocodilians that use the front of their jaws to deliver a powerful bite when subduing prey. The loads exerted on the mandibles were consistent with struggle of small prey, which may have been hunted by delivering slashing bites to wound it, and then captured with the front of the jaws after being too weakened to resist. The prey may then have been moved further back into the jaws, where the largest teeth were located, and killed by slicing bites (similar to some crocodilians) with the sideways compressed teeth. The authors suggested that if "Dilophosaurus" indeed fed on small prey, possible hunting packs would have been of limited size.

Milner and <a href="James%20I.%20Kirkland">James I. Kirkland</a> suggested in 2007 that "Dilophosaurus" had features that indicate it may have eaten fish. They pointed out that the ends of the jaws were expanded to the sides, forming a "rosette" of interlocking teeth, similar to those of spinosaurids, known to have eaten fish, and <a href="gharials">gharials</a>, which is the modern <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a> that eats the most fish. The nasal openings were also retracted back on the jaws, similar to spinosaurids, which have even more retracted nasal openings, and this may have limited water splashing into the nostrils during fishing. Both groups also had long arms with well-developed claws, which could help when catching fish. Lake Dixie, a large lake which extended from Utah to Arizona and Nevada, would have provided abundant fish in the "post-cataclysmic", biologically more impoverished world that followed the <a href="Triassic%E2%80%93Jurassic%20extinction%20event">Triassic–Jurassic extinction event</a>.

Welles conceded that suggestions as to the function of the crests of "Dilophosaurus" were conjectural, but thought that, though the crests had no grooves to indicate vascularization, they could have been used for <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>. He also suggested they could have been used for <a href="species%20recognition">species recognition</a> or <a href="biological%20ornament">ornamentation</a>. The Czerkas pointed out that the crests could not have been used during battle, as their delicate structure would have been easily damaged. They suggested that they were a <a href="visual%20display">visual display</a> for attracting a mate, and even thermoregulation. In 1990, the American paleontologist Walter P. Coombs stated that the crests may have been enhanced by colors for use in display.

In 2011 the American paleontologists <a href="Kevin%20Padian">Kevin Padian</a> and <a href="John%20R.%20Horner">John R. Horner</a> proposed that "bizarre structures" in dinosaurs in general (including crests, frills, horns, and domes) were primarily used for species recognition, and dismissed other explanations as unsupported by evidence. They noted that too few specimens of cranially ornamented theropods, including "Dilophosaurus", were known to test their evolutionary function statistically, and whether they represented <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> or <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a>.

In a response to Padian and Horner the same year, the American paleontologists Rob J. Knell and <a href="Scott%20D.%20Sampson">Scott D. Sampson</a> argued that species recognition was not unlikely as a secondary function for "bizarre structures" in dinosaurs, but that <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> (used in display or combat to compete for mates) was a more likely explanation, due to the high cost of developing them, and because such structures appear to be highly variable within species. In 2013 the British paleontologists David E. Hone and <a href="Darren%20Naish">Darren Naish</a> criticized the "species recognition hypothesis", and argued that no extant animals use such structures primarily for species recognition, and that Padian and Horner had ignored the possibility of mutual sexual selection (where both sexes are ornamented).

Welles originally interpreted the smaller "Dilophosaurus" specimens as juveniles, and the larger specimen as an adult, later interpreting them as different species. Paul suggested that the differences between the specimens was perhaps due to sexual dimorphism, as was seemingly also apparent in "Coelophysis", which had "robust" and "gracile" forms of the same size, that might otherwise have been regarded as separate species. Following this scheme, the smaller "Dilophosaurus" specimen would represent a "gracile" example.

In 2005 Tykoski found that most "Dilophosaurus" specimens known were juvenile individuals, with only the largest an adult, based on the level of <a href="coossification">coossification</a> (fusion during bone tissue formation) of the bones. In 2005 Gay found no evidence of the sexual dimorphism suggested by Paul (but supposedly present in "Coelophysis"), and attributed the variation seen between "Dilophosaurus" specimens to individual variation and <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a> (changes during growth). There was no dimorphism in the skeletons, but he did not rule out that there could have been in the crests; more data was needed to determine this. Based on the tiny nasal crests on a juvenile specimen, Yates had tentatively assigned to the related genus "Dracovenator", he suggested that these would have grown larger as the animal became adult.

The American paleontologist Joe S. Tkach reported a <a href="histological">histological</a> study (microscopical study of internal features) of "Dilophosaurus" in 1996, conducted by taking <a href="thin-sections">thin-sections</a> of long bones and ribs of specimen UCMP37303 (the lesser preserved of the two original skeletons). The bone tissues were well vascularized and had a fibro-lamellar structure similar to that found in other theropods and the sauropodomorph "<a href="Massospondylus">Massospondylus</a>". The plexiform (woven) structure of the bones suggested rapid growth, and "Dilophosaurus" may have attained a growth rate of per year early in life.

Welles found that the replacement teeth of "Dilophosaurus" and other theropods originated deep inside the bone, decreasing in size the farther they were from the alveolar border. There were usually two or three replacement teeth in the alveoli, with the youngest being a small, hollow <a href="tooth%20crown">crown</a>. The replacement teeth erupted on the outer side of the old teeth. When a tooth neared the <a href="gum%20line">gum line</a>, the inner wall between the interdental plates was resorbed and formed a nutrient notch. As the new tooth erupted, it moved outwards to center itself in the alveolus, and the nutrient notch closed over.

Welles noted various <a href="Theropod%20paleopathology">paleopathologies</a> (ancient signs of disease, such as injuries and malformations) in "Dilophosaurus". The holotype had a <a href="Sulcus%20%28morphology%29">sulcus</a> (groove or furrow) on the neural arch of a cervical vertebra that may have been due to an injury or crushing, and two pits on the right humerus that may have been <a href="abscesses">abscesses</a> (collections of <a href="pus">pus</a>) or artifacts. Welles also noted that it had a smaller and more delicate left humerus than the right, but with the reverse condition in its forearms. In 2001 the Australian paleontologist <a href="Ralph%20Molnar">Ralph Molnar</a> suggested that this was caused by a developmental anomaly called <a href="fluctuating%20asymmetry">fluctuating asymmetry</a>. This anomaly can be caused by stress in animal populations, for example due to disturbances in their environment, and may indicate more intense <a href="selective%20pressure">selective pressure</a>. Asymmetry can also result from traumatic events in early development of an animal, which would be more randomly distributed in time. A 2001 study conducted by the American paleontologist Bruce Rothschild and colleagues examined 60 "Dilophosaurus" foot bones for signs of <a href="stress%20fracture">stress fracture</a>s (which are caused by strenuous, repetitive actions), but none were found. Such injuries can be the result of very active, predatory lifestyles.

In 2016 Senter and Sara L. Juengst examined the paleopathologies of the holotype specimen and found that it bore the greatest and most varied number of such maladies on the pectoral girdle and forelimb of any theropod dinosaur so far described, some of which are not known from any other dinosaur. Only six other theropods are known with more than one paleopathology on the pectoral girdle and forelimbs. The holotype specimen had eight afflicted bones, whereas no other theropod specimen is known with more than four. On its left side it had a fractured scapula and radius, and fibriscesses (like abscesses) in the ulna and the outer <a href="phalanx%20bone">phalanx bone</a> of the thumb. On the right side it had torsion of its humeral shaft, three <a href="bony%20tumors">bony tumors</a> on its radius, a truncated articular surface of its third <a href="metacarpal%20bone">metacarpal bone</a>, and deformities on the first phalanx bone of the third finger. This finger was permanently deformed and unable to flex. The deformities of the humerus and the third finger may have been due to <a href="osteodysplasia">osteodysplasia</a>, which had not been reported from non-avian dinosaurs before, but is known in birds. Affecting juvenile birds that have experienced malnutrition, this disease can cause pain in one limb, which makes the birds prefer to use the other limb instead, which thereby develops torsion.

The number of traumatic events that led to these features is not certain, and it is possible that they were all caused by a single encounter, for example by crashing into a tree or rock during a fight with another animal, which may have caused puncture wounds with its claws. Since all the injuries had healed, it is certain that the "Dilophosaurus" survived for a long time after these events, for months, perhaps years. The use of the forelimbs for prey capture must have been compromised during the healing process. The dinosaur may therefore have endured a long period of fasting or subsisted on prey that was small enough for it to dispatch with the mouth and feet, or with one forelimb. According to Senter and Juengst, the high degree of pain the dinosaur might have experienced in multiple locations for long durations also shows that it was a hardy animal. They noted that paleopathologies in dinosaurs are underreported, and that even though Welles had thoroughly described the holotype, he had mentioned only one of the pathologies found by them. They suggested that such features may sometimes be omitted because descriptions of species are concerned with their characteristics rather than abnormalities, or because such features are difficult to recognize.

"Dilophosaurus" is known from the Kayenta Formation, which dates to the <a href="Sinemurian">Sinemurian</a> and <a href="Pliensbachian">Pliensbachian</a> stages of the Early Jurassic, approximately 196–183 million years ago. The Kayenta Formation is part of the <a href="Glen%20Canyon%20Group">Glen Canyon Group</a> that includes formations in northern Arizona, parts of southeastern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. It is composed mostly of two <a href="facies">facies</a>, one dominated by <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a> deposition and the other by sandstone. The siltstone facies is found in much of Arizona, while the sandstone facies is present in areas of northern Arizona, southern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. The formation was primarily deposited by rivers, with the siltstone facies as the slower, more sluggish part of the river system. Kayenta Formation deposition was ended by the encroaching dune field that would become the <a href="Navajo%20Sandstone">Navajo Sandstone</a>. A definitive <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a> of this formation has not yet been made, and the available stratigraphic correlation has been based on a combination of radiometric dates from vertebrate fossils, <a href="magnetostratigraphy">magnetostratigraphy</a>, and pollen evidence.

The Kayenta Formation has yielded a small but growing assemblage of organisms. Most fossils are from the siltstone facies. Most organisms known so far are vertebrates. Non-vertebrates include microbial or "algal" limestone, <a href="petrified%20wood">petrified wood</a>, plant impressions, freshwater bivalves and snails, <a href="ostracod">ostracod</a>s, and invertebrate <a href="trace%20fossil">trace fossil</a>s. Vertebrates are known from both body fossils and trace fossils. Vertebrates known from body fossils include <a href="hybodontidae">hybodont</a> sharks, indeterminate <a href="osteichthyes">bony fish</a>, <a href="lungfish">lungfish</a>, salamanders, the frog "<a href="Prosalirus">Prosalirus</a>", the <a href="caecilia">caecilia</a>n "<a href="Eocaecilia">Eocaecilia</a>", the turtle "<a href="Kayentachelys">Kayentachelys</a>", a <a href="sphenodontia">sphenodontia</a>n reptile, lizards, and several early <a href="crocodylomorpha">crocodylomorphs</a> including "<a href="Calsoyasuchus">Calsoyasuchus</a>", "<a href="Eopneumatosuchus">Eopneumatosuchus</a>", "<a href="Kayentasuchus">Kayentasuchus</a>", and "<a href="Protosuchus">Protosuchus</a>", and the <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> "<a href="Rhamphinion">Rhamphinion</a>". Apart from "Dilophosaurus", several dinosaurs are known, including the theropods "<a href="Coelophysis%20kayentakatae">Megapnosaurus</a>" (a species in need of a new genus name that may also have had crests), and "<a href="Kayentavenator">Kayentavenator</a>", the sauropodomorph "<a href="Sarahsaurus">Sarahsaurus</a>", a <a href="heterodontosauridae">heterodontosaurid</a>, and the armored dinosaurs "<a href="Scelidosaurus">Scelidosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Scutellosaurus">Scutellosaurus</a>". <a href="synapsida">Synapsids</a> include the <a href="tritylodontidae">tritylodontids</a> "<a href="Dinnebitodon">Dinnebitodon</a>", "<a href="Kayentatherium">Kayentatherium</a>", and "<a href="Oligokyphus">Oligokyphus</a>", <a href="morganucodonta">morganucodontids</a>, the possible early true mammal "<a href="Dinnetherium">Dinnetherium</a>", and a <a href="haramiyida">haramiyid</a> mammal. The majority of these finds come from the vicinity of Gold Spring, Arizona. Vertebrate trace fossils include <a href="coprolite">coprolite</a>s and the tracks of <a href="therapsid">therapsid</a>s, lizard-like animals, and several types of dinosaur.

Welles outlined the <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> of the original specimens, changes that happened during their decay and fossilization. The holotype skeleton was found lying on its right side, and its head and neck were recurvedcurved backwardsin the "<a href="death%20pose">death pose</a>" in which dinosaur skeletons are often found. This pose was thought to be <a href="opisthotonus">opisthotonus</a> (due to death-spasms) at the time, but may instead have been the result of how a carcass was embedded in <a href="sediments">sediments</a>. The back was straight, and the hindmost dorsal vertebrae were turned on their left sides. The caudal vertebrae extended irregularly from the pelvis, and the legs were articulated, with little displacement. Welles concluded that the specimens were buried at the place of their deaths, without having been transported much, but that the holotype specimen appears to have been disturbed by scavengers, indicated by the rotated dorsal vertebrae and crushed skull. Gay noted that the specimens he described in 2001 showed evidence of having been transported by a stream. As none of the specimens were complete, they may have been transported over some distance, or have lain on the surface and weathered for some time before transport. They may have been transported by a <a href="flood">flood</a>, as indicated by the variety of animals found as fragments and bone breakage.

"Dilophosaurus" was <a href="List%20of%20cloned%20animals%20in%20Jurassic%20Park">featured</a> in the 1990 novel "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28novel%29">Jurassic Park</a>", by the American writer <a href="Michael%20Crichton">Michael Crichton</a>, and its 1993 <a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">movie adaptation</a> by the American director <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>. The "Dilophosaurus" of "Jurassic Park" was acknowledged as the "only serious departure from scientific veracity" in the movie's <a href="making-of">making-of</a> book, and as the "most fictionalized" of the movie's dinosaurs in a book about <a href="Stan%20Winston%20Studios">Stan Winston Studios</a>, which created the <a href="animatronics">animatronics</a> effects. For the novel, Crichton invented the dinosaur's ability to spit venom (explaining how it was able to kill prey, in spite of its seemingly weak jaws). The art department added another feature, a cowl folded against its neck that expanded and vibrated as the animal prepared to attack, similar to that of the <a href="Chlamydosaurus">frill-necked lizard</a>. To avoid confusion with the "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a>" as featured in the movie, "Dilophosaurus" is presented as only tall, instead of its assumed true height of about . Nicknamed "the spitter", the "Dilophosaurus" of the movie was realized through puppeteering, and required a full body with three interchangeable heads to produce the actions required by the script. Separate legs were also constructed for a shot where the dinosaur hops by. Unlike most of the other dinosaurs in the movie, no <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> was employed when showing the "Dilophosaurus".

The American geologist J. Bret Bennington noted that though "Dilophosaurus" probably did not have a frill and could not spit venom like in the movie, its bite could have been venomous, as has been claimed for the <a href="Komodo%20dragon">Komodo dragon</a>. He found that adding venom to the dinosaur was no less allowable than giving a color to its skin, which is also unknown. If the dinosaur had a frill, there would have been evidence for this in the bones, in the shape of a rigid structure to hold up the frill, or markings at the places where the muscles used to move it were attached. He also added that if it did have a frill, it would not have used it to intimidate its meal, but rather a competitor (it may have responded to a character in the movie pulling a hood over his head). Welles himself was "thrilled" to see "Dilophosaurus" in "Jurassic Park", and he noted the inaccuracies but found them minor points and enjoyed the movie, and was happy to find the dinosaur "an internationally known actor".

In 2017 "Dilophosaurus" was designated as the <a href="state%20dinosaur">state dinosaur</a> of the US state of <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, to become official with the new state budget in 2019. "Dilophosaurus" was chosen because tracks thought to be made by a related dinosaur were discovered in <a href="Rocky%20Hill%2C%20Connecticut">Rocky Hill</a> in 1966, during excavation for the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%2091">Interstate Highway 91</a>. The six tracks were assigned to the <a href="ichnotaxon">ichnospecies</a> "Eubrontes giganteus", which was made the <a href="state%20fossil">state fossil</a> of Connecticut in 1991. The area they were found in had been a Triassic lake, and when the significance of the area was confirmed, the highway was rerouted, and the area made a <a href="Connecticut%20state%20park">state park</a> named <a href="Dinosaur%20State%20Park">Dinosaur State Park</a>. In 1981 a sculpture of "Dilophosaurus", the first life-sized reconstruction of this dinosaur, was donated to the park. "Dilophosaurus" was proposed as the state dinosaur of Arizona in 1998, but lawmakers suggested "<a href="Sonorasaurus">Sonorasaurus</a>" instead, arguing that "Dilophosaurus" was not unique to Arizona. Later a compromise was suggested that would recognize both dinosaurs, but the bill died when it was revealed that the " Dilophosaurus" fossils had been taken without permission from the Navajo Reservation.

Ernst Lindemann

Otto Ernst Lindemann (28 March 1894 – 27 May 1941) was a German "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" (<a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">naval captain</a>). He was the only commander of the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> during its eight months of service in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Lindemann joined the German Imperial Navy () in 1913, and after his basic military training, served on a number of warships during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> as a <a href="wireless%20telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a> officer. On board , he participated in <a href="Operation%20Albion">Operation Albion</a> in 1917. After World War I, he served in various staff and naval gunnery training positions. One year after the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed commander of the battleship "Bismarck", at the time the largest warship in commission anywhere in the world and the pride of the "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" (Nazi Germany's navy).

In May 1941, Lindemann commanded "Bismarck" during "<a href="Operation%20Rhein%C3%BCbung">Operation Rheinübung</a>". "Bismarck" and the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> formed a task force under the command of <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20L%C3%BCtjens">Günther Lütjens</a> on board Bismarck. Orders were to break out of their base in <a href="Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29">German occupied Poland</a> and attack British merchant shipping lanes in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The task force's first major engagement was the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Denmark%20Strait">Battle of the Denmark Strait</a> which resulted in the sinking of . Less than a week later, on 27 May, Lindemann and most of his crew died in "Bismarck"s <a href="Last%20battle%20of%20the%20battleship%20Bismarck">last battle</a>.

He was posthumously awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> (), the highest award in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during World War II. The medal was presented to his widow, Hildegard, on 6 January 1942.

Otto Ernst Lindemann was born on 28 March 1894 in <a href="Altenkirchen">Altenkirchen</a> in the <a href="Westerwald">Westerwald</a>, <a href="Rhine%20Province">Rhine Province</a>. He was the first of three children of Dr. jur. Georg Heinrich Ernst Lindemann and Maria Lindemann, née Lieber. Known as Ernst, Georg Lindemann was a probationary judge (<a href="Gerichtsassessor">Gerichtsassessor</a>) and later president of the Prussian Central Land Credit Company, a Prussian credit bank.

Otto Ernst Lindemann was baptised into the <a href="Protestantism">Protestant Church</a> on 26 April 1894. The family moved to the <a href="Charlottenburg">Charlottenburg</a> quarter of Berlin, where they lived at 6 Carmer Street, in 1895. His younger brother—Kurt—was born in 1896, followed by a second brother, Hans-Wolfgang, in 1900. The family relocated again in 1903, this time to their own house in the <a href="Dahlem%20%28Berlin%29">Dahlem</a> quarter of Berlin, near the <a href="Grunewald">Grunewald</a> forest.

In 1910, when Lindemann was 16, his uncle "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" Friedrich Tiesmeyer was in command of the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> (October 1909 – January 1910) of the Imperial Navy, at that time holding the rank of (commander). At a family reunion in <a href="Hamelin">Hamelin</a>, Lindemann talked with his uncle and heard of his seafaring adventures in the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>. These conversations gave Lindemann the idea of a naval career.

Lindemann graduated from the Bismarck-<a href="Gymnasium%20%28Germany%29">Gymnasium</a> (secondary school) in Berlin-<a href="Wilmersdorf">Wilmersdorf</a> with his "<a href="Abitur">Abitur</a>" (diploma) late in 1912 with an average-to-good overall rating. For the next six months, he attended the <a href="University%20of%20Westminster">Royal Polytechnic Institution</a> in <a href="Richmond%2C%20London">Richmond, London</a>.

Ernst Lindemann met Charlotte Weil (née Fritsche; 1899–1979), a Berlin singer, in the spring of 1920. The couple married on 1 February 1921, and they had a daughter, Helga Maria, born on 26 February 1924. Lindemann's job as a naval officer demanded that he be away from his family for long periods of time. This proved to be too demanding on the marriage, and they were divorced in 1932. Lindemann was engaged again on 20 July 1933 to his youngest brother's sister-in-law, Hildegard Burchard. Hildegard was 14 years younger than Lindemann. They married on 27 October 1934 in the St. Annen Church in Berlin–Dahlem. The ceremony was performed by <a href="Martin%20Niem%C3%B6ller">Martin Niemöller</a>, a founder of the <a href="Confessing%20Church">Confessing Church</a>, later imprisoned as an anti-Nazi. They had a daughter, Heidi Maria, born on 6 July 1939.

On 26 March 1913, Lindemann traveled with his parents to <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a> for his medical examination at the <a href="Naval%20Academy%20at%20M%C3%BCrwik">Naval Academy at Mürwik</a>. The strong financial background of his parents made him a suitable applicant for the Imperial Navy, as the costs associated with a naval education in 1909 were 800–1,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">Marks</a> per year for eight years. By comparison, a metal worker earned 1,366 Marks annually and a teacher 3,294 Marks. Only 5 percent of the German population at the time earned more than 3,000 Marks annually. However, the doctor certified him as fit only for limited duties (), as pneumonia in childhood had left him unfit for service in <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s. After a second examination, he was accepted on probation, and Lindemann became one of the 290 young men of "Crew 1913" (the incoming class of 1913). He was officially enlisted in the Imperial Navy as a (<a href="midshipman">midshipman</a>) on 1 April 1913.
In early May 1913, the cadets of Crew 1913 were sent to the training ships , , and . Lindemann was assigned to "Hertha" with 71 of his comrades. At that time, "Hertha" was under the command of Captain Heinrich Rohardt, a friend of his uncle Friedrich. Arriving on board on 9 May, they were divided into watches consisting of roughly 18 men each. "Hertha" left <a href="M%C3%BCrwik">Mürwik</a> and stayed in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> until the end of the month. On 29 May 1913, "Hertha" headed for <a href="%C5%9Awinouj%C5%9Bcie">Swinemünde</a>, where she stayed until 15 June. The next stop, via <a href="Sassnitz">Sassnitz</a> and <a href="Visby">Visby</a>, was <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden, arriving on 24 June. The ship remained in Stockholm until 1 July, before leaving for <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a> in Norway. After a few days, the voyage continued to the Lönne Fjord. Here, Lindemann met his commander-in-chief—<a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>—for the first time. "Hertha" then returned to Germany, arriving in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> on 8 August 1913.

One week later, "Hertha" began a seven-month training cruise (15 August 1913 – 12 March 1914). The voyage took Lindemann to <a href="Dartmouth%2C%20Devon">Dartmouth</a> in England, <a href="Vilagarc%C3%ADa%20de%20Arousa">Vilagarcía de Arousa</a> in Spain, <a href="Faial%20Island">Faial Island</a> in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and as far as <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a> in <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. The return trip then went via <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Vera Cruz</a> in Mexico, <a href="Havana">Havana</a> in Cuba, <a href="Port-au-Prince">Port-au-Prince</a> in Haiti, <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston</a> in Jamaica, <a href="Port%20of%20Spain">Port of Spain</a> in Trinidad and then to the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, and the Spanish mainland, arriving back in Germany in the middle of March 1914, first in <a href="Brunsb%C3%BCttel">Brunsbüttel</a> and two days later in Kiel. Lindemann was promoted to "<a href="F%C3%A4hnrich%20zur%20See">Fähnrich zur See</a>" (<a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">Ensign</a>) on 3 April 1914.

With the <a href="World%20War%20I">German declaration of war</a> in August 1914, all further training at the naval academy was terminated and the normal compulsory officer examination was skipped. The entire Crew 1913 was assigned to various units in the Imperial Navy. Lindemann was assigned to , a battleship which belonged to the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">2nd Battle Squadron</a> of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> under the command of "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (vice admiral) <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>, taking on the position of 3rd <a href="wireless%20telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a> officer. "Lothringen" was mostly tasked with patrolling the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, sailing back and forth between Altenbruch (now part of <a href="Cuxhaven">Cuxhaven</a>) and Brunsbüttel without engaging in combat. Lindemann left "Lothringen" on 1 June 1915 to attend the wireless telegraphy school at Mürwik. He successfully completed the course and returned from it in July 1915. He then took over the position of 2nd wireless telegraphy officer and was promoted to "Leutnant zur See" (<a href="Second%20Lieutenant">Second Lieutenant</a>) on 18 September 1915.
On 19 March 1916, Lindemann was transferred to the newly commissioned battleship (under the command of Captain Max Hahn), with the same rank of 2nd wireless telegraphy officer. "Bayern", with her eight guns, was the most powerful ship of the fleet. Her crew had been largely assigned from "Lothringen", which continued to serve as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>. Aboard "Bayern", now under the command of Captain Rohardt, Lindemann participated in <a href="Operation%20Albion">Operation Albion</a> in September–October 1917. Operation Albion's objective was the invasion and occupation of the Estonian islands of <a href="Saaremaa">Saaremaa</a> (Ösel), <a href="Hiiumaa">Hiiumaa</a> (Dagö) and <a href="Muhu">Muhu</a> (Moon), then part of the <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Russian Republic</a>. At 05:07 on 12 October 1917, "Bayern" struck a <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> while moving into her bombardment position to secure the landing beaches at Pamerort. Seven sailors were killed. Despite mine damage, "Bayern" engaged the coast defense battery at Cape Toffri on the southern tip of Hiiumaa. "Bayern" was released from her duties at 14:00 that day. Preliminary repairs were made on 13 October in <a href="Tagga%20Bay">Tagga Bay</a> before she returned to Kiel on 1 November 1917.

After the <a href="armistice%20with%20Germany">armistice</a> in 1918, "Bayern"—together with the majority of the German High Seas Fleet—was interned at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, the home of the British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. "Bayern" arrived there on 23 November 1918 with a <a href="skeleton%20crew">skeleton crew</a> of only 175 men, including Lindemann, who was then ordered to return to Germany, arriving in Kiel on 12 January. On 21 June 1919, Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a> ordered the <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20at%20Scapa%20Flow">scuttling of the fleet</a>, and "Bayern" sank at 14:30.

When Ernst Lindemann returned to Germany, it was uncertain whether he could remain on active military service. As a result of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> which was signed on 28 June 1919, the former Imperial German Navy was downsized to 15,000 men, including 1,500 officers, while being renamed the "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>" in the era of the <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a>. As Lindemann had finished fifth in the Class of 1913, he stood a good chance of being retained. He served temporarily in the Dahlem Protection Company a part of the Protection Regiment of Greater Berlin (June–July 1919), before he became <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> to the newly created chief of the Naval Command Department (1 August 1919 – 30 September 1922), at the time under the command of <a href="William%20Michaelis">William Michaelis</a>. The Naval Command Department was directly subordinated to the Admiralty Staff. At the same time, he held the position of adjutant in the Fleet Department. During this assignment Lindemann was promoted to "<a href="Oberleutnant%20zur%20See">Oberleutnant zur See</a>" (Sub-Lieutenant) on 7 January 1920.

Lindemann's next assignment (1 October 1922 – 30 September 1924) was aboard the battleship , where he served as a watch and division officer. During this assignment, he attended an officers' course at the ships' gunnery school in Kiel between 5 February and 3 May 1924. From here, Lindemann took command of the 1st Artillery Company of the 3rd Coastal Defense Department in Friedrichsort in Kiel from 1 October 1924 – 26 September 1926. His commanding officer was "<a href="Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n">Korvettenkapitän</a>" (Lieutenant Commander) <a href="Otto%20Schultze">Otto Schultze</a>, a former World War I <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> commander and later "<a href="Generaladmiral">Generaladmiral</a>" (general admiral) of the "Kriegsmarine". In this position, Lindemann was promoted to "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant">Kapitänleutnant</a>" (captain lieutenant) on 1 January 1925.

His next assignment (27 September 1926 – 6 September 1929) placed him on the Admiral's staff at the Baltic Naval Station, first as a staff officer and then as assistant to the chief of the station, which at the time was under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="Erich%20Raeder">Erich Raeder</a>. From here, he was transferred to the serving as the second gunnery officer and "Fähnrichsoffizier" (officer in charge of cadets), responsible for the on-board training of the officer cadets, from 7 September 1929 – 25 February 1930. Holding the same rank and position, Lindemann then transferred to the .

On 30 January 1933, the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>, under the leadership of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, came to power in Germany, ushering in a period of <a href="German%20re-armament">naval rearmament</a>. In 1935, the "Reichsmarine" was renamed the "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>". Between 22 September 1931 and 22 September 1934, Lindemann was a senior lecturer at the Naval Gunnery School in Kiel. He was then posted to the under the command of Captain <a href="Hermann%20Boehm%20%28admiral%29">Hermann Boehm</a> and served as first gunnery officer from 23 September 1933 to 8 April 1934. Ernst Lindemann was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on 1 April 1932. On 9 April 1934, he was ordered to the Wilhelmshaven Shipyard (9 April–11 November 1934) for training in ship construction and familiarisation with the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , under the command of Captain <a href="Wilhelm%20Marschall">Wilhelm Marschall</a>.
On "Admiral Scheer", he again served as first gunnery officer, and in this position he participated in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> (24 July–30 August 1936). "Admiral Scheer" had to make ready for the mission on short notice; the order came from Admiral <a href="Rolf%20Carls">Rolf Carls</a> on 23 July 1936 at 13:45. The normal 48 hours required to prepare the ship was reduced to 12 hours, demanding a lot of the crew and especially Lindemann. As the first gunnery officer, Lindemann was responsible for handling and storing all munitions. "Admiral Scheer" and the cruiser left Germany on 24 July at 8:00. Lindemann's main responsibilities included commanding the German landing parties and acting as diplomatic aid and interpreter for Captain Marschall. These landing parties consisted of up to 350 men, which included 11 officers, 15 non-commissioned officers and 266 sailors, or roughly one-third of the crew. On the return voyage to Germany, "Admiral Scheer" stopped at Gibraltar on the morning of 25 August 1936. Marschall, Lindemann and other officers met with the British Governor and Rear Admiral <a href="James%20Somerville">James Somerville</a>. After Lindemann returned to Germany, he was promoted to commander on 1 October 1936.

Between 1936 and 1938, he was an adviser and later head of the ship construction department at the Naval High Command, and at the same time a consultant to and later chief of the Naval Training Department. On 1 April 1938, he was promoted to the rank of "Kapitän zur See" (captain at sea). On 30 September 1939, one month after the outbreak of World War II, Lindemann succeeded Captain Heinrich Woldag as commander of the Naval Gunnery School in Wik in Kiel, after Woldag took command of the heavy cruiser . Under his command were three training departments, the gunnery training ship and "Hektor", numerous gunnery training boats, gun carriers, auxiliary vessels, and occasionally Hitler's state yacht, the aviso .

Ernst Lindemann was frustrated by the fact that—as commander of the Naval Gunnery School—he would never come into direct contact with the enemy. When he received the news that he had been selected to be the first commander of the battleship , he was honoured by the trust that had been bestowed on him but doubted that he would be able to get "Bismarck" ready for action before the war was over. His doubts suggest that he was confident the war would end in a favourable outcome for Germany by mid-1940. Prior to commanding "Bismarck", Lindemann had never held any shipboard command, a situation rare if not unique in the "Kriegsmarine". Nevertheless, Lindemann had served exclusively on ships with a gun calibre of at least , and he was Germany's leading gunnery expert. In 1940, he ranked second out of Crew 1913 and was considered an outstanding leader.
Lindemann arrived at the <a href="Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss">Blohm & Voss</a> shipbuilding works in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> at the beginning of August 1940. "Bismarck"s keel had been laid on 1 July 1936 and she was launched on 14 February 1939. Burkard Freiherr von Müllenheim-Rechberg joined "Bismarck" as fourth gunnery officer in June 1940, and he would become the highest-ranking officer to survive <a href="Last%20battle%20of%20the%20battleship%20Bismarck">"Bismarck"s last battle</a> on 27 May 1941. Much of what is currently known about "Bismarck"s final days is attributed to his account as a witness. Lindemann made Von Müllenheim-Rechberg his personal adjutant and instructed him to refer to the ship as "he" rather than "she"; Lindemann considered the ship too powerful to be referred to as a female. He commissioned the battleship on 24 August 1940. He showed a great deal of attachment to the ship and was respected by his crew.

"Bismarck" left the <a href="Kiel%20Fjord">Kiel Fjord</a> on the morning of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, "Bismarck" reached Gotenhafen (now <a href="Gdynia">Gdynia</a>) the next day. Here "Bismarck" conducted a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now <a href="Gda%C5%84sk%20Bay">Gdańsk Bay</a>). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, "Bismarck" reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the <a href="rudder">rudder</a>s but only the <a href="Screw%20ship">screws</a>, "Bismarck" was almost impossible to steer.
In November 1940, Von Müllenheim-Rechberg was sent to the Naval Gunnery School at Wik to complete his heavy gun training courses, which ended his position as Lindemann's personal adjutant. Lindemann's new adjutant was the <a href="Military%20communications">signals</a> officer Second Lieutenant Wolfgang Reiner. "Bismarck"s heavy guns were first test-fired in the second half of November, and "Bismarck" was shown to be a very stable gun platform. After the 1940 Christmas celebration on board, Lindemann and the majority of the officers, non-commissioned officers and sailors went on home leave. First gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander <a href="Adalbert%20Schneider">Adalbert Schneider</a> relieved Lindemann as "Bismarck"s commander during his absence. Lindemann spent his leave with his wife and daughter and returned on 1 January 1941.

On 28 April 1941, the ship and crew were ready, and stores were on board for a three-month mission. Lindemann notified Naval High Command ("<a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Marine">Oberkommando der Marine</a>"), Naval Groups North and West ("Marinegruppen Nord und West") and Fleet Command that "Bismarck" was ready for action. The Chief of Fleet—Admiral <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20L%C3%BCtjens">Günther Lütjens</a>—and his fleet staff held drills for the first time on board "Bismarck" on 13 May, testing the communication chain between Fleet Command and "Bismarck"s officers.

<a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>—accompanied by <a href="Field%20Marshal%20%28Germany%29">"Generalfeldmarschall"</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20Keitel">Wilhelm Keitel</a>, his former naval adjutant Commander <a href="Karl-Jesko%20von%20Puttkamer">Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer</a>, and his "Luftwaffe" adjutant "<a href="Oberst">Oberst</a>" <a href="Nicolaus%20von%20Below">Nicolaus von Below</a>, among others—visited "Bismarck" on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral <a href="Erich%20Raeder">Erich Raeder</a>. Hitler was taken on a tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of "Bismarck" had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion that the possibility of the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.

The goal of <a href="Operation%20Rhein%C3%BCbung">Operation "Rheinübung"</a> (Rhine Exercise) was for "Bismarck" and the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> —under the command of Lindemann's "Crew 1913" classmate Captain <a href="Helmuth%20Brinkmann">Helmuth Brinkmann</a>—to break into the Atlantic and attack Allied shipping. Grand Admiral Raeder's orders to the task force commander—Admiral Günther Lütjens—were that "the objective of the "Bismarck" is not to defeat enemies of equal strength, but to tie them down in a delaying action, while preserving combat capacity as much as possible, so as to allow "Prinz Eugen" to get at the merchant ships in the convoy" and "The primary target in this operation is the enemy's merchant shipping; enemy warships will be engaged only when that objective makes it necessary and it can be done without excessive risk."

At 02:00 on 19 May 1941, "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen" left Gotenhafen and proceeded through the Baltic Sea and out toward the Atlantic. Unknown to Lütjens, the British had intercepted enough signals to infer that a German naval operation might occur in the area. The German task force was first encountered by the Swedish seaplane-cruiser on 20 May heading north-west past <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>. The British Admiralty was informed through a Norwegian officer in Stockholm who had learned of the sighting from a Swedish military intelligence source. Alerted by this report, British Admiralty requested air reconnaissance of the Norwegian coast. A <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a> <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> found and photographed the German task force in the Grimstad fjord (), near <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>, at 13:15 on 21 May. On the evening of 23 May at 19:22, the German force was detected by the heavy cruisers and that had been patrolling the <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a> in the expectation of a German breakout. The alarm was sounded and Lindemann announced at 20:30 over the intercom: "". (Enemy sighted to port. Engage!) "Bismarck" fired five <a href="salvo">salvo</a>s without scoring a direct hit. The heavily outgunned British cruisers retired to a safe distance and shadowed the enemy until their own heavy units could draw closer. However, "Bismarck"s forward radar had failed as a result of vibration from the heavy guns firing during this skirmish, and Lütjens was obliged to order "Prinz Eugen" to move ahead of "Bismarck" in order to provide the squadron with forward radar coverage.

At the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Denmark%20Strait">Battle of the Denmark Strait</a> on 24 May 1941, was sunk, probably by "Bismarck". The <a href="hydrophone">hydrophone</a>s on "Prinz Eugen" detected a foreign ship to port at 05:00. The Germans sighted the smokestacks of two ships at 05:45, which the first gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider initially reported as two heavy cruisers. The first British salvo revealed them to be battleships, but not until the British task force turned to port was their precise identity revealed. The British ships started firing at the German task force at 05:53. Vice-Admiral <a href="Lancelot%20Holland">Lancelot Holland</a> planned on targeting "Bismarck" first, but due to the reversed German battle order, "Hood" opened fire on the "Prinz Eugen" instead. The German task force was still waiting for the order to commence firing, which Admiral Lütjens did not give immediately. Two minutes later, after multiple inquiries by Schneider, ""? (Permission to open fire?), an impatient Lindemann responded: "" (I'm not letting my ship get shot out from under my arse. Open fire!) At 06:01, the fifth salvo by "Bismarck", fired at a range of about , was seen to hit "Hood" abreast her mainmast. It is likely that one shell struck somewhere between Hood's mainmast and 'X' turret aft of the mast. A huge jet of flame burst out from "Hood" from the vicinity of the mainmast. This was followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship. This explosion broke the back of "Hood", and she sank in only three minutes, her nearly vertical bow last to descend into the water.
Following the explosion, "Prince of Wales" was targeted by both German ships and disengaged from combat after seven direct hits, four by "Bismarck" and three by "Prinz Eugen", at about 06:09. During this brief engagement, "Prince of Wales" had also hit "Bismarck" three times, first striking the commander's boat and putting the seaplane catapult amidships out of action. The second shell passed right through the bow from one side to the other. The third struck the hull underwater and burst inside the ship, flooding a generator room and damaging the bulkhead of an adjoining boiler room, partially flooding it. The damage caused to "Bismarck" by these two shots allowed of water into the ship.

Lindemann and Lütjens at this point differed on how best to continue the mission. Lindemann, as commander of a battleship, was guided by the tactical situation, and wanted to hunt down the damaged "Prince of Wales". (The Germans did not at that time know the ship to be "Prince of Wales", but knew that it was a battleship.) Lütjens, apparently mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary contact with similar enemy units, rejected this without discussion. Lindemann and Lütjens also differed on where to take the ship for repairs; Lindemann advocated retracing their route through the Denmark Strait and returning to <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>, Norway. Lütjens overruled him and ordered a course set for <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a>, France. In the afternoon, Admiral Lütjens ordered "Prinz Eugen" to break away from "Bismarck" and operate independently against the enemy's merchant shipping. "Prinz Eugen" and "Bismarck" separated at 18:14 that evening. "Prinz Eugen" arrived safely at <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest, France</a> on 1 June 1941. No direct witnesses to this difference of opinion survived the sinking, but "Matrosengefreiter" (<a href="Leading%20Seaman">Leading Seaman</a>) Heinz Staat, the helmsman on the bridge, remembered a telephone call between the First <a href="Watch%20officer">Watch Officer</a>, Commander Hans Oels, and a fleet staff officer which suggested that Lindemann had been trying to persuade Lütjens to pursue the enemy. A messenger returning to his comrades below spoke of ""dicke Luft"" ("thick air" or a "bad atmosphere") on the bridge.

"Bismarck" was sunk three days later, after a concentrated effort by Britain's <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. At 23:30 (local time 19:30) on 24 May an attack was made by a small group of nine <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Swordfish</a> <a href="biplane">biplane</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s of <a href="825%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">825 Naval Air Squadron</a> under the command of <a href="Eugene%20Esmonde">Eugene Esmonde</a> from the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> . One hit was scored, which killed "Oberbootsmann" Kurt Kirchberg, but caused only superficial damage to the "Bismarck"s <a href="belt%20armour">armoured belt</a>. In mid-morning at 10:30 on 26 May, a <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">RAF Coastal Command</a> <a href="PBY%20Catalina">Catalina reconnaissance aircraft</a> from <a href="No.%20209%20Squadron%20RAF">209 Squadron RAF</a> spotted "Bismarck" roughly west of Saint-Nazaire. The British battle group <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a>, under the command of <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="James%20Somerville">James Somerville</a>, whose main units were the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> , the First World War era <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> and the <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> , was ordered to stop "Bismarck". At 19:15 that evening, 15 Swordfish from "Ark Royal" launched an attack. The air raid alarm was sounded on "Bismarck" at 20:30. Roughly 15 minutes into the attack "Bismarck" was possibly hit by one torpedo, and at around 21:00 another single torpedo jammed "Bismarck"s rudder 12° to port. Damage-control parties laboured to regain steering control and uncoupled and centred the starboard rudder, but failed to free the port rudder. With asymmetric power applied, speed reduced to , "Bismarck" was on a converging course with the Royal Navy units on the chase. The alarm sounded again at 23:00 when destroyers of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla under the command of Captain <a href="Philip%20Vian">Philip Vian</a> attacked "Bismarck". Throughout the night "Bismarck" was targeted by incessant torpedo attacks by , , , , and , denying Lindemann and the crew much-needed rest.

"Bismarck"s alarm sounded for the last time at 08:00 on the morning of 27 May 1941. "Norfolk" sighted the "Bismarck" at 08:15, and the battleship opened fire on "Bismarck" at 08:48. "Bismarck" returned fire at 08:49. Further involved in the final battle were the battleship and the cruisers "Norfolk" and . Torpedo bombers did not participate in the final battle. "Bismarck"s forward command position was hit at 08:53, and both forward gun turrets were put out of action at 09:02, killing Adalbert Schneider in the main gun director. The after command position was destroyed at 09:18 and turret "Dora" was disabled at 09:24. "Bismarck" received further heavy hits at 09:40, resulting in a fire amidships, and turret "Caesar" went out of action after a hit at 09:50. All weapons fell silent at 10:00. Short of fuel, "Rodney" and "King George V" had to disengage prior to "Bismarck"s sinking. The Germans were preparing to <a href="Scuttling">scuttle</a> "Bismarck" when three torpedoes fired by "Dorsetshire" hit the ship's side armour. "Bismarck" sank at 10:36 at position , roughly west of Ouessant (<a href="Ushant">Ushant</a>). The cruiser "Dorsetshire" saved 85 men, and the British destroyer "Maori" saved 25. A further five sailors were saved by under the command of "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant">Kapitänleutnant</a>" <a href="Eitel-Friedrich%20Kentrat">Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat</a> and the weather observation ship . The "<a href="Befehlshaber%20der%20U-Boote">Befehlshaber der U-Boote</a>" (U-boats Commander-in-Chief) <a href="Karl%20D%C3%B6nitz">Karl Dönitz</a> had ordered under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" <a href="Herbert%20Wohlfarth">Herbert Wohlfarth</a> to pick up "Bismarck"s <a href="war%20diary">war diary</a>. Out of torpedoes and low on fuel, Wohlfarth requested that the order be transferred to "U-74". "U-74" failed to reach Bismarck on time and the war diary was never retrieved.

Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for the last time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg described the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored, and later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.
Lindemann's body was never recovered, and it is thought that he, Lütjens and other officers probably died when shells from the British warships hit "Bismarck"s bridge at 09:02. When <a href="Robert%20Ballard">Robert Ballard</a>, the <a href="oceanographer">oceanographer</a> responsible for finding discovered the wreck of the "Bismarck" in 1989, he found that most of the forward <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> had been blasted away by shellfire and there were more than 50 shell holes around the area of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>. This may support the theory.

Alternatively, Lindemann may have left his combat position when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and prior to the lethal hit on the command position, in order to give the command to abandon the ship. The surviving "Matrose" Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that he had seen a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving "Maschinengefreiter"—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near "Bismarck"s forward 38 cm turret, "Anton". He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, <a href="Captain%20goes%20down%20with%20the%20ship">going under with the ship</a>.

Lindemann's comrades of Crew 1913 all contacted the young widow after his death. The former head of Crew 1913, Captain Otto Klüber, contacted Mrs Lindemann in the fall of 1941 and offered her an honorary membership. Shortly after Christmas on 27 December 1941, exactly seven months after the sinking of "Bismarck" and the death of its commander, Captain Ernst Lindemann received a posthumous <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a>. He received this high award because the "<a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Marine">Oberkommando der Marine</a>" felt that his skilled leadership significantly contributed to the destruction of the British battlecruiser "Hood" and the damage inflicted on the British battleship "Prince of Wales".

Lindemann's first gunnery officer—Lieutenant Commander <a href="Adalbert%20Schneider">Adalbert Schneider</a>—had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 May 1941. Traditionally, the commanding officer would have received this award before any other crew member was so honoured. This exception had been criticized by various circles in the "Wehrmacht". It is thought likely that Ernst Lindemann's cousin, the former "<a href="General%20of%20the%20Cavalry%20%28Germany%29">General der Kavallarie</a>" (General of the Cavalry) <a href="Georg%20Lindemann">Georg Lindemann</a>, intervened. Grand Admiral <a href="Erich%20Raeder">Erich Raeder</a>, with whom Lindemann shared a 20-year comradeship dating to the early days of the "Reichsmarine", presented the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to Mrs Lindemann on Tuesday, 6 January 1942, in <a href="Dahlem%20%28Berlin%29">Dahlem</a>. Raeder went on to provide moral and emotional support to Lindemann's mother and widow.


To honour the late Captain Lindemann, the heavy naval battery at <a href="Sangatte">Sangatte</a>, between <a href="Calais">Calais</a> and <a href="Boulogne">Boulogne</a> was christened "Batterie Lindemann" (the Lindemann Battery) on 19 September 1942 by the admiral in command of the Channel Coast <a href="Friedrich%20Frisius">Friedrich Frisius</a>. The battery consisted of three heavy <a href="40.6%20cm%20SK%20C/34%20gun">SK C/34</a> guns housed in casemates, originally intended for the early <a href="H-class%20battleship%20proposals">H-class battleships</a>. Prior to this, the guns had been referred to as "Batterie Schleswig-Holstein" or "Batterie Groß-Deutschland" and were located in the <a href="Hel%20Peninsula">Hel Peninsula</a>, Poland. The battery was destroyed by Canadian forces on the evening of 26 September 1944. Today the structure is partly covered by excavated material from the <a href="Channel%20Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a>, and only the command bunker with a number of smaller strong points are still visible.

Austrian actor <a href="Carl%20M%C3%B6hner">Carl Möhner</a> played Captain Ernst Lindemann in the 1960 black-and-white British war film "<a href="Sink%20the%20Bismarck%21">Sink the Bismarck!</a>" The film was based on the novel "<a href="The%20Last%20Nine%20Days%20of%20the%20Bismarck">The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck</a>" by <a href="C.%20S.%20Forester">C. S. Forester</a>.

Pokémon Channel

Pokémon Channel, released in Japan as , is a 2003 <a href="video%20game">video game</a> in the <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28video%20game%20series%29">"Pokémon" series</a> for the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>, developed by <a href="Ambrella">Ambrella</a>, published by <a href="The%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Company">The Pokémon Company</a> and distributed by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>. The player's goal is to help <a href="Professor%20Oak">Professor Oak</a> refine and promote his TV network through watching broadcasts with a <a href="Pikachu">Pikachu</a>. The game contains elements of the <a href="adventure%20video%20game">adventure</a>, <a href="digital%20pet">digital pet</a>, and <a href="simulation%20video%20game">simulation</a> genres. The player can explore full <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> environments, have Pikachu converse with other Pokémon, and collect various items.

The game was developed rather quickly as a sequel to the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> title "<a href="Hey%20You%2C%20Pikachu%21">Hey You, Pikachu!</a>" and to promote the <a href="Nintendo%20e-Reader">Nintendo e-Reader</a> accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in <a href="Sapporo">Sapporo</a>, <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received.

"Pokémon Channel" is difficult to categorize into a genre, as it incorporates elements of <a href="adventure%20game">adventure</a>, <a href="simulation%20video%20game">simulation</a>, and <a href="digital%20pet">digital pet</a> games. The graphics are in <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a>, the perspective is <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a>, and the player navigates and selects things with a cursor. The game centers on watching television programs with a <a href="Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, a mouse-like <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokémon</a>. The player, who lives in a house, can <a href="channel-surf">channel-surf</a> freely among the various channels of a television network created by the Pokémon professor, <a href="Professor%20Oak">Professor Oak</a>, as well as explore one room of the house and several outdoor areas. Pikachu sometimes displays emotional reactions while watching, such as happiness or anger. The game takes place over a few days, with unique plot events on each. The GameCube's inner clock tracks time such that every in-game day lasts at least as long as one real-time day.

While several channels are available, only a few are essential to the completion of the game. The player saves the game by reporting on recent accomplishments to Oak at "Prof. Oak Report", watches episodes of an <a href="anime">anime</a> series at "<a href="Pichu">Pichu</a> Bros.", and listens to plot-advancing news coverage from a <a href="Psyduck">Psyduck</a> at "Pokémon News Flash" (PNF). On a channel called "Shop 'n Squirtle", the player uses the game's currency, "Poké", to purchase bus passes to travel among the game's locations, as well as non-essential items like Pokémon dolls, new television sets in various styles, and other decorations, all delivered by a Delibird (a bird-like Pokémon that carries various items in its satchel). Extraneous channels include the <a href="trivia">trivia</a>-based <a href="game%20show">game show</a> "Quiz <a href="Wobbuffet">Wobbuffet</a>", where the player earns Poké, the art exhibition program "<a href="Smeargle">Smeargle</a>'s Art Study", where Smeargle gives opinions on art that can be created in a <a href="paint%20by%20number">paint-by-numbers</a> style in the player's house, and the exercise program "<a href="Smoochum">Smoochum</a> Shape-Up".

The main collectibles available in "Pokémon Channel" are <a href="collectible%20card%20game">trading cards</a> that display various Pokémon. The trading cards, known in game as Nice Cards, exist in three forms: Single, which simply show a picture; Motion, which are holographic; and Platinum, which are holographic and play the respective Pokémon's cries. The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks, or by ordering from "Shop 'n Squirtle". There is a virtual <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20Mini">Pokémon Mini</a> console hidden under the player's bed that plays six games: "<a href="Snorlax">Snorlax</a>'s Lunch Time" (exclusive to "Pokémon Channel") and five others previously released for the real-life Pokémon Mini. The games are simple and mainly based on <a href="rhythm%20game">rhythm</a>.

The game opens with a group of <a href="Magnemite">Magnemite</a>—magnet-like Pokémon with levitation abilities—delivering a television to the player's house. Upon turning the television on, Professor Oak appears to request the player's help: he is creating a new television network for Trainers and their Pokémon to enjoy together, and he wants the player to serve as a <a href="beta%20tester">beta tester</a>. He has them watch an episode of an anime called "Pichu Bros." and then introduces the game's basic features before leaving them alone. The player then hears Pokémon cries from outside, which turn out to belong to a Pikachu and two other creatures: the reptilian <a href="Treecko">Treecko</a> and the avian <a href="Torchic">Torchic</a>. While the others run off, the Pikachu stays and the player adopts it. Oak decides to allow Pikachu to be a second beta tester.

After completing a few tasks, the player returns to Oak's channel, and the Professor remarks that Pikachu has behaved remarkably well. The overexcited Pikachu uses its Thunderbolt attack on the television and destroys it. Unfazed, Oak has the Magnemite deliver a "retro" television while the player and Pikachu wait for a replacement of the original. When the replacement arrives the next morning, the Professor remarks that the player's viewership has brought life to the network and helped spawn new shows. The player then finds a bus stop and visits Viridian Forest, a location that first appeared in <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20Red%20and%20Blue">"Pokémon Red" and "Blue"</a>.

The third day opens with Pikachu asleep in the cupboard and Oak expressing pleasure at the Pokémon's growing attachment to the player. On the fourth day, Pikachu invites its friends back over. Little else occurs on these two days besides visits to the snowy Mt. Snowfall and the tropical Cobalt Coast, although Oak does continue to laud the player's investment in the network, which has become a huge success.

On the morning of the fifth day, the "Pokémon News Flash" reports on a breaking news story: a disc containing the unaired fifth episode of "Pichu Bros." was dropped and lost by the delivery Magnemite on their way to the show's broadcasting studio. After obtaining a lamp from a friendly <a href="Duskull">Duskull</a> in the front lawn, the player takes a bus back to Mt. Snowfall, where the disc was presumed lost. Eastward are the Ruins of Truth, where the stubborn Ghost-type Pokémon <a href="Gengar">Gengar</a> blocks the player's path until it is scared away by the lamp. Inside the Ruins, Pikachu gets stuck inside a statue of the bat-like Pokémon <a href="Golbat">Golbat</a>. Upon being shaken free, the missing disc pops out. The player hands it back to Magnemite, who is waiting sheepishly outside, and heads home to watch the last episode, along with a video called "<a href="Meowth%27s%20Party">Meowth's Party</a>".

Oak informs the player that every program produced for his network has been aired, thanking the player and Pikachu for their time, and announces the impending arrival of a gift for them. The gift, which arrives the following morning, is a "Star Projector", a device for viewing images flashed across the sky. That night, Professor Oak notices that a Pokémon has arrived at the player's house—the rare and legendary <a href="Jirachi">Jirachi</a>—which leaves him in shock. The player, Pikachu, and Jirachi then visit Camp Starlight, the locale for which the Projector is intended. Using it, they project the entire series of "Pichu Bros." and "Meowth's Party" onto the sky for the universe to see, and the story ends. This event also allows players of the PAL version (i.a. Europe and Australia) to download a Jirachi to a copy of <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20Ruby%20and%20Sapphire">"Pokémon Ruby" or "Sapphire"</a> via the <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube%20%E2%80%93%20Game%20Boy%20Advance%20link%20cable">Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable</a>.

"Pokémon Channel" was developed by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> subsidiary <a href="Ambrella">Ambrella</a> and published by Nintendo and <a href="The%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Company">The Pokémon Company</a>. It was created both to serve as a <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a> to "<a href="Hey%20You%2C%20Pikachu%21">Hey You, Pikachu!</a>"—a similar digital pet-type game wherein the player plays with a Pikachu—and to promote the <a href="Nintendo%20e-Reader">Nintendo e-Reader</a> peripheral device. The game included three e-Reader-compatible cards, but not the e-Reader device itself. When scanned, the cards upload new templates for the player to paint and for Smeargle to critique.

The game uses the visual effect of applying pre-rendered video footage to a polygon, specifically the game's pre-recorded shows on the television. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> writer Anoop Gantayat praised this effect's implementation, although he did note some minor graphical issues visible in the transition from distanced to full-screen viewing. Also unusual for the <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28video%20game%20series%29">"Pokémon" video game series</a>, the Pokémon's voices are borrowed from the <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28anime%29">anime</a> and sound like their names.

The game was first announced at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> 2003, where IGN staff noted that the game's demo appeared to be early in development due to its choppy frame rate. "Pokémon Channel" was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. The game was showcased on its Japanese release date at the <a href="Sapporo">Sapporo</a>, <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>, location of , a series of promotional events that extended across Japan and lasted about a month. Attendees could play the game at GameCube kiosks.

"Pokémon Channel" has scores of 51% and 55% on the review aggregators <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, respectively, both indicating a mixed or average reception. Reviewers felt that the game would only suit existing "Pokémon" fans and young children: staff at <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> summarized that "the various diversions here are cute, slickly produced, and entertaining, assuming you really, really dig Pokémon", and that even fans would be bored if over the age of five. Justin Leeper of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" claimed that fans would enjoy it but "everyone else will be turned off, pun intended". Author Tokyo Drifter of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" guessed that the game had been "tailored for die-hard fans" and would please no one else. IGN's Mary Jane Irwin stated that its intuitive interface, copious instructions, and "mindless entertainment" would keep young players entertained. "Nintendo Power"s review called the game "hours of fun for "Pokémon" fans."

Reviewers complained about the game's low level of interactivity due to most of the gameplay time being spent watching television with Pikachu. Summarizing the gameplay in general as "weak", <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Ricardo Torres argued that the game's promising ideas were fundamentally deadened by "the gimmick of having to 'virtually' watch television programs" and the long stretches of time this entails. Leeper claimed that Pikachu "will be content much longer than you will" and decried the channels' non-interactive nature while praising the unlockable status of a few. Darryl Vassar of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> went even further and claimed that there was "no gameplay". He gave the game only one star out of five as a result, despite calling the animation quality and Pokémon voices "decent". Tokyo Drifter found its low interactivity and slow pace to be the two biggest barriers for "Pokémon" fan enjoyment, and gave the game a 3.0 on a five-point scale. Irwin stated that the player would desire more interactivity and condemned the programs overall, with the exception of "Pichu Bros", which she called "the only worthwhile programming".

The game's 3D graphics received lukewarm opinions. Torres called them "decent but unspectacular" and "bland". His praise focused on the animations of the Pokémon with "distinct animations that suit their personalities", especially that of Pikachu. Irwin echoed these opinions. Vassar stated that the Pokémon animations were better than those in the then-upcoming GameCube title "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20Colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a>" and found the environments passable, if boring and overly limited. Tokyo Drifter found the environments "bright and colorful" while wholeheartedly praising the smooth and "adorable" Pokémon animations.

The sound and music were negatively received. Torres focused on their repetitiveness, stating that some of the music within the programs was catchy but "it starts to grate after some of the mandatory repeated viewings you'll have to endure", and that the paucity of sound effects "puts the weight of the audio burden on the Pokémon voices, which, while accurate, are naturally repetitive". Irwin and Vassar gave special focus to the repetitiveness of the voices. Tokyo Drifter gave little opinion on the voices but found the lack of voice acting for Oak to be disappointing.

Critics praised the large number of collectible items and Pokémon in the game. Torres noted the game's many items to collect and Pokémon for Pikachu to meet, and praised the game's increased <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a> as a result. Tokyo Drifter thought similarly, calling the collecting aspects "a prominent part of the gaming experience". Irwin found the collecting aspects a nice way to pass time and called the incorporation of the virtual Pokémon Mini "a nice diversion".

Within three days of its Japanese release, "Pokémon Channel" sold 12,581 copies, making it the thirteenth best-selling game among all platforms during its release week (July 14 to July 20). By August 17, 2003, its Japanese sales totaled 38,617 copies. The title had sold 66,373 copies in Japan by December 28 of the same year.

The 13th Airborne Division was an <a href="airborne%20forces">airborne forces</a> formation of <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a>-size of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> that was active during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The division was commanded for most of its existence by <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Elbridge%20Chapman">Elbridge G. Chapman</a>. It was officially activated in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> in August 1943 at <a href="Fort%20Bragg">Fort Bragg</a> in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, remaining active until February 1946, but never saw combat.

After activation the division remained in the United States to complete its training. This training was completed by September 1944, but had to be extended by a further four months when the division provided replacements for the <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division">82nd</a> and <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division">101st Airborne Division</a>s. The division also encountered delays in mounting large-scale training exercises due to a lack of transport aircraft in the United States. This shortage was caused by the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions taking priority over the 13th in terms of equipment due to the two divisions serving in combat in Europe. As a consequence of these delays the division was not fully trained and combat-ready until January 1945, and was transferred to France and the <a href="European%20Theater%20of%20Operations%2C%20United%20States%20Army">European Theater of Operations</a> in February.

When the division <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">arrived in France</a>, it came under the command of the <a href="First%20Allied%20Airborne%20Army">First Allied Airborne Army</a>, which controlled all <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> airborne formations. The division, along with two others, was selected to participate in <a href="Operation%20Varsity">Operation Varsity</a>, the airborne operation to support the Anglo-Canadian <a href="21st%20Army%20Group">21st Army Group</a> crossing the <a href="Rhine">River Rhine</a>, but was removed from the operation due to there being insufficient transport aircraft to carry all three divisions into combat. Several other operations were planned for the division after the end of Operation Varsity, but these operations were cancelled when their objectives were captured by the <a href="Western%20Allied%20invasion%20of%20Germany">rapid advance of Allied ground forces</a> and they became superfluous. After the <a href="Victory%20in%20Europe%20Day">end of the conflict in Europe</a>, the 13th Airborne was shipped to the United States to stage there before it was to participate in the planned <a href="Operation%20Downfall">invasion of Japan</a>, but the <a href="Pacific%20War">conflict in the Far East</a> ended before it was required and it remained in the United States. The 13th Airborne Division was finally inactivated on 26 February 1946 and its combat personnel were transferred to the command of the 82nd Airborne Division.

The 13th Airborne Division was the fifth airborne division to be formed in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and was officially activated on Friday the 13th of August 1943 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, under the command of <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="George%20Wesley%20Griner%2C%20Jr.">George W. Griner, Jr</a>. Only a few months after the activation of the division, however, Major General Griner was ordered to take command of the <a href="98th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">98th Infantry Division</a>, and was replaced by Major General <a href="Elbridge%20Chapman">Elbridge Chapman</a>, who would go on to command the division for the rest of the conflict. Chapman was one of the early pioneers of the American airborne concept, commanding the experimental 88th Airborne Infantry Battalion in late 1941 when he was a <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a>, before going on to take command of the 13th Airborne Division. The 88th Airborne Infantry Battalion would be renamed as the 88th Airborne Infantry Regiment, and then finally become the <a href="88th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">88th Glider Infantry Regiment</a> on 21 September 1942, forming the core of the 13th Airborne Division. When it was activated, the 13th Airborne Division was initially composed of the <a href="515th%20Parachute%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">515th Parachute Infantry Regiment</a>, the <a href="88th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">88th Glider Infantry Regiment</a> and the <a href="326th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">326th Glider Infantry Regiment</a>.

The division's shoulder patch, a winged <a href="unicorn">unicorn</a> in orange on an ultramarine blue, the branch of service colours of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a>, was approved on 2 June 1943. A gold on black "<a href="Airborne%20forces">Airborne</a>" <a href="Tabs%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army%23Airborne">tab</a> was worn above the insignia.

Between August 1943 and February 1945, the 13th Airborne Division remained in the United States and did not serve overseas or participate in any airborne operations, as it began training to become a combat-ready formation. In comparison, the <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division">82nd</a> and <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division">101st Airborne Division</a>s had been assigned as active combat formations to serve overseas in Europe, the <a href="11th%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">11th Airborne Division</a> was scheduled to be deployed to the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific Theater of Operations</a>, and the <a href="17th%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">17th Airborne Division</a> had been assigned as the United States strategic reserve formation. During this period, the activities of the division primarily involved airborne training, as well as taking part in several training exercises. However, while airborne training for the first four American airborne divisions was conducted during 1943, the 13th encountered considerable difficulties when it came to its turn for training. By the last few months of 1943 the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions had conducted airborne exercises and finished their training, and had then been transferred to Europe; to ensure the divisions could conduct airborne operations, a majority of the transport aircraft available in the United States had been sent with them, and even more were transferred to Europe as replacements after the <a href="American%20airborne%20landings%20in%20Normandy">American airborne landings in Normandy</a> in June 1944. Consequently, very few transport aircraft were available for use by the 13th, and the original training exercise for the division that had been scheduled for June 1944 had to be postponed until 17 September, and then once again until 24 September.

The divisional training exercise took place around <a href="Camp%20Mackall">Camp Mackall</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, and suffered from a number of difficulties and problems. Poor weather delayed the beginning of the exercise until the night of 25 September, and it was only then that the aircraft carrying the first three battalions of paratroopers could take off and attempt to drop the airborne troops on three separate drop zones. A combination of poor visibility, and a lack of sufficient training for the pilots of the transport aircraft, resulted in the paratroopers being dispersed widely when dropped. Only sixty-five percent of the airborne troops and equipment dropped on the first drop zone were ready for action ninety minutes later, and in the second drop zone the airborne troops were so scattered that by 10:00 the next morning the commander of the battalion only had control over twenty percent of his men. A similar number of paratroopers missed the third drop zone, although the majority were dropped in a relatively small area where they could gather. Further problems were encountered, as a plane crash killed eight paratroopers and four aircrew, and the glider-borne elements of the division due to land were delayed by poor weather. After the initial night, the exercise continued for a further three days and included a complex supply mission designed to test whether it was possible to supply an isolated battalion of airborne troops.

Overall, observers present for the exercise reported that they had been impressed with the performance of the glider-borne elements of the division. However, several noted that the training of the aircraft pilots for night formation flying and navigation was far from satisfactory. A recommendation was made that night that glider landings should be considered only when an emergency existed, and that otherwise gliders should take off during the night and land during daylight to avoid the wide dispersal of airborne troops and a decrease in efficiency. After these exercises had ended, the division continued to train, but encountered further delays. These were caused when 1,652 men were removed from the division to provide reinforcements for U.S. Airborne units in the European Theater; this drastically reduced the strength of the division and forced it to extend its training period for a further four months. After completing its training in January the division was preparing to transfer to the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific Theatre</a> in early 1945. However, the rapid advances made by German forces during the Battle of the Bulge led to the division being transferred to the European Theatre of Operations to reinforce Allied divisions already in combat.

The division arrived in the European Theater of Operations in early February, coming under the command of the <a href="First%20Allied%20Airborne%20Army">First Allied Airborne Army</a>, and Major General Chapman was informed that there was a possibility that the division would be required to conduct airborne operations during the closing stages of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>. However, the campaign in the <a href="Ardennes">Ardennes</a> ended before the division could be transported there. The next chance for the 13th to participate in an airborne operation, and to actually see combat, was in March 1945 when the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> had penetrated into Germany itself and reached the River Rhine. A few weeks before the division was to participate in a combat jump over the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> it was reorganized, after a conference by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> had decided that a more efficient composition for an airborne division was two Parachute Infantry Regiments and only a single Glider Infantry Regiment. Subsequently, the <a href="517th%20Parachute%20Infantry%20Regiment">517th Parachute Infantry Regiment</a>, a veteran unit that had served in <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Italy</a>, <a href="Operation%20Dragoon">Southern France</a> and the Ardennes, joined the division in early March, and the <a href="88th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">88th Glider Infantry Regiment</a> was combined into the <a href="326th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">326th Glider Infantry Regiment</a> that remained as the division's sole glider-based element. The 517th had recently fought during the Ardennes campaign, and had received a <a href="Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28United%20States%29">Presidential Unit Citation</a> for its actions.

The Rhine river was a formidable natural obstacle to the Allied advance, but if breached would allow the Allies access to the <a href="North%20German%20Plain">North German Plain</a> and ultimately to advance on Berlin and other major cities in Northern Germany. Following the 'Broad Front Approach' laid out by <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, the <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force">Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force</a>, it was decided to attempt to breach the Rhine in several areas. <a href="Field%20marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>, commanding the Anglo-Canadian <a href="21st%20Army%20Group">21st Army Group</a>, devised a plan to allow the forces under his command to breach the Rhine, which he titled <a href="Operation%20Plunder">Operation Plunder</a>, and which was subsequently authorized by Eisenhower. Plunder envisioned the <a href="Second%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Second Army</a>, under <a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Miles%20Dempsey">Miles C. Dempsey</a>, and the <a href="Ninth%20United%20States%20Army">U.S. Ninth Army</a>, under <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="William%20Hood%20Simpson">William Simpson</a>, crossing the Rhine at <a href="Rees%2C%20Germany">Rees</a>, <a href="Wesel">Wesel</a>, and an area south of the <a href="Lippe">Lippe</a> Canal. To ensure that the operation was a success, Montgomery insisted that an airborne component was inserted into the plans for the operation to support the amphibious assaults that would take place, which was code-named <a href="Operation%20Varsity">Operation Varsity</a>. Three airborne divisions were initially chosen to take part in Varsity, these being the <a href="6th%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 6th Airborne Division</a>, the <a href="17th%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 17th Airborne Division</a>, and finally the 13th, all of which were assigned to <a href="XVIII%20Airborne%20Corps">U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps</a>, commanded by Major General <a href="Matthew%20Ridgway">Matthew Ridgway</a>. However, it was discovered that there were only enough transport aircraft available in Europe to transport two airborne divisions into combat, and as such it was removed from Operation Varsity due to its lack of combat experience.

After its removal from Operation Varsity, the division remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to <a href="Oise">Oise</a>, France, on 3 April for supply and administrative tasks. The division was scheduled to participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was Operation Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a 'strategic airhead' in the <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a> region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that the operation would deny a large swathe of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division">82nd</a> and <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division">101st Airborne Division</a>s and the British 6th and <a href="1st%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Airborne Division</a>s. A preliminary date for 1 May was set for the operation once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating the need for the operation. Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. Operation Choker II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near <a href="Worms%2C%20Germany">Worms, Germany</a>; planning for the operation got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when the operation was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. Operation Effective was designed to land the 13th south of <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>. The operation was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a> region and making it unnecessary.

The conflict with Germany came to an end a few weeks after Operation Effective was cancelled, and shortly afterwards it was announced that the division would be redeployed to the Pacific to participate in the invasion of Japan after a brief stop-over in the United States. The deactivation of the 17th Airborne Division meant that the 13th acquired several combat units from that division to bolster it for its envisioned action in Japan. The division arrived in New York City on 23 August, but did not leave the United States before the surrender of Japan in September 1945. With the conflict at an end, the division was no longer required by the United States Army, and it was permanently inactivated at <a href="Fort%20Bragg%2C%20North%20Carolina">Fort Bragg</a>, North Carolina, on 25 February 1946, with its personnel transferred to the command of the 82nd Airborne Division.

Australian Cattle Dog

The Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of <a href="herding%20dog">herding dog</a> originally developed in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> for <a href="droving">droving</a> cattle over long distances across rough terrain. This breed is a medium-sized, short-<a href="Coat%20%28dog%29">coated</a> dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white <a href="Coat%20%28dog%29">coat</a>, which gives the appearance of a "red" or "blue" dog. 

As with dogs from other <a href="working%20dog">working breeds</a>, the Australian Cattle Dog is energetic and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both <a href="Heredity">hereditary</a> conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a <a href="lifespan">lifespan</a> of 12 to 14 years.

In the 19th century, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> cattle farmer Thomas Hall <a href="crossbreed">crossed</a> the dogs used by <a href="Drover%20%28Australian%29">drovers</a> in his parents' home county, <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, with <a href="dingo">dingo</a>es he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as <a href="Halls%20Heeler">Halls Heeler</a>s. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates. They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the <a href="Australian%20Stumpy%20Tail%20Cattle%20Dog">Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog</a>. <a href="Robert%20Kaleski">Robert Kaleski</a>, who wrote the first <a href="Breed%20standard%20%28dogs%29">standard</a> for the breed, was influential in its development.

Australian Cattle Dog has been nicknamed a "Red Heeler" or "Blue Heeler" on the basis of its colouring and practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. Dogs from a line bred in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, Australia, which were successful at shows and at <a href="Stud%20%28animal%29">stud</a> in the 1940s, were called "Queensland Heelers" to differentiate them from lines bred in New South Wales; this nickname is now occasionally applied to any Australian Cattle Dog.

The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact dog that gives the impression of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful <a href="Snout">muzzle</a>. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.

The Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or <a href="conformation%20show">show</a> purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.

The female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately at the <a href="withers">withers</a>, and the male measures about at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9. An Australian Cattle Dog in good condition weighs around .

There are two accepted <a href="Coat%20%28dog%29">coat</a> colours, red and blue, though chocolate and cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled with or without black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration is the result of black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not <a href="Merle%20%28dog%20coat%29">merle</a> colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking <a href="gene">gene</a>. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.

In addition to the primary colouration, an Australian Cattle Dog displays some patches of solid or near-solid colour. In both red and blue dogs, the most common are masks over one or both eyes, a white tip to the tail, a solid spot at the base of the tail, and sometimes solid spots on the body, though these are not desirable in dogs bred for <a href="conformation%20show">conformation show</a>s. Blue dogs can have tan midway up the legs and extending up the front to breast and throat, with tan on jaws, and tan eyebrows. Both colour forms can have a white "star" on the forehead called the "Bentley Mark", after a legendary dog owned by Tom Bentley. Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red-coated dog, including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog, and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog, called "creeping tan". The Cattle Dog has a double coat—the short, straight outer <a href="guard%20hairs">guard hairs</a> are protective in nature, keeping the elements from the dog's skin while the undercoat is short, fine and dense.
The mask consists of a black patch over one or both eyes (for the blue coat colour) or a red patch over one or both eyes (for the red coat colour). Depending on whether one or both eyes have a patch, these are called, respectively, "single" (or "half") mask and "double" (or "full") mask. Dogs without a mask are called plain-faced. Any of these are acceptable according to the breed standard. In conformation shows, even markings are preferred over uneven markings.

The breed standards of the Australian, American and Canadian <a href="kennel%20club">kennel club</a>s specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, <a href="Docking%20%28dog%29">un-docked</a> tail. There will often be a solid colour spot at the base of the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.

In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, tails are sometimes docked on working stock. The tail is not docked in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, and serves a useful purpose in increasing agility and the ability to turn quickly. The Australian Cattle Dog is a breed distinct from the <a href="Australian%20Stumpy%20Tail%20Cattle%20Dog">Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog</a>, a square-bodied dog born with a naturally "bobbed" tail. The Stumpy Tail resembles the Australian Cattle Dog, but has a taller, leaner conformation. It occasionally has a natural long thin tail, but most are born without tails.

Like many <a href="working%20dogs">working dogs</a>, the Australian Cattle Dog has high energy levels, an active mind, and a level of independence. The breed ranks 10th in <a href="Stanley%20Coren">Stanley Coren's</a> "<a href="The%20Intelligence%20of%20Dogs">The Intelligence of Dogs</a>", rated as one of the most intelligent dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in <a href="dog%20sports">dog sports</a>, <a href="Dog%20training">learning tricks</a>, or other activities that engage its body and mind.

When on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is an affectionate and playful <a href="pet%20dog">pet</a>. However, it is reserved with people it does not know and naturally cautious in new situations. Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent <a href="guard%20dog">guard dog</a> when trained for this task, and it can be socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet. It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal. By the time puppies are weaned, they should have learned that the company of people is pleasurable, and that responding to cues from a person is rewarding. The bond that this breed can create with its owner is strong and will leave the dog feeling protective towards the owner, typically resulting in the dog's never being too far from the owner's side. The Australian Cattle Dog can be the friendliest of companions although it is quick to respond to the emotions of its owners, and may defend them without waiting for a command. The ACD was originally bred to move reluctant cattle by biting, and it will bite if treated harshly. The Australian Cattle Dog's protective nature and tendency to nip at heels can be dangerous as the dog grows into an adult if unwanted behaviours are left unchecked.

While an Australian Cattle Dog generally works silently, it will <a href="Bark%20%28sound%29">bark</a> in alarm or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking can be a sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a <a href="pecking%20order">pecking order</a> can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.

Data accumulated from Council reports in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> from April to June 2013, showed that dogs identified as Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in 66 attacks, where an attack is defined as any incident where a dog rushes at, bites, harasses or chases any person or animal. <a href="Staffordshire%20Bull%20Terrier">Staffordshire Bull Terrier</a> (155 attacks), <a href="German%20Shepherd">German Shepherd</a> (89) and <a href="American%20Staffordshire%20Terrier">American Staffordshire Terrier</a> (88) were reported to be involved in more incidents. Expressed as a percentage of registered dogs, 0.1% of Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in attacks. The data gathered in 2011–2012 listed the ACD twenty-seventh in involvement in incidents ranked by percentage of dogs registered. A review of incidents in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> where a dog bit, rushed at or chased a person or animal in a public space, found that there were sixty breeds involved and the German Shepherd and German Shepherd crosses, and Australian Cattle Dog and Cattle Dog crosses accounted for 9% of incidents. Surveys of U.S. breed club members showed that both dog-directed aggression and stranger-directed aggression were higher in the ACD than the average of breeds studied, with dog-directed aggression being the more prevalent of the two aggression types. The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 79.3% for Australian Cattle Dogs. The average pass rate for all breeds is 80.4%.

Known as a "wash and wear" dog, the Australian Cattle Dog requires little grooming, and an occasional brushing is all that is required to keep the coat clean and odour-free. Even for the show ring it needs no more than wiping down with a moist cloth. It is not a year-round <a href="Moulting">shedder</a> but <a href="blowing%20the%20coat">blows its coat</a> once a year (twice in the case of <a href="Entire%20%28animal%29">intact females</a>) and frequent brushing and a warm bath during this period will contain the shedding hair. As with all dogs, regular attention to nails, ears and teeth will help avoid health problems.

In Katherine Buetow's guide to the Australian Cattle Dog, <a href="Ian%20Dunbar">Ian Dunbar</a> makes the point that while people think of <a href="dog%20training">dog training</a> as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it is a good idea to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other <a href="Working%20dog">working breeds</a>, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.

The Australian Cattle Dog demands a high level of physical activity. Like many other <a href="herding%20dog">herding dog</a> breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.

<a href="Kennel%20club">Kennel club</a>-sponsored <a href="herding">herding</a> trials with a range of events suit the driving abilities of the Cattle Dog and other upright breeds, while <a href="sheepdog%20trials">sheepdog trials</a> are more suited to the "eye" breeds such as the <a href="Border%20Collie">Border Collie</a> and <a href="Australian%20Kelpie">Australian Kelpie</a>. Herding instincts and trainability are measured at non-competitive herding tests, and basic commands are sometimes taught through herding games, where rules such as "stay", "get it" and "that'll do" are applied to fetching a ball or chasing a yard broom.

The Australian Cattle Dog was developed for its ability to encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.
Among the most popular activities for an Australian Cattle Dog is <a href="dog%20agility">dog agility</a>. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately at a distance from the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.

The Australian Cattle Dog thrives on change and new experiences, and many handlers find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in <a href="obedience%20trial">obedience competition</a>. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead it to find solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. <a href="Rally%20obedience">Rally obedience</a> offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.

Australian Cattle Dogs have been successful in a range of dog sports including <a href="weight%20pulling">weight pulling</a>, <a href="flyball">flyball</a> and <a href="schutzhund">schutzhund</a>. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as <a href="canicross">canicross</a>, <a href="disc%20dog">disc dog</a>, and <a href="skijoring">skijoring</a> or <a href="bikejoring">bikejoring</a>. It is an effective <a href="hiking">hiking</a> companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.

The Australian Cattle Dog can be put to work in a number of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a disability or are <a href="therapy%20dog">therapy dog</a>s, some work for customs agencies in <a href="Detection%20dog">drug detection</a>, some as <a href="police%20dog">police dog</a>s, others haze pest animals, such as <a href="Canada%20goose">geese</a>, for city or state agencies, and some work as <a href="Feces">scat</a>-detection dogs, tracking <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered wildlife species</a>.

In a small sample of 11 deceased dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7 years (maximum 15.9 yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41 years with a <a href="standard%20deviation">standard deviation</a> of 2.36 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13 years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named <a href="Bluey%20%28dog%29">Bluey</a>, born in 1910 and living for 29.5 years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14 years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.

The Australian Cattle Dog carries <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">recessive</a> <a href="piebald">piebald</a> <a href="allele">allele</a>s that produce white in the coat and skin and are linked to <a href="Congenital%20disorder">congenital</a> <a href="Heredity">hereditary</a> deafness, though it is possible that there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.

The Australian Cattle Dog is one of the dog breeds affected by <a href="progressive%20retinal%20atrophy">progressive retinal atrophy</a>. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the <a href="Rod%20cell">rods</a> and <a href="Cone%20cell">cones</a> in the <a href="retina">retina</a> of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an <a href="autosome">autosomal recessive trait</a> and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.

<a href="Hip%20dysplasia%20%28canine%29">Hip dysplasia</a> is not common in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their <a href="Selective%20breeding">breeding stock</a> tested. The Cattle Dog has a number of inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (<a href="spondylosis">spondylosis</a>, <a href="elbow%20dysplasia">elbow dysplasia</a>, and arthritis) and reproductive (<a href="pyometra">pyometra</a>, infertility, and <a href="false%20pregnancy">false pregnancy</a>), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and <a href="Anterior%20cruciate%20ligament%20injury">cruciate ligament tears</a> as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.

George Hall and his family arrived in the <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had established two cattle stations in the <a href="Upper%20Hunter%20Shire">Upper Hunter Valley</a>, and had begun a northward expansion into the <a href="Liverpool%20Plains">Liverpool Plains</a>, <a href="New%20England%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">New England</a> and <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced <a href="stock%20route">stock route</a>s through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in <a href="Shrubland">scrub</a>.

A <a href="droving">droving</a> dog was needed, but the colonial working dogs are understood to have been of the <a href="Old%20English%20Sheepdog">Old English Sheepdog</a> type, commonly referred to as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.

Thomas Hall crossed his Drovers Dogs with <a href="dingo">dingo</a>es he had tamed, and by 1840 was satisfied with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the <a href="Halls%20Heeler">Halls Heeler</a>s, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it is understandable that the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.
By the 1890s, the dogs had attracted the attention of the "Cattle Dog Club of Sydney", a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term "Australian Cattle Dog" to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's "heelers", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. <a href="Robert%20Kaleski">Robert Kaleski</a>, of <a href="Moorebank%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Moorebank</a>, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote "in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding ... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines". This first <a href="breed%20standard">breed standard</a> for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.

Kaleski's standard was adopted by breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into the early history of the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to <a href="Dalmatian%20%28dog%29">Dalmatian</a> and <a href="Australian%20Kelpie">Kelpie</a> infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia at the beginning of the 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of <a href="Bull%20Terrier">Bull Terrier</a> but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, <a href="information%20technology">information technology</a> enabling the manipulation of large <a href="database">database</a>s combined with advances in the understanding of canine <a href="genetics">genetics</a> has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.

Through the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls Heeler derivations were seen in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne of <a href="Booval%2C%20Queensland">Booval</a>, and these were a different population from those shown in New South Wales. "Little Logic" was bred in <a href="Rockdale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Rockdale, New South Wales</a>, however Sydney exhibitors saw "Little Logic" for the first time after the dog had been added to the "Hillview" kennels of Arch Bevis in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. The show records of "Little Logic" and his offspring created a demand in New South Wales for Queensland dogs. By the end of the 1950s, there were few Australian Cattle Dogs whelped that were not descendants of "Little Logic" and his best known son, "Logic Return". The success and popularity of these dogs led to the growth of the nickname "Queensland Heeler".

The prominence of "Little Logic" and "Logic Return" in the <a href="pedigree%20%28animal%29">pedigrees</a> of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. For some twenty years, Wooleston supplied foundation and supplementary breeding stock to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental Europe. As a result, "Wooleston Blue Jack" is ancestral to most, if not all, Australian Cattle Dogs whelped since 1990 in any country.

In the 1940s Alan McNiven, a Sydney veterinarian, introduced Dingo, Kelpie, German Shepherd, and <a href="Kangaroo%20Dog">Kangaroo Hound</a> into his breeding program; however, the Royal Agricultural Society Kennel Club (RASKC) would not register the cross breeds as Australian Cattle Dogs, even though McNiven argued they were true to conformation, colour and temperament. McNiven responded by giving his pups registration papers from dead dogs, and was consequently expelled from the RASKC and all of his dogs removed from the registry. Meanwhile, Greg Lougher, a <a href="Napa%2C%20California">Napa</a>, <a href="California">California</a> <a href="cattle%20rancher">cattle rancher</a> who met Alan McNiven while stationed in Australia during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, had imported several adults and several litters from McNiven. After his de-registration McNiven continued to export his "improved" dogs to the United States. Many U.S. soldiers who were stationed in Queensland or NSW during the War discovered the Australian Cattle Dog and took one home when they returned.

In the late 1950s a veterinarian in <a href="Santa%20Rosa%2C%20California">Santa Rosa, California</a>, Jack Woolsey, was introduced to Lougher's dogs. With his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in "Western Horsemen" stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including "Oaklea Blue Ace", "Glen Iris Boomerang" and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of <a href="Butler%2C%20Indiana">Butler</a>, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.

Australian Cattle Dogs had been classified in the "miscellaneous" category at the <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">American Kennel Club</a> (AKC) since the 1930s; to get the breed full recognition, the AKC required that a National Breed Parent Club be organised for promotion and protection of the breed. In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs and the process of establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia. The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards. The National Stock Dog Registry continued to recognise Cattle Dogs without prerequisite links to Australian registered dogs, on the condition that any dog of unknown parentage that was presented for registry would be registered as an "American Cattle Dog", and all others would still be registered as "Australian Cattle Dogs".

The breed gained official recognition from the <a href="Canadian%20Kennel%20Club">Canadian Kennel Club</a> in January 1980 after five years of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and <a href="lobbying">lobbying</a> officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and <a href="lure%20coursing">lure coursing</a>. At the end of 1980, "Landmaster Carina" was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.

The first registered Australian Cattle Dogs to arrive in the United Kingdom were two blue puppies, "Lenthal Flinton" and "Lenthal Darlot", followed in 1980 by "Landmaster Darling Red" in whelp. "Landmaster Darling Red" was imported by John and Mary Holmes, and proved to be an outstanding brood bitch. Over the next few years additional Cattle Dogs arrived in the UK from the Netherlands, Kenya, Germany and Australia, although prior to relaxation of rules regarding <a href="artificial%20insemination">artificial insemination</a>, the UK <a href="gene%20pool">gene pool</a> was limited. In 1985 an Australian Cattle Dog Society was formed and officially recognised by the Kennel Club; before this they had to compete in the category "Any Variety Not Separately Classified". Australian Cattle Dogs were competing successfully in obedience and working trials in the UK during the 1980s.

The <a href="Texas%20Heeler">Texas Heeler</a> is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the <a href="Australian%20Shepherd">Australian Shepherd</a> that was first registered with the <a href="Animal%20Research%20Foundation%20%28ARF%29">Animal Research Foundation (ARF)</a> in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without <a href="Breed%20registry">papers</a> as "Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers" since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in <a href="dog%20sports">dog sports</a>. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.

Battle of Leuthen

The Battle of Leuthen was fought on 5 December 1757, at which <a href="Frederick%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick the Great's</a> <a href="Prussian%20army">Prussian army</a> used <a href="Maneuver%20warfare">maneuver</a> and <a href="terrain">terrain</a> to decisively defeat a much larger Austrian force commanded by <a href="Prince%20Charles%20Alexander%20of%20Lorraine">Prince Charles of Lorraine</a> and <a href="Count%20Leopold%20Joseph%20von%20Daun">Count Leopold Joseph von Daun</a>. The victory ensured <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> control of <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a> during the <a href="Third%20Silesian%20War">Third Silesian War</a> (part of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>).

The battle was fought at the <a href="Prussian%20Silesia">Silesian</a> town of <a href="Lutynia%2C%20%C5%9Aroda%20%C5%9Al%C4%85ska%20County">Leuthen</a>, northwest of <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a>. By exploiting the training of his troops and his superior knowledge of the terrain, Frederick created a diversion at one end of the battlefield, and moved most of his small army behind a series of low hillocks. The surprise attack in <a href="oblique%20order">oblique order</a> on the unsuspecting Austrian flank baffled Prince Charles; the Prince took several hours to realize that the main action was to his left, and not to his right. Within seven hours, the Prussians destroyed the Austrian force, erasing any advantage the Austrians had gained throughout the campaigning in the preceding summer and autumn. Within 48 hours, Frederick had laid <a href="Siege%20of%20Breslau%20%281757%29">siege</a> to Breslau, which resulted in that city's surrender on 19–20 December.

Leuthen was the last battle at which Prince Charles commanded the Austrian Army, before his sister-in-law, Empress <a href="Maria%20Theresa">Maria Theresa</a>, appointed him as governor of the <a href="Habsburg%20Netherlands">Habsburg Netherlands</a> and placed Leopold Joseph von Daun in command of the army. The battle also established beyond doubt Frederick's military reputation in European circles; it was arguably his greatest tactical victory. After <a href="Battle%20of%20Rossbach">Rossbach</a> (5 November), the French had refused to participate further in Austria's war with Prussia; and after Leuthen (5 December), Austria could not continue it by herself.

Although the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> was a global conflict, it acquired a specific intensity in the European theater as a result of the competition between <a href="Frederick%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20Prussia">Frederick II of Prussia</a>, known as Frederick the Great, and <a href="Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Austria">Maria Theresa of Austria</a>. Their rivalry dated from 1740, when, upon her ascension, Frederick had attacked and annexed the prosperous province of <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>. The 1748 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281748%29">Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</a>, which concluded <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a> (1740–1748) between Prussia and Maria Theresa's allies, awarded Silesia to Prussia. Empress Maria Theresa had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances. She intended to regain her ascendancy in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and to reacquire Silesia. Similarly, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">France</a> sought to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. In 1754, escalating tensions between Britain and France in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> offered the Empress the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia's ever growing power. France and Austria put aside their old <a href="French%E2%80%93Habsburg%20relations">rivalry</a> to form a coalition of their own; Maria Theresa agreed that one of her daughters, <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Maria Antonia</a>, would marry the <a href="Dauphin%20of%20France">Dauphin of France</a>, and her chief ministers negotiated a military and political pact advantageous to both parties. That drove Britain to align herself with <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II</a>'s nephew, the King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>; their alliance also involved the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Hanover">Electorate of Hanover</a>, which was held in <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a> by George, along with George's and Frederick's relatives who ruled the <a href="Principality%20of%20Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a> and the <a href="Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel</a>. This series of political manoeuvrers became known as the <a href="Diplomatic%20Revolution">Diplomatic Revolution</a>.

When war broke out in 1756, Frederick overran <a href="Duchy%20of%20Saxony">Saxony</a> then campaigned in <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>. There he defeated the Austrians on 6 May 1757 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Prague%20%281757%29">Battle of Prague</a>. Learning that French forces had <a href="Invasion%20of%20Hanover%20%281757%29">invaded his ally's territory of Hanover</a>, Frederick moved west. On 5 November 1757, an infantry regiment of about 1,000 men and 1,500 of his cavalry defeated the combined French and Austrian force of 30,000 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rossbach">Battle of Rossbach</a> in a 90-minute battle. In his absence, though, the Austrians had managed to retake Silesia: the Empress's brother-in-law, <a href="Prince%20Charles%20Alexander%20of%20Lorraine">Prince Charles</a>, took the city of <a href="Schweidnitz">Schweidnitz</a> and moved on Breslau in lower Silesia.

While heading back to Silesia, Frederick learned of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Breslau%20%281757%29">fall</a> of Breslau in late November. He and his 22,000 men covered in 12 days and, at Liegnitz, joined up with the Prussian troops who had survived the fighting at Breslau. The augmented army of about 33,000 troops (with approximately 167 cannons) arrived near <a href="Lutynia%2C%20%C5%9Aroda%20%C5%9Al%C4%85ska%20County">Leuthen</a> (now Lutynia, Poland), west of Breslau, to find 66,000 Austrians in possession.

Most of <a href="Lower%20Silesia">Lower Silesia</a> is a rolling plain of fertile land. It includes black and <a href="alluvial">alluvial</a> soils near Breslau (Wrocław) and in river valleys, mixed with more sandy soils. Located between the <a href="Oder">Oder</a> river and the foot of the <a href="Sudetes">Sudeten Mountains</a>, its mild climate, fertile soils and extensive water network made it a coveted agricultural resource.

In the area northwest of Breslau, the absence of steep hills made observation of an approaching enemy easy, and the relative flatness limited hiding maneuvers. The presence of alluvial soils guaranteed relatively soft ground – not as soft as Frederick would face at <a href="Kunersdorf">Kunersdorf</a> in 1758, but soft enough to provide the occasional natural bogs to bar the passage of troops in some locations, or to muffle the sound of marching and horses' hooves. The area around Leuthen included several hamlets and villages: principally, <a href="Mroz%C3%B3w">Nippern</a>, about north; <a href="Wr%C3%B3blowice%2C%20Lower%20Silesian%20Voivodeship">Frobelwitz</a>, also to the north, about halfway between Leuthen and Nippern; <a href="G%C4%85d%C3%B3w">Gahla</a>, to the southeast; and <a href="Le%C5%9Bnica">Lissa</a>, to the east. A roadway connected the villages of <a href="B%C5%82onie%2C%20Lower%20Silesian%20Voivodeship">Borna</a>, Leuthen, and Lissa with Breslau, across the Oder river and its tributaries.
Aware of Frederick's approach, Charles and his second in command, <a href="Count%20Leopold%20Joseph%20von%20Daun">Count Leopold Joseph von Daun</a>, positioned the army facing west on a front in country of undulating plains. The Prince deployed his troops in two lines, the right wing at his northernmost point, anchored at Nippern. Leuthen served as the Austrian center. Charles established his command post there, using a church tower as his observation post, and stationing seven battalions in the village itself. The majority of Charles' forces stood on his right wing. A small advanced post stood at Borna, but with Frederick's arrival in force, they withdrew immediately to the east. The Austrian position intersected at right angles with the principal road between Borna and Breslau, passing through Frobelwitz and Lissa. He secured Nippern with eight grenadier companies and placed his cavalry at <a href="Guckerwitz">Guckerwitz</a> (present-day ). The Austrian line extended as far south as Sagschütz (present-day <a href="Zakrzyce%2C%20Lower%20Silesian%20Voivodeship">Zakrzyce</a>). There, his cavalry stood at right angles to the infantry, creating a line between Sagschütz and Gahla. The positions were secured with additional grenadiers and pickets. Troops filled villages and woods, and hastily made <a href="abatis">abatis</a> and <a href="redoubt">redoubt</a>s. Pickets guarded all communication points as well as road and path crossings. The left wing was his shortest, with cavalry placed at the far end, near a stream by the village of Gahla. Charles had an amalgamated force of Habsburg troops, including several contingents from the <a href="Military%20Frontier">military frontier</a>, and <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Empire">imperial troops</a> from the duchies <a href="Duchy%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a> and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a>.

Frederick had learned the countryside by heart on previous maneuvers. On 4 December 1757, from his position on the Schönberg, a knoll about west of Borna, he surveyed the familiar landscape with his generals. A plan emerged. In front of him, a cluster of low hills dotted the landscape along an axis approximately parallel to the Austrian line. He knew the names of the hills: Schleierberg, Sophienberg, Wachberg, Butterberg. They were hardly hills, more like hillocks, but they were high enough to provide a screen for his troops. Facing an army twice his size, he had to rely on his own army's tactical training and use the terrain to maneuver his men into optimal position. Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—fired at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire a phenomenal five, twice the rate of fire of most European armies. Only the Russians could come close to achieving this rate. The Prussians could maneuver better than any of the armies in Europe and march faster, and they had just come from a resounding success at Rossbach. His artillery could quickly deploy and redeploy to support his infantry; his cavalry, superbly trained, could maneuver and charge with horses flank to flank and riders knee to knee, while moving at a full gallop.

The foggy weather made it difficult to see positions from either side, but Frederick and his commanders used the fog to their advantage. Leaving a cavalry unit and a cluster of infantry in front of the northernmost end of the Austrian line (the Austrian right), Frederick deployed the remainder (and bulk) of his forces toward Leuthen itself; Charles saw them start their redeployment, and may have interpreted the maneuver as withdrawal, at least for a while.

At 4:00 am on that Sunday morning, Frederick moved toward the Austrian right wing in four columns, with infantry in the inner two and cavalry in the outer two columns. Using the knolls to block his movements, Frederick shifted the two columns of infantry and one of cavalry obliquely to his own right. The leftmost column of cavalry remained behind to convince the Austrians that they were still approaching directly at the latter end of the Austrian line, near Frobelwitz. Their visible distraction screened Frederick's intent, which was to execute an oblique maneuver similar to that he had used to win only weeks earlier at the Battle of Rossbach. Prince Charles, watching from his vantage point, moved his entire reserve to his right flank. This not only weakened the left flank, but also stretched his front from Leuthen past Frobelwitz and on to Nippern, extending it well beyond its original . While a single column of cavalry mesmerized Charles at his farthest right flank, the rest of the Prussians continued undetected, behind those hills, across the Austrian front, and overreached (passed) the Austrian left wing.

The Prussian infantry marched southward, remaining out of Austrian sight, behind a line of low hills. When the heads of the two superbly drilled Prussian columns—the distances between the marching platoons remaining exactly the width of each platoon's front—had passed the Austrian left flank, the columns veered left toward the enemy and continued their march until they had passed beyond the left Austrian flank. Then, on command, the platoons of the columns faced left at Lobetinz, and the whole Prussian army stood in line of battle, two to three men deep, at nearly a right angle to the weakest point of the Austrian left. Similarly, <a href="Hans%20Joachim%20von%20Zieten">Hans Joachim von Zieten</a>'s cavalry had traversed the entire Austrian front, and positioned itself at a 45-degree angle to the Austrian flank. The Prussian artillery perched the reverse slopes of the Butterberg, hidden from Austrian view but prepared to move to the crest to time their bombardment with the infantry's attack. The bulk of the repositioned Prussian army now faced the smallest component of the Austrian line. The one column of Prussian cavalry and the small reserve of infantry remaining at the Austrian far right continued to demonstrate in front of the Austrians, even moving further north, as if an attack would occur at that position.

The Austrians were astonished at the Prussian appearance on their left flank. The objective was soon clear: the Prussian infantry, now arrayed in the conventional two lines of battle, advanced on the weakest part of the Austrian line, intending to roll up the flank. The Austrian colonels on the scene did the best they could: by turning their own lines 90 degrees, they tried to take advantage of a shallow ditch facing the Prussian line. <a href="Franz%20Leopold%20von%20N%C3%A1dasdy">Franz Leopold von Nádasdy</a>, commanding the flank, asked Charles for support, a request the Prince ignored: even at late morning, with most of the Prussian army on his left flank, he still believed that any attack would come at the northern flank. Most of the men in the first Austrian line were Württembergers, Protestant troops whose willingness to fight the <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> Prussians had been called into question by the Austrian command. The Württembergers held out, maintaining steady musket fire until the mass of Prussians emerged through the haze of gunpowder. Then they ran for their lives, sweeping the <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>ns Nádasdy had deployed to support his flank with them.

The first wave of Prussian infantry, supported by Frederick's artillery now pounding away from the crest of one of the hillocks, pushed steadily toward Leuthen. Commanded by <a href="Prince%20Moritz%20of%20Anhalt-Dessau">Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau</a>, the seasoned infantry and grenadiers went into battle with 60 rounds per man, according to Prussian regulation; by the time they overwhelmed the first Austrian line, they already were out of ammunition. Nádasdy sent his own small cavalry against the Prussian grenadier column and its infantry support, but to no avail. Nádasdy withdrew his men in chaos, his troops disarrayed. Prince Charles and Daun finally realized that they had been tricked and rushed troops from the right to the left, but they had extended the front, originally about long, to almost , when they repositioned forces earlier in the day to meet Frederick's diversion. As the Austrians withdrew, the Prussian artillery raked them with <a href="enfilade">enfilade</a> fire.
The Prussian infantry and grenadiers reached the village in 40 minutes, pushing the Austrian troops into the village. Prussian grenadiers breached the wall first and stormed the church, where many of the defenders were killed. Hand-to-hand fighting raged throughout the village. <a href="Charles-Joseph%2C%207th%20Prince%20of%20Ligne">Charles-Joseph Lamoral</a>, eventually Prince de Ligne, was then a <a href="captain">captain</a> in an Austrian regiment of foot:
Our Lieutenant-Colonel fell[,] killed almost at the first; beyond this we lost our Major, and indeed all the Officers but three ... We had crossed two successive ditches, which lay in an orchard to the left of the first houses in Leuthen; and were beginning to form in front of the village. But there was no standing of it. Besides a general cannonade such as can hardly be imagined, there was a rain of case-shot upon this Battalion, of which I, as there was no Colonel left, had to take command.
Leuthen was not a big village. Troops were so closely packed they stood 30 to 100 ranks deep and the killing was terrible. Lamoral commented later that his battalion, usually some 1,000 strong, plus some Hungarians and some grenadiers who had been separated from their own companies, gave him almost (and only) 200 men. He drew them back to the height at the edge of the village, where there was a windmill around which they could shelter. Eventually, though, the Prussian Life Guards, commanded by <a href="Wichard%20Joachim%20Heinrich%20von%20M%C3%B6llendorf">Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf</a>, then a captain, broke through the village cemetery, and forced them to abandon their post.

The Austrians briefly took the advantage when they moved a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy at right angles to their original front. Frederick responded by ordering the last of his reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a barrage. Some participants said it was this barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.

The assault on the wall briefly exposed General <a href="Wolf%20Frederick%20von%20Retzow">Wolf Frederick von Retzow</a>'s infantry line. More than two hours elapsed since the Prince had ordered his cavalry back to Leuthen, but they arrived opportunely. Commanded by <a href="Joseph%20Count%20Lucchesi%20d%E2%80%99%20Averna">Joseph Count Lucchesi d’ Averna</a> the cavalry hurried to take them in the flank: a successful cavalry charge at this critical point could have turned the tide of battle. Unfortunately for the Austrians, 40 squadrons of Zieten's cavalry awaited them at Radaxdorf and charged their flank; another 30 squadrons commanded by <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20von%20Driesen">Georg Wilhelm von Driesen</a> charged their front; the <a href="Bayreuth%20Dragoons">Bayreuth Dragoons</a> hit their other flank; and the <a href="Georg%20Ludwig%20von%20Puttkamer">Puttkammer</a> Hussars charged the rear. Lucchessi was killed—decapitated by a cannonball—and his troopers were scattered. The cavalry mêlée soon swirled into the Austrian infantry line behind Leuthen, causing more confusion. Overrun by the Prussian horse, the Austrian infantry broke. First the infantry, then the cavalry retreated toward Breslau, where they crossed the <a href="Schweidnitzer%20Weistritz">Schweidnitz river</a>, then called the "Black Water".

As the smoke cleared, the Prussian infantry reformed its lines, preparing to pursue the fleeing Austrians. Snow began to fall and Frederick halted the pursuit. A few soldiers, perhaps only one, started to sing the well-known chorale, "<a href="Nun%20danket%20alle%20Gott">Nun danket alle Gott</a>" ("Now Thank We All Our God"); eventually the entire army may have joined in the song, although this story is likely <a href="Urban%20legend">apocryphal</a>. Frederick pushed toward Lissa. Refugees from the battle had filled the town, and he found the courtyard of the local castle crowded with startled Austrian officers. Reportedly, after he dismounted, he addressed them politely, "Good evening, Gentlemen, I dare say you did not expect me here. Can one get a night's lodging along with you?"

After a day of rest, on 7 December Frederick sent half his cavalry with Zieten, chasing Charles' retreating army, now heading toward <a href="Hradec%20Kr%C3%A1lov%C3%A9">Königgrätz</a> by <a href="%C5%9Awidnica">Schweidnitz</a>; they captured another 2,000 men and baggage. With the rest of his army, Frederick marched on Breslau. By chasing Charles' army into Bohemia, the Prussians guaranteed the isolation of the Allied garrison holding Breslau. The Austrian general left in command of the city, Lieutenant Field Marshal <a href="Soloman%20Sprecher%20von%20Bernegg">Salman Sprecher von Bernegg</a>, had a combined force of French and Austrian men, 17,000 strong. Breslau itself was a well-fortified city of walls and moats. The Austrians were determined to hold Breslau, not only because losing it would cost them control of Silesia and considerable diminution of prestige, but also for the immense quantities of stores the city held. The Austrian commander, recognizing his grim plight, posted placards on gallows and poles throughout the city, warning that anyone who spoke of surrender would be hanged immediately. On 7 December, Frederick laid <a href="Siege%20of%20Breslau%20%281757%29">siege</a> to the city and the future of Austrian control of Breslau and the region looked grim: indeed, Breslau surrendered on 19–20 December.

Out of an army of approximately 66,000 men, the Austrians lost 22,000, including 3,000 dead, 7,000 wounded, and an astonishing 12,000 captured. Of the dead and wounded, Austrian demographer and historian <a href="Gaston%20Bodart">Gaston Bodart</a> estimated that almost five percent were officers; he also placed such other losses as capture and desertion at 17,000, almost 26 percent. Charles lost entire regiments, either scattered in the first attacks or overrun at the end; they simply dissolved in the waves of Prussian blue coats. The Prussians also captured 51 standards and 116 of the 250 Austrian cannons. Of the Prussian army of 36,000, Frederick lost 6,344, including 1,141 dead, 5,118 wounded and 85 captured. He lost none of his artillery. Despite the victory, its cost was high: Frederick lost one fifth of the men he had taken into battle, including two of his major generals.

The battle presented a severe blow to Austrian morale. The army had been soundly beaten by an army half its size, with fewer guns, and tired after a long march over 12 days. Charles and his second in command, Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, sank "in the depths of despondency", and the Prince could not fathom what had happened. Charles had a mixed-to-poor record against Frederick in past encounters, but he had never fared so badly as at Leuthen. After this crushing defeat, Maria Theresa replaced him with Daun; Charles retired from military service and later served as the governor of the <a href="Habsburg%20Netherlands">Habsburg Netherlands</a>. The Austrians also learned some lessons, such as not to fight the Prussians in open fields; they had to choose their own ground for battle, and they employed this lesson in the future.

Frederick had benefited from an obliging enemy. First, Charles saw what he wanted to see regarding the principal attack instead of using his efficient light cavalry to figure out what the Prussians really intended. Frederick commented later that a lone patrol could have uncovered the truth. The cavalry he had left demonstrating in front of the northernmost position of the Austrian line was simply a screen, a diversion, to hide his real movements. Second, the Austrians obliged him by their failure to post pickets on their unprotected flank south of Leuthen. Nádasdy's omission of outposts on his open flank south of Leuthen was a surprising failure for a man with his long years of experience against the Prussians; he should have considered the possibility of an attack from an unexpected direction because this was Frederick's "modus operandi." Third, even when confronted with the attack on his left, the diversion on the right flank near Frobelwitz continued to mesmerize Charles. By the time the Prince moved cavalry to support the faltering troops south of, and in, Leuthen, they had too far to travel in too little time.

The battle of Leuthen was Frederick's greatest victory so far, perhaps his greatest tactical masterpiece ever, and showed Europeans the superiority of Prussian infantry. In one day, Frederick wiped out the victories the Austrians had achieved earlier in the year at Breslau and Schweidnitz, and the inroads the Austrians had made into reclamation of Silesia. The battle also demonstrated 18th century linear tactics at their best. Furthermore, Frederick had learned some valuable lessons at the Battles <a href="Battle%20of%20Prague%20%281757%29">of Prague</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Kolin">of Kolin</a>, where his infantry had run out of ammunition and lost the initiative. At Leuthen, ammunition wagons moved with the advancing lines of grenadiers and infantry battalions. Troops could be resupplied quickly, without losing their momentum. Consequently, although some infantrymen fired as many as 180 rounds, the advance never bogged down for lack of ammunition. The Prussian cavalry successfully protected the flanks, especially important with Nádasdy's assault on the Prussian grenadiers at the village church, and provided tactically important charges, which eventually turned the defeat into a rout. Finally, Frederick's redoubtable <a href="horse%20artillery">horse artillery</a>, sometimes called the flying artillery for its ability to move rapidly, maintained its fire and kept pace with the army; the artillery deployed and redeployed its guns as needed; the distinctive bellow of the 12-pounders, sometimes called "Brummers", heightened Prussian morale and wrought havoc on the Austrians'.

The victory also changed the attitude of Frederick's enemies. Before the battle, he was often referred to in unflattering, even demeaning, ways; after Leuthen, he was widely called the King of Prussia, in both polite and general (popular) circles. This victory, plus the one at <a href="Battle%20of%20Rossbach">Rossbach</a>, earned for Frederick some respect and fear that even his most bitter of enemies held for the rest of the war and the subsequent peace. Furthermore, Leuthen, combined with the earlier Rossbach, in all probability saved Prussia from extinction. A half century later, Napoleon called it "a masterpiece of movements, maneuvers and resolution."

A memorial erected in 1854 honored the Prussian army at Leuthen. Frederick's great-great nephew, King <a href="Frederick%20William%20IV">Frederick William IV</a> ordered a victory column with a gilded goddess of victory at <a href="Hajduki%20Nyskie">Heidau</a>— southeast of Lissa. The <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> architect <a href="Friedrich%20August%20St%C3%BCler">Friedrich August Stüler</a> provided the design for the monument, and <a href="Christian%20Daniel%20Rauch">Christian Daniel Rauch</a> created the goddess of victory. The sculptor <a href="Heinrich%20Menzel">Heinrich Menzel</a> from Neisse constructed the column in his workshop, in local white-gray stone. <a href="Moritz%20Geiss">Moritz Geiss</a> executed the plinth and the goddess in zinc casting and gilded the statue <a href="Victoria%20%28mythology%29">Victoria</a> for better effect.

Battle of Hochkirch

The Battle of Hochkirch took place on 14 October 1758, during the <a href="Third%20Silesian%20War">Third Silesian War</a> (part of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>). After several weeks of maneuvering for position, an Austrian army of 80,000 commanded by <a href="Lieutenant%20Field%20Marshal">Lieutenant Field Marshal</a> <a href="Count%20Leopold%20Joseph%20von%20Daun">Leopold Josef Graf Daun</a> surprised the Prussian army of 30,000–36,000 commanded by <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a>. The Austrian army overwhelmed the Prussians and forced a general retreat. The battle took place in and around the village of <a href="Hochkirch">Hochkirch</a>, east of <a href="Bautzen">Bautzen</a>, <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>.

Historians generally consider the battle as among Frederick's greatest blunders. Contrary to the advice of his subordinates, he refused to believe that the typically cautious Austrian commander Leopold von Daun would bring his troops into battle. The Austrian force surprised his army in a pre-dawn attack. Over 30 percent of Frederick's army was destroyed; five generals were killed and he lost his artillery park and a vast amount of supplies. Although Daun had scored a complete surprise, his attempt to exploit this with a pursuit of the retreating Prussians was unsuccessful. He allowed the force to escape, unite with another corps in the vicinity, and regain the momentum over the winter.

Although the Seven Years War was a global conflict, it took a specific intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a> (1740–1748). The 1748 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281748%29">Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</a> gave <a href="Frederick%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20Prussia">Frederick II of Prussia</a>, known as Frederick the Great, the prosperous province of <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>. Empress <a href="Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Austria">Maria Theresa of Austria</a> had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> as well as recovering the Silesian province. In 1754, escalating tensions between Britain and France in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> offered France an opportunity to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. Seeing the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia's growing power, Austria put aside its old <a href="French%E2%80%93Habsburg%20relations">rivalry</a> with France to form a new coalition. Britain aligned herself with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>; this alliance drew in not only the British king's European territories held in <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a>, including Hanover, but also those of his relatives in the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a> and the <a href="Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel</a>. This series of political maneuvers became known as the <a href="Diplomatic%20Revolution">Diplomatic Revolution</a>.

At the outset of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, the course of the war had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia achieved spectacular victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Rossbach">Rossbach</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Leuthen">Leuthen</a>, and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria. The Prussians then pressed south into Austrian <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>. In April 1758, Prussia and Britain concluded the <a href="Anglo-Prussian%20Convention">Anglo-Prussian Convention</a> in which the British committed to pay Frederick an <a href="Golden%20Cavalry%20of%20St%20George">annual subsidy</a> of £670,000. Britain also dispatched 7,000–9,000 troops to reinforce the army of Frederick's brother-in-law, the <a href="Duke%20Ferdinand%20of%20Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a>. Ferdinand evicted the French from Hanover and <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a> and re-captured the port of <a href="Emden">Emden</a> in March 1758; he crossed the Rhine, causing general alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Krefeld">Battle of Krefeld</a> and the brief occupation of <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, successful maneuvering of larger French forces required him to withdraw across the Rhine.

While Ferdinand kept the French occupied, Prussia had to contend with Sweden, Russia, and Austria. There remained a possibility that Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a> to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a> to Poland or <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>: for Prussia, this represented an entirely nightmarish scenario. By 1758, Frederick was concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. East of the <a href="Oder%20river">Oder river</a> in Brandenburg-<a href="Neumark">Neumark</a>, a Prussian army of 35,000 men fought a Russian army of 43,000 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zorndorf">Battle of Zorndorf</a> on 25 August 1758. Both sides suffered heavy casualties but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tornow">Battle of Tornow</a> a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had reached a draw. None of Prussia's enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia's heartland.

In September and early October 1758, Lieutenant Field Marshal <a href="Count%20Leopold%20Joseph%20von%20Daun">Count Leopold Joseph von Daun</a> and his 80,000-man army camped near the town of <a href="Stolpen">Stolpen</a>. They had covered the from <a href="G%C3%B6rlitz">Görlitz</a> in 10 days. Frederick had left half of his army in Pomerania near Zorndorf to make sure the Russians stayed on the defensive, and rushed south— in seven days—with the remainder of his army to confront Daun in <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>. Upon arrival, Frederick announced that he and his army, now totaling 45,000, were ready to knock Daun's head off. He referred to Daun as "die dicke Exzellenz" (the fat Excellency).

There, between <a href="Bautzen">Bautzen</a> and <a href="L%C3%B6bau">Löbau</a>, Frederick and Daun played their game of cat and mouse. Frederick had tried several times to draw the Austrians out of Stolpen into a battle: Daun, who seldom attacked unless he had a perfect position, had refused the bait. Frederick and his army had marched within of the Austrians, but Daun had pulled his army away, again, refusing to be drawn into battle. Upon the Austrian withdrawal, Frederick sent troops in pursuit; these were driven off by Daun's rearguard. In frustration, Frederick shadowed Daun by maneuvering his army toward Bautzen; while there, Frederick learned that Daun had established a camp about east of him in the hills directly east of Hochkirch. He dispatched an entire Prussian corps commanded by General <a href="Wolf%20Frederick%20von%20Retzow">Wolf Frederick von Retzow</a> to those hills in late September; by early October, Retzow's corps was within of the Austrians. Frederick ordered Retzow to take the hill that commanded the area, called Strohmberg. When Retzow arrived there, he discovered that the Austrians already had laid possession with a strong force. Retzow chose not to attack; Frederick had him removed from command and arrested.

Hochkirch stands on a slight rise in terrain, surrounded by mildly undulating plains; the village can be seen from the distance, except from the south, where several heights abut the village and block visibility. The church stands near the highest point, granting visibility east, west and north.

On 10 October, Frederick marched on Hochkirch and established his own camp, extending from the town north, to the edge of the forest at the base of the Kuppritzerberg. Frederick did not plan to stay in the small village for an extended period, only until provisions—mostly bread—arrived from Bautzen, and then they would move eastward. To the east of the village, less than distant, the Austrians' presence on the hilltop increasingly made the Prussians—except Frederick—anxious about an attack. Frederick ignored the warnings of his officers, especially his trusted Field Marshal <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Keith">James Keith</a>, who thought staying in the village was suicide. "If the Austrians leave us unmolested in this camp," Keith told the king, "they deserve to be hanged." Frederick reportedly replied, "it is to be hoped they are more afraid of us than of the gallows."

Instead of worrying about a possible Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an outpost of nine battalions with artillery support; the principal purpose of the infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch. He did not believe any attack would occur; Daun's army had been dormant in recent months, refusing to be drawn into battles.

The Imperial court in Vienna criticized Daun for his failure to act; the Empress and her ministers worried that the Russians and the French would drop out of the coalition if there were no action. Daun, a cautious and diligent commander, took his time to make his plans. The Strohmberg, one of the heights abutting Hochkirch, anchored Daun's left flank, and he deployed the remainder of his force southward across the road between Bautzen and Loebau. This also gave him control of an important junction between Görlitz in the east and <a href="Zittau">Zittau</a> in the south. He anchored the far right end of his line in another wooded hill south of the road, the Kuppritzerberg, on the opposite side of the hill from the Prussians. Despite the proximity, the Prussians neither increased their security nor deployed their troops in response to the Austrian presence. The cautious Daun also took into account that his men were eager to fight a battle and that they outnumbered the Prussians by more than two-to-one. His men made a great production of hewing the trees in a nearby forest, action which Frederick interpreted as efforts to create field works, not, as it was actually intended, to build a road through the thick wood. Daun also had discovered a secret weakness of Frederick's. His own personal secretary had been sending Frederick information on Daun's plans, secreted in deliveries of eggs; upon discovering this, Daun promised the man his life in return for his cooperation in continuing to send Frederick misinformation. Daun's plan, which he had kept secret, was an early morning sweep through the woods with 30,000 specially picked troops, around Frederick's flank, to <a href="encirclement">enclose</a> him. The Prussian army would be asleep, both literally and figuratively, when the Austrian army struck.

Daun's battle plan took the Prussians completely by surprise. The east side of Frederick's line was the first to be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, the <a href="Croatia">Croats</a> cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents bled to death, in what today is still called "Blutgasse", or Blood Alley.

Initially, Frederick thought the sounds of the battle were either an outpost <a href="skirmish">skirmish</a> or the Croats, who apparently started their days with regular firing of their weapons. His staff had trouble rousing him from bed, but he was soon alerted when Prussian cannons, captured by the Austrians, started to fire on his own camp.

While his adjutants were trying to wake Frederick, his generals, most of whom had not slept and had kept their horses saddled and weapons ready, organized the Prussian resistance. Keith had anticipated an Austrian attack and organized a slashing counterattack on the Austrians holding the Prussian battery. <a href="Prince%20Moritz%20of%20Anhalt-Dessau">Maurice von Anhalt-Dessau</a>, another of Frederick's able generals, funneled the awakening troops to Keith. Combined, this action briefly retook the Prussian battery south of Hochkirch, but they could not hold it in the face of Austrian muskets. At 6:00, three more Prussian regiments rushed Hochkirch itself, while Prince Maurice continued directing stragglers and reinforcements into the counterattack. The Prussians swept through the village, out the other side, and fell on the battery at bayonet point. By that point, though, most Prussian order and cohesion had been lost. The Austrians, supported by their appropriated Prussian guns, which had not been <a href="Touch%20hole">spiked</a>, wrought havoc on the attackers. Keith was hit mid-body and knocked out of his saddle, dead as he fell.

When the early morning fog had lifted, the soldiers could distinguish friend from foe. Prussian cavalry, which had remained saddled and ready throughout the night, launched a series of regimental counterattacks. A battalion of the 23rd Infantry charged, but withdrew as it was surrounded flank and rear. The church yard, a walled stronghold, diverted the Austrians; Major <a href="Siegmund%20Moritz%20William%20von%20Langen">Siegmund Moritz William von Langen</a>'s musketeers of the 19th regiment held it with determination and provided safety for retreating Prussians. Most importantly, Langen bought time.

By this time fully awake, Frederick hoped that the battle could be retrieved and returned to the village to take command. At 7:00, finding his infantry milling about in the village, Frederick ordered them to advance, sending reinforcements commanded by Prince <a href="Frederick%20Francis%20of%20Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Francis of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a>, his brother-in-law, with them. As Francis approached the village, Austrian cannon-fire sheared his head off his shoulders; his troops faltered, demoralized by the sight of the prince's headless body atop his spooked horse. Frederick himself helped to rally Francis' shaken troops.

By 7:30, the Austrians had retaken the burning village, but their hold on it was tenuous. Keith and Prince Francis were dead. General <a href="Karl%20Ferdinand%20von%20Hagen">Karl von Geist</a> lay among the injured. Maurice von Anhalt-Dessau had been injured and captured. By 9:00, the Prussian left wing began to collapse under the weight of the Austrian assault; the last Prussian battery was overrun and turned against them. Led by the King, they advanced against five Austrian companies of <a href="hussar">hussar</a>s commanded by <a href="Franz%20Moritz%20von%20Lacy">Franz Moritz von Lacy</a>. Within a dozen yards of the Austrian line of infantry, Frederick's horse was killed. His own hussars rescued him from capture.

As he withdrew, Frederick established a fighting line north of the village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were out of range of the Austrian army by the time they had reorganized. <a href="Hans%20Joachim%20von%20Zieten">Hans Joachim von Zieten</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Seydlitz">Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz</a>, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.

In five hours, Frederick lost 9,400 of the 30,000 men he brought into the battle, more than 30 percent of his army, including five generals, 101 guns, and nearly all the tents. Frederick required his generals to set an example of courage and leadership: they led from the front. The same rate of attrition applied throughout the officer corps, which lost half of its strength in the first three campaigns of the war. In addition to human losses, they lost valuable horses and draft animals, 70 munitions wagons, and, a blow to morale, 28 <a href="Colour%20%28flag%29">flags</a>, and two <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">standards</a>. On the positive side, Retzow's corps of about 6,000 men, which had not arrived in time to participate in the fighting, remained intact; Frederick had pulled his troops together for an orderly retreat; and the King retained the confidence of his soldiers.

The Austrians suffered casualties and losses at about three percent. According to the Austrian historian <a href="Gaston%20Bodart">Gaston Bodart</a>, there were fewer troops participating than most modern sources suggest: he places Austrian participants at 60,000, losses in casualties at 5,400, approximately 8.3 percent, but other losses (to injuries, desertions and capture) at about 2,300, or 3.6 percent. They also lost three standards. Some modern historians place the overall losses higher, at 7,300. Notification of the battle arrived in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> during the celebration of the <a href="Maria%20Theresa">Empress</a>'s <a href="name%20day">name day</a>, to the delight of Maria Theresa and her court, gathered at <a href="Sch%C3%B6nbrunn%20Palace">Schönbrunn Palace</a>. Daun received a <a href="blessed%20sword%20and%20hat">blessed sword and hat</a> from <a href="Pope%20Clement%20XIII">Pope Clement XIII</a>, a reward usually granted for defeating "<a href="infidel">infidel</a>s". The Empress eventually created an endowment of 250,000 <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20gulden">gulden</a> for Daun and his heirs.

For Daun and Lacy, it was a victory of mixed emotions; upon the discovery of Keith's body in the village church, they both broke down in tears of grief. Keith had been the best friend of Lacy's <a href="Peter%20Lacy">father</a> during his service in Russia. Similarly, the grief Frederick felt at the loss of one of his greatest friends was intense. His grief was added to when he learned a couple of days later that his beloved elder sister, <a href="Wilhelmine%20of%20Prussia%2C%20Margravine%20of%20Brandenburg-Bayreuth">Wilhelmine</a>, who had shared their father's wrath in 1730 during the <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great%23Crown%20Prince">Katte affair</a>, had died on the same day. He sulked in his tent for a week. At one point, he showed his librarian a small box of <a href="opium">opium</a> capsules, 18 in total, that he could use to "journey to a dark place from which there was no return." Despite having rescued his army from catastrophe, he remained depressed and suicidal.

Although Frederick demonstrated good leadership by rallying his troops against the surprise attack, Hochkirch is considered one of his worst losses, and it badly shook his equanimity. Andrew Mitchell, the British envoy who was with them, and normally wrote positively about Frederick, attributed Frederick's loss to the contempt he had for Daun's supposedly cautious nature and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not agree with what he imagined was true: according to Mitchell, there was no one to blame but himself. That winter, Mitchell described the 46-year-old Frederick as "an old man lacking half of his teeth, with greying hair, without gaiety or spark or imagination." Frederick suffered from <a href="gout">gout</a> and influenza, and refused to change his uniform, which was moth-eaten and covered in food and snuff stains.

However, the situation could have been far worse for Frederick. The fabled discipline of his army held up: once the Prussians were out of the burning village, unit cohesion and discipline returned. Their discipline neutralized any strategic advantage the Austrians could have gained, and Daun's hesitation nullified the rest. Instead of following Frederick, or cutting off Retzow's division, which had not participated in the battle, Daun withdrew to the heights and positions he had occupied before the battle, so that his men might have a good rest under blankets after the fatigue of the day. After staying there for six days, they marched out in stealth to take up a new position between <a href="Belgern">Belgern</a> and <a href="Jesewitz">Jesewitz</a>, while Frederick remained at <a href="Dobersch%C3%BCtz">Doberschütz</a>. Ultimately, the costly Austrian victory decided nothing.

The Austrian failure to follow up with Frederick meant that the Prussians lived to fight another day. Daun took great criticism for this, but not from the people who mattered the most, the Empress and her minister <a href="Wenzel%20Anton%2C%20Prince%20of%20Kaunitz-Rietberg">Kaunitz</a>. For Frederick, instead of having the war decided at Hochkirch, he had the opportunity over the winter to rebuild his army. In two years of fighting (1756–1757) Frederick had lost over 100,000 soldiers to death, wounds, capture, disease and desertion. By Hochkirch, many regiments were only half-disciplined. In the winter after Hochkirch, he could only replace his soldiers with untrained men, many of whom would be foreigners and prisoners-of-war; he would be starting 1759 with a half-trained army of recruits, and seasoned soldiers who were exhausted by the slaughter. The only way he could hire men would be with British gold.

Frederick's reputation for aggressiveness meant he could still terrify the Austrians simply by showing up. On 5 November, the anniversary of his great victory at Rossbach, Frederick marched toward <a href="Neisse">Neisse</a>, causing the Austrians to abandon their siege. A few weeks later, as Frederick marched further west, Daun took the entire army into winter quarters in Bohemia. Consequently, despite major losses, at the end of the campaign year, Frederick remained in possession of Saxony and Silesia, and his name remained feared in at least that part of Europe.

A granite monument, inlaid with a bronze plaque, was erected by the inhabitants of Hochkirch in memory of "Generalfeldmarschall Jacob von Keith" and his achievement. The inscription reads "Suffering, Misery, Death."

Battle of Kunersdorf

The decisive Battle of Kunersdorf occurred on 12 August 1759 near <a href="Kunowice">Kunersdorf (Kunowice)</a>, immediately east of <a href="Frankfurt%20%28Oder%29">Frankfurt an der Oder</a> (the second largest city in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>). Part of the <a href="Third%20Silesian%20War">Third Silesian War</a> and the wider <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, the battle involved over 100,000 men. An Allied army commanded by <a href="Pyotr%20Saltykov">Pyotr Saltykov</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Gideon%20von%20Laudon">Ernst Gideon von Laudon</a> that included 41,000 <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russians</a> and 18,500 <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austrians</a> defeated <a href="Frederick%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick the Great's</a> army of 50,900 Prussians.

The terrain complicated battle tactics for both sides, but the Russians and the Austrians, having arrived in the area first, were able to overcome many of its difficulties by strengthening a causeway between two small ponds. They had also devised a solution to Frederick's deadly "modus operandi", the <a href="oblique%20order">oblique order</a>. Although Frederick's troops initially gained the upper hand in the battle, the sheer number of Allied troops gave the Russians and Austrians an advantage. By afternoon, when the combatants were exhausted, fresh Austrian troops thrown into the fray secured the Allied victory.

This was the only time in the Seven Years' War that the Prussian Army, under Frederick's direct command, disintegrated into an undisciplined mass. With this loss, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, only away, lay open to assault by the Russians and Austrians. Saltykov and Laudon did not follow up on the victory. Only 3,000 soldiers from Frederick's original 50,000 remained with him after the battle, although many more had simply scattered and rejoined the army within a few days. This represented the penultimate success of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> under <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Russia">Elizabeth of Russia</a> and was arguably Frederick's worst defeat.

Although the Seven Years' War was a global conflict, it took on a specific intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a> (1740–1748). The 1748 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281748%29">Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</a> gave <a href="Frederick%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20Prussia">Frederick II of Prussia</a>, known as Frederick the Great, the prosperous province of <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a> as a consequence of the <a href="First%20Silesian%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Silesian%20War">Second Silesian War</a>s. Empress <a href="Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Austria">Maria Theresa of Austria</a> had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> as well as reacquiring Silesia. In 1754, escalating tensions between <a href="United%20Kingdom">Great Britain</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">France</a> in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> offered France an opportunity to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. Recognizing the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia's growing power, the Empress put aside the old <a href="French%E2%80%93Habsburg%20relations">rivalry</a> with France to form a new coalition. Faced with this turn of events, Britain aligned herself with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>; this alliance drew in not only the British king's territories held in <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a>, including <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, but also those of his and Frederick's relatives in the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a> and the <a href="Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel</a>. This series of political maneuvers became known as the <a href="Diplomatic%20Revolution">Diplomatic Revolution</a>.

At the outset of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, the course of the war had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had achieved spectacular victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Rossbach">Rossbach</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Leuthen">Leuthen</a> and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.
The Prussians then pressed south into Austrian <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>. In April 1758, Prussia and Britain concluded the <a href="Anglo-Prussian%20Convention">Anglo-Prussian Convention</a> in which the British committed an <a href="Golden%20Cavalry%20of%20St%20George">annual subsidy</a> of £670,000. Britain also dispatched 7,000–9,000 troops to reinforce the army of Frederick's brother-in-law, <a href="Duke%20Ferdinand%20of%20Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a>. Ferdinand evicted the French from Hanover and <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a> and re-captured the port of <a href="Emden">Emden</a> in March 1758; he crossed the Rhine with his own forces, causing general alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Krefeld">Battle of Krefeld</a> and his brief occupation of <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, the successful maneuvering of larger French forces required him to withdraw across the Rhine.

While Ferdinand kept the French occupied, Prussia had to contend with Sweden, Russia, and Austria, all of which wanted to carve out a piece of Prussia for themselves. Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a> to Sweden, <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a> to Saxony, and <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a> to Poland or Russia: an entirely nightmarish scenario. By 1758, Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the <a href="Oder%20river">Oder river</a> in Brandenburg-<a href="Neumark">Neumark</a>, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zorndorf">Battle of Zorndorf</a>, on 25 August 1758 a Prussian army of 35,000 men fought a Russian army of 43,000. Both sides suffered heavy casualties but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tornow">Battle of Tornow</a> a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army, but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had resulted in a draw. None of Prussia's enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia's heartland. The Austrian Feldmarshalleutnant <a href="Count%20Leopold%20Joseph%20von%20Daun">Leopold Josef Graf Daun</a> could have ended the war in October at <a href="Battle%20of%20Hochkirch">Hochkirch</a>, but he failed to follow up on his victory with a determined pursuit of Frederick's retreating army. This allowed Frederick time to recruit a new army over the winter.

By 1759, Prussia had reached a strategic <a href="defense%20%28military%29">defensive</a> position; Russian and Austrian troops surrounded Prussia, although not quite at the borders of <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>. Upon leaving winter quarters in April 1759, Frederick assembled his army in <a href="Lower%20Silesia">Lower Silesia</a>; this forced the main <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> army to remain in its staging area in <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>. The Russians, however, shifted their forces into western Poland-Lithuania, a move that threatened the Prussian heartland, potentially <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> itself. Frederick countered by sending <a href="Generalleutnant">Generalleutnant</a> <a href="Friedrich%20August%20von%20Finck">Friedrich August von Finck</a>'s army corps to contain the Russians. Finck's corps was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kay">Battle of Kay</a> on 23 July. Subsequently, <a href="Pyotr%20Saltykov">Pyotr Saltykov</a> and the Russian forces advanced west to occupy <a href="Frankfurt%20an%20der%20Oder">Frankfurt an der Oder</a>, Prussia's second largest city, on 31 July (on Germany's border with present-day <a href="Poland">Poland</a>). There he ordered entrenchment of their camp to the east, near Kunersdorf. To make matters worse for the Prussians, an Austrian corps commanded by Feldmarshalleutnant <a href="Ernst%20Gideon%20von%20Laudon">Ernst Gideon von Laudon</a> joined Saltykov on 3–5 August. King Frederick rushed from <a href="Electorate%20of%20Saxony">Saxony</a>, took over the remnants of Generalleutnant <a href="Carl%20Heinrich%20von%20Wedel">Carl Heinrich von Wedel</a>'s contingent at <a href="M%C3%BCllrose">Müllrose</a> and moved toward the <a href="Oder">Oder</a> River. By 9 August, he had 49,000–50,000 troops, enhanced by Finck's defeated corps, and <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281726%E2%80%931802%29">Prince Henry of Prussia</a>'s corps moving from the <a href="Lausitz">Lausitz</a> region.

The terrain surrounding Kunersdorf suited itself better to defense than offense. Between the Frankfurt dam, a long earthen <a href="bulwark">bulwark</a> that helped to contain the Oder river, and to the north of Kunersdorf itself stretched a line of <a href="hillock">knolls</a>; Judenberge (Jews Hill), Mühlberge (Mill Hill) and Walkberge (also spelled Walckberge). None was more than high. The hillocks were steeper on the north side than the south, but bounded by a marshy, boggy meadow called the Elsbusch, or the Alder wasteland. East of Kunersdorf and the Walkberge, the Hühner Fliess ("Fliess" means <a href="watercourse">running water</a>) was joined by another stream that tumbled between two more hillocks. Past the Walkberge and beyond the Hühner stood two more promontories at <a href="Drzecin">Trettin</a>.

Several ravines intersected the ridge of hillocks: starting at the northeastern end, the Bäckergrund joined the Hühner Fleiss. Just east of the Walkberge a small ravine separated the Walkberge from the Mühlberge. Another narrow roadway cut through the Mühlberge ridge, then a second narrow depression, known as the Kuhgrund (cow hollow), lay west of that. Beyond the Kuhgrund, the ground rose again, then dipped into a fourth hollow in which lay a Jewish settlement known as a <a href="shtetl">shtetl</a>, and the ground rose into the Judenberge; from this point, one could overlook most of Frankfurt and its suburbs. To the southeast lay a variety of small promontories, called the Grosser- and Kleiner- Spitzberge. Like the northwest side of the ridge, this ground was covered with small ponds, streams, marshy fields, and broad meadows. Natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—would restrict wide movements on some of the terrain. To the east and north of the entire landscape lay the <a href="Rzepin%23Rzepin%20Forest">Forest of Reppen</a>. Here the ground itself was sandy and unstable. The scrub forests were threaded with streams, springs, and bogs of all kinds.

Sources vary greatly on the relative strength of the Russian and Austrian armies. Saltykov had started the summer with a force of about 60,000 men; he had lost close to 4,000 at the Battle of Kay. Laudon had been detached from the main Austrian army with 22–24,000 men, and sent north to support the Russian cause. A portion of the Russian force remained in Frankfurt as the Allied advanced guard. Saltykov had expected the Austrian commander-in-chief's entire army to arrive; instead a mere wing under Laudon's command came to his aid. Their collaboration was complicated by their personalities. Neither Laudon nor Saltykov had great command of <a href="Operational%20level%20of%20war">operational arts</a>. Saltykov did not like foreigners; Laudon thought Saltykov was inscrutable. Neither liked conversing through translators, and both mistrusted each other's intentions.

Laudon wanted a fight, so he swallowed his differences and joined the Russians in building fortifications. Saltykov established his troops on a strong position from which to receive the Prussian attack, concentrating his force in the center, which he calculated was the best way to counter-act any attempt by Frederick to deploy his deadly <a href="oblique%20order">oblique order</a>. Saltykov entrenched himself in a position running from the Judenberge through the Grosser Spitzberge to the Mühlberge, creating a bristling line of fortifications, and faced his troops to the northwest; the Judenberge, most heavily fortified, fronted what he believed would be Frederick's approach. He and the Austrian troops were stretched along the ridge that ran from the outskirts of Frankfurt to just north of the village of Kunersdorf. Anticipating that Frederick would rely on his cavalry, the Russians effectively negated any successful cavalry charge by using fallen trees to break up the ground on the approaches.

Saltykov had little concern about the extreme northwestern face of the ridge, which was steep and fronted by the marshy Elsbruch, but a few of the Austrian contingents faced northwest as a precaution. He expected Frederick to attack him from the west, from Frankfurt, and from the Frankfurt outer city. The Russians constructed <a href="redans">redans</a> and <a href="Fl%C3%A8che%20%28fortification%29">flèche</a> to protect all the potentially weak points of their fortifications; they built <a href="glacis">glacis</a> to cover the most shallow of the hills, and <a href="Counterscarp">scarps</a> and <a href="counterscarp">counterscarp</a>s to protect seemingly weak points. <a href="Abatis">Abatis</a> not only littered the hillsides, but dotted flat ground. By 10 August, his scouts had told him that Frederick was at the far western edge of Frankfurt. Accordingly, Saltykov took everything he could from the city by way of sustenance, all oxen, sheep, chickens, produce, wine, beer, in a flurry of ransacking.
While Saltykov plundered the city and prepared for Frederick's assault from the west, the Prussians reached <a href="Reitwein">Reitwein</a>, some north of Frankfurt on 10 August, and built pontoon bridges during the night. Frederick crossed the Oder in the night and the next morning, and moved southward toward Kunersdorf; the Prussians established a staging area near <a href="G%C3%B3rzyca%2C%20Lubusz%20Voivodeship">Göritz</a> (also spelled Gohritz on the old maps), about north-northeast of Kunersdorf late on 11 August with about 50,000 men; of these, 2,000 were deemed unfit for service and stayed behind to guard the baggage.

Frederick conducted a perfunctory reconnaissance of his enemy's position, accompanied by a forest ranger and an officer who had previously been stationed in Frankfurt. He also consulted a peasant who, though garrulous, was uninformed about military needs: the peasant told the King that a natural obstacle between the Red Grange (a large farmstead between Kunersdorf and Frankfurt's outer city) and Kunersdorf was unpassable; what the peasant did not know was that the Russians had been there long enough to construct a causeway linking these two sections. Looking to the east through his telescope, Frederick saw some wooded hills, called the Reppen Forest, and he believed he could use them to screen an advance, much like he had done at Leuthen. He did not send scouts to reconnoiter the land or question locals about the ground in the forest. Furthermore, through his glass he could see that the Russians were facing west and north, and their fortifications were stronger on the west. He decided that "all" the Allies were facing northwest and that the forest was readily passable.

After his perfunctory reconnaissance, Frederick returned to his camp to develop his battle plan. He planned to direct a diversionary force, commanded by Finck, to the Hühner Fliess, to demonstrate in front of what he believed to be the main Russian <a href="Line%20%28formation%29">line</a>. He would march with his main army to the southeast of the Allied position, circling around Kunersdorf, screened by the Reppen Forest. This way, he thought, he would surprise his enemy, forcing the Allied army to reverse fronts, which is a complicated maneuver for even the best trained troops. Frederick could then employ his much feared oblique battle order, feinting with his left flank as he did so. Ideally, this would allow him to roll up the Allied line from the Mühlberge.

Late in the afternoon on the 11th, wily Saltykov realized that Frederick was not advancing on him from Frankfurt, and changed his plans. He inverted his flanks: instead of having the left wing at the shtetl and the right at Mühlberge, he reversed his flank with the right at the shtetl. Then the Russians set fire to Kunersdorf. Within hours, the only thing left was the stone church and some walls. While Frederick developed his plan to outflank Saltykov by maneuvering behind him, Saltykov outfoxed him.

Prussian activities began at 2:00 am on 12 August. Troops were roused and, within the hour, they set off. Finck's corps had the shortest distance to travel, and the five brigades arrived at the assigned post, the high ground northeast of the Walkeberge, by dawn; <a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20von%20Moller">Karl Friedrich von Moller</a> established the artillery park on the highest ground at Trettin, and pointed it at the Walkberge, on the hills north of the Hühner Fleiss. Finck's infantry and cavalry demonstrated in front of the five Russian regiments as a diversion, while the remainder of Frederick's army continued in a semi-circle around the eastern flank of the Russian line, to approach from the village from the southeast. The grueling march took up to eight hours. Frederick intended to flank his opposition, and attack what he assumed would be its weakest side, but again, he sent no reconnaissance, not a single <a href="hussar">hussar</a> or <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>, to confirm his assumptions.

Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally realized that he would end up facing his enemy, instead of approaching from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make an assault on the Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he could turn the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.

Frederick's army became bogged down in the Reppen Forest. The day was already hot and sultry, and the men were already tired. The trees were thick and the ground was unstable and oozy in some parts, which made the movement of the heavy guns difficult. Delay after delay slowed them down. The carriages pulling the biggest guns, traveling with the bulk of the army, were too wide to cross the narrow forest bridges and the columns had to be reshuffled in the woods. The Russians could hear them, but thought they were scouting parties, albeit noisy ones; they calculated Finck's column was the primary force. Between 5:00 am. and 6:00 am., only Finck's demonstrating corps, to the north by Trettin, were visible to the Russians. Finck's right wing moved out of the hills toward the mill on Hühner Fleiss; more Prussians from Finck's left and center prepared to attack the Walkberge. Finck's artillery awaited Frederick's signal, but the bulk of Frederick's army still crashed about in the woods.

Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick's army emerged from the woods, with most of Generalleutnant <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Seydlitz">Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz</a>'s cavalry and the rest of his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians emerged from the woods, and the Russians realized it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck's artillery park had been in place since dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to the meadows beyond the Mühlberge, not the ravine, and had to be reset. For 30 minutes, the two sides bombarded each other.

At about noon, Frederick sent his first wave of soldiers toward the Russian position on the Mühlberge. Frederick favored mixed troops in such conditions, and his forward troops included <a href="grenadier">grenadier</a>s and <a href="musketeer">musketeer</a>s, and some <a href="cuirassier">cuirassier</a>s. The Prussian artillery batteries created an arc of fire on the Russian sector by the Walkberge and the Kleiner Spitzberge; the infantry could safely move under this arc. They advanced into the crevasse between the two hills; when they came within of the Russian guns on the Mühlberge, they charged at <a href="point-blank%20range">point-blank range</a>. Some of Shuvalov's Observation Corps, stationed on the summit, took substantial losses—perhaps 10 percent—before the Prussian grenadiers overwhelmed them. Prussian losses were also high. Frederick sent 4,300 men into this assault, immediately losing 206 of <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281726%E2%80%931802%29">Prince Henry's</a> cuirassiers. Although Saltykov sent his own grenadiers to shore up the Russian defense, the Prussians carried the Mühlberge, capturing between 80 and 100 enemy cannons, which they immediately deployed against the Russians. For the moment, the Prussians held the position.

After capturing the cannons, the Prussians raked the retreating Russians with fire from their own pieces. The Russians were slaughtered by the score, losing most of five large regiments to injury and death. By 1:00 pm, the Russian left flank had been defeated and driven back on Kunersdorf itself, leaving behind small, disorganized groups capable of only token resistance. In panic, some of the Russians even <a href="Friendly%20fire">fired</a> on the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Baden-Baden">Margrave of Baden-Baden</a>'s troops, which also wore blue coats (although of a lighter blue), mistaking them for Prussians. Saltykov fed in more units, including a force of Austrian grenadiers led by Major <a href="Joseph%20Nikolaus%20De%20Vins">Joseph De Vins</a>, and gradually the situation stabilized.

The Prussian position at Kunersdorf was not substantially better than it had been a few hours earlier, but it was, at least, defensible; the Russian position, on the other hand, was substantially worse. While Frederick's principal force had assaulted the Mühlberge, <a href="Johann%20Jakob%20von%20Wunsch">Johann Jakob von Wunsch</a>, with 4,000 men, had retraced his steps from Reitwein to Frankfurt and had captured the city by mid-day. The Prussians had effectively blocked the Allies from moving east, west or south, and the terrain blocked them from moving north; if they tried such a foolhardy move, Moller's artillery would rake them with <a href="enfilade">enfilade</a> fire. The King's brother, Prince Henry, and several other generals encouraged Frederick to stop there. The Prussians could defend Frankfurt from their vantage point on the Mühlberge and in the city itself. To descend into the valley, cross the Kuhgrund and ascend Spitzberge against frightful fire was foolhardy, they argued. Furthermore, the weather was blisteringly hot and the troops had endured forced marches to reach the theater and the battlefield. They were exhausted and low on water. The men had not had a hot meal in several days, having bivouacked the night before without fires. Despite these arguments, Frederick wanted to press his initial success. He had won half the battle and wanted the whole victory. He decided to continue the fight. He transferred his artillery to the Mühlberge, and ordered Finck's battalions to assault the Allied <a href="Salients%2C%20re-entrants%20and%20pockets">salient</a> from the northwest, while his main strike force would cross the Kuhgrund.

To complete Frederick's battle plan, the Prussians would have to descend from the Mühlberge to the lower Kuhgrund, cross the spongy field, and then assault the well-defended higher ground. This is where Saltykov had concentrated his men, making the Grosser Spitzburg nearly impregnable. At this point in his plan, Frederick intended to have the second half of a pincer movement ready to squeeze the Russian left. The rearmost forces were supposed to have advanced straight against the Russians from the south, while the right wing did the same from the north. The right was where it was supposed to be, with the exception of one of the support formations for the right wing, which was held up by mis-information about the ground: a couple of bridges that crossed the Huhner Fleiss were too narrow for the artillery teams. The left was still out of position.

Anticipating Frederick's plan, Saltykov had reinforced the salient with reserves from the west and southwest; these reserves included most of Laudon's fresh infantry. Finck made no progress at the salient and the Prussian attack at the Kuhgrund was thwarted with murderous fire along their very narrow front. Watching from the luxury of the Kleiner Spitzberge immediately east of the village, Saltykov judiciously fed in reinforcements from other sectors, and awaited results. Once, in the fierce fighting, it looked like the Prussians might break through, but gradually the Allied superiority of 423 artillery pieces could be brought to bear on the struggling Prussians. The Allied grenadiers held their lines.

The Prussian left had been held up by a variety of problems, mostly relating to the inadequately-scouted terrain. Two small ponds and several streams trisected the ground between the Prussian front and the Russians, which the Russians had also littered with abatis. This required the Prussian line to break into small columns that could march along narrow passages between the water and marshy ground, diminishing the legendary fire-power of the Prussian line of attack. Outside the shtetl, the Prussians tried to break through the Russian line; they got as far as the Jewish cemetery at the eastern base of Judenberge, but lost two thirds of Krockow's 2nd Dragoons in the process: 484 men and 51 officers gone in minutes. The 6th Dragoons lost another 234 men and 18 officers as well. Other regiments battling through the Russians and the terrain had comparable losses. Despite these problems, they continued to slog through the Russian positions, advancing toward the Kuhgrund outside what remained of Kunersdorf's wall.
The battle culminated in the early evening hours with a Prussian cavalry charge, led by von Seydlitz, upon the Russian center and artillery positions, a futile effort. The Prussian cavalry suffered heavy losses from cannon fire and retreated in complete disorder. Seydlitz himself was badly wounded and, in his absence, Generalleutnant <a href="Dubislav%20Friedrich%20von%20Platen">Dubislav Friedrich von Platen</a> assumed command. Under Frederick's orders, Platen organized a last-ditch effort. His scouts had discovered a crossing past the chain of ponds south of Kunersdorf, but it lay in full view of the artillery batteries on the Grosser Spitzberge. Seydlitz, still following the action, noted that it was foolish to charge a fortified position with cavalry. His assessment was correct, but Frederick had apparently lost his ability to think objectively. The strength of Frederick's cavalry lay in its ability to attack at a full gallop, with riders knee to knee and horses touching at the shoulders. The units sent against the position shattered; they had to attack piecemeal because of the manner in which the ground was naturally formed. Before any further action could take place, Laudon himself led the Austrian cavalry's counter-attack around the obstacles and routed Platen's cavalry. The fleeing men and horses trampled their own infantry around the base of the Mühlberge. General panic ensued.

The cavalry attack against fortified positions had failed. The Prussian infantry had been on its feet for 16 hours, half of that in a forced march over muddy and uneven terrain, and the other half in slogging battle against formidable odds, in hot weather. Despite the apparent futility, the Prussian infantry repeatedly attacked the Spitzberge, each time with greater losses; the 37th Infantry lost 992 men and 16 officers, more than 90 percent of its force. The King himself led two attacks of the 35th Infantry, and lost two of his horses in the effort. He was mounting a third when the animal was shot in the neck and fell to the ground, nearly crushing the King. Two of Frederick's adjutants pulled him from under the horse as it fell. A ball smashed the gold <a href="Snuff%20%28tobacco%29">snuff</a> box in his coat, and this box, plus his heavy coat, probably saved his life.
By 5:00 pm, neither side could make any gains; the Prussians held tenaciously to the captured artillery works, too tired to even retreat: they had pushed the Russians from the Mühlberge, the village, and the Kuhgrund, but no further. The Allies were in a similar state, except they had more cavalry in reserve and some fresh Austrian infantry. This part of Laudon's forces, late arrivals to the scene and largely unused, came into action at about 7:00 pm. To the exhausted Prussians holding the Kuhgrund, the swarm of fresh Austrian reserves was the final stroke. Although such isolated groups as <a href="Hans%20Sigismund%20von%20Lestwitz">Hans Sigismund von Lestwitz</a>'s regiment put up a bold front, these groups lost heavily and their stubborn defense could not stop the chaos of the Prussian retreat. Soldiers threw their weapons and gear aside and ran for their lives.

The battle was lost for Frederick—it had actually been lost for the Prussians for a couple of hours—but he had not accepted this fact. Frederick rode among his melting army, snatched a regimental flag, trying to rally his men: "Children, my children, come to me. Avec moi, Avec moi!" They did not hear him, or if they did, they chose not to obey. Watching the chaos and seeking the "<a href="coup%20de%20gr%C3%A2ce">coup de grâce</a>," Saltykov threw his own <a href="Cossack">Cossack</a>s and <a href="Kalmyk%20people">Kalmyks</a> (cavalry) into the fray. The Chuguevski Cossacks surrounded Frederick on a small hill, where he stood with the remnants of his body-guard—the Leib Cuirassiers—determined to either hold the line or to die trying. With a 100-strong <a href="hussar">hussar</a> squadron, Rittmeister (cavalry captain) <a href="Joachim%20Bernhard%20von%20Prittwitz">Joachim Bernhard von Prittwitz-Gaffron</a> cut his way through the Cossacks and dragged the King to safety. Much of his squadron died in the effort. As the hussars escorted Frederick from the battlefield, he passed the bodies of his men, lying on their faces with their backs slashed open by Laudon's cavalry. A <a href="dry%20thunderstorm">dry thunderstorm</a> created a surreal effect.

That evening back in Reitwein, Frederick sat in a peasant hut and wrote a despairing letter to his old tutor, <a href="Count%20Karl-Wilhelm%20Finck%20von%20Finckenstein">Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein</a>:
Frederick also decided to turn over command of the army to Finck. He told this unlucky general he was sick. He named his brother as <a href="generalissimo">generalissimo</a> and insisted his generals swear allegiance to his nephew, the 14-year-old <a href="Frederick%20William%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William</a>.

Before the battle, both armies had been reinforced by smaller units; by the time of the battle, the Allied forces had about 60,000 men, with another 5,000 holding Frankfurt, and the Prussians had almost 50,000. The Russians and Austrians lost about 15,000 men (approx. 5,000 killed), although some sources suggest a slightly higher number, perhaps 15,600 or 15,700, about 26 percent. Christopher Duffy places Russian losses at 13,477; in addition, the Russians had lost about 4,000 at the Battle of Kay a week earlier. Sources differ on Prussian losses. Duffy maintains 6,000 killed and 13,000 wounded, a casualty rate of more than 37 percent. Gaston Bodart represents losses at 39 percent, and that two thirds (12,000) of the 19,000 casualties were deaths. Frank Szabo places Prussian losses at 21,000.
Following the battle, the victorious Cossack troops plundered corpses and slit the throats of the wounded; this no doubt contributed to the death rate.

The Prussians lost their entire <a href="horse%20artillery">horse artillery</a>, an amalgam of cavalry and artillery in which the crews rode horses into battle, dragging their cannons behind them, one of Frederick's notable inventions. The Prussians also lost 60 percent of their cavalry, killed or wounded, animals and men. The Prussians lost 172 of their own cannons plus the 105 that they had captured from the Russians in the late morning on the Mühlberge. They also lost 27 flags and two standards.

Staff losses were significant. Frederick lost eight regimental colonels. Of his senior command, Seydlitz was wounded and had to relinquish command to Platen, nowhere near his equal in energy and nerve; Wedel was wounded so badly that he never fought again; <a href="Georg%20Ludwig%20von%20Puttkamer">Georg Ludwig von Puttkamer</a>, commander of the Puttkamer Hussars, lay among the dead. <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Steuben">Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben</a>, later the <a href="inspector%20general">inspector general</a> and major general of the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, was wounded at the battle. <a href="Ewald%20Christian%20von%20Kleist">Ewald Christian von Kleist</a>, the famous poet of the Prussian army, was badly injured in the latter moments of the assault on the Walkeberge. By the time he was injured, Major Kleist was the highest-ranking officer in his regiment. Generalleutnant <a href="August%20Friedrich%20von%20Itzenplitz">August Friedrich von Itzenplitz</a> died of his wounds on 5 September, <a href="Prince%20Karl%20Anton%20August%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck">Prince Charles Anton August von Holstein-Beck</a> on 12 September, and Finck's brigade commander, Generalmajor <a href="George%20Ernst%20von%20Klitzing">George Ernst von Klitzing</a>, on 28 October in Stettin. Prussia was at its last gasp and Frederick despaired of preserving much of his remaining kingdom for his heir.

Although still wary of one another, the Russian and Austrian commanders were satisfied with the result of their cooperation. They had outfought Frederick's army in a test of nerve, courage and military skills. <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Russia">Elizabeth of Russia</a> promoted Saltykov to Generalfeldmarschall and awarded a special medal to everyone involved. She also sent a sword of honor to Laudon. The price of this rout, though, was high: 26 percent Austrian and Russian losses would not usually qualify as a victory. The storming of field works typically resulted in a disproportionate number of killed over wounded. The conclusion of the battle in hand-to-hand struggle also increased casualties on both sides. Finally, subsequent cavalry charges and the stampeding flight of men and horses had caused many more injuries. Regardless of the losses, though, Saltykov and Laudon remained on the field with intact armies, and with extant communications between one another. The Prussian defeat remained without consequences when the victors did not capitalize on the opportunity to march against Berlin, but retired to Saxony instead. If Saltykov had sought the "coup de grâce" in the last hour of the battle, he did not follow through with it.

Within days, Frederick's army had reconstituted itself. Approximately 26,000 men—most of the survivors—were scattered over the territory between Kunersdorf and Berlin. Four days after the battle, though, most of the men turned up at the headquarters on the Oder River or in Berlin, and Frederick's army recovered to a strength of 32,000 men and 50 artillery pieces.

Elizabeth of Russia continued her policy of providing support to Austria, considering it vital to Russian interests, but with decreasing effectiveness. Distance constrained the Russian supply lines and, despite Austrian headquarters' agreement to supply the Russian troops through their own lines, Russian troops took little part in the remaining battles of 1759 and 1760. The Russian army did not fight another major battle until they <a href="Siege%20of%20Kolberg%20%28Seven%20Years%27%20War%29%23Third%20siege%20%281761%29">stormed Kolberg</a> in 1761, allowing the Prussians to focus on the Austrians. In 1762, the death of Elizabeth, and the ascension of her nephew, <a href="Peter%20III%20of%20Russia">Peter</a>, an admirer of Frederick's, saved the Prussians when he immediately withdrew Russia from hostilities.

Most military historians agree that Kunersdorf was Frederick's greatest, and most catastrophic, loss. They generally attribute it to three major problems: his indifference to the Russian practices of the "art of war", his lack of information about the terrain, and his inability to realize that the Russians had surmounted the obstacles of location. Frederick complicated his fate by violating every principle of war he had espoused in his <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great%23Military%20theorist">own writing</a>.

First, Frederick had assumed he could use his trade-mark oblique order attack, but his reconnaissance had been incomplete. The Russians had been there for two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick's arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason for him not to have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, except, perhaps, that his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the oblique battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of <a href="redan">redan</a>s; the Russians were able to shape abutments from which to fire down upon the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite the murderous fire, Frederick's troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.

Second, Frederick's most egregious mistake was his refusal to consider the recommendations of his trusted staff. Brother Henry, a superb tactician and strategist in his own right, reasonably suggested halting the battle at mid-day, after the Prussians had secured the first height and Wunsch, the city. Wunsch could not move across the river; only one bridge remained, and Laudon's cavalry guarded it fiercely. Regardless, from these vantage points, the Prussians would be unassailable, and eventually, the Austro-Russian force would have to withdraw. Furthermore, Henry argued, the troops were exhausted from several days of marching, the weather was appallingly hot, they did not have enough water, and they had not had a good meal in several days. Instead of holding his secure position, though, Frederick forced his tired troops to descend the hill, cross the low ground, and ascend the next hill, in the face of heavy fire. The Prussian cavalry effort initially drove back the Russian and Austrian squadrons, but the fierce cannon and musketry fire from the united Allied front inflicted staggering losses on Frederick's much-vaunted horsemen. Furthermore, he committed perhaps the gravest of errors in sending his cavalry into battle piecemeal and against <a href="Field%20entrenchment">entrenched positions</a>.

Third, he acted on the ground of his enemy's choosing, not of his own, and on the basis of meager information and almost no understanding of the ground, he broke all the military tactical rules of his own devising. He had thrown his infantry into the teeth of gun fire; he compounded this folly by committing his cavalry piecemeal in pointless charges across soft, spongy ground that was divided by streams, requiring them to attack in long, drawn out lines, rather than "<a href="en%20masse">en masse</a>"; of course, he could not send his cavalry "en masse" because several natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—made this impossible on some of the terrain.

The catastrophic loss was due to more than these three issues, though. Indeed, he violated his own rules of strategy and tactics because he faced an enemy he despised, and this brought out the worst of his generalship. In this way, the loss at Kunersdorf was similar to that of the Battle of Hochkirch. There, the British envoy traveling with the Prussian Army attributed Frederick's loss to the contempt in which he held the Austrians and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not agree with his imagination; certainly, this contempt for the Austrians and the Russians contributed to his loss at Kunersdorf as well. Yet, as Herbert Redman notes, "... seldom in military history has a battle been so completely lost by an organized army in such a short space of time." The loss was not only due to Frederick's unwillingness to accept that the Russians, whom he despised, and the Austrians, whom he despised only slightly less, had any military acumen. At Hochkirch, Frederick demonstrated good leadership by rallying his troops against the surprise attack; Prussian discipline and the bonds of regimental cohesion had prevailed. Importantly, the Prussian army at Kunersdorf was not the same army that had fought at Hochkirch, because it had already fought, and lost, there. Over the winter, Frederick had cobbled together a new army, but it was not as well-trained, well-disciplined, and well-drilled as his old one. He failed to accept this. Arguably Frederick's worst defeat, at Kunersdorf, his army panicked and discipline disintegrated before his eyes, especially in the last hour of the battle. The few regiments that held together, such as that of Lestwitz, were the exception. Frederick had demanded more of his men than they could bear.

Brownhills

Brownhills is a small former market town in the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28county%29">West Midlands</a>, England. Located on the edge of <a href="Cannock%20Chase">Cannock Chase</a> near the large artificial lake <a href="Chasewater">Chasewater</a>, it is north-east of <a href="Walsall">Walsall</a> and a similar distance south-west of <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>. It is part of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Walsall">Metropolitan Borough of Walsall</a> and the <a href="Aldridge-Brownhills%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Aldridge-Brownhills</a> parliamentary constituency and neighbours the ancient villages of <a href="Pelsall">Pelsall</a> and <a href="Stonnall">Stonnall</a>. Before boundary changes in 1974, it was in the county of <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>.

The town lies on the ancient <a href="Watling%20Street">Watling Street</a>, but is not recorded before the 17th century, although Ogley Hay, which in modern times is a district of the town, is recorded as a settlement in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>. Brownhills quickly grew around the coal mining industry, especially after it became linked to the <a href="canal">canal</a> and railway networks in the mid-19th century, and by the end of the century had grown from a hamlet of only 300 inhabitants to a town with a population of over , of whom the vast majority were employed in the coal industry. Mining remained the town's principal industry until the 1950s, but the subsequent closure of the area's pits led to a severe economic decline which has continued until the present day. The local authority has instituted a regeneration programme which it is hoped will revive the town's fortunes, providing better transport and leisure facilities.

Brownhills is situated on the ancient <a href="Watling%20Street">Watling Street</a> and there is evidence of early settlement in the area, including an ancient burial mound and a guard post believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle. The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular suggestion for the origin of the name is that it refers to the early mining <a href="Slag%20heap">spoil heaps</a> which dotted the area.
The settlement is first recorded (as "Brownhill") on <a href="Robert%20Plot">Robert Plot</a>'s 1680 map of <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>, at which time it was a hamlet within the <a href="Manorialism">manor</a> of Ogley Hay, which in turn was part of the parish of <a href="Norton%20Canes">Norton Canes</a>. Ogley Hay itself had existed since at least the 11th century and is mentioned in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>, although the 1801 census lists it as having a population of only 8 people. Beyond Ogley Hay lay Catshill, another hamlet which pre-dated Brownhills and which lay within the parish of <a href="Shenstone%2C%20Staffordshire">Shenstone</a>.

During the 17th century, shallow mine workings began to develop in the area and in 1759 a <a href="Turnpike%20trust">turnpike</a> was erected in the Catshill area. A local legend claims that <a href="Dick%20Turpin">Dick Turpin</a> once vaulted the barricade on his horse to avoid paying the toll, although this is demonstrably false as Turpin was executed in 1739, twenty years before the turnpike's construction. In 1794 Brownhills (now in the plural) was included in a list of local settlements mentioned in an <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> concerning canals in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>, and three years later the <a href="Wyrley%20%26amp%3B%20Essington%20Canal">Wyrley & Essington Canal</a>, nicknamed the "Curly Wyrley" by the locals due to its winding course, was opened. In 1799 Norton Pool, later to be renamed <a href="Chasewater">Chasewater</a>, was created to serve as a reservoir for the canals.

Early in the 19th century, a horse-drawn tram system connected the mines to the wharves on the canal. In response to the growing population of the area open land in Ogley Hay, up until then merely heathland, was enclosed and converted to farmland in 1838, the same year in which the area was first declared a parish, although no church was built for another 13 years. Charles Foster Cotterill, a former mayor of <a href="Walsall">Walsall</a> who had purchased the manor of Ogley Hay in 1836 upon the death of former lord Phineas Hussey, saw the potential of the area and sold off large tracts of his land for private farming and the construction of a <a href="gristmill">flour mill</a> and a <a href="foundry">foundry</a>. The remaining land of the former manor was progressively sold off through a series of <a href="indenture">indenture</a>s of questionable legality until 1846 when Cotterill sold the last and moved to London.

The <a href="South%20Staffordshire%20Railway">South Staffordshire Railway</a> reached Brownhills in 1850 and led to a huge expansion of the local mining operation and with it a population explosion in the area, with the population increasing from 305 in 1801 to over 13,000 in 1891. In 1858 a branch line was constructed through the heart of what was then the hamlet of Brownhills, which led to a migration of the population eastwards, leading to the formation of mining slums in the Ogley Hay area. Eventually a new town centre developed, complete with library and theatre. This led to the gradual amalgamation of Brownhills, Ogley Hay and Catshill into one town.
Mining was to remain the principal industry of Brownhills until the last pit closed in the 1950s. During the 18th and 19th centuries the area known as Coppice Side was the hub of the mining industry, and the census of 1841 showed that over 80% of the population of the area which makes up modern Brownhills lived and worked there, with up to ten pits active in the area at any one time. As in other mining areas, several men lost their lives in the Brownhills pits. Seven miners, including a boy aged 11, died in an accident in 1861, and in October 1930 an <a href="Grove%20Colliery%20mining%20accident">explosion at the Grove Colliery</a> killed fourteen miners, ten of them from Brownhills.

In 1877 the town of Brownhills was officially recognised for the first time after a new Act authorised the amalgamation of rural districts into larger local government areas. An order was issued on 29 September stating:

After the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the Urban District Council, which had replaced the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. Large areas of open farmland were purchased for the building of <a href="council%20house">council house</a>s, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared unfit for human habitation, was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final farmland within the boundaries of Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.

By the time of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> the mines of Brownhills, being amongst the oldest in the area, were largely exhausted, and following the nationalisation of the mining industry the final pit on the Common was closed in the 1950s. Following the demise of the coalfield the town experienced a severe economic slump, with many high street shops closing down. A wave of new development in the 1960s and 1970s saw a new shopping precinct planned, which it was claimed would incorporate a cinema, bowling alley, hotel and bus station and would completely revitalise the town. Despite the developers' grandiose claims, the project was not a success and ultimately consisted solely of shopping units, many of which stood empty for up to five years. There was little further development in the 1980s and 1990s, and the feeling of the local council is that the town centre is in need of improvement. To this end the council has created a "Townscape Masterplan" for the redevelopment of the town.

Brownhills is represented by three tiers of government, <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Walsall">Walsall Borough Council</a> ("local"), UK Parliament ("national"), and European Parliament ("Europe").

The Brownhills District established in 1877 remained in existence until 1894 when it was superseded by Brownhills Urban District. In 1966 the Urban District merged with that of <a href="Aldridge">Aldridge</a> to form the <a href="Aldridge-Brownhills%20Urban%20District">Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District</a>, in accordance with a recommendation of the <a href="Local%20Government%20Commission%20for%20England%20%281958%20-%201967%29">Local Government Commission for England</a>. This in turn was amalgamated in 1974, under the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a>, into the newly formed <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Walsall">Metropolitan Borough of Walsall</a>, under whose jurisdiction the area remains to this day. As a result of this amalgamation Brownhills also became part of the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28county%29">West Midlands county</a>, having previously been part of <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>. Today Brownhills constitutes a <a href="Ward%20%28country%20subdivision%29">ward</a> within the Borough of Walsall and has three seats on the Borough Council. As at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202008">2008 local elections</a> two of these seats were held by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> and one by <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a>.

<a href="Wendy%20Morton">Wendy Morton</a>, representing the Conservative Party, has been the Member of Parliament for the constituency of <a href="Aldridge-Brownhills%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Aldridge-Brownhills</a> since 2015. Before the creation of the Aldridge-Brownhills seat in 1974, the town had been part of the <a href="Walsall%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Walsall North</a> constituency since 1955, when it had been transferred from the now-defunct Cannock constituency.

Brownhills is part of the Walsall council counting area of the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Midlands European Parliament constituency</a>, which elects six <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">MEPs</a>. In the 2009 election the Conservatives gained 26.8% of the vote in this counting area, ahead of UKIP 24.5% and Labour with 18.9%.
Brownhills is located at on the edge of <a href="Cannock%20Chase">Cannock Chase</a> and lies mostly at a height of approximately 150 metres (492 ft) above sea level, although there is a sharp incline to nearly 180 metres (590 ft) at the eastern end of the town. The highest point of Cannock Chase, standing at 244 metres (801 ft) above sea level, lies approximately from the town. Although a small river called Crane Brook flows slightly to the east of Brownhills, the only significant bodies of water in the area are human-made, namely the canal and the reservoir <a href="Chasewater">Chasewater</a>, which lies to the north, between Brownhills and Cannock Chase. The reservoir was constructed in the 18th century and reshaped by reclamation schemes as recently as the 1970s.
Immediately to the west of the town is Brownhills Common, a heathland which once formed part of Cannock Forest (also known as "Canke Wood"). Although the forest was felled in the 15th and 16th centuries, the spread of <a href="Canulla">heather</a> and the grazing of <a href="Domestic%20sheep">sheep</a> led to the creation of a huge area of heathland. The area was affected by mine workings but has now returned to a more natural state and <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s and <a href="dragonfly">dragonflies</a> may be observed. The area now supports various habitat types, with the heathland mixing with marshy grassland, with scattered scrub and pools. In 1926, when ownership of the Common was transferred to the local Council, a large area of barren land at the eastern end, closest to the town, was landscaped, with new trees planted. Lying south of the Common, Birch Coppice is a large area of predominantly <a href="oak">oak</a> and <a href="birch">birch</a> woodland, which, although crossed by a now-dismantled railway line, mostly escaped the destruction caused to other wooded areas by mining and other industry.
To the south, Brownhills is separated from the nearby village of <a href="Clayhanger%2C%20West%20Midlands">Clayhanger</a> by Clayhanger Common, which is designated a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> and considered "one of the best wetland sites in the county". In 2007, a new £445,000 bridge was erected across the canal at Brownhills, providing pedestrian, disabled and cycling access to the Common and to the village of Clayhanger beyond. To the east lies the village of <a href="Stonnall">Stonnall</a> and a large area of <a href="green%20belt">green belt</a> land.

The geology of Brownhills comprises mainly red clay <a href="marl">marl</a> overlying <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> and deposits of coal. The town is on several <a href="geologic%20fault">fault lines</a>, the main one being the Vigo Fault, a branch of the larger Eastern Boundary Fault, which runs from <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> to <a href="Rugeley">Rugeley</a>. On the western side of the fault, in the area of Brownhills Common, the marl is over thinner than on the eastern side, bringing the coal seams significantly closer to the surface. The presence of the faults and the effects of mining mean that subsidence has been a major problem in the area for many years.

The land within the town is made up of approximately 62% greenspace, 18% domestic gardens, 7% roads, 4% domestic buildings, 3% non-domestic buildings and 6% other uses. Since the 19th century, trade in Brownhills has been centred on the High Street. As the canal and Clayhanger Common lie immediately to the south of the High Street, the town's housing areas are mainly to the north and at the eastern and western ends of the town. Brownhills has 5,152 residential dwellings, of which 47% are <a href="semi-detached">semi-detached</a> houses. Selling prices for all types of property within the town have risen significantly since 2000; in August 2007 the average selling price was £137,600, compared to £59,596 in 2000, a rise of 131%. The Aldridge and Brownhills Housing Trust owns and manages those properties formerly owned as <a href="council%20houses">council houses</a> by Walsall Council.

In the West Midlands, the warmest time of the year is July and August, when maximum temperatures average around 21 °C (70 °F); the coolest months are January and February, when minimum temperatures average around 1 °C (39 °F). The area's average maximum and minimum temperatures are almost exactly in line with the national average. The average annual rainfall is about , the wettest months being September to January. This is lower than the national average annual rainfall of 838 mm (33 inches).

See <a href="Penkridge%20weather%20station">Penkridge weather station</a> for details of average temperature and rainfall figures taken between 1971 and 2000 at the <a href="Met%20Office">Met Office</a> weather station in <a href="Penkridge">Penkridge</a> (around from Brownhills).

At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">2001 UK census</a>, Brownhills <a href="Ward%20%28politics%29">ward</a> had a population of 12,637, and a population density of 17.45 persons per hectare.

Of the town's 5,151 households, 40.7% were married couples living together, 10.4% were <a href="Cohabitation">cohabiting</a> couples and 10.2% were lone parents. 25.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.8% had someone living alone at pensionable age. 31.8% of households included children aged under 16 or a person aged 16 to 18 who was in full-time education. The average household size was 2.5.

The ethnicity of the town was 97.4% white, 0.6% mixed race, 1.2% Asian, 0.5% black and 0.3% Chinese or other. The country of birth of residents was 97.8% United Kingdom, 0.4% <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, 0.2% Germany, 0.2% other Western European countries, 0.2% Eastern Europe, 0.2% Africa, 0.3% Far East, 0.4% South Asia, <0.1% Middle East, 0.2% North America and <0.1% Oceania. Religion was recorded as 79.6% Christian, 0.6% <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>, 0.2% <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a>, 0.1% <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a>, 0.1% <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> and 0.3% <a href="Sikhism">Sikh</a>. 12.5% were recorded as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion and 6.5% did not state their religion.

For every 100 females, there were 98.04 males. The age distribution was 6.6% aged 0–4 years, 15.0% aged 5–15 years, 4.2% aged 16–19 years, 36.3% aged 20–44 years, 23.6% aged 45–64 years and 14.1% aged 65 years and over. The mean population age was 37.5, lower than the national average of 38.6.

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 43.2% in full-time employment, 12.3% in part-time employment, 6.1% self-employed, 3.8% unemployed, 1.3% students with jobs, 2.3% students without jobs, 13.5% retired, 7.3% looking after home or family, 6.9% permanently sick or disabled and 3.3% economically inactive for other reasons. The percentage of people in full-time employment was significantly higher than the 39.1% average for the whole of the Walsall district. Of the town's residents aged 16–74, 8.5% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared with 19.9% nationwide. According to <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> estimates, during the period of April 2001 to March 2002 the average gross weekly income of households in the Brownhills area was £460 (£23,920 per year).

The decline of the mining industry in the 1950s caused a severe economic slump in Brownhills, which continues to this day. The local authority has created a "Townscape Masterplan" for the regeneration of Brownhills, which involves increased leisure provision, the improvement of the town centre's shopping facilities, a new transport interchange incorporating Park and Ride facilities and cycle links to the town centre and the <a href="National%20Cycle%20Route">National Cycle Route</a>, and the refurbishment of run-down properties. The plan also involves the potential construction of a bypass to relieve the heavily congested High Street. In addition to these developments, a grant of over £350,000 was obtained to fund the creation of a new "mini town square", and the demolition of blocks of high-rise flats in the town has begun.

At the 2001 census, Brownhills had 5,768 people in employment, of which the largest percentage (28.85%) worked in manufacturing, followed by retail (19.35%) and construction (8.93%). Compared to the national average, the town had a relatively high percentage of workers in the construction industry and a relatively low number in real estate and financial intermediation. The average distance travelled to work by Brownhills residents was 10.36 km; the vast majority (62%) travelled to work by car.

One of the town's largest employers is T & S Stores, a subsidiary of Tesco plc, whose depot in the town employs approximately 1,000 people. Brownhills was also formerly home to the wirings manufacturer Electrium's last UK-based factory, but this has closed, with manufacturing shifted overseas and commercial staff moved to a new site in <a href="Cannock">Cannock</a>. In 2006, the site was converted into a mixed-use facility dubbed Toll Point, with Walsall Council among those moving to the site. Many people are also employed at the town's large branch of <a href="Tesco">Tesco</a> which is open 24 hours a day on weekdays and is large enough to have its own petrol station. Before being taken over by Tesco, the store was a branch of <a href="Hillards">Hillards</a>, and an earlier Tesco store in the town had been forced to close as it could not compete with Hillards.

The High Street retains various independent shops, including a cobbler and a butcher, but is seen as in need of improvement. Walsall Council's regeneration programme includes extensive redevelopment of the High Street; the council's view is that retail investment should be focussed on the existing shopping area rather than encouraging new developments outside this area as, based on consultants' studies, the council believes that the town could not support large-scale retail development. Specific development opportunities within the vicinity of the High Street have been identified, with particular focus on land on Silver Street, adjacent to the canal.

Brownhills is served by the <a href="A5%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29">A5</a> and lies close to a junction of the <a href="M6%20Toll">M6 Toll</a> motorway. <a href="National%20Express%20West%20Midlands">National Express West Midlands</a> bus services connect the town with <a href="Walsall">Walsall</a>, <a href="Arriva%20Midlands">Arriva</a> links to both Cannock and Walsall, and <a href="Central%20Connect">Diamond Bus</a> to <a href="Aldridge">Aldridge</a> and <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>. Choice Travel and ATZ Travel did link services to Brownhills before being taken over by the present <a href="Diamond%20Bus">Diamond Bus</a>. The nearest <a href="National%20Express%20Coaches">National Express</a> coach stops are in Walsall, <a href="Bloxwich">Bloxwich</a> and <a href="Cannock">Cannock</a>.

The <a href="Birmingham%20Canal%20Navigations">Birmingham Canal Navigations</a>' <a href="Wyrley%20and%20Essington%20Canal">Wyrley and Essington Canal</a> passes through Brownhills and meets the <a href="Daw%20End%20Branch%20Canal">Daw End Branch Canal</a> at <a href="Catshill%20Junction">Catshill Junction</a>. The Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust is in the process of restoring the <a href="Lichfield%20Canal">Lichfield Canal</a> from <a href="Ogley%20Junction">Ogley Junction</a>, Brownhills, to <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>.

Brownhills formerly had two railway stations. <a href="Brownhills%20railway%20station">The first</a>, on the <a href="South%20Staffordshire%20Line">South Staffordshire Line</a> (later part of the <a href="London%2C%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a>), opened in 1849 but was closed as part of the <a href="Beeching%20Axe">Beeching Axe</a> in 1965. The line remained open for freight until 1983, but the track was lifted in 1985. <a href="Brownhills%20Watling%20Street%20railway%20station">The other</a>, on the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a>, was open for passengers between 1884 and 1930 and for freight until 1960, when the track was lifted. The local authority ultimately aims to create a new station and re-open passenger rail links to Brownhills as part of its "Townscape Masterplan". Within a radius of Brownhills there are six <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a> stations, at <a href="Walsall%20railway%20station">Walsall</a>, <a href="Lichfield%20City%20railway%20station">Lichfield</a>, <a href="Cannock%20railway%20station">Cannock</a>, <a href="Bloxwich%20railway%20station">Bloxwich</a>, <a href="Landywood%20railway%20station">Great Wyrley</a>, and <a href="Shenstone%20railway%20station">Shenstone</a>; of which Shenstone (about away) is the closest.
The town's main secondary school is <a href="Brownhills%20School">Brownhills School</a> (formerly Brownhills Sports College, Brownhills Community Technology College, Brownhills Community School and Brownhills Comprehensive), a mixed-gender school with approximately pupils. In 2002 the school was designated a <a href="technology%20college">technology college</a> and since 2005 has been affiliated to the <a href="Specialist%20Schools%20and%20Academies%20Trust">Specialist Schools and Academies Trust</a>. In 2006, only 28% of the school's pupils gained at least five <a href="GCSE">GCSE</a>s at grades A*–C including English and maths, ranking it 12th out of Walsall's 19 secondary schools.

Although officially located slightly outside the town's boundaries in Walsall Wood, <a href="Shire%20Oak%20School">Shire Oak School</a> (the former Shire Oak Grammar School) takes many pupils from Brownhills. Approximately 6% of children from the town attend selective schools elsewhere in the borough of Walsall.

Watling Street Primary School, situated on the <a href="A5%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29">A5</a> at the western end of town, has approximately 200 students between the ages of 3 and 11. In 2006 Watling Street's <a href="Key%20Stage%202">Key Stage 2</a> results were the best in the Walsall LEA. There are four other primary schools in the town, St James' Primary School, St Bernadette's Catholic Primary School, Brownhills West Primary School, Millfield Primary School and one in Clayhanger, Holy Trinity Church of England Primary School.

Brownhills has a <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> church (St James), a <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a> church (St Bernadette), three <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> churches (including one in Clayhanger), two <a href="Spiritualist%20Church">Spiritualist Church</a>es, and a <a href="Pentacostalism">Pentecostal</a> church.

Brownhills has had strong links with the Methodist faith since the 19th century. The current Silver Street Methodist church was built in the 1960s when two other churches were compulsorily purchased and demolished due to their sites being identified as prime locations for additional town centre car parking under a council redevelopment scheme.

Brownhills has a population of Asians who make up nearly 2% of the local population in the area. The 2011 census found that 67.9% identified as Christians making it one of the biggest parts of Walsall with Christianity being the highest religion. 24.4% identified as no-religion while Sikh was the second highest religion with 0.6% of the population. The nearby temples and mosques are in Walsall or Birchills but there is a mosque in <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>.

One of Brownhills' most prominent landmarks is a stainless steel sculpture of a <a href="coal%20mining">coal miner</a>, erected in May 2006 on a roundabout at one end of the High Street, where the A4124 Pelsall Road and High Street A452 cross. The colossal sculpture, by <a href="John%20McKenna%20%28sculptor%29">John McKenna</a> ARBS, commemorates the town's mining tradition. A competition was organised to choose an official nickname for the statue. The winning name was Jigger after Jack "Jigger" Taylor who died when the roof of Walsall Wood pit collapsed in 1951.

<a href="Chasewater">Chasewater</a> in Staffordshire lies on the edge of Brownhills, with the area surrounding it, which is designated as a country park, officially falling within the Brownhills postal area. The reservoir supports a variety of activities including water-skiing, sailing, angling and bird watching. The <a href="Chasewater%20Railway">Chasewater Railway</a>, operates a <a href="Heritage%20railway">heritage rail</a> service on the line of the former <a href="mineral%20railway">mineral railway</a> around <a href="Chasewater">Chasewater</a> between Brownhills and <a href="Chasetown">Chasetown</a>, north of the <a href="Brownhills%20Watling%20Street%20railway%20station">former Brownhills Watling Street</a> station. The railway's main station is designated <a href="Brownhills%20West%20railway%20station">Brownhills West</a>.

On the opposite side of the A5, Brownhills Common, where a wide variety of birds can be observed, is a designated nature reserve, as is Shire Oak Park, approximately from the town centre. Holland Park, on the edge of the Common, has a skate park and multi-sports area, which were created as part of a £95,000 <a href="environmental%20remediation">environmental regeneration</a> project and opened in 2002. The final stage of the project will see the building of a new "youth shelter".

The town is home to what is reputed to be the oldest <a href="fingerpost">fingerpost</a> in the United Kingdom.

One of the major concerns of the local council is that the town is "particularly lacking in leisure provision". At one time the town had two cinemas, but the last of these closed in the 1960s and a plan to build a new one never came to fruition. Although the town's theatre also closed down many years ago, the Brownhills Community School's theatre stages productions by local groups such as the Aldridge Musical Comedy Society and the Walsall Gilbert and Sullivan Society.

Brownhills holds an annual canal festival in June with stalls, entertainment and boat trips, and there is an active Community Association which organises a range of events, including a weekend-long military display event in 2006. The town has a weekly market which is popular but suffers from a reputation for the sale of counterfeit goods. In 2005 Trading Standards officers seized over £40,000 worth of fake goods in a raid on the market.

Brownhills has several <a href="public%20house">public house</a>s. Although some older ones, such as the Victorian-era Jolly Collier in Coppice Side, were demolished in the 1980s, several dating from the 19th century still stand comparatively unchanged, including the Shoulder of Mutton, which still bears windows etched with the emblem of the brewery which owned it in the 1850s. The Station Hotel in the High Street hosted concerts, including an appearance by <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> in 1968.

Brownhills does not currently have a Saturday men's <a href="football%20%28soccer%29">football (soccer)</a> team; in the 1990s Brownhills Town F.C. competed in the <a href="Midland%20Football%20Combination">Midland Football Combination</a> but folded during the <a href="2003-04%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> season. During the 1950s Ogley Hay F.C. were a strong local team, reaching the final of the <a href="Walsall%20Senior%20Cup">Walsall Senior Cup</a> on three occasions. Currently, the main football club in the town is Brownhills Community Colts, a youth club which has existed since the 1970s and fields teams in various age groups, as well as teams for children with disabilities.

The Brownhills Canoe and Outdoor Centre opened in 2006, funded by <a href="British%20Waterways">British Waterways</a> with the assistance of partners such as <a href="Sport%20England">Sport England</a>, the <a href="European%20Regional%20Development%20Fund">European Regional Development Fund</a> and <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Walsall">Walsall Council</a>, and offers <a href="canoeing">canoeing</a> and <a href="kayaking">kayaking</a> lessons on the canal, close to the centre of town. Nearby Chasewater is a prominent watersports site, with the Watersports Centre offering a variety of <a href="water%20skiing">water skiing</a> facilities, including the largest children's coaching scheme in the UK, and the sailing club providing year-round <a href="windsurfing">windsurfing</a> and <a href="dinghy%20sailing">dinghy sailing</a>.

The local community association organises a range of sporting activities for members of the public, including activities as diverse as <a href="yoga">yoga</a>, badminton and <a href="kickboxing">kickboxing</a>.

Brownhills has no dedicated local newspaper of its own, but is covered by newspapers published in <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a> and <a href="Walsall">Walsall</a>. The most popular paid-for local newspaper is the "<a href="Express%20%26amp%3B%20Star">Express & Star</a>". Free newspapers with significant circulation in the town include the "Walsall Chronicle", "Walsall Advertiser", and "Walsall Observer". Similarly, the town has no dedicated local radio station but receives the stations broadcast from the <a href="Sutton%20Coldfield%20transmitting%20station">Sutton Coldfield transmitting station</a>, including <a href="BRMB">BRMB</a> and <a href="Kerrang%21%20105.2">Kerrang! 105.2</a>.

Three members of the Dorsett family from Brownhills played professional <a href="football%20%28soccer%29">football</a>. <a href="George%20Dorsett">George Dorsett</a> (1881–1942) and his brother <a href="Joe%20Dorsett">Joe</a> (1888–1951) both played for <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in the early years of the 20th century. Their nephew <a href="Dicky%20Dorsett">Dicky Dorsett</a> (born 3 December 1919, died 1999) played over 250 times for <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> between 1946 and 1952 and also played for <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> in the <a href="1939%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1939 FA Cup Final</a>.

Arthur W. Radford

Arthur William Radford (27 February 1896 – 17 August 1973) was a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">admiral</a> and <a href="naval%20aviator">naval aviator</a>. In over 40 years of military service, Radford held a variety of positions including <a href="Vice%20Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Vice Chief of Naval Operations</a>, <a href="Commander%2C%20U.S.%20Pacific%20Fleet">commander</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">United States Pacific Fleet</a> and later the second <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>.

With an interest in ships and aircraft from a young age, Radford saw his first sea duty aboard the battleship during World War I. In the <a href="inter-war%20period">inter-war period</a> he earned his pilot wings and rose through the ranks in duties aboard ships and in the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a>. After the U.S. entered World War II, he was the architect of the development and expansion of the Navy's aviator training programs in the first years of the war. In its final years he commanded carrier <a href="task%20force">task force</a>s through several major campaigns of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>.

Noted as a strong-willed and aggressive leader, Radford was a central figure in the post-war debates on U.S. military policy, and was a staunch proponent of naval aviation. As commander of the Pacific Fleet, he defended the Navy's interests in an era of shrinking defense budgets, and was a central figure in the "<a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Admirals">Revolt of the Admirals</a>," a contentious public fight over policy. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he continued to advocate for aggressive foreign policy and a strong <a href="nuclear%20deterrent">nuclear deterrent</a> in support of the <a href="New%20Look%20%28policy%29">"New Look" policy</a> of President <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>.

Retiring from the military in 1957, Radford continued to be a military adviser to several prominent politicians until his death in 1973. For his extensive service, he was awarded many military honors, and was the namesake of the <a href="Spruance-class%20destroyer">"Spruance"-class destroyer</a> .

Arthur William Radford was born on 27 February 1896 in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, to John Arthur Radford, a Canadian-born <a href="electrical%20engineer">electrical engineer</a>, and Agnes Eliza Radford (née Knight). The eldest of four children, he was described as bright and energetic in his youth. When Arthur was six years old the family moved to <a href="Riverside%2C%20Illinois">Riverside, Illinois</a>, where his father took a job as a managing engineer with <a href="Commonwealth%20Edison%20Company">Commonwealth Edison Company</a>. John Radford managed the first <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> engines in the United States, at the <a href="Fisk%20Street%20Generating%20Station">Fisk Street Generating Station</a>.

Arthur began his school years at Riverside Public School, where he expressed an interest in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> from a young age. He gained an interest in <a href="aviation">aviation</a> during a visit to the <a href="1904%20World%27s%20Fair">1904 World's Fair</a> in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. By <a href="fourth%20grade">fourth grade</a>, he frequently drew detailed cross-section diagrams of the . He was shy, but performed very well in school. In mid-1910, Radford moved with his family to <a href="Grinnell%2C%20Iowa">Grinnell, Iowa</a>, and attended <a href="Grinnell%20High%20School">Grinnell High School</a> for a year and a half, before deciding to apply to the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>. He obtained the local <a href="United%20States%20Congress">congressman</a>'s recommendation for an appointment to the academy, and was accepted. After several months of tutoring at <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>, he entered the academy in July 1912, at the age of sixteen.

Although Radford's first year at the academy was mediocre he applied himself to his studies in his remaining years there. He participated in summer cruises to Europe in 1913 and 1914 and passed through the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> in 1916. Radford, known as "Raddie" to his fellow students, graduated 59th of 177 in the class of 1916, and was <a href="commissioned%20officer">commissioned</a> as an <a href="ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

Radford's first duty was aboard the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> , as it escorted a transatlantic convoy to France in 1918. In his second post he was an <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to a battleship division commander, and in his third, a <a href="flag%20lieutenant">flag lieutenant</a> for another battleship division commander.
In 1920, Radford reported to <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a>, for <a href="flight%20training">flight training</a>, and was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20%28US%20Navy%29">lieutenant</a> soon thereafter. During the 1920s and 1930s his sea duty alternated among several aircraft squadrons, fleet staffs, and tours in the U.S. with the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a>. It was during this time, while he served under <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="William%20Moffett">William Moffett</a>, that he frequently interacted with politicians and picked up the political acumen that would become useful later in his career. While he did not attend the <a href="Naval%20War%20College">Naval War College</a>, as other rising officers did, Radford established himself as an effective officer who would speak his mind frankly, even to superiors.

Radford achieved the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20commander%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant commander</a> by 1927, and served with aircraft units aboard , , and . In 1936, he was promoted to <a href="Commander%20%28US%20Navy%29">commander</a> and took charge of fighter squadron <a href="VF-1B">VF-1B</a> aboard . By 1939, he was given command of <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Seattle">Naval Air Station Seattle</a> in <a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>. On 22 April 1939, he married Miriam J. (Ham) Spencer at <a href="Vancouver%20Barracks%2C%20Washington">Vancouver Barracks, Washington</a>. Spencer (1895–1997) was a daughter of George Ham of <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, and the former wife of (1) Albert Cressey Maze (1891–1943), with whom she had a son, Robert Claude Maze Sr., Major, USMC who was killed in action in 1945 and (2) <a href="Earl%20Winfield%20Spencer%20Jr.">Earl Winfield Spencer Jr.</a> In May 1940, Radford was appointed <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a> of the , a post he served in for one year.

In July 1941, Radford was appointed commander of the Naval Air Station in <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, <a href="British%20West%20Indies">British West Indies</a>. He protested this appointment because he feared he would remain there for years, sidelined as World War II loomed. In the event he only remained in this station for three months, following an organizational shift in the Bureau of Aeronautics. By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators. Further, at that time, the vast difference in the performance of combat aircraft over training aircraft meant that pilots needed more time in combat aircraft before becoming proficient in them. Radford was subsequently visited by <a href="Artemus%20L.%20Gates">Artemus L. Gates</a>, <a href="Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy%20%28AIR%29">Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air</a>. The latter was so impressed that he ordered Rear Admiral <a href="John%20H.%20Towers">John H. Towers</a>, chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, to transfer Radford to a newly formed training division.

Radford took command of the Aviation Training Division in Washington, D.C. on 1 December 1941, seven days before the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> that brought the United States into World War II. He was appointed as Director of Aviation Training for both the Office of the <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a> and the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Navigation">Bureau of Navigation</a>; the double appointment helped to centralize training coordination for all naval aviators. With the U.S. mobilizing for war, Radford's office worked long hours six days a week in an effort to build up the necessary training infrastructure as quickly as possible. For several months, this around-the-clock work took up all of his time, and he later noted that walking to work was his only form of exercise for several months. During this time, he impressed colleagues with a direct and no-nonsense approach to work, while maintaining a demeanor that made him easy to work for. He was promoted to <a href="captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> soon after.

Throughout 1942 he established and refined the administrative infrastructure for aviation training. Radford oversaw the massive growth of the training division, establishing separate sections for administration; Physical Training Service Schools; and training devices; and sections to train various aviators in flight, aircraft operation, radio operation, and gunnery. The section also organized technical training and wrote training literature. He also engineered the establishment of four field commands for pilot training. Air Primary Training Command commanded all pre-flight schools and <a href="US%20Navy%20Reserve">Naval reserve</a> aviation bases in the country. Air Intermediate Training Command administered <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Pensacola">Naval Air Station Pensacola</a> and <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Corpus%20Christi">Naval Air Station Corpus Christi</a> where flight training was conducted. Air Operational Training Command was in charge of all education of pilots between pilot training and their first flying assignments. Finally, Air Technical Training Command trained enlisted men for support jobs in aviation such as maintenance, engineering, aerography, and parachute operations. Radford sought to integrate his own efficient leadership style into the organization of these schools.

Radford was noted for thinking progressively and innovatively to establish the most effective and efficient training programs. He sought to integrate <a href="sports%20conditioning">sports conditioning</a> programs into naval aviator training. Radford brought in athletic directors from <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a>, <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> and <a href="Penn%20State%20University">Penn State University</a> under <a href="American%20football">football</a> player and naval aviator <a href="Tom%20Hamilton%20%28American%20football%29">Tom Hamilton</a>, to whom he gave the remit to develop the conditioning programs. Radford also suggested integrating women into intricate but repetitive tasks, such as running <a href="flight%20simulator">flight simulator</a>s. When commanders rejected the idea of bringing women into the service, he convinced Congressman <a href="Carl%20Vinson">Carl Vinson</a>, chair of the House Naval Affairs Committee of the merit of the idea. This effort eventually led to the employment of the "<a href="Women%20Accepted%20for%20Volunteer%20Emergency%20Service">Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service</a>", and 23,000 WAVES would assist in aeronautical training in the course of the war. Radford also sought to best use the assets of businessmen and professionals who had volunteered for military service, establishing the Aviation Indoctrination School and Air Combat Intelligence School at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Quonset%20Point">Naval Air Station Quonset Point</a> so as to enable these advanced recruits to become more experienced naval officers.

By early 1943, with Radford's training programs established and functioning efficiently, he sought combat duty. In April of that year, he was ordered to report to the office of <a href="Commander%2C%20Naval%20Air%20Forces%2C%20Pacific%20Fleet">Commander, Naval Air Forces, Pacific Fleet</a> where he was promoted to rear admiral and tapped to be a carrier division commander. This was an unusual appointment, as most carrier division commanders were appointed only after duty commanding a <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>. He then spent May and June 1943 on an inspection party under Gates, touring U.S. bases in the south Pacific. Following this, he was assigned under Rear Admiral <a href="Frederick%20C.%20Sherman">Frederick C. Sherman</a>, commander of <a href="Carrier%20Division%202">Carrier Division 2</a> at <a href="Naval%20Station%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>. Radford spent several weeks observing flight operations and carrier tactics for various ships operating out of Hawaii. He was particularly impressed with how carrier doctrine had evolved in the time since his own assignment on a carrier, and in June 1943, he was ordered to observe operations on the <a href="light%20aircraft%20carrier">light aircraft carrier</a> , learning the unique challenges of using light carriers.

On 21 July 1943, Radford was given command of <a href="Carrier%20Division%20Eleven">Carrier Division Eleven</a>, which consisted of the new <a href="Essex-class%20aircraft%20carrier">"Essex"-class carrier</a> as well as the light carriers USS "Independence" and . These carriers remained at Pearl Harbor through August, training and refining their operations. Radford got his first operational experience on 1 September 1943, covering a foray to <a href="Baker%20Island">Baker</a> and <a href="Howland%20Island">Howland Island</a>s as part of Task Force 11 under Rear Admiral <a href="Willis%20A.%20Lee">Willis A. Lee</a>. Radford commanded "Princeton", and four destroyers to act as a covering force for Lee's marines, who built an airfield on the islands. After this successful operation, and at the direction of Admiral <a href="Chester%20W.%20Nimitz">Chester W. Nimitz</a>, Task Force 11 was joined by Task Force 15, with "Lexington", under Rear Admiral <a href="Charles%20A.%20Pownall">Charles A. Pownall</a>. The two task forces then steamed for <a href="Tarawa%20Atoll">Tarawa Atoll</a> to strike it. On the night of 17 September, the carriers launched six strikes of <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>, <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s, and <a href="torpedo%20planes">torpedo planes</a> to work over the Japanese defenses.

Next, Radford and his carriers took part in an air attack and cruiser bombardment of <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a> on 5 to 6 October 1943. He shifted his flag to "Lexington" for the operation, which took two days. Though the effects on Japanese positions were not known, Radford and other leaders considered the operations useful for preparing their forces for the major battles to come in the <a href="Central%20Pacific%20Area">Central Pacific</a>.

Major operations in the Central Pacific began that November. Radford's next duty was in <a href="Operation%20Galvanic">Operation Galvanic</a>, a campaign into the <a href="Gilbert%20Islands">Gilbert Islands</a> with the objective of capturing Tarawa as well as <a href="Makin%20%28islands%29">Makin Island</a> and <a href="Abemama">Apamama Atoll</a>. It would be one of the first times that American carriers would be operating against Japanese land-based air power in force, as <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> troops and <a href="U.S.%20Marines">U.S. Marines</a> fought the Japanese on the ground. For this mission, Radford's carrier division was designated Task Group 50.2, the Northern Carrier Group, which consisted of , "Belleau Wood" and . He did not agree with this strategy, maintaining until his death that the force should have gone on an offensive to strike Japanese air power instead of being tied to the ground forces. Despite his objections, the force left Pearl Harbor for the Gilbert Islands on 10 November.

The invasion began on 20 November. Radford's force was occupied with <a href="air%20strike">air strike</a>s on Japanese ground targets, and faced frequent attack by Japanese aircraft in night combat, which U.S. aircrews were not well prepared or equipped for. He improvised a unit to counter Japanese night raids, and was later credited with establishing routines for nighttime <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a>s to protect carriers; these were adopted fleetwide. He commanded Carrier Division Eleven around Tarawa for several more days, returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 December.

Returning from Tarawa, Radford was reassigned as <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a> to Towers, who was Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet. He assisted in planning upcoming operations, including <a href="Operation%20Flintlock%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Operation Flintlock</a>, the invasion of the Marshall Islands. He had hoped to return to combat duty at the end of this assignment, but in March 1944 he was ordered to Washington, D.C. and appointed as <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Deputy Chief of Naval Operations</a>. He assumed this new duty on 1 April, a role which was primarily administrative in nature. His duties included establishing a new integrated system for aircraft maintenance, supply, and retirement, for which he was appointed the head of a board to study aircraft wear and tear. After six months in this duty, Radford was returned to the Pacific theater by Admiral <a href="Ernest%20J.%20King">Ernest J. King</a>, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commander in Chief, <a href="United%20States%20Fleet">United States Fleet</a>.

Radford returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 October 1944, where he was appointed as commander of First Carrier Task Force, <a href="Carrier%20Division%20Six">Carrier Division Six</a>. While flying to his new command, he was held over in Kwajalein and then Saipan, missing the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> which took place in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> during the layover. He flew to <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> where he reported to Vice Admiral <a href="John%20S.%20McCain%2C%20Sr.">John S. McCain, Sr.</a>, commander of <a href="Task%20Force%2058">Task Force 58</a>. For the next two months, Radford remained on "make learn" status, again under Sherman's command, observing the operations and employment of carrier-based air power as a passenger aboard , part of <a href="Task%20Group%2038.3">Task Group 38.3</a>. During this time, he observed the <a href="battle%20of%20Luzon">strikes on Luzon and the Visayas</a>, as well as air attacks on Japanese shipping and <a href="Typhoon%20Cobra%20%281944%29">Typhoon Cobra</a>.
On 29 December 1944, Radford was unexpectedly ordered to take command of Task Group 38.1 after its commander, Rear Admiral <a href="Alfred%20E.%20Montgomery">Alfred E. Montgomery</a>, was injured. The next day the fleet sortied from Ulithi and headed for scheduled air strikes on <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> and <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a> (Taiwan). Throughout January 1945, Radford's fleet operated in the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a> striking Japanese targets in <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a> and <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>. In February, the <a href="U.S.%20Third%20Fleet">U.S. Third Fleet</a> was re-designated the <a href="U.S.%20Fifth%20Fleet">U.S. Fifth Fleet</a>, and as a part of this reorganization Radford's force was redesignated Task Group 58.4. He continued striking Japanese targets in the <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Inland Sea</a> during March. On 1 April, the force was moved to support the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a>. Over the course of the next two months, his force continued its use of night raids, which by this point were effective in repelling Japanese attacks on U.S. Navy ships. After two months supporting ground forces on Okinawa, Radford's fleet was detached from that operation.

Returning to the Third Fleet and being re-designated Task Group 38.4, the force began operating off the <a href="Japanese%20Home%20Islands">Japanese Home Islands</a> in July 1945. It began an intense airstrike campaign against military targets on <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a> and <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>, striking Japanese airfields, merchant shipping, and ground targets. Radford commanded the force in this duty until <a href="V-J%20Day">V-J Day</a>, the end of the war in the Pacific. Upon receipt of the orders to end hostilities, he signaled his ships that he was proud of their accomplishments.

Radford was promoted to vice admiral in late 1945. For a time he was <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Deputy Chief of Naval Operations</a> for Air under <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="James%20V.%20Forrestal">James V. Forrestal</a>. During the <a href="post-war%20period">post-war period</a>, Radford was a strong advocate that naval aviation programs be maintained. When <a href="Fleet%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Fleet Admiral</a> Ernest J. King issued a post-war plan calling for the U.S. to maintain nine active aircraft carriers, Radford suggested he double the number, a politically unrealistic proposal.

After the war, Radford was a principal opponent to a plan to merge the <a href="uniformed%20services%20of%20the%20United%20States">uniformed services</a>. A plan existed to split the Army and the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Air%20Forces">Army Air Forces</a> into separate branches and unite them and the Navy under one <a href="United%20States%20Cabinet">Cabinet</a>-level defense organization. Fearing the loss of their branch's influence, Navy commanders opposed the formation of a separate Air Force and favored a more loose defense organization. Radford was picked by Forrestal to form the Secretary's Committee of Research and Reorganization. Months of discussion resulted in the <a href="National%20Security%20Act%20of%201947">National Security Act of 1947</a>, a political victory for the Navy because it created the <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a> while resulting in a coordinated, not unified, <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a> with limited power and with the Navy maintaining control of its air assets. In 1947, Radford was briefly appointed commander of the <a href="United%20States%20Second%20Fleet">Second Task Fleet</a>, a move he felt was to distance him from the budget negotiations in Washington, but nonetheless preferred.

In 1948, Radford was appointed by President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> as the <a href="Vice%20Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Vice Chief of Naval Operations</a> (VCNO). Debates continued with military leaders about the future of the armed forces as Truman sought to trim the defense budget. Radford was relied on by Navy leaders as an expert who would fiercely defend the Navy's interests from budget restrictions, but his appointment as VCNO was opposed by Fleet Admiral <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a>, who feared his hard-line stance on the budget would alienate the generals in the other branches of the military. Some historians contend Radford brought strong leadership to the role. Naval aviation assets grew from 2,467 aircraft to 3,467 during this time, almost all aircraft for fast-attack carriers. He also oversaw the implementation of the "Full Air Program" which envisioned 14,500 total aircraft in the naval air force. Along with his predecessor <a href="John%20Dale%20Price">John Dale Price</a>, he favored reducing naval ship strength in order to develop stronger naval aviation capabilities. Then, in 1949, Truman appointed him as the <a href="High%20Commissioner%20of%20the%20Trust%20Territory%20of%20the%20Pacific%20Islands">High Commissioner</a> of the <a href="Trust%20Territory%20of%20the%20Pacific%20Islands">Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands</a>.

In April 1949, Truman appointed Radford to the position of <a href="Commander%2C%20U.S.%20Pacific%20Fleet">Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet</a>. A staunch <a href="anticommunist">anticommunist</a>, Radford saw the greatest threat to U.S. security coming from Asia, not Europe. He traveled extensively throughout the Pacific as well as South Asia and the Far East. He became acquainted with political and military leaders in New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, <a href="Peninsular%20Malaysia">Malaya</a>, Burma, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, <a href="Taiwan">Formosa</a>, and Japan, and learned about the sociopolitical issues facing each nation and the region as a whole.

Despite his new office, Radford was soon recalled to Washington to continue hearings on the future of the U.S. military budget. He became a key figure in what would later be called the "<a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Admirals">Revolt of the Admirals</a>", which took place during April 1949 when the <a href="supercarrier">supercarrier</a> was cancelled.

At the request of Congressman <a href="Carl%20Vinson">Carl Vinson</a>, Radford strongly opposed plans by Secretary of Defense <a href="Louis%20A.%20Johnson">Louis Johnson</a> and Secretary of the Navy <a href="Francis%20P.%20Matthews">Francis P. Matthews</a> to make the <a href="Convair%20B-36">Convair B-36</a> the Air Force's principal bomber, calling it a "billion dollar blunder." Radford also questioned the Air Force's plan to focus on nuclear weapons delivery capabilities as its primary deterrent to war and called nuclear war "morally reprehensible". While the "United States" remained cancelled and the post-war cuts to the Navy were intact, funding was increasing during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> era for conventional forces.

Shortly after the outbreak of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> in June 1950, control of Vice Admiral <a href="Arthur%20D.%20Struble">Arthur D. Struble</a>'s <a href="U.S.%20Seventh%20Fleet">U.S. Seventh Fleet</a> was transferred from Radford to Vice Admiral <a href="C.%20Turner%20Joy">C. Turner Joy</a>, who was serving as Commander, Naval Forces, Far East. Joy's superior was General of the Army <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Command%20Korea">United Nations Command Korea</a> (UNC). As such, Radford exercised no direct responsibility over forces involved in the conflict.

Radford was an admirer of MacArthur and a proponent of his "<a href="Asia%20First">Asia First</a>" strategy. He supported <a href="Operation%20Chromite">Operation Chromite</a> in October 1950, as well as the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> mission of <a href="Korean%20reunification">Korean reunification</a>. He attended the <a href="Wake%20Island%20Conference">Wake Island Conference</a> between MacArthur and Truman on 15 October, and later recalled his belief that, should the Chinese intervene in the war, the U.S. could still prevail provided it was able to strike Chinese bases in <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> with air power. When the <a href="People%27s%20Volunteer%20Army">People's Volunteer Army</a> did intervene in favor of <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> the next month, Radford shared MacArthur's frustration at restrictions placed on the UN force in the war preventing it from striking Chinese soil. Once <a href="President%20Truman%27s%20relief%20of%20General%20Douglas%20MacArthur">Truman relieved MacArthur</a> in April 1951, Radford reportedly gave the general a "hero's welcome" in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> as he was returning to the United States.

As commander of U.S. forces in the Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an <a href="exit%20strategy">exit strategy</a> for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases and the use of nuclear weapons. This view was shared by <a href="Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="John%20Foster%20Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a> and UNC Commander General <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark W. Clark</a>, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, at a time when the Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>.

Eisenhower's official nomination for Radford came in mid-1953. Eisenhower was initially cautious about him because of his involvement in the <a href="inter-service%20rivalry">inter-service rivalry</a> and "revolt" in 1949. Radford's anticommunist views, however, as well as his knowledge of Asia and his support of Eisenhower's <a href="New%20Look%20%28policy%29">"New Look" defense policy</a>, made him an attractive nominee, particularly among <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>, to replace <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>. Eisenhower was also impressed with his "intelligence, dedication, tenacity, and courage to speak his mind." During his nomination, Radford indicated a changed outlook from the positions he had taken during the "Revolt of the Admirals". As chairman, he was eventually popular with both the president and Congress.

Radford was integral in formulating and executing the "New Look" policy, reducing spending on conventional military forces to favor a strong <a href="nuclear%20deterrent">nuclear deterrent</a> and a greater reliance on airpower. In this time, he had to overcome resistance from Army leaders who opposed the reduction of their forces, and Radford's decisions, unfettered by inter-service rivalry, impressed Eisenhower. In spite of his support of the "New Look", he disagreed with Eisenhower on several occasions when the president proposed drastic funding cuts that Radford worried would render the U.S. Navy ineffective. In late 1954, for example, Radford testified privately before a congressional committee that he felt some of Eisenhower's proposed defense cuts would limit the military's capability for "<a href="massive%20retaliation">massive retaliation</a>", but he kept his disagreements out of public view, working from within and seeking the funding to save specific strategic programs.

In 1956, Radford proposed protecting several military programs from funding cuts by reducing numbers of conventional forces, but the proposal was <a href="News%20leak">leaked</a> to the press, causing an uproar in Congress and among U.S. military allies, and the plan was dropped. In 1957, after the other <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> again disagreed on how to downsize force levels amid more budget restrictions, Radford submitted ideas for less dramatic force downsizing directly to Secretary of Defense <a href="Charles%20Erwin%20Wilson">Charles Erwin Wilson</a>, who agreed to pass them along to Eisenhower.

While Radford remained Eisenhower's principal adviser for the budget, they differed on matters of <a href="foreign%20policy">foreign policy</a>. Radford advocated the use of nuclear weapons and a firm military and diplomatic stance against China. Early in his tenure, he suggested to Eisenhower a <a href="preventive%20war">preventive war</a> against China or the Soviet Union while the U.S. possessed a nuclear advantage and before it became entangled in conflicts in the Far East. Eisenhower immediately dismissed this idea.

After France requested U.S. assistance for its <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">beleaguered force at Dien Bien Phu</a> in 1954, Radford suggested an aggressive stance toward the <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a>, recommending the U.S. threaten them with nuclear weapons as it had with the Chinese in Korea.

Dan Leno

George Wild Galvin (20 December 1860 – 31 October 1904), better known by the stage name Dan Leno, was a leading English <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> comedian and musical theatre actor during the late <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. He was best known, aside from his music hall act, for his <a href="pantomime%20dame">dame</a> roles in the annual <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>s that were popular at London's <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, from 1888 to 1904.

Leno was born in <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20London">St Pancras</a>, London, and began to entertain as a child. In 1864, he joined his parents on stage in their music hall act, and he made his first solo appearance, aged nine, at the Britannia Music Hall in <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a>. As a youth, he was famous for his <a href="clog%20dancing">clog dancing</a>, and in his teen years, he became the star of his family's act. He adopted the stage name Dan Leno and, in 1884, made his first performance under that name in London. As a solo artist, he became increasingly popular during the late 1880s and 1890s, when he was one of the highest-paid comedians in the world. He developed a music hall act of talking about life's mundane subjects, mixed with comic songs and <a href="surreal%20humour">surreal</a> observations, and created a host of mostly working-class characters to illustrate his stories. In 1901, still at the peak of his career, he performed his "Huntsman" sketch for <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a> at <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham</a>. The monarch was so impressed that Leno became publicly known as "the king's jester".

Leno also appeared in <a href="Victorian%20burlesques">burlesque</a> and, every year from 1888 to 1904, in the Drury Lane Theatre's Christmas pantomime spectacles. He was generous and active in charitable causes, especially to benefit performers in need. Leno continued to appear in musical comedies and his own music hall routines until 1902, although he suffered increasingly from alcoholism. This, together with his long association with dame and <a href="low%20comedy">low comedy</a> roles, prevented him from being taken seriously as a dramatic actor, and he was turned down for <a href="Shakespearean">Shakespearean</a> roles. Leno began to behave in an erratic and furious manner by 1902, and he suffered a mental breakdown in early 1903. He was committed to a mental asylum, but was discharged later that year. After one more show, his health declined, and he died aged 43.

Leno was born in <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20London">St Pancras</a>, London. He was the youngest of six children, including two elder brothers, John and Henry, and an elder sister, Frances. Two other siblings died in infancy. His parents, John Galvin (1826–1864) and his wife Louisa (<a href="Married%20and%20maiden%20names">"née"</a> Dutton; 1831–1891), performed together in a <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> double act called "The Singing and Acting Duettists". Known professionally as Mr. and Mrs. Johnny Wild, they did not achieve much success, and the family struggled in poverty.

Having had very little schooling, and being raised by performers, Leno learned to entertain as a child. In 1862, Leno's parents and elder brothers appeared at the Surrey Music Hall in <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, then performed in northern cities later in the year. In 1864, at the age of four, Leno joined his parents on stage for the first time, at the Cosmotheca Music Hall in <a href="Paddington">Paddington</a>, under the billing "Little George, the Infant Wonder, Contortionist, and Posturer".

When Leno was four years old, his alcoholic father died, aged 37. The family moved to <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> a few months later, where his mother married William Grant (1837–1896), on 7 March 1866. Grant was a comedian of <a href="Lancashire">Lancastrian</a> and Irish descent, who performed in music halls throughout the British provinces under the stage name of William Leno. He was a seasoned actor and had previously been employed by <a href="Charles%20Kean">Charles Kean</a> in his theatre company at the <a href="Princess%27s%20Theatre%2C%20London">Princess's Theatre</a> in London. In 1866, the family home in <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a> was demolished to make way for <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">St Pancras railway station</a> and, as a result, Leno's sister Frances was sent to live with an uncle, while his brother John, who performed occasionally with his parents, took full-time employment. Leno, his mother, stepfather and brother Henry moved north and settled in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, where they performed in various halls and theatres, including the Star Music Hall, but they often returned to London to perform in the capital's music halls.

In 1865, Leno and his brother Henry, who first taught Leno to dance, formed a <a href="clogging">clog dancing</a> double act known as "The Great Little Lenos". This was the first time that Leno used his stepfather's stage name, "Leno", which he never registered legally. The same year, Leno also appeared in his first pantomime, in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, where he had a supporting part as a juvenile clown in "Fortunatus; or, The Magic Wishing Cap" alongside his parents, who appeared as "Mr and Mrs Leno – Comic Duettists". On 18 July 1866, Leno, Henry and their parents appeared on the opening night of the Cambridge Music Hall in <a href="Toxteth">Toxteth</a>, Liverpool, under the billing "Mr. and Mrs. Leno, the Great, Sensational, Dramatic and Comic Duettists and The Brothers Leno, Lancashire Clog, Boot and Pump Dancers". The following year, the brothers made their first appearance without their parents at the <a href="Britannia%20Theatre">Britannia music hall</a> in <a href="Hoxton">Hoxton</a>. Although initially successful, the pair would experience many bouts of unemployment and often <a href="Street%20performance">busked</a> outside London pubs to make a living. Tired of surviving on little or no money, Henry left the clog dancing act to take up a trade in London, forcing Leno to consider a future as a solo performer. Henry later founded a dance school. Soon, however, Henry was replaced intermittently in the act by the boys' uncle, Johnny Danvers, who was a week older than Leno. Leno and Danvers were close from an early age.

Leno made his debut as a solo performer in 1869, returning to the Britannia music hall in Hoxton, where he became known as "The Great Little Leno, the Quintessence of Irish Comedians". The name was suggested by his stepfather, William, who thought the Irish connection would appeal to audiences on their upcoming visit to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. Arriving in Ireland the same year, the Lenos were struggling financially and stayed with William's relatives. In addition to his performances as part of the family act, young Leno appeared as a solo act under an Irish-sounding stage name, "Dan Patrick". This allowed him to earn a separate fee of 23 <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shillings</a> per performance plus living expenses. The name "Dan" was chosen to honour Dan Lowery, a northern music hall comedian and music hall proprietor whom the Lenos had met a few months earlier. During this tour of Ireland, the Lenos appeared in Dublin in a pantomime written by Leno's father: "Old King Humpty; or, Harlequin Emerald Isle and Katty of Killarney" (1869), in which Leno received praise from <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, who was in the audience and told him: "Good little man, you'll make headway!"

In 1870, the Lenos appeared in another pantomime by Leno's father, "Jack the Giant Killer; or, Harlequin Grim Gosling, or the Good Fairy Queen of the Golden Pine Grove", in which Leno played the title character and also featured in the variety entertainment that preceded the pantomime. This was his last theatrical role until 1886. Throughout the 1870s, Leno and his parents performed as "The Comic Trio (Mr. & Mrs. Leno and Dan Patrick) In Their Really Funny Entertainments, Songs and Dances". In the family act with his parents and Danvers, young Leno often took the leading role in such sketches as his stepfather's "The Wicklow Wedding". Another of their sketches was "Torpedo Bill", in which Leno played the title role, an inventor of explosive devices. His parents played a "washerwoman" and a "comic cobbler". This was followed by another sketch, "Pongo the Monkey". Opening at Pullan's Theatre of Varieties in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a> on 20 May 1878, this burlesque featured Leno as an escaped monkey; it became his favourite sketch of the period.

The teenage Leno's growing popularity led to bookings at, among others, the Varieties Theatre in Sheffield and the Star Music Hall in Manchester. At the same time, Leno's clog dancing continued to be so good that in 1880 he won the world championship at the Princess's Music Hall in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>, for which he received a gold and silver belt weighing 44.5 oz (1.26 kg). His biographer, the pantomime librettist J. Hickory Wood, described his act: "He danced on the stage; he danced on a pedestal; he danced on a slab of slate; he was encored over and over again; but throughout his performance, he never uttered a word".

In 1878, Leno and his family moved to Manchester. There, he met Lydia Reynolds, who, in 1883, joined the Leno family theatre company, which already consisted of his parents, Danvers and Leno. The following year, Leno and Reynolds married; around this time, he adopted the stage name "Dan Leno". On 10 March 1884, the Leno family took over the running of the Grand Varieties Theatre in Sheffield. The Lenos felt comfortable with their working class Sheffield audiences. On their opening night, over 4,000 patrons entered the theatre, paying sixpence to see Dan Leno star in "Doctor Cut 'Em Up". In October 1884, facing tough competition, the Lenos gave up the lease on the theatre.

In 1885, Leno and his wife moved to <a href="Clapham%20Park">Clapham Park</a>, London, and Leno gained new success with a solo act that featured comedy patter, dancing and song. On the night of his London debut, he appeared in three music halls: the Foresters' Music Hall in <a href="Mile%20End">Mile End</a>, <a href="New%20London%20Theatre">Middlesex Music Hall</a> in Drury Lane and <a href="Carlo%20Gatti">Gatti</a>'s-in-the-Road, where he earned £5 a week in total (£ in 2019 adjusted for inflation). Although billed as "The Great Irish Comic Vocalist and Clog Champion" at first, he slowly phased out his dancing in favour of character studies, such as "Going to Buy Milk for the Twins", "When Rafferty Raffled his Watch" and "The Railway Guard". His dancing had earned him popularity in the provinces, but Leno found that his London audiences preferred these sketches and his comic songs. Leno's other London venues in the late 1880s included the Collins Music Hall in <a href="Islington">Islington</a>, the Queen's Theatre in <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a> and the Standard in <a href="Pimlico">Pimlico</a>.

Leno was a replacement in the role of Leontes in the 1888 <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">musical burlesque</a> of the ancient Greek character "<a href="Atalanta">Atalanta</a>" at the <a href="Novello%20Theatre">Strand Theatre</a>, directed by <a href="Charles%20Hawtrey%20%28stage%20actor%29">Charles Hawtrey</a>. It was written by Hawtrey's brother, George P. Hawtrey, and it starred <a href="Frank%20Wyatt%20%28singer%29">Frank Wyatt</a>, <a href="Willie%20Warde">Willie Warde</a> and William Hawtrey. The "<a href="Illustrated%20Sporting%20and%20Dramatic%20News">Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News</a>" praised Leno's singing and dancing and reported that: "He brings a good deal of fun and quaintness to the not very important part of Leontes." Leno accepted the role at short notice, with no opportunity to learn the script. But his improvised comedy helped to extend the life of the show. When Leno and another leading actor left a few months later, the production closed.

During the 1890s, Leno was the leading performer on the music hall stage, rivalled only by <a href="Albert%20Chevalier">Albert Chevalier</a>, who moved into music hall from the legitimate theatre. Their styles and appeal were very different: Leno's characters were gritty working-class realists, while Chevalier's were overflowing in romanticism, and his act depicted an affluent point of view. The two represented the opposite poles of <a href="cockney">cockney</a> comedy.

For his music hall acts, Leno created characters that were based on observations about life in London, including <a href="wikt%3Ashopwalker">shopwalkers</a>, grocer's assistants, <a href="beefeater">beefeater</a>s, huntsmen, racegoers, firemen, fathers, henpecked husbands, garrulous wives, pantomime dames, a police officer, a Spanish bandit, a fireman and a hairdresser. One such character was Mrs. Kelly, a gossip. Leno would sing a verse of a song, then begin a monologue, often his "You know Mrs. Kelly?" routine, which became a well-known <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a>: "You see we had a row once, and it was all through Mrs. Kelly. You know Mrs. Kelly, of course. ... Oh, you must know Mrs. Kelly; everybody knows Mrs. Kelly."
For his London acts, Leno purchased songs from the foremost music hall writers and composers. One such composer was Harry King, who wrote many of Leno's early successes. Other well-known composers of the day who supplied Leno with numbers included <a href="Harry%20Dacre">Harry Dacre</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Tabrar">Joseph Tabrar</a>. From 1890, Leno commissioned George Le Brunn to compose the incidental music to many of his songs, including "The Detective", "My Old Man", "Chimney on Fire", "The Fasting Man", "The Jap", "All Through A Little Piece of Bacon" and "The Detective Camera". Le Brunn also provided the incidental music for three of Leno's best-known songs that depicted life in everyday occupations: "The Railway Guard" (1890), "The Shopwalker" and "The Waiter" (both from 1891). The songs in each piece became instantly distinctive and familiar to Leno's audiences, but his occasional changes to the characterisations kept the sketches fresh and topical.

"The Railway Guard" featured Leno in a mad characterisation of a railway station guard dressed in an ill-fitting uniform, with an unkempt beard and a whistle. The character was created by exaggerating the behaviour that Leno saw in a real employee at Brixton station who concerned himself in other people's business while, at the same time, not doing any work. "The Shopwalker" was full of comic one-liners and was heavily influenced by <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>. Leno played the part of a shop assistant, again of manic demeanour, enticing imaginary clientele into the shop before launching into a frantic selling technique sung in verse. Leno's depiction of "The Waiter", dressed in an oversized dinner jacket and loose-fitting white dickey, which would flap up and hit his face, was of a man consumed in self-pity and indignation. Overworked, overwrought and overwhelmed by the number of his customers, the waiter gave out excuses for the bad service faster than the customers could complain:

Leno's first London appearance in pantomime was as Dame Durden in "<a href="Jack%20and%20the%20Beanstalk">Jack and the Beanstalk</a>", which he performed at London's <a href="Surrey%20Theatre">Surrey Theatre</a> in 1886, having been spotted singing "Going to Buy Milk" by the Surrey Theatre manager, George Conquest. Conquest also hired Leno's wife to star in the production. The pantomime was a success, and Leno received rave reviews; as a result, he was booked to star as Tinpanz the Tinker in the following year's pantomime, which had the unique title of "Sinbad and the Little Old Man of the Sea; or, The Tinker, the Tailor, the Soldier, the Sailor, Apothecary, Ploughboy, Gentleman Thief".

After these pantomime performances proved popular with audiences, Leno was hired in 1888 by <a href="Augustus%20Harris">Augustus Harris</a>, manager at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, to appear in that year's Christmas pantomime, "<a href="Babes%20in%20the%20Wood">Babes in the Wood</a>". Harris's pantomime productions at the huge theatre were known for their extravagance and splendour. Each one had a cast of over a hundred performers, ballet dancers, acrobats, <a href="marionettes">marionettes</a> and animals, and included an elaborate <a href="transformation%20scene">transformation scene</a> and an energetic <a href="harlequinade">harlequinade</a>. Often they were partly written by Harris. <a href="Herbert%20Campbell">Herbert Campbell</a> and <a href="Harry%20Nicholls%20%28comedian%29">Harry Nicholls</a> starred with Leno in the next fifteen Christmas productions at Drury Lane. Campbell had appeared in the theatre's previous five pantomimes and was a favourite of the writer of those productions, <a href="Edward%20Litt%20Laman%20Blanchard">E. L. Blanchard</a>. Blanchard left the theatre when Leno was hired, believing that music hall performers were unsuitable for his Christmas pantomimes. This was not a view shared by audiences or the critics, one of whom wrote: 
"Babes in the Wood" was a triumph: the theatre reported record attendance, and the run was extended until 27 April 1889. Leno considerably reduced his music-hall engagements as a consequence. Nevertheless, between April and October 1889, Leno appeared simultaneously at the <a href="Empire%2C%20Leicester%20Square">Empire Theatre</a> and the <a href="Oxford%20Music%20Hall">Oxford Music Hall</a>, performing his one-man show. By this time, Leno was much in demand and had bookings for the next three years. On 9 May 1889 he starred for George P. Hawtrey in a matinee of "Penelope", a musical version of a famous farce "The Area Belle", to benefit the Holborn Lodge for Shop Girls. In this benefit, he played the role of Pitcher opposite the seasoned <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> performer <a href="Rutland%20Barrington">Rutland Barrington</a>. "The Times" considered that his performance treated the piece "too much in the manner of pantomime". During Leno's long association with the <a href="Drury%20Lane%20pantomime">Drury Lane pantomime</a>s, he appeared chiefly as the <a href="pantomime%20dame">dame</a>. After Harris died in 1896, <a href="Arthur%20Collins%20%28theatre%20manager%29">Arthur Collins</a> became the manager of the theatre and oversaw (and often helped to write) the pantomimes.

In their pantomimes, the diminutive Leno and the massive Campbell were a visually comic duo. They would often deviate from the script, improvising freely. This was met with some scepticism by producers, who feared that the scenes would not be funny to audiences and observed that, in any event, they were rarely at their best until a few nights after opening. <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> wrote of one appearance: "I hope I never again have to endure anything more dismally futile", and the English essayist and caricaturist <a href="Max%20Beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</a> stated that "Leno does not do himself justice collaborating with the public". He noted, however, that Leno "was exceptional in giving each of his dames a personality of her own, from extravagant queen to artless gossip". In "Sleeping Beauty", Leno and Campbell caused the audience to laugh even when they could not see them: they would arrive on stage in closed <a href="palanquins">palanquins</a> and exchange the lines, "Have you anything to do this afternoon, my dear?" – "No, I have nothing on", before being carried off again. Leno and Campbell's pantomimes from 1889 were "Jack and the Beanstalk" (1889 and 1899), "<a href="Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast">Beauty and the Beast</a>" (1890 and 1900), "<a href="Humpty%20Dumpty">Humpty Dumpty</a>" (1891 and 1903), "<a href="Little%20Bo-Peep">Little Bo-Peep</a>" (1892), "<a href="Robinson%20Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a>" (1893), "<a href="Dick%20Whittington%20and%20His%20Cat">Dick Whittington and His Cat</a>" (1894), "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a>" (1895), "<a href="Aladdin">Aladdin</a>" (1896), "<a href="Babes%20in%20the%20Wood">Babes in the Wood</a>" (1897) and the "<a href="Ali%20Baba">Forty Thieves</a>" (1898).
Leno considered the dame roles in two of his last pantomimes, "<a href="Bluebeard">Bluebeard</a>" (1901) and "<a href="Mother%20Goose">Mother Goose</a>" (1902), written by J. Hickory Wood, to be his favourites. He was paid £200 (£ in 2019 adjusted for inflation) for each of the pantomime seasons. Leno appeared at Drury Lane as Sister Anne in "Bluebeard", a character described by Wood as "a sprightly, somewhat below middle aged person who was of a coming on disposition and who had not yet abandoned hope" "The Times" drama critic noted: "It is a quite peculiar and original Sister Anne, who dances breakdowns and sings strange ballads to a still stranger harp and plays ping-pong with a frying-pan and potatoes and burlesques Sherlock Holmes and wears the oddest of garments and dresses her hair like Miss Morleena Kenwigs, and speaks in a piping voice – in short it is none other than Dan Leno whom we all know". "Mother Goose" provided Leno with one of the most challenging roles of his career, in which he was required to portray the same woman in several different guises. Wood's idea, that neither fortune nor beauty would bring happiness, was illustrated by a series of magical character transformations. The poor, unkempt and generally ugly Mother Goose eventually became a rich and beautiful but tasteless <a href="parvenu">parvenu</a>, searching for a suitor. The production was one of Drury Lane's most successful pantomimes, running until 28 March 1903.

In 1896, the impresario Milton Bode approached Leno with a proposal for a farcical musical comedy vehicle devised for him called "Orlando Dando, the Volunteer", by <a href="Basil%20Hood">Basil Hood</a> with music by <a href="Walter%20Slaughter">Walter Slaughter</a>. Leno's agent declined the offer, as his client was solidly booked for two years. Bode offered Leno £625 (£ in 2019 adjusted for inflation) for a six-week appearance in 1898. Upon hearing this, the comedian overrode his agent and accepted the offer. Leno toured the provinces in the piece and was an immediate success. So popular was his performance that Bode re-engaged him for a further two shows: the musical farce "In Gay Piccadilly!" (1899), by <a href="George%20R.%20Sims">George R. Sims</a>, in which Leno's uncle, Johnny Danvers appeared ("The Era" said that Leno was "attracting huge houses" and called him "excruciatingly funny"); and the musical comedy "Mr. Wix of Wickham" (1902). Both toured after their original runs. In 1897, Leno went to America and made his debut on 12 April of that year at <a href="Olympia%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%29">Hammerstein's Olympia Music Hall</a> on Broadway, where he was billed as "The Funniest Man on Earth". Reviews were mixed: one newspaper reported that the house roared its approval, while another complained that Leno's English humour was out of date. His American engagement came to an end a month later, and Leno said that it was "the crown of my career". Despite his jubilation, Leno was conscious of the few negative reviews he had received and rejected all later offers to tour the United States and Australia.

The same year, the comedian lent his name and writing talents to "Dan Leno's Comic Journal". The paper was primarily aimed at young adults and featured a mythologised version of Leno – the first comic paper to take its name from, and base a central character on, a living person. Published by <a href="Sir%20Arthur%20Pearson%2C%201st%20Baronet">C. Arthur Pearson</a>, Issue No. 1 appeared on 26 February 1898, and the paper sold 350,000 copies a year. Leno wrote most of the paper's comic stories and jokes, and <a href="Tom%20Browne%20%28illustrator%29">Tom Browne</a> contributed many of the illustrations. The comedian retained editorial control of the paper, deciding which items to omit. The Journal was known for its slogans, including "One Touch of Leno Makes the Whole World Grin" and "Won't wash clothes but will mangle melancholy". The cover always showed a caricature of Leno and his editorial staff at work and play. Inside, the features included "Daniel's Diary", "Moans from the Martyr", two yarns, a couple of dozen cartoons and "Leno's Latest – Fresh Jokes and Wheezes Made on the Premises". After a run of nearly two years the novelty wore off, and Leno lost interest. The paper shut down on 2 December 1899.
A journalist wrote, in the late 1890s, that Leno was "probably the highest paid funny man in the world". In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in <a href="Fulham">Fulham</a>, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, "Dan Leno: Hys Booke", in 1899, <a href="ghostwriter">ghostwritten</a> by T. C. Elder. Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: "I can honestly say that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was always doing something, and had something else to do afterwards; or he had just been somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to follow." That year, Leno performed the role of "waxi omo" (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, <a href="Bransby%20Williams">Bransby Williams</a>, <a href="Joe%20Elvin">Joe Elvin</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Stratton">Eugene Stratton</a>. The troupe's only performance was at the <a href="London%20Pavilion">London Pavilion</a> on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. Leno's song "The Funny Little Nigger" greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be "more or less, the last gasp of black-face minstrelsy in Britain".

Between 1901 and 1903, Leno recorded more than twenty-five <a href="Songs%2C%20sketches%20and%20monologues%20of%20Dan%20Leno">songs and monologues</a> on the <a href="Gramophone%20Company">Gramophone and Typewriter Company label</a>. He also made 14 short films towards the end of his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with <a href="Seymour%20Hicks">Seymour Hicks</a> and his wife, the actress <a href="Ellaline%20Terriss">Ellaline Terriss</a>, was invited to <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham House</a> to take part in a <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">Royal Command Performance</a> to entertain <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King Edward VII</a>, Queen <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra</a>, their son <a href="George%20V">George</a> and his wife, <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Mary</a>, the Prince and Princess of Wales. Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: "How to Buy a House" and "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny – I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal <a href="tie%20pin">tie pin</a>, and thereafter, Leno became known as "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.

In 1883, Leno met Sarah Lydia Reynolds (1866–1942), a young dancer and comedy singer from <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, while both were appearing at King Ohmy's Circus of Varieties, <a href="Rochdale">Rochdale</a>. The daughter of a stage carpenter, Lydia, as she was known professionally, was already an accomplished actress as a teenager: of her performance in "Sinbad the Sailor" in 1881, one critic wrote that she "played Zorlida very well for a young artiste. She is well known at this theatre and with proper training will prove a very clever actress." She and Leno married in 1884 in a discreet ceremony at St. George's Church, in <a href="Hulme">Hulme</a>, Manchester, soon after the birth of their first daughter, Georgina. A second child died in infancy, and John was born in 1888. Their three youngest children – Ernest (b. 1889), Sidney (b. 1891) and May (b. 1896) – all followed their father onto the stage. Sidney later performed as Dan Leno, Jr. After Leno's mother and stepfather retired from performing, Leno supported them financially until their deaths.

Leno owned of land at the back of his house in <a href="Clapham%20Park">Clapham Park</a>, and was <a href="self-sufficient">self-sufficient</a>, producing cabbages, potatoes, poultry, butter and eggs. He would also send these as gifts to friends and family at Christmas. In 1898, Leno and his family moved to 56 Akerman Road, <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>, where they lived for several years. A <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> was erected there in 1962 by the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a>.

The Terriers Association was established in 1890 to help retired artists in need of financial help. Leno was an active fundraiser in this and in the Music Hall Benevolent Fund, of which he became President. He was an early member of the entertainment charity <a href="Grand%20Order%20of%20Water%20Rats">Grand Order of Water Rats</a>, which helps performers who are in financial need, and served as its leader, the King Rat, in 1891, 1892 and 1897. Near the end of his life, Leno co-founded The Music Hall Artistes Railway Association, which entered a partnership with the Water Rats to form music hall's first trade union. Some of Leno's charity was discreet and unpublicised.

In the late 1890s, Leno formed a <a href="cricket">cricket</a> team called the "Dainties", for which he recruited many of the day's leading comedians and music hall stars. They played for charity against a variety of amateur teams willing to put up with their comedic mayhem, such as London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police Force</a>; Leno's and his teammates' tomfoolery on the green amused the large crowds that they drew. From 1898 to 1903, the Dainties continued to play matches across London. Two films of action from the matches were produced in 1900 for audiences of the new medium of cinema. In September 1901, at a major charity match, the press noted the carnival atmosphere. The comedians wore silly costumes – Leno was dressed as an undertaker and later as a schoolgirl riding a camel. Bands played, and clowns circulated through the crowd. The rival team of professional Surrey cricketers were persuaded to wear tall hats during the match. 18,000 spectators attended, contributing funds for music hall and cricketers' charities, among others.

Leno began to drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, like his father and stepfather before him, he had become an alcoholic. He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that began to affect his work. By 1902, Leno's angry and violent behaviour directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic. His erratic behaviour was often a result of his diminishing ability to remember his lines and inaudibility in performance. Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of "Bluebeard", Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left stuck up a tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of "Mother Goose" in 1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre's management, with an expensive silver dinner service. Leno rose to his feet and said: "Governor, it's a magnificent present! I congratulate you and you deserve it!"

Frustrated at not being accepted as a serious actor, Leno became obsessed with the idea of playing "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" and other great Shakespearean roles, inundating the actor–manager <a href="Herbert%20Beerbohm%20Tree">Herbert Beerbohm Tree</a> with his proposals. After his final run of "Mother Goose" at the Drury Lane Theatre in early 1903, Leno's delusions overwhelmed him. On the closing evening, and again soon afterwards, he travelled to the home of <a href="Constance%20Collier">Constance Collier</a>, who was Beerbohm Tree's leading lady at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">His Majesty's Theatre</a>, and also followed her to rehearsal there. He attempted to persuade her to act alongside him in a Shakespearean season that Leno was willing to fund. On the second visit to her home, Leno brought Collier a jewellery box holding a diamond-encrusted plaque. Recognising that Leno was having a mental breakdown, she sadly and gently refused his offer, and Leno left distraught.

Two days later, he was admitted into an asylum for the insane. Leno spent several months in Camberwell House Asylum, London, under the care of Dr. Savage, who treated Leno with "peace and quiet and a little water colouring". On his second day, Leno told a nurse that the clock was wrong. When she stated that it was right, Leno remarked, "Well if it's right, then what's it doing here?" Leno made several attempts to leave the asylum, twice being successful. He was found each time and promptly returned.

Upon Leno's release from the institution in October 1903, the press offered much welcoming commentary and speculated as to whether he would appear that year in the Drury Lane pantomime, scheduled to be "Humpty Dumpty". Concerned that Leno might suffer a relapse, Arthur Collins employed <a href="Marie%20Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a> to take his place. By the time of rehearsals, however, Leno persuaded Collins that he was well enough to take part, and the cast was reshuffled to accommodate him. Leno appeared with success. Upon hearing his signature song, the audience reportedly gave him a standing ovation that lasted five minutes. He received a telegram from the King congratulating him on his performance.

Leno's stage partner Herbert Campbell died in July 1904, shortly after the pantomime, following an accident at the age of fifty-seven. The death affected Leno deeply, and he went into a decline. At that time, he was appearing at the <a href="London%20Pavilion">London Pavilion</a>, but the show had to be cancelled owing to his inability to remember his lines. So harsh were the critics that Leno wrote a statement, published in "The Era", to defend the show's originality. On 20 October 1904, Leno gave his last performance in the show. Afterwards, he stopped at the <a href="Belgrave%20Hospital%20for%20Children">Belgrave Hospital for Children</a> in <a href="Kennington">Kennington</a> to leave a donation of £625 (£ in 2019 adjusted for inflation).

Leno died at his home in London on 31 October 1904, aged 43, and was buried at <a href="Lambeth%20Cemetery">Lambeth Cemetery</a>, <a href="Tooting">Tooting</a>. The cause of death is not known. His death and funeral were national news. The "Daily Telegraph" wrote in its obituary: "There was only one Dan. His methods were inimitable; his face was indeed his fortune ... Who has seen him in any of his disguises and has failed to laugh?" <a href="Max%20Beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</a> later said of Leno's death: "So little and frail a lantern could not long harbour so big a flame".

Sheerness

Sheerness is a town beside the mouth of the <a href="River%20Medway">River Medway</a> on the north-west corner of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Isle of Sheppey</a> in north <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, England. With a population of 12,000 it is the largest town on the island.

Sheerness began as a fort built in the 16 century to protect the River Medway from naval invasion. In 1665 plans were first laid by the <a href="Navy%20Board">Navy Board</a> for <a href="Sheerness%20Dockyard">Sheerness Dockyard</a>, a facility where warships might be provisioned and repaired. The site was favoured by <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>, then Clerk of the Acts of the navy, for <a href="shipbuilding">shipbuilding</a> over <a href="Chatham%2C%20Medway">Chatham</a> inland. After the <a href="raid%20on%20the%20Medway">raid on the Medway</a> in 1667, the older fortification was strengthened; in 1669 a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="dockyard">dockyard</a> was established in the town, where warships were stocked and repaired until its closure in 1960.

Beginning with the construction of a <a href="pier">pier</a> and a <a href="promenade">promenade</a> in the 19 century, Sheerness acquired the added attractions of a <a href="seaside%20resort">seaside resort</a>. Industry retains its important place in the town and the Port of Sheerness is one of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom's</a> leading car and fresh produce importers. The town is the site of one of the UK's first <a href="co-operative">co-operative</a> societies and also of the world's first multi-storey buildings with a rigid metal frame.

The first structure in what is now Sheerness was a fort built by order of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> to prevent enemy ships from entering the <a href="River%20Medway">River Medway</a> and attacking the <a href="Chatham%20Dockyard">naval dockyard</a> at <a href="Chatham%2C%20Kent">Chatham</a>. In 1666 work began to replace it with a stronger fort. However, before its completion, this second fort was destroyed during the 1667 <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> Naval Fleet as part of what would be known as the <a href="raid%20on%20the%20Medway">raid on the Medway</a>.

The <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20Admiralty">Secretary to the Admiralty</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>, subsequently ordered the construction of <a href="Sheerness%20Dockyard">Sheerness Dockyard</a> as an extension to that at Chatham. There was no established <a href="Human%20settlement">settlement</a> in the vicinity of Sheerness, so most of the workers were initially housed in <a href="Hulk%20%28ship%20type%29">hulks</a>. By 1738, dockyard construction workers had built the first houses in Sheerness, using materials they were allowed to take from the yard. The grey-blue naval paint they used on the exteriors led to their homes becoming known as the Blue Houses. This was eventually corrupted to <a href="Blue%20Town">Blue Town</a> (which is now the name of the north-west area of Sheerness lying just beyond the current dockyard perimeter). The modern town of Sheerness has its origins in Mile Town, which was established later in the 18th century at a mile's distance from the dockyard (Blue Town having by then filled the space available).

In 1797, discontented sailors in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="Spithead%20and%20Nore%20mutinies">mutinied just off the coast</a> of Sheerness.
By 1801 the population of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of <a href="Minster-in-Sheppey">Minster</a>, reached 5,561. In 1816, one of the UK's first <a href="co-operative">co-operative</a> societies was started in Sheerness, chiefly to serve the dockyard workers and their families. The Sheerness Economical Society began as a co-operative bakery but expanded to produce and sell a range of goods. By the middle of the 20 century, the society had spread across the Isle of Sheppey and had been renamed the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society.

In the early 1820s a fire destroyed the old Blue Houses. New houses and a major redevelopment of the dockyard followed. A high brick wall and a moat were constructed around the yard to serve as a defence measure and remained in place until the end of the 19th century. As the settlement expanded eastwards, away from the dockyard and the Blue Houses, the wider area became known as Sheerness, taking its new name from the brightness or clearness of the water at the mouth of the River Medway. The rebuilt Dockyard contained many groundbreaking new buildings and structures; for example, completed in 1860 and still standing today, the Sheerness Boat Store was the world's first multi-storey building with a rigid metal frame.

From the completion of the dockyard until 1960 Sheerness was one of the bases of the <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20The%20Nore">Nore Command</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, which was responsible for protecting British waters in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. The command was named after the Nore <a href="sandbank">sandbank</a> in the <a href="Thames%20Estuary">Thames Estuary</a>, about east of Sheerness.

In 1863, <a href="Water%20supply%20network">mains water</a> was installed in the town, and the Isle of Sheppey's first railway station opened at the dockyard. Towards the end of the 19 century, Sheerness achieved official town status and formed its own civil parish, separate from Minster-in-Sheppey. The 1901 Census recorded the Sheerness parish as having 18,179 residents and 2,999 houses.

The town's low rainfall and ample sunshine made it popular as a <a href="seaside%20resort">seaside resort</a>, with tourists arriving by steamboat and train. The <a href="Sheppey%20Light%20Railway">Sheppey Light Railway</a> opened in 1901, connecting the new Sheerness East station with the rest of the island. However, by 1950, lack of demand led to the railway's closure. The <a href="Sheerness%20and%20District%20Tramways">Sheerness and District Tramways</a>, which opened in 1903, only lasted until 1917.

In 1944 the United States cargo ship ran aground and sank off the coast of Sheerness, with large quantities of explosives on board. Due to the inherent danger and projected expense, the ship and its cargo have never been salvaged; if the wreck were to explode, it would be one of the largest non-nuclear explosions of all time. A 2004 report published in "<a href="New%20Scientist">New Scientist</a>" warned that an explosion could occur if sea water penetrated the bombs.

During the Second World War the <a href="Shoeburyness%20Boom">Shoeburyness Boom</a>, which ran across the Thames Estuary to protect shipping from submarine attack, ran from Sheerness to Shoeburyness in Essex. A similar structure was built along the same alignment in the early 1950s to protect against Soviet submarines. The Sheerness end of the boom was demolished in the 1960s.

In March 1960 the Royal Navy ceased operating the Sheerness dockyard and the Medway Port Authority took over the site for commercial use. The dockyard closure led to thousands of job losses, and most of the nearby houses and shops in the Bluetown area were eventually abandoned and demolished. By the 1961 census, the population of Sheerness had fallen to 13,691. The dockyard closure also led to the decline of the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society, as many of its members were dockyard workers. At the time, the society was the island's main retailer, but it has since been reduced to a few shops and been merged with a larger society.

In 2003, the Beachfields Park project was organised to publicise Beachfields' heritage and to preserve it for future generations. Students of Cheyne Middle School and Minster College, with assistance from local organisations, researched the funfair, bandstands, Prisoner of the War hut, boating lake and bowling green. As part of the project, students wrote a book, "Tales of Beachfields Park", which won the Historical Association Young Historian Primary School Award for Local History.

As of 2007, Bluetown is an industrial area, and Sheerness has become the largest port in the UK for motor imports. Prior to the closure of the Dockyard, twenty-five of its historic buildings were listed in recognition of their "architectural distinction and value"; regardless of this, the majority were subsequently demolished (including Admiralty House and the quadrangular Great Store) and others were left to decay. In the early 21 century a concerted effort was made to save the remaining buildings and several have been restored to residential use. In July 2013 <a href="Swale%20Borough%20Council">Swale Borough Council</a> announced that a deal had been reached to secure restoration of Rennie and Taylor's Royal Dockyard Church (which had been gutted by a fire in 2001), with a view to new uses such as displaying the above-mentioned model of the Dockyard.

Sheerness has had four <a href="windmill">windmill</a>s. They were the Little Mill, a <a href="smock%20mill">smock mill</a> that was standing before 1813 and burnt down on 7 February 1862; The Hundred Acre Mill, a small <a href="tower%20mill">tower mill</a> which was last worked in 1872 and demolished in 1878 leaving a base which remains today; The <a href="Great%20Mill%2C%20Sheerness">Great Mill</a>, a smock mill, the building of which was started in 1813 and completed in 1816, which was demolished in 1924 leaving the base, upon which a replica mill body is being built to serve as flats. On 23 January 2008 a fire started in the mill tower. The fire was declared not to have been a case of <a href="arson">arson</a>; Little is known of the fourth windmill, said to have been a vertical axle windmill designed by Stephen Hooper.

Sheerness is in the <a href="parliamentary%20constituency">parliamentary constituency</a> of <a href="Sittingbourne%20and%20Sheppey%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Sittingbourne and Sheppey</a>. Since the constituency's creation in 1997 until 2010 the <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> was <a href="Derek%20Wyatt">Derek Wyatt</a> of the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>. At the 2010 general election, <a href="Gordon%20Henderson%20%28politician%29">Gordon Henderson</a> of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> won the seat. Before 1997, Sheppey and Sittingbourne were part of the constituency of <a href="Faversham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Faversham</a>. Sheerness is in the <a href="Districts%20of%20England">local government district</a> of <a href="Borough%20of%20Swale">Swale</a>. The town is covered by the local government <a href="Ward%20%28politics%29">wards</a> of Sheerness, which has three of the forty-seven seats on the Swale Borough Council. At the 2015 local elections, two of those seats were held by the Labour Party and one by UKIP. 

Swale Borough Council is responsible for running local services, such as recreation, refuse collection and <a href="council%20house">council housing</a>; <a href="Kent%20County%20Council">Kent County Council</a> is responsible for education, social services and trading standards. Both councils are involved in town planning and road maintenance. From 1894 to 1968, Sheerness formed its own local government district, Sheerness Urban District, and lay within the <a href="Administrative%20counties%20of%20England">administrative county</a> of Kent. Over much of the past century, the Labour Party has received the most support in Sheerness, mainly due to the town's industrial nature. As early as 1919, the town had four Labour councillors; Faversham elected its first only in 1948.

Sheerness is in the north-west corner of the Isle of Sheppey in North Kent. To the north, sandy beaches run along the coast of the <a href="Thames%20Estuary">Thames Estuary</a>. To the west, the outlet of the River Medway flows into the Estuary. An area of <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s known as The Lappel lies between the river and the south-western part of town. Marshland lies to the south and the east. The main rock type of the Isle of Sheppey is <a href="London%20Clay">London Clay</a>, which covers most of North Kent. Along with most of the Kent coast, the uninhabited coastal areas of the island have been designated <a href="Sites%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Sites of Special Scientific Interest</a>, due to their wildlife and geological features.

The main commercial and leisure areas of the town dominate the north coast, where there is easy access to the pleasure beach. The industrial areas are in the west, beside the wetlands and the River Medway. The Bluetown industrial area and the Port of Sheerness are in the north-western part of the town. The residential districts of Mile Town and Marine Town are in the central and the eastern areas respectively.

According to the 2001 data, Sheerness has a low proportion of foreign-born residents compared to the rest of England, at 3%. Ninety-eight percent of residents were recorded as white; the largest minority group was recorded as Asian, at 1.1% of the population. The 2000s saw a rise in the foreign-born population, with the town now having a significant eastern European population. Data from the 2011 census is not yet available to give specific numbers.

The Port of Sheerness is a significant feature of the Isle of Sheppey's economy. Covering more than 1.5 million square metres, it is one of the largest foreign car importers in the UK, and it handles thousands of tonnes of fruits and meat products from all over the world. Inexpensive land and good infrastructure, including a rail network that branches off the main passenger line, have attracted industries to the port area, including producers of pharmaceuticals, steel, sausages and <a href="garden%20gnome">garden gnome</a>s. 

The major employers are HBC Engineering Solutions, <a href="Sheerness%20Steelworks">Sheerness Steel</a>, Regis Furniture and The Bond Group - although HBC has closed and the Steel plant is currently closed but is currently being changed and upgraded ready for reopening. The steel mill was established in 1972, designed to recycle scrap steel into rods and coils. It survived a number of closure threats and changes of ownership; from 2003 it was operated by Thamesteel. Thamesteel went into administration in January 2012, with the loss of 350 jobs. Six months later, the plant was bought back by the former owners Al-Tuwairqi Group. there were plans to reopen the plant as a <a href="rolling%20mill">rolling mill</a>. PeelPort now own the site and are preparing it for reopening is a steel mill. The port has a seafarers' centre, which was refurbished in May 2015, and is operated by Apostleship of the Sea, a seafarers' charity.

The seafront is popular with tourists, and in 2007 Sheerness' recently refurbished town centre had more than 200 shops.

Sheerness's sand and shingle beach was awarded a European <a href="Blue%20Flag%20beach">Blue Flag</a> for cleanliness and safety. Flower gardens decorate the seafront, and a sea wall forms a promenade along the coast. The Sheppey Leisure Complex located near the beach contains a swimming pool and badminton, squash and tennis courts. Other sports clubs include Sheerness Town Bowls Club, Sheerness East Cricket Club, the Isle of Sheppey Sailing Club, Beachfields Skatepark, Sheerness East Table Tennis Club, Catamaran Yacht Club, and Sheerness Swimming Club and Lifeguard Corps.

Sheerness has a library and clubs for photography, music, singing, dancing and writing. The youth club in Meyrick Road, in East Sheerness has been operational for over 50 years and has played a vital role in the development of many young people.

Sheerness's town centre is home to the largest freestanding cast iron clock tower in Kent. It is tall and was built in 1902 at a cost of around £360 to commemorate the coronation of King <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Edward VII</a>. In 2002, the clock tower was restored to celebrate the <a href="Silver%20Jubilee%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">Silver</a> and <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">Golden Jubilees</a> of <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.

The "Sheerness Times Guardian" is now the only newspaper serving the town and island at large, owned by the <a href="KM%20Group">KM Group</a>. The "Sheppey Gazette" closed in 2011 after around 100 years of publication. It was owned by <a href="Northcliffe%20Media">Northcliffe Media</a>.

The island has its own community radio station, <a href="BRFM%2095.6%20FM">BRFM 95.6 FM</a>, which can also be heard online at www.brfm.net and broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week from Minster-on-Sea. In October 2011 BRFM was granted a five-year extension to its broadcast licence by regulator <a href="Ofcom">Ofcom</a>.. The station is run by 20 volunteers and plays a wide range of music, with news, weather and local events being broadcast around the clock, the station also provides for specialist music during weekday evenings.

In July 2013 the island received some notoriety for an attack on a tour bus of Jewish boys by local youths who shouted epithets, and threw stones and eggs, telling the boys to "go back to where you came from!"

<a href="Sheerness-on-Sea%20railway%20station">Sheerness-on-Sea railway station</a> is on the <a href="Sheerness%20Line">Sheerness Line</a>, run by <a href="Southeastern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Southeastern</a>. The line connects Sheerness with <a href="Sittingbourne%20railway%20station">Sittingbourne</a>, south on the mainland of Kent. Sittingbourne is on the <a href="Chatham%20Main%20Line">Chatham Main Line</a>, which connects <a href="London">London</a> with <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> and <a href="Dover">Dover</a> in <a href="East%20Kent">East Kent</a>.

The <a href="A249%20road">A249 road</a> terminates at Sheerness, running from Maidstone via Sittingbourne. The road crosses the <a href="M2%20motorway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">M2 motorway</a> near Sittingbourne, and the <a href="M20%20motorway">M20 motorway</a> near Maidstone.

Coach Link (part of <a href="The%20Kings%20Ferry">The Kings Ferry</a>) also provides service from Sheerness, Minster, Halfway, Queenborough and part of the mainland to <a href="Victoria%2C%20London">London Victoria</a> early in the morning and a return journey in the evening. Three school buses run from the Isle Of Sheppey to Sittingbourne school in the morning and after school finishes.

No passenger <a href="ferry">ferry</a> services currently operate from Sheerness, although <a href="Olau%20Line">Olau Line</a> used to run a ferry service to <a href="Vlissingen%2C%20Netherlands">Vlissingen</a> in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> from 1974 until 1994.

Until September 2009, The Isle of Sheppey was the only area in Kent to still have a <a href="middle%20school">middle school</a> system. On the island, <a href="primary%20school">primary school</a>s taught pupils from ages 4 to 9, middle schools 9–13 and <a href="secondary%20school">secondary school</a>s 13–18. Minster College in the neighbouring town of <a href="Minster-on-Sea">Minster</a> was the only secondary school on the island. Sheerness had one middle school, Isle of sheppey Academy, with 800 pupils, although Danley Middle School and St George's Middle School were found in Halfway and Minster, respectively. In 2006, the Cheyne Middle School's <a href="Key%20Stage%202">Key Stage 2</a> performance ranked 322 among Kent's 386 primary and middle schools. The town's primary schools are Richmond First School, Rose Street Primary School, St Edward's Roman Catholic Primary School and West Minster Primary School, all of which cover ages 4–11. Sheppey College, in Sheerness, is a branch of <a href="Canterbury%20College%2C%20Kent">Canterbury College</a> that provides a range of <a href="further%20education">further education</a> courses.

On 1 September 2009, Cheyne Middle school and Minster College merged to become The Isle of Sheppey Academy (now <a href="Oasis%20Academy%20Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Oasis Academy Isle of Sheppey</a>). Danley Middle school closed and St George's Middle School changed into a primary school with a £3 million fund, and Richmond First School now houses an extra year of students. This change was to bring the island up to date with the rest of the UK with the two-tier system (primary school, and then secondary school). Respectively, The Isle of Sheppey Academy now ranges from students of year 6 to 11, as well as housing the island's sixth form students.

Flag of Portugal

The Flag of Portugal () is a rectangular bicolour with a field unevenly divided into green on the <a href="Flag%20terminology%23Description%20of%20standard%20flag%20parts%20and%20terms">hoist</a>, and red on the <a href="Flag%20terminology%23Description%20of%20standard%20flag%20parts%20and%20terms">fly</a>. The lesser version of the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Portugal">national coat of arms</a> (i.e. <a href="armillary%20sphere">armillary sphere</a> and Portuguese shield) is centered over the colour boundary at equal distance from the upper and lower edges. On 30 June 1911, less than a year after the downfall of the <a href="History%20of%20Portugal%20%281834-1910%29">constitutional monarchy</a>, this design was officially adopted for the new national flag of the <a href="First%20Portuguese%20Republic">First Portuguese Republic</a>, after selection by a special commission whose members included <a href="Columbano%20Bordalo%20Pinheiro">Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro</a>, <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Chagas">João Chagas</a> and <a href="Abel%20Botelho">Abel Botelho</a>.

The conjugation of the new field colours, especially the use of green, was not traditional in the Portuguese national flag's composition and represented a radical <a href="republicanism">republican</a>-inspired change that broke the bond with the former monarchical flag. Since a failed republican insurrection on 31 January 1891, red and green had been established as the colours of the <a href="Portuguese%20Republican%20Party">Portuguese Republican Party</a> and its associated movements, whose political prominence kept growing until it reached a culmination period following the <a href="5%20October%201910%20revolution">Republican revolution</a> of 5 October 1910. In the ensuing decades, these colours were popularly propagandized as representing the hope of the nation (green) and the blood (red) of those who died defending it, as a means to endow them with a more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment. Although the flag flown from Porto city hall in the morning of 31 January 1891, symbol of the republican uprising was red and green. Totally red with a green circle in the center, to which were added the inscriptions referring to the republican center to whom it belonged - "the Centro Democrático Federal 15 de Novembro."'

The current flag design represents a dramatic change in the evolution of the Portuguese standard, which had always been closely associated with the royal arms, blue and white. Since the country's foundation, the national flag developed from the blue cross-on-white armorial square banner of King <a href="Afonso%20I%20of%20Portugal">Afonso I</a> to the <a href="liberalism">liberal</a> monarchy's arms over a blue-and-white rectangle. In between, major changes associated with determinant political events contributed to its evolution into the current design.

The decree that legally created the flag used under the constitutional monarchy with the new design was approved by the <a href="National%20Constituent%20Assembly%20%28Portugal%29">Constituent Assembly</a> and published in government journal no. 141 (), on 19 June 1911. On 30 June, this decree had its regulations officially published in government diary no. 150.

The flag's <a href="Flag%20terminology%23Description%20of%20standard%20flag%20parts%20and%20terms">length</a> is equal to times its <a href="Flag%20terminology%23Description%20of%20standard%20flag%20parts%20and%20terms">width</a>, which translates into an <a href="aspect%20ratio">aspect ratio</a> of 2:3. The background is vertically divided into two colours: dark green on the hoist side, and scarlet red on the fly. The colour division is made in a way that green spans of the length and the remaining are filled by red (ratio 2:3). The lesser version of the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Portugal">national coat of arms</a> (without the <a href="laurel%20wreath">laurel wreath</a>s)—a white-rimmed national shield on top of a black-highlighted yellow <a href="armillary%20sphere">armillary sphere</a>—is positioned over the border between both colours.

The armillary sphere has a diameter equal to width and is equidistant from the upper and lower edges of the flag. The sphere, drawn in perspective, possesses six edge-embossed arcs, four of which are <a href="great%20circle">great circle</a>s and two are <a href="small%20circle">small circle</a>s.
The great circles represent the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a> (wider oblique arc), the <a href="equator">equator</a>, and two <a href="meridian%20%28geography%29">meridian</a>s. These last three are positioned so that the intersections between each two arcs make a right angle; one meridian lies on the flag's plane while the other is perpendicular to it.
The small circles consist of two <a href="Circle%20of%20latitude">parallel</a>s (the <a href="tropic%20%28disambiguation%29">tropic</a>s), each tangent to one of the ecliptic-meridian intersections.

Vertically centred over the sphere is the national shield, a white-rimmed curved bottom red shield charged with a white <a href="inescutcheon">inescutcheon</a>. Its height and width are equal to and of the sphere's diameter, respectively.
The shield is positioned in a way that its limits intersect the sphere:

A curious aspect of the official design is the absence of a segment of the Tropic of Capricorn, between the national shield and the ecliptic arc.

The white inescutcheon is itself charged with five smaller blue shields ("escudetes") arranged like a <a href="Greek%20cross">Greek cross</a> (1+3+1). Each smaller shield holds five white <a href="bezant">bezant</a>s displayed in the form of a <a href="saltire">saltire</a> (2+1+2). The red <a href="bordure">bordure</a> is charged with seven yellow castles: three on the <a href="chief%20%28heraldry%29">chief</a> portion (one in each corner and one in the middle), two in the middle points of each quadrant of the curved base (rotated 45 degrees), and two more on each side of the bordure, over the flag's horizontal middle line. Each castle is composed by a base building, showing a closed (yellow) gate, on top of which stand three <a href="battlement">battlement</a>ed towers. In <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> terminology, the shield's <a href="blazon">blazon</a> is described as "Argent, five escutcheons in cross azure each charged with five plates in saltire, on a bordure gules seven towers triple-turreted Or, three in chief".

The colour tones of the flag are not accurately specified in any legal document. Approximate tones are listed below:

The <a href="5%20October%201910%20revolution">Republican revolution</a> of 5 October 1910, brought a need to replace the symbols of the overthrown monarchy, represented in the first instance by the old national flag and <a href="O%20Hino%20da%20Carta">anthem</a>. The choice of the new flag was not one without conflict, especially over the colours, as partisans of the republican red-and-green faced opposition from supporters of the traditional royal blue-and-white. Blue also carried a strong religious meaning as it was the colour of <a href="Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary%20%28Roman%20Catholic%29">Our Lady</a> of the <a href="Immaculate%20Conception">Conception</a> (), who was crowned Queen and Patroness of Portugal by King <a href="John%20IV%20of%20Portugal">John IV</a>, so its removal or replacement from the future flag was justified by Republicans as one of the many measures needed to <a href="Secularity">secularize</a> the state.

After the presentation and discussion of the many proposals, a governmental commission was set up on 15 October 1910. It included <a href="Columbano%20Bordalo%20Pinheiro">Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro</a> (painter), <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Chagas">João Chagas</a> (journalist), <a href="Abel%20Botelho">Abel Botelho</a> (writer) and two military leaders of 1910: Ladislau Pereira and Afonso Palla. This commission ultimately chose the red-and-green of the <a href="Portuguese%20Republican%20Party">Portuguese Republican Party</a>, delivering an explanation based on patriotic reasons, which disguised the political significance behind the choice, as these had been the colours present on the banners of the rebellious during the republican insurrection of 31 January 1891, in <a href="Porto">Porto</a>, and during the monarchy-overthrowing revolution, in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>.
The commission considered that red should "be present as one of the main colours, because it is the battling, warm, virile colour, par excellence. It is the colour of conquest and laughter. A singing, burning, joyful colour ... Recalls the idea of blood and urges to achieve victory". An explanation for the inclusion of the green was harder to come up with, given that it was not a traditional colour of the Portuguese flag's history. Eventually, it was justified on the grounds that, during the 1891 insurrection, this was the colour present on the revolutionary flag that "sparked the redeeming lightning" of republicanism. Finally, white (on the shield) represented "a beautiful and fraternal colour, into which all other colours merge themselves, colour of simplicity, of harmony and peace", adding that "it is this same colour that, charged with enthusiasm and faith by the <a href="Order%20of%20Christ%20Cross">red cross of Christ</a>, marks the <a href="Age%20of%20Discovery">Discoveries</a> epic cycle".

The <a href="Manueline">Manueline</a> armillary sphere, which had been present on the national flag under the reign of <a href="John%20VI%20of%20Portugal">John VI</a>, was revived because it consecrated the "Portuguese epic maritime history ... the ultimate challenge, essential to our collective life.". The Portuguese shield was kept, being positioned over the armillary sphere. Its presence would immortalize the "human miracle of positive bravery, tenacity, diplomacy, and audacity, that managed to bind the first links of the Portuguese nation's social and political affirmation", since it is one of the "most vigorous symbols of the national identity and integrity".

The new flag was produced in large numbers at the ("National Rope House") and was officially presented nationwide on 1 December 1910, on occasion of the 270 years of the <a href="Portuguese%20Restoration%20War">Restoration of Independence</a>. This day had already been declared by the government as the "<a href="Flag%20Day">Flag Day</a>" (currently not celebrated). In the capital, it was paraded from the city hall to the ("Restorers") Monument, where it was hoisted. This festive presentation did not mask, however, the turmoil caused by a design chosen single-handedly without prior popular consultation, and that represented more of a political regime than a whole nation. To encourage a greater acceptance of the new flag, the government issued all teaching establishments with one exemplar, whose symbols were to be explained to the students; textbooks were changed to intensively display these symbols. Also, 1 December ("Flag Day"), 31 January and 5 October were declared <a href="public%20holiday">national holidays</a>.

The Portuguese flag displays three important symbols: the field colours, and the armillary sphere and national shield, which make up the coat of arms.

The explanation for the green and red colours that make up the background field arose during the <a href="Estado%20Novo%20%28Portugal%29">Estado Novo</a> period, the nationalist authoritarian regime that held power from 1933 to 1974. It claims that the green represented the hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of those who died serving the nation.

Despite the fact that these colours never constituted a major part of the national flag until 1910, they were present in several historical banners during important periods. King <a href="John%20I%20of%20Portugal">John I</a> included a <a href="Order%20of%20Aviz">green Aviz cross</a> on the red bordure of his banner. The red cross of the <a href="Order%20of%20Christ%20%28Portugal%29">Order of Christ</a> was used over a white field as a naval pennon during the Discoveries and frequently on ship sails. A green background version was a popular standard of the rebellious during the 1640 revolution that restored Portugal's independence from Spain. There are no registered sources to confirm that this was the origin of the republican colours. Another explanation gives full credit to the flag that was hoisted on the balcony of Porto's city hall during the 1891 insurrection. It consisted of a red field bearing a green disc and the inscription "Centro Democrático Federal «15 de Novembro»" (), representing one of many <a href="Freemasonry">masonry</a>-inspired republican clubs. Over the following 20 years, the red-and-green was present on every republican item in Portugal. The 1891 flag-inherited red stands for the colour of the republican-inspired masonry-backed revolutionaries, whereas green was the colour <a href="Auguste%20Comte">Auguste Comte</a> had destined to be present in the flags of <a href="positivism">positivist</a> nations, an ideal incorporated into the republican political matrix.

The <a href="armillary%20sphere">armillary sphere</a> was an important astronomical and navigational instrument for the Portuguese sailors who ventured into unknown seas during the <a href="Age%20of%20Discoveries">Age of Discoveries</a>. It was introduced by the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>, whose knowledge was essential to the <a href="Portuguese%20Discoveries">Portuguese Discoveries</a>—<a href="Henry%2C%20the%20Navigator">Henry, the Navigator</a>, the person mainly responsible for the development of <a href="Age%20of%20Discovery">Age of Discovery</a> was actually the <a href="Grand%20Master%20%28order%29">Grand Master</a> of the <a href="Order%20of%20Christ%20%28Portugal%29">Order of Christ</a>. It thus became the symbol of the most important period of the nation—the Portuguese discoveries. In light of this, King <a href="Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Manuel I</a>, who ruled during this period, incorporated the armillary sphere into his personal banner. It was simultaneously used as the <a href="ensign">ensign</a> of ships plying the route between the metropolis and <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, thus becoming a colonial symbol and a fulcral element of the flags of the future Brazilian kingdom and <a href="Brazilian%20empire">empire</a>.

Adding to the sphere's significance was its common use on every <a href="Manueline">Manueline</a>-influenced architectural work, where it is one of the major stylistic elements, as seen on the <a href="Jer%C3%B3nimos%20Monastery">Jerónimos Monastery</a> and <a href="Bel%C3%A9m%20Tower">Belém Tower</a>.

The Portuguese shield rests over the armillary sphere. Except during the reign of <a href="Afonso%20I%20of%20Portugal">Afonso I</a>, it is present in every single historical flag, in one form or another. It is the prime Portuguese symbol as well as one of the oldest, with the first elements of today's shield appearing during the reign of <a href="Sancho%20I%20of%20Portugal">Sancho I</a>. The evolution of the Portuguese flag is inherently associated with the evolution of the shield.

Within the white inescutcheon, the five small blue shields with their five white <a href="bezant">bezant</a>s representing the <a href="five%20wounds%20of%20Christ">five wounds of Christ</a> () when crucified and are popularly associated with the "Miracle of Ourique". The story associated with this miracle tells that before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ourique">Battle of Ourique</a> on 25 July 1139, an old hermit appeared before Count Afonso Henriques (future Afonso I) as a divine messenger. He foretold Afonso's victory and assured him that God was watching over him and his peers. The messenger advised him to walk away from his camp, alone, if he heard a nearby chapel bell tolling, in the following night. In doing so, he witnessed an apparition of Jesus on the cross. Ecstatic, Afonso heard Jesus promising victories for the coming battles, as well as God's wish to act through Afonso, and his descendants, in order to create an empire which would carry his name to unknown lands, thus choosing the Portuguese to perform great tasks.
Boosted by this spiritual experience, Afonso won the battle against an outnumbering enemy. Legend has it that Afonso killed the five <a href="Moors">Moorish</a> kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja <a href="taifas">taifas</a>, before decimating the enemy troops. Hence, in gratitude to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ's <a href="stigmata">five wounds</a> in the form of silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing <a href="Judas%20Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>'s <a href="thirty%20pieces%20of%20silver">thirty pieces of silver</a>.

However, evidence pointing out that the number of bezants on each shield was greater than five during long periods following Afonso I's reign, as well as the fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by <a href="Fern%C3%A3o%20Lopes">Fernão Lopes</a> (1419), support this explanation as one of pure myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was created by divine intervention and was destined for great things.

The seven castles are traditionally considered a symbol of the Portuguese victories over their Moorish enemies, under <a href="Afonso%20III%20of%20Portugal">Afonso III</a>, who supposedly captured seven enemy fortresses in the course of his conquest of the <a href="Algarve">Algarve</a>, concluded in 1249. However, this explanation is weakly founded since this king did not have seven castles on his banner, but an unspecified number. Some reconstructions display about sixteen castles; this number changed to twelve in 1385, to seven in 1485 and to eleven in 1495; it then changed back to seven, in 1578, this time definitively. An hypothesis about the origin of the castles on a red bordure lies in the family ties of Afonso III with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a> (both his <a href="Urraca%20of%20Castile%2C%20Queen%20of%20Portugal">mother</a> and <a href="Beatrice%20of%20Castile%20%281242-1303%29">second wife</a> were Castilian), whose arms consisted of a golden castle on a red field.

Since the foundation of the kingdom, the flag of Portugal was always linked to the Portuguese coat of arms. In fact, until the 19th century, the flag served as a mere support to display the Royal coat of arms, without having any separate meaning. Until the 16th century, the flag consisted in a banner of arms, with its field being totally occupied by the field of the coat of arms, then it came to include the complete coat of arms, including the crown and other external elements laid over a monochrome white field. The flag only acquired a meaning by its own in 1830, when its field was changed from the neutral white to the distinctive blue and white, which were the national colors at that time. Although representing the country since its early beginnings, the flag of Portugal had a limited use until the 19th century, essentially being used as a fortress flag and as naval ensign, with some other flags also existing to represent the nation in other contexts, namely at the sea. In the 19th century, the flag of Portugal started to have a universal use, becoming a real national flag. It evolved in a way that gradually incorporated most of the symbols present on the current coat of arms.

The first heraldic symbol that can be associated with what would become the Portuguese nation was on the shield used by <a href="Henry%2C%20Count%20of%20Portugal">Henry of Burgundy</a>, <a href="Second%20County%20of%20Portugal">Count of Portugal</a> since 1095, during his battles with the <a href="Moors">Moors</a>. This shield consisted of a blue cross over a white field. Nevertheless, this design has no reliable sources since it is a reconstruction that became popular and widely accepted thanks to the nationalistic purposes of the Estado Novo regime.

Henry's son <a href="Afonso%20Henriques">Afonso Henriques</a> succeeded him in the county and took on the same shield. In 1139, despite being outnumbered, he defeated an army of <a href="Almoravid">Almoravid</a> Moors at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ourique">Battle of Ourique</a> and proclaimed himself Afonso I, <a href="King%20of%20Portugal">King of Portugal</a>, in front of his troops. Following the official recognition by the neighbouring <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">León</a>, Afonso changed his shield in order to reflect his new political status. Sources state he charged the cross with five sets of an unspecified number of silver bezants (most likely large-headed silver nails), one set on the centre and one on each arm, symbolizing Afonso's newly gained right to issue currency.

During the time of Afonso I, it was typical not to repair battle damage inflicted on the shield, so changes such as the breaking off of pieces, colour shifting or stains were very common. When Sancho I succeeded his father Afonso I, in 1185, he inherited a very worn off shield: the blue-stained leather that made the cross had been lost except where the bezants (nails) held it in place. This involuntary degradation was the basis for the next step on the evolution of the national coat of arms, where a plain blue cross transformed into a compound cross of five blue bezant-charged escutcheons—the "quina" (Portuguese word meaning “group of five”) were thus born. Sancho's personal shield (called ""Portugal ancien"") consisted of a white field with a compound cross of five shields (each one charged with eleven silver bezants) with the bottom edges of the lateral ones facing towards the centre. Both Sancho's son <a href="Afonso%20II%20of%20Portugal">Afonso II</a> and grandson <a href="Sancho%20II%20of%20Portugal">Sancho II</a> used these arms, as it was usual with direct succession lines (<a href="cadency">cadency</a> system). A new modification of the royal arms was made when Sancho II's younger brother became king, in 1248.

<a href="Afonso%20III%20of%20Portugal">Afonso III of Portugal</a> was not the eldest son, therefore heraldic practices stated he should not take his father's arms without adding a personal variation. Before becoming king, Afonso was married to <a href="Matilda%20II%20of%20Boulogne">Matilda II of Boulogne</a> but her inability to provide him with a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, in 1253. He then married <a href="Beatrice%20of%20Castile%20%281242-1303%29">Beatrice of Castile</a>, an illegitimate daughter of <a href="Alfonso%20X%20of%20Castile">Alfonso X of Castile</a>. It is more likely that it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the <a href="Algarve">Algarve</a> and its Moorish fortresses, considering that the number of castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.

The inner portion contained the arms of Sancho I, although the number of bezants varied between seven, eleven and sixteen (the latter number was used on Afonso's personal standard while he was still <a href="Count%20of%20Boulogne">Count of Boulogne</a>). This same design was used by the Portuguese kings until the end of the <a href="House%20of%20Burgundy">first dynasty</a>, in 1383; a <a href="1383%E2%80%931385%20Crisis">succession crisis</a> put the country at war with Castile and left it without a ruler for two years.

In 1385, in the wake of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aljubarrota">Battle of Aljubarrota</a>, a <a href="House%20of%20Aviz">second dynasty</a> was founded when John, Master of the <a href="Order%20of%20Aviz">Order of Aviz</a> and illegitimate son of King <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Portugal">Peter I</a>, acceded to the throne as <a href="John%20I%20of%20Portugal">John I</a>. To his personal banner, John I added his Order's <a href="fleur-de-lys">fleur-de-lys</a> cross, displayed as green flowery points on the red bordure; this inclusion reduced the number of castles to twelve (three around each corner). The number of bezants in each escutcheon was reduced from eleven to seven. This banner lasted a hundred years until John I's great-grandson <a href="John%20II%20of%20Portugal">John II</a> restyled it, in 1485, introducing important changes: the removal of the Aviz cross, a downward arrangement and edge-smoothing of the shields, and the definitive fixing of five saltire-arranged bezants in each shield (summing up six "quinas", i.e., six “groups of five”: one "quina" of shields and five "quinas" of bezants) and seven castles on the bordure (as it is currently). John II's banner was the last armorial square banner used as the "national" flag or standard. Following his death, in 1495, radical changes were made by his successor.

John II was succeeded by his first cousin <a href="Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Manuel I</a>, in 1495. This king was the first to convert the traditional square armorial banner into a rectangular (2:3) field with the coat of arms on its centre. Specifically, the flag was now a white rectangle centrally charged with the coat of arms (bearing eleven castles) on an <a href="ogive">ogival</a> or <a href="heater%20shield">heater</a>-shaped shield and surmounted by an open royal crown. This flag was used exclusively as the kingdom's banner since Manuel I possessed a personal standard which included the armillary sphere for the first time.

In 1521, <a href="John%20III%20of%20Portugal">John III</a> made minor changes to the flag by adopting a coat of arms (bearing only seven castles) with a round shaped shield.

In 1578, during the reign of <a href="Sebastian%20of%20Portugal">Sebastian</a> and on the eve of the fatal <a href="Battle%20of%20Alc%C3%A1cer%20Quibir">Battle of Alcácer Quibir</a>, the flag was again modified. The number of castles was permanently fixed at seven and the royal crown was converted into a closed three-arched crown, which symbolized a stronger royal authority. With Sebastian's death and the short-lived reign of his great-uncle <a href="Henry%2C%20King%20of%20Portugal">Cardinal Henry</a>, in 1580, a <a href="Struggle%20for%20the%20throne%20of%20Portugal">dynastic crisis</a> was solved with the <a href="List%20of%20Spanish%20monarchs">Spanish king</a> <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II</a> acceding to the Portuguese throne as Philip I, installing a <a href="Philippine%20Dynasty">Spanish dynasty</a>. The accession was made on the condition that Portugal was ruled as a separate, autonomous state, not as a province. This was fulfilled as Portugal and <a href="Spain">Spain</a> formed a <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a> under Philip I and his successors. A consequence of this administrative situation was the maintenance of the flag created under Sebastian's reign as the Portuguese national flag, while Spain had its own. As the ruling house in Portugal, the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> banner also included the Portuguese arms.

The country regained its independence from Spain, in 1640, in a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> that placed on the throne John, <a href="Duke%20of%20Bragan%C3%A7a">Duke of Bragança</a>, as King <a href="John%20IV%20of%20Portugal">John IV</a>. Under his rule, the national flag was slightly changed as the ogival shield became rounded. It was from this reign forward that the royal arms and the kingdom's arms became separate banners.

When <a href="Afonso%20VI%20of%20Portugal">Afonso VI</a>'s younger brother <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Portugal">Peter II</a> replaced him on the throne, in 1667, he adapted the flag's crown to fit the contemporary trends by transforming it into a five-arched crown. The new flag did not remain unchanged for too long, as it was refurbished by Peter's son <a href="John%20V%20of%20Portugal">John V</a>, after he took the throne, in 1707. Heavily influenced by the luxurious and ostentatious court of the <a href="French%20king">French king</a> <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a>, and by <a href="France">France</a>'s political and cultural impact in Europe, John V wanted to transpose such style into the country's coat of arms. A red <a href="beret">beret</a> was then added under the crown. Besides the change of the crown, the shields started to be represented, on the flags, not only in the traditional round bottom shape ("Iberian type"), but also in other formats like the samnitic ("French type"), the horsehead ("Italian type") or the oval ("<a href="cartouche">cartouche</a>") shapes. Instated by an <a href="absolute%20monarch">absolute monarch</a> like John V, this flag endured through almost the entire absolutist period in Portugal—John V (1707–1750), <a href="Joseph%20I%20of%20Portugal">Joseph I</a> (1750–1777) and <a href="Maria%20I%20of%20Portugal">Maria I</a> (1777–1816).

During the second half of the 17th century, the maritime use of the white flag with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 expressly banned the use of this flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with a complement of 40 or more men. The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead green and white striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours green and white were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.

With the <a href="Peninsular%20War">invasion of Portugal</a> by <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a>'s imperial army in 1807, the Portuguese Royal Court fled to <a href="Colonial%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, establishing the capital of the Portuguese Monarchy and Empire in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. In 1815, the Portuguese state of Brazil was elevated to a kingdom, thus receiving the same status as the Kingdom of Portugal and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Algarve">Algarves</a>. The whole of the Portuguese Monarchy became then the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Portugal%2C%20Brazil%20and%20the%20Algarves">United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves</a>. To reflect the change of the status of the Portuguese Monarchy, the Prince Regent <a href="John%20VI%20of%20Portugal">John</a> (future King John VI, at that time still reigning in name of his mother, Queen Mary I) established a new Royal coat of arms, where the Portuguese shield (representing Portugal and the Algarves) charged a blue-filled yellow armillary sphere (<a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Brazil">representing Brazil</a>) surmounted by the same beret-bearing five-arched crown. The new coat of arms replaced the previous one in the Portuguese flags.

Despite the end of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, when Brazil became independent in 1822, its coat of arms continued to be used, inclusive in flags, until the death of John VI in 1826. From then on, the previous coat of arms, without the armillary sphere, became in use again.

John VI died in Lisbon in 1826. His elder son Peter, who had declared the independence of Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Brazil">Peter I</a>, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Peter IV. Because the new Brazilian constitution did not allow further personal unions of Portugal and Brazil, Peter abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became <a href="Maria%20II%20of%20Portugal">Maria II of Portugal</a>. She was only seven years old, so Peter stated she would marry his brother <a href="Miguel%20of%20Portugal">Miguel</a> who would act as <a href="regent">regent</a>. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. This started the period of the <a href="Liberal%20Wars">Liberal Wars</a>.

The liberals formed a separate government exiled on the <a href="Azores">Azorean</a> island of <a href="Terceira%20Island">Terceira</a>. This government issued two decrees establishing modifications to the national flag. While supporters of usurper King Miguel I still upheld the flag established by John VI, the liberal supporters imposed important changes on it. The background was equally divided along its length into blue (hoist) and white (fly); the armillary sphere (associated with Brazil) was removed and the coat of arms was centred over the colour boundary; and the shield reverted to the "French type" shape of John V. This new flag configuration was decreed solely for terrestrial use, but a variation of it was used as the national <a href="ensign">ensign</a>. This ensign differed in the way the colours occupied the background (blue , white ) with a consequent positional shift of the arms.

With the defeat and <a href="exile">exile</a> of Miguel in 1834, Queen Maria II returned to the throne and the standard of the victorious side was hoisted in Lisbon as the new national flag. It would survive for 80 years, witnessing the last period of the Portuguese monarchy until its abolition, in 1910. Currently this flag is used by Portuguese monarchists.

The Portuguese legislation concerning the use of the National Flag is mostly limited to the Decree-law 150/87, issued in 30 March 1987, which replaced the previous scarce legislation dated back to the beginning of the 20th century.

The Decree-law 150/87 states that the flag is to be hoisted from 9:00 a.m. to sunset (during the night, it must be properly lit), on Sundays and national holidays, throughout the entire national territory. It can also be displayed on days where official ceremonies or other solemn public sessions are held; in this case, the flag is hoisted on-site. The flag can be hoisted in other days if it is considered appropriate by the central government, or by other regional or local governing bodies, or by heads of private institutions. It must follow the official design standard and be preserved in good condition.

On the headquarters buildings of the bodies of sovereignty, the flag can stay hoisted on a daily basis. It can also be hoisted on civilian and military national monuments; on public buildings associated with the central, regional or local administration; and on headquarters of public corporations and institutions. Citizens and private institutions can also display it, on the condition that they respect the relevant legal procedures. In the facilities of nationally based international organizations or in the case of international meetings, the flag is hoisted according to the protocol used on those situations.

If national <a href="mourning">mourning</a> is declared, the flag will be flown at <a href="half-staff">half-staff</a> during the fixed number of days; any flag hoisted along with it will be flown in the same manner.

When unfurled in the presence of other flags, the national flag must not have smaller dimensions and must be situated in a prominent, honourable place, according to the relevant protocol.

If there are more than one flagpole, the National Flag should be flown:

If the flagpoles have not the same height, the flag must be flown in the highest pole. The poles should be placed in honourable locations of the ground, building façades and roofs. On public acts where the flag is not hoisted, it can be suspended from a distinct spot, but never used as decoration, covering or for any purpose that can diminish its dignity.

An early decree, from 28 December 1910, established that "any person who, through speech, published writings or any other public act, shows lack of respect to the national flag, which is the motherland's symbol, will be sentenced to a three to twelve-month prison term with corresponding fine and, in case of relapse, will be sentenced to <a href="exile">exile</a>, as stated in the 62nd article of the <a href="Penal%20Code">Penal Code</a>".
In its 332nd article, the current penal code punishes infractions with a prison sentence of up to two years. If the sentence is shorter than 240 days, there is a formula for converting it into a fine. If the offense is directed towards regional symbols, the penalties are halved.

During formal occasions, four people are required to properly fold the flag, where each person holds one of the sides. A correctly folded flag must be a square limiting the national shield. However, the order by which the different folding steps are performed to achieve this result is not legislated.

The procedure begins with the flag fully extended and held in a horizontal plane with the <a href="obverse">obverse</a> facing down. One of the possible folding sequences is demonstrated below:
The National Flag of Portugal also serves as <a href="war%20flag">war flag</a> and ensign, so being flown on military facilities and naval ships. There are however specific national military flags for specific uses, namely the military colours, the naval jack and the naval pennant. The military colours are occasionally referred as war flag, however they are not to be flown on military facilities but are only to be carried by the military units on parades.

The <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">national colours</a> constitute the portable variants of the National Flag for use on parades by the <a href="Portuguese%20Armed%20Forces">military units</a>. In the past, the colours had a practical function, being used as a signal to guide the military units in battle. Originally, the colours were referred as "regimental flags" ("bandeiras regimentais") or "military units flags" ("bandeiras das unidades militares"), but now they are referred as "national standards" ("estandartes nacionais"). The colours are always carried in parade by a junior officer, escorted by a <a href="colour%20guard">colour guard</a>.

The standard model of the colours – also adopted in 1911 – is a rectangular flag measuring in width and in length (ratio 12:13). Green and red are positioned at the hoist and fly, respectively, but occupy the field in an equal manner (1:1). Centred over the colour boundary lie the armillary sphere and Portuguese shield, surrounded by two yellow <a href="Bay%20laurel">laurel</a> branches intersecting at their stems. These are bound by a white stripe bearing the verse by <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20de%20Cam%C3%B5es">Luís de Camões</a> ""Esta é a ditosa pátria minha amada"" () as the <a href="motto">motto</a>. This differs from the version of <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Portugal">coat of arms</a> employed as emblem, where the laurel shoots are tied by a green and red stripe without the verse. The sphere's outer diameter is one-third of the width and lies from the upper edge and from the lower edge.

Although the 1911 regulation is, theoretically, still in force, the various branches of the Armed Forces made specific changes to it and so, several types of colours are used by the different military units. For example, the colours adopted by the <a href="Portuguese%20Army">Portuguese Army</a>, in 1979, measures just .

The Portuguese <a href="naval%20jack">naval jack</a> ("jaco" or "jaque") is only hoisted at the <a href="prow">prow</a> of docked or anchored <a href="Portuguese%20Navy">Navy</a> ships, from sunrise to sunset. The national flag is permanently hoisted at the <a href="stern">stern</a>, when sailing, and from sunrise to sunset, when docked. It is a square flag (ratio 1:1) bearing a green-bordered red field with the minor coat of arms on the centre. The width of the green border and the diameter of the armillary sphere are equal to and of the side's dimension, respectively.

The Portuguese <a href="commissioning%20pennant">commissioning pennant</a> ("flâmula") is a long triangular flag, green on the hoist and red on the fly. It is to be flown on the main mast of the naval ships commanded by officers.

Highly ranked state and governmental offices are also represented by their own flag. The <a href="President%20of%20Portugal">President of the Republic</a> () uses a flag largely similar to the national flag, except for having dark green as the only background colour. It is usually hoisted at the President's official residence, the <a href="Palace%20of%20Bel%C3%A9m">Palace of Belém</a>, as well as on the presidential car, as small-sized flags. The flag of the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Portugal">Prime-Minister</a> is a white rectangle (ratio 2:3) with a dark green saltire, holding the lesser coat of arms on its centre, and a red bordure charged with a pattern of yellow laurel leaves. Other ministerial flags do not possess the red bordure. The flag of the <a href="Assembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20%28Portugal%29">Assembly of the Republic</a> (), the national parliament, is also a white rectangle (ratio 2:3) with the lesser coat of arms in the centre and a dark green bordure.

Cold Feet

Cold Feet is a British <a href="comedy-drama">comedy-drama</a> television series produced by <a href="Granada%20Television">Granada Television</a> for the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> network. The series was created and principally written by <a href="Mike%20Bullen">Mike Bullen</a> as a follow-up to his award-winning 1997 <a href="Comedy%20Premieres">Comedy Premiere</a> special <a href="Pilot%20%28Cold%20Feet%29">of the same name</a>. The series follows three couples experiencing the ups-and-downs of romance, originally Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley (<a href="James%20Nesbitt">James Nesbitt</a> and <a href="Helen%20Baxendale">Helen Baxendale</a>), Pete and Jenny Gifford (<a href="John%20Thomson%20%28comedian%29">John Thomson</a> and <a href="Fay%20Ripley">Fay Ripley</a>) and Karen and David Marsden (<a href="Hermione%20Norris">Hermione Norris</a> and <a href="Robert%20Bathurst">Robert Bathurst</a>). As the original series progressed, the Giffords divorced and Pete married Jo Ellison (<a href="Kimberley%20Joseph">Kimberley Joseph</a>), whilst Karen and David also separated forming relationships with Mark Cubitt (<a href="Sean%20Pertwee">Sean Pertwee</a>) and Robyn Duff (<a href="Lucy%20Robinson%20%28actress%29">Lucy Robinson</a>).

The original series was executive-produced by Bullen with Granada's head of comedy <a href="Andy%20Harries">Andy Harries</a>, and produced by <a href="Christine%20Langan">Christine Langan</a>, <a href="Spencer%20Campbell">Spencer Campbell</a> and Emma Benson. 32 episodes were broadcast over the original five series from 15 November 1998 to 16 March 2003. A revival with all of the original cast except <a href="Helen%20Baxendale">Baxendale</a> began airing from 5 September 2016.

The revived series introduced <a href="Ceallach%20Spellman">Ceallach Spellman</a> as Adam and Rachel's now teenage son Matthew, alongside <a href="Karen%20David">Karen David</a> as Adam's second wife Angela Zubayr following the death of Rachel, and <a href="Art%20Malik">Art Malik</a> as Angela's business tycoon father Eddie, a love interest for Karen Marsden. Pete and Jenny had remarried whilst David's marriage to Robyn was crumbling. <a href="Leanne%20Best">Leanne Best</a> was introduced as Tina Reynolds, Adam's partner following his separation from Angela. After his separation from Robyn, Nikki Kirkbright (<a href="Siobhan%20Finneran">Siobhan Finneran</a>) is introduced as David's new partner.

Series creator <a href="Mike%20Bullen">Mike Bullen</a>'s working relationship with <a href="Granada%20Television">Granada Television</a> began in 1994 when his agent sold his first screenplay, a one-off <a href="comedy-drama">comedy-drama</a> called "The Perfect Match", to the company's head of comedy <a href="Andy%20Harries">Andy Harries</a>. Harries had been looking for television scripts that would reflect the lives of people from his generation—people in their 30s who were under-represented on television. "The Perfect Match", about a man who proposes to his girlfriend at the <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> and has to deal with constant media attention afterwards, was made and then broadcast in 1995. Harries asked Bullen to pitch more ideas for television to "The Perfect Match"s assistant producer <a href="Christine%20Langan">Christine Langan</a>. As a fan of American television such as "<a href="Thirtysomething%20%28TV%20series%29">Thirtysomething</a>", "<a href="Frasier">Frasier</a>" and "<a href="Hill%20Street%20Blues">Hill Street Blues</a>", Bullen pitched "<a href="Pilot%20%28Cold%20Feet%29">Cold Feet</a>", a traditional "boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl-back" story told from both sides of the relationship but using elements of fantasy and flashback to distort events to fit a character's point of view. The initial pitch centred on Adam Williams and <a href="Rachel%20Bradley">Rachel Bradley</a> (<a href="James%20Nesbitt">James Nesbitt</a> and <a href="Helen%20Baxendale">Helen Baxendale</a>), which Harries believed would diminish the storytelling potential if the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> Network Centre commissioned a full series after the pilot, so Bullen "tacked on" plots for two other couples—Adam and Rachel's respective friends Pete and Jenny Gifford (<a href="John%20Thomson%20%28comedian%29">John Thomson</a> and <a href="Fay%20Ripley">Fay Ripley</a>) and David and Karen Marsden (<a href="Robert%20Bathurst">Robert Bathurst</a> and <a href="Hermione%20Norris">Hermione Norris</a>).

The pilot was directed by "<a href="Father%20Ted">Father Ted</a>"s <a href="Declan%20Lowney">Declan Lowney</a> over 12 days in 1996 on location around <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>. The programme was one of four one-off <a href="Comedy%20Premieres">Comedy Premieres</a> made by Granada for ITV. "Cold Feet" was eventually broadcast on 30 March 1997. It received only 3.5 million viewers and little critical attention. As ITV's comedy portfolio was so thin, "Cold Feet" was submitted as the network's comedy entry at the Montreux Television Festival in May 1997. There it won the Silver Rose for Humour and the <a href="Rose%20d%27Or">Rose d'Or</a>, the highest accolade of the festival. ITV scheduled a repeat broadcast a few days afterwards but did not commission a series. Not until <a href="David%20Liddiment">David Liddiment</a>'s appointment as director of programming at ITV in August 1997 was a six episode series ordered.

The first series begins nine months after the pilot episode. After Pete and Jenny's baby is born in Episode 1, the couple have a hard time getting any sleep. Pete has to cope with the death of his father in Episode 4. Adam and Rachel decide to rent a house together. He is horrified to discover in Episode 2 that she is married to another man. While he is staying with Pete and Jenny, Rachel has sex with her visiting husband (<a href="Lennie%20James">Lennie James</a>)—who leaves soon after—and is pregnant by Episode 6. Just as hers and Adam's relationship is recovering, she tells him that he might not be the father, and that she is moving to London until the birth. Karen and David have recently hired Ramona as a nanny to their young son Josh. At her publishing job, Karen edits the novel of a renowned author (<a href="Denis%20Lawson">Denis Lawson</a>), whom she becomes attracted to. She plans to sleep with him on a book tour but is humiliated when she finds out he is not attracted to her. David tries to sleep with Ramona to get back at Karen, which causes friction between the couple. They seek guidance counselling to repair their marriage.

Six months after the last series, Rachel returns from London and tells Adam that she aborted the baby, and their relationship seems over for good. They both start seeing other people—he one of Pete's colleagues (<a href="Rosie%20Cavaliero">Rosie Cavaliero</a>) and she a man much younger than her (<a href="Hugh%20Dancy">Hugh Dancy</a>)—but reconcile after Adam is diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer in Episode 5. David is made redundant at work and decides to be a <a href="stay-at-home%20dad">stay-at-home dad</a> for Josh. After some interference from Karen, he takes a new job. Their relationship improves from the first series; they spend their wedding anniversary in Paris and Karen announces in Episode 6 that she is pregnant. Pete and Jenny's marriage deteriorates when she reveals she had a crush on Adam. Pete later sleeps with a co-worker— with whom Adam was also briefly involved—and Jenny tells him to move out of the house. They decide to give their marriage another chance when Adam's cancer puts things into perspective. In Episode 6, all three couples see in the new millennium on a trip to Lindisfarne, where Pete and Jenny's relationship worsens again as the others' improve.

Half a year after the Lindisfarne trip, Pete and Jenny have separated. He moves from house to house, eventually finding a houseshare with a gay landlord. He has a brief fling with Ramona, which is followed by some dates with a teacher (<a href="Pooky%20Quesnel">Pooky Quesnel</a>). Jenny begins a relationship with a dotcom millionaire (<a href="Ben%20Miles">Ben Miles</a>), who decorates her house with flowers and takes her on a trip to New York. The fling ends when Jenny realises he does not love her. She and Pete reconcile after briefly considering a divorce. David and Karen bring home their newborn twins, and Karen's ex-pat mother (<a href="Mel%20Martin">Mel Martin</a>) moves in for a couple of episodes. Karen is reunited with an old boyfriend (<a href="Richard%20Dillane">Richard Dillane</a>), who is in Manchester for a photography exhibition. Karen is rivalled by Jenny, who has returned to working to pay the bills while Pete is living elsewhere. David takes a sudden interest in politics after meeting local residents' activist Jessica (<a href="Yasmin%20Bannerman">Yasmin Bannerman</a>). He starts an affair with her but she dumps him after being offended by his insensitivity when he tries to end it. Karen finds out about the affair in Episode 8 but is adamant that she and David will stay together for the children. Adam and Rachel decide to have children but are distraught to discover that she is infertile from complications with her abortion. They decide to get married instead but Adam is briefly tempted when he reunites with a long-lost love (<a href="Victoria%20Smurfit">Victoria Smurfit</a>) on his stag weekend to Belfast.

Jenny and Pete await the birth of their second child but after a miscarriage, Jenny rethinks her current lifestyle. In Episode 2 she decides to take a job in New York, and leaves with little Adam. Pete is unhappy for a time but begins a relationship with Jo Ellison, a friend of Rachel's. The relationship goes well until Jo has to return to Australia after her visa expires. Pete follows her and declares his love and they get married in Episode 8. Karen and David are sleeping in separate beds until she decides he should move out. He moves into Pete's spare bedroom and starts seeing a therapist (<a href="Michael%20Troughton">Michael Troughton</a>). Karen develops alcoholism and decides to seek therapy too. She and David reconcile and he moves back in. Soon, she starts an affair with a publisher, Mark (<a href="Sean%20Pertwee">Sean Pertwee</a>), which is revealed to David in Episode 8. Having had enough of the lies, he leaves Karen. Adam and Rachel decide to adopt a child and begin going through the procedures. They are pleased when they later discover that Rachel is pregnant but are distraught when their social worker tells them that the adoption cannot proceed. In Australia for Pete and Jo's wedding, Rachel goes into premature labour and gives birth to a boy.

Three months after the birth of their baby, Adam is made redundant. He gets a new job, but then he and Rachel are told that after the death of their landlord they will be evicted from their house. As they search for a new place to live, Adam's estranged father, Bill (<a href="Ian%20McElhinney">Ian McElhinney</a>), arrives. Bill and Adam patch up their relationship and he offers Adam and Rachel the money to buy their own house. On the way to the auction, Rachel is killed in a car crash, leaving Adam devastated. Her ashes are scattered in the final episode. Karen and David are going through an amicable divorce but when she starts seeing Mark again and David starts seeing his new lawyer Robyn (<a href="Lucy%20Robinson%20%28actress%29">Lucy Robinson</a>), it escalates, as they begin using each other's adultery and her alcoholism as a basis for custody of the children. Karen stops seeing Mark and the divorce cools down. Both re-evaluate their lives after Rachel's death; David develops his relationship with Robyn and Karen plans a trip with Ramona. Pete and Jo's marriage deteriorates when she sleeps with a co-worker (<a href="Richard%20Armitage%20%28actor%29">Richard Armitage</a>) on a work weekend away. Jenny returns from New York in Episode 4 and moves back in with Pete after he asks Jo for a divorce.

After a jet-set life in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, Adam returns to Manchester to visit his old friends and to see son Matthew (now portrayed by <a href="Ceallach%20Spellman">Ceallach Spellman</a>), breaking the news of his upcoming nuptials with businesswoman Angela Zubayr (<a href="Karen%20David">Karen David</a>). This isn't well received amongst the group, especially Matthew who sees Angela as a replacement for his mother Rachel. Struggling to support his family, Pete finds himself in two run down jobs and suffering from depression, which Jenny seems oblivious to. Seeing a fault in their love life, she pursues a fling with client Trevor Green (<a href="Nicholas%20Gleaves">Nicholas Gleaves</a>), who begins to stalk her. Torn apart after the death of Harry (<a href="James%20Bolam">James Bolam</a>), an old man who he was caring for, Pete considers suicide. David is entangled through a wrongdoing at work and is arrested, something which his wife Robyn finds humiliating and throws him out of their luxury <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> home. Karen finds herself on the dating game, and soon falls for Adam's father-in-law Eddie (<a href="Art%20Malik">Art Malik</a>), though later discovers that they live in two very different worlds, with Karen's twin daughters Ellie (<a href="Ella%20Hunt">Ella Hunt</a>) and Olivia (Daisy Edgar-Jones) still dependent on her. Jenny's ex-partner Grant (<a href="Robert%20Webb">Robert Webb</a>) from her time in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> turns up on her doorstep determined to see their daughter Chloe (Madeleine Edmondson), who still believes that Pete is her father. Struggling to cope with living in Manchester and being step-mother to Matthew, Angela decides to end her marriage with Adam, who fell quickly for his landlord Tina Reynolds (<a href="Leanne%20Best">Leanne Best</a>). At Adam's 49th Birthday party, the Marsden's eldest son Josh (Callum Woodhouse) arrives from Spain with former nanny Ramona (<a href="Jacey%20Salles">Jacey Salles</a>), and it is later revealed that he is gay.

Setting up her own publishing house "Marsden House", Karen is relying on useless Ramona as personal assistant. Adam is determined to take things one step further with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed on his feet as a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.

The series began filming in Manchester on 19 March 2018 and continued until July. It began airing on 14 January 2019 and concluded on 18 February 2019 after 6 episodes. Bullen has described it as the best of the "rebooted series".

"Cold Feet" began its first series with the six main cast members—James Nesbitt, Helen Baxendale, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst—who had appeared in the pilot. Thomson's character Pete Gifford was written specifically for him after his performance in "The Perfect Match" made a positive impression on Christine Langan. Norris originally auditioned for the part of Rachel but was cast as Karen because the role suited her social class. Nesbitt got an audition through a mutual friend of pilot director Declan Lowney, and read the part in his natural accent because he was keen to play a Northern Irish character in a contemporary drama unconnected to <a href="The%20Troubles">The Troubles</a>. Baxendale was best known for her role in "<a href="Cardiac%20Arrest%20%28TV%20series%29">Cardiac Arrest</a>" and was hesitant to star as Rachel because she did not believe she could perform comedy. Bathurst was known to Langan for his starring role in "<a href="Joking%20Apart">Joking Apart</a>". Ripley thought she would be auditioning for the part of Rachel, and had to put on an accent for her role as natural Mancunian Jenny. When the fourth series was commissioned, Ripley announced that she was leaving the show to broaden her career options. <a href="Kimberley%20Joseph">Kimberley Joseph</a> was cast as Jo Ellison, a replacement character who remained on screen until "Cold Feet"s conclusion. Bullen makes numerous <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a>-esque cameo appearances; he plays a neighbour and a husband in the first series and a workman in the third.

Despite all receiving equal billing in the credits, the original principal cast members were paid different salaries in the first few years; Baxendale and Nesbitt were the most well-known, so received more than Ripley, Thomson, Norris and Bathurst, who were comparatively less well known to audiences. Prompted by the continued success of the show, Andy Harries reviewed the salaries in 2000 and decided to pay all six actors the same amount. The amount was not publicly disclosed but was believed to be £20,000 per episode, plus repeat broadcast royalties. Another pay deal for the fourth series in 2001 increased the salaries of the cast to £50,000. For the final series in 2003, they each received £75,000 an episode.

The main characters are six core characters were devised to be "regular people, not distinguished by their careers or by crime" and were based on people from Mike Bullen's life, along with characters who became integral to the programme as Cold Feet progressed.


Significant supporting roles in the series are played by <a href="Rosie%20Cavaliero">Rosie Cavaliero</a> (Amy, Series 2), <a href="Ben%20Miles">Ben Miles</a> (Robert Brown, Series 3), <a href="Yasmin%20Bannerman">Yasmin Bannerman</a> (Jessica Barnes, Series 3), <a href="Sean%20Pertwee">Sean Pertwee</a> (Mark Cubitt, Series 4–5), <a href="Richard%20Armitage%20%28actor%29">Richard Armitage</a> (Lee, Series 5), <a href="Lucy%20Robinson%20%28actress%29">Lucy Robinson</a> (Robyn Duff, Series 5-6), and <a href="Eve%20Myles">Eve Myles</a> (Caitlin Henderson, Series 8).

<a href="Doreen%20Keogh">Doreen Keogh</a> is introduced in Series 1, Episode 4 as Pete's mother Audrey Gifford. She makes a cameo appearance in Series 3, Episode 1, and reappears in Series 4, Episode 4 and Series 5, Episode 1. The character's recurrence was based on the good chemistry between Keogh and Thomson.

Yasmin Bannerman played local residents' campaigner Jessica in Series 3. Bannerman and Bathurst did not know that Jessica and David would have a full-blown affair after their kiss in Episode 3, as David was seen as too much of a "jittery type". The character appears in five episodes. Bathurst was more impressed with the storylines that came out of the affair, rather than the affair itself: "It was the deception, the guilt and the recrimination rather than the actual affair, which was neither interesting nor remarkable".

Series 6 introduced <a href="Cel%20Spellman">Cel Spellman</a> as the now teenaged Matthew, who in Adam's absence, was raised by his godmother Karen and attended a private school.

Mike Bullen has sole writing credit on 26 episodes of the series; four episodes of Series 3 were written by <a href="David%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">David Nicholls</a>, and Bullen co-wrote one episode of Series 4 and 5 with <a href="Mark%20Chappell">Mark Chappell</a> and <a href="Matt%20Greenhalgh">Matt Greenhalgh</a> respectively. Bullen usually wrote ten pages of script per day, whatever the quality of his writing. His own third draft was usually submitted to the producers as the "first" draft. As he was still an inexperienced writer by the time production of the first series began in January 1998, Bullen was aided by Christine Langan, who pitched in as a script editor. Storylines were planned in advance—the producers knew that they wanted to split up Adam and Rachel at the end of Series 1—but the later scripts were written once filming on earlier episodes had already begun. The number of people on the development team varied; the third series' comprised Bullen, Langan, Harries, producer <a href="Spencer%20Campbell">Spencer Campbell</a>, script editor Camilla Campbell, ITV's controller of comedy, and a team of five writers.

Many storylines were based on life experiences of the production team; Bullen and his wife Lisa had their first child in late 1997, which made Bullen identify with the Pete character, whose son is born in the first episode. Bullen incorporated his experiences of the first few months of parenthood into the Pete and Jenny storyline. Adam's <a href="testicular%20cancer">testicular cancer</a> storyline in Series 2, Episode 5 was influenced by a similar condition that afflicted Harries, and was supplemented by the newspaper columns written by terminal cancer sufferer <a href="John%20Diamond%20%28journalist%29">John Diamond</a>. If a storyline was not drawn from real life experiences, it was researched by communicating with experts; Bullen consulted the relationship support charity <a href="Relate">Relate</a> for the scenes of Karen and David's marriage guidance session in Series 1, Episode 5, and consulted Dr <a href="Sammy%20Lee%20%28scientist%29">Sammy Lee</a> for information about Rachel's <a href="intracytoplasmic%20sperm%20injection">intracytoplasmic sperm injection</a> in Series 3. When it was decided to have Rachel's abortion lead to her developing <a href="Asherman%27s%20syndrome">Asherman's syndrome</a> in Series 3, the <a href="British%20Pregnancy%20Advisory%20Service">British Pregnancy Advisory Service</a> (BPAS) were contacted. BPAS strongly recommended that the plot be developed in a different direction, on the basis that infertility from what would appear to have been a routine abortion would be an "improbable link", though the producers proceeded with their original story anyway.

By the time pre-production on the third series began, Bullen had grown tired of writing the series single-handedly and believed all the stories that could be told had been told. ITV were keen to increase the number of episodes per series to 20 but Granada refused, though did agree to add two more, bringing the total to eight. A writing team of five was assembled, overseen by Bullen. Four of the scriptwriters were deemed not good enough and they parted company with Granada. David Nicholls remained and scripted four of the eight-third series episodes; Bullen wrote the other four and his interest in the series was revived.

At the conclusion of the third series, Bullen announced that he did not want to write a fifth series, and that the fourth would be the last. Series 4, Episode 8 was produced as the final episode but the cast and crew realised that they would like to make one final series for proper closure. Bullen agreed to write the final episodes on the condition that there would be just four, and that he could kill off a character. Matt Greenhalgh co-wrote Series 5, Episode 3 with Bullen, specifically the scenes depicting Rachel's death. Greenhalgh worked on the script at the same time as he was writing his <a href="BBC%20Three">BBC Three</a> series "<a href="Burn%20It">Burn It</a>", also set in Manchester. In a 2007 interview, he said that he was not a fan of "Cold Feet"—decrying the depiction of Manchester in the series—and that killing off Rachel was "a privilege".

A reunion episode was speculated after the fifth series ended; in the 2003 documentary "Cold Feet: The Final Call", executive producer <a href="Andy%20Harries">Andy Harries</a> stated, "By killing a character, you are truly saying 'this series is over' … until, of course, in 10 years time when money is running a bit short for all of us, we bring it back. What we do with Rachel, I don't know yet—but I have got a few theories." In an interview published in October 2003, Harries told "The Daily Telegraph" that ITV would "probably" bring back "Cold Feet" ten years after it ended, and said, "There's a tacit understanding with the actors that we will re-visit it again at the appropriate time." In 2007, a tabloid newspaper quoted an ITV "insider" as saying that a reunion episode would be broadcast to mark ten years since the pilot aired. The report turned out to be a fabrication. At the 2010 <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Television%20Festival">Edinburgh International Television Festival</a>, Harries stated that discussions about the series' return were "ongoing", but highlighted a number of factors that would prevent a reunion in the near future. The following day, Harries told <a href="Kate%20Silverton">Kate Silverton</a> that he had held discussions with Mike Bullen about the series returning, but that it would not be back on television screens in 2011 or 2012.

All episodes of "Cold Feet" were shot on <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a> on locations in and around Greater Manchester. Sets were designed by Chris Truelove to reflect the characters; Karen and David's home was designed as a spacious detached house intended to be located in <a href="Bowdon%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bowdon</a>, while Pete and Jenny and Adam and Rachel had smaller middle-class abodes intended to be located in <a href="Didsbury">Didsbury</a>. All exteriors of the characters' houses were shot on location. Christine Langan was keen to avoid a generic sitcom style of filming, citing the formulae of such programmes as "tired and dreary" and lacking emotional depth. To achieve this goal, she and Harries recruited directors with little background in television. These included <a href="Nigel%20Cole">Nigel Cole</a>, who came from an advertising background and was keen to use the two episodes of the first series he was allotted to "make his mark" and establish himself as a good television director. Other directors included <a href="Mark%20Mylod">Mark Mylod</a>, <a href="Tom%20Hooper%20%28director%29">Tom Hooper</a>, <a href="Tom%20Vaughan%20%28director%29">Tom Vaughan</a>, <a href="Pete%20Travis">Pete Travis</a>, <a href="Jon%20Jones%20%28director%29">Jon Jones</a>, <a href="Ciaran%20Donnelly%20%28director%29">Ciaran Donnelly</a> and <a href="Tim%20Sullivan%20%28British%20filmmaker%29">Tim Sullivan</a>.

For the first series, interior sets were built at the Blue Shed Studios in <a href="City%20of%20Salford">Salford</a>. Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50-minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998. Locations included an empty shop unit near <a href="Manchester%20Piccadilly%20station">Piccadilly station</a> for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a> for the gala dinner scenes in Episode 6. In the second year, the sets were moved to the Spectrum Arena in <a href="Warrington">Warrington</a>, where filming ran from March to June. The series featured the first location shoots outside Manchester; a short scene in Episode 2 featuring Bathurst was filmed over half a day in <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a>; Bathurst, Norris and a small production crew filmed scenes in Paris for Episode 3; exterior location scenes of the characters on holiday in Episode 6 were filmed on <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, though the castle interiors were shot at <a href="Hoghton%20Tower">Hoghton Tower</a>. The second series also featured more visual effects; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle (which was computer-generated) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts. The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction. "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">The Mirror</a>"s television critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical: "I hated that sequence. I thought it was really unfunny. It was a lousy prop and awful graphics and there was too much of it—it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that and get it over with. You couldn't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen." By the third series, "Cold Feet"s sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series. This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes, such as "<a href="The%20Grimleys">The Grimleys</a>" and "My Beautiful Son". After the final episode was filmed in 2002, the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill.
In Series 3, "Cold Feet" shot outside England for the first time for Episode 5. A storyline featuring Adam's stag weekend was originally scripted to take place first in Blackpool and then in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. James Nesbitt suggested that it should be filmed in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> and <a href="Portrush">Portrush</a>, near where he grew up. He, Andy Harries and producer <a href="Spencer%20Campbell">Spencer Campbell</a> scouted the locations in April 2000 before filming went ahead later that year. Local businesspeople were so eager to promote the area that they waived any fees Granada would have given them for allowing filming, meaning the location manager only spent £20, considerably less than the £3,000 a typical shoot of that length would have cost. This location shoot inspired the producers to film even further away from Manchester; in November 2000, Bullen and Harries spoke at the Screen Producers Association of Australia conference, where they decided to base the fourth series finale in Sydney. The episode was written to be a "normal episode" of "Cold Feet" that just had a different background. The main cast—except for Helen Baxendale who was pregnant—the producers and Ciaran Donnelly shot for 18 days in October 2001 in locations that included <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20Sydney">Hyde Park</a>, <a href="Kirribilli">Kirribilli</a>, <a href="Double%20Bay">Double Bay</a> and the northern beaches. Budget problems meant an overseas location could not be secured for Series 5, so scenes in the final episode were shot in <a href="Portmeirion">Portmeirion</a>, Wales.

Screen time was divided up equally between the couples over the course of an episode, though occasionally some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester. A hand-held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.

Incidental music for the series was composed by <a href="Mark%20Russell%20%28composer%29">Mark Russell</a>. He also composed a theme tune, which was used as an alternative to <a href="Space%20%28English%20band%29">Space</a>'s "<a href="Female%20of%20the%20Species">Female of the Species</a>". Christine Langan heard "Female of the Species" on "<a href="The%20Chart%20Show">The Chart Show</a>" while the pilot was being produced and decided to make it the theme song. She remained involved in choosing popular music used on the show for the three series she worked on it. "Female of the Species" was used as a closing theme throughout the first series. For the second series, it was replaced by <a href="Morcheeba">Morcheeba</a>'s "Let Me See", except for the last episode when <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>'s "<a href="Love%20%28John%20Lennon%20song%29">Love</a>" was used. "The Mirror"s Charlie Catchpole described the diagetic popular music in the school reunion scenes of Series 2, Episode 4—"<a href="Don%27t%20You%20Want%20Me">Don't You Want Me</a>" (<a href="The%20Human%20League">The Human League</a>), "<a href="Relax%20%28song%29">Relax</a>" (<a href="Frankie%20Goes%20to%20Hollywood">Frankie Goes to Hollywood</a>), "<a href="Temptation%20%28Heaven%2017%20song%29">Temptation</a>" (<a href="Heaven%2017">Heaven 17</a>), "<a href="True%20%28Spandau%20Ballet%20song%29">True</a>" (<a href="Spandau%20Ballet">Spandau Ballet</a>), "<a href="Do%20You%20Really%20Want%20to%20Hurt%20Me">Do You Really Want to Hurt Me</a>" (<a href="Culture%20Club">Culture Club</a>) and "<a href="Tainted%20Love">Tainted Love</a>" (<a href="Soft%20Cell">Soft Cell</a>)—as "[catching] the changing mood with devastating precision". Catchpole's positive comments about the music led to a previously shelved soundtrack album being released.

The ITV Network Centre originally scheduled the first series to be broadcast in the 10 pm timeslot on Sunday nights. This went against the wishes of Andy Harries, who wanted it broadcast at 9 pm in the so-called "ironing slot"—generally used for programmes that an audience does not have to concentrate on. David Liddiment compromised by allowing the show to start at 9.30 pm Harries was able to get the second series moved to 9 pm, which annoyed advertisers. The third series remained in the same timeslot but, like other series on the network, suffered from ITV's late decision to add a third advert break to hour-long shows. Episode 8, featuring Adam and Rachel's wedding, was broadcast on Boxing Day—the first time the show was aired on a Tuesday. The eighth episode of Series 4 and all four episodes of Series 5 were extended to fill a 90-minute timeslot.

The series was repeated when ITV launched digital channel <a href="ITV3">ITV3</a>, then marketed towards over-35 viewers. In the United States, "Cold Feet" was first broadcast on the cable network <a href="Bravo%20%28US%20TV%20network%29">Bravo</a>. Bravo bought the pilot and first three series for $1 million. The pilot was broadcast as a "sneak peek" before the regular series run began. From 2005 the series was broadcast by <a href="BBC%20America">BBC America</a>. When broadcast on <a href="SABC%203">SABC 3</a> in South Africa, the series is retitled "Life, Love and Everything Else". Worldwide, it has been broadcast in over 34 countries.

Critical response to the first episode was not favourable; in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, "Are we supposed to care about these people? The theory, I think, is that we should relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic as our own, and because "Cold Feet" is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This is another way of saying the writer hasn't bothered with research or imagination." He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On "<a href="The%20Late%20Show%20%28BBC%20TV%20series%29">The Late Review</a>", <a href="Germaine%20Greer">Germaine Greer</a> and <a href="Tony%20Parsons%20%28British%20journalist%29">Tony Parsons</a> singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him "especially awful" and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on at the beginning of the episode. General reaction improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%281998%20TV%20serial%29">Vanity Fair</a>" in the "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>" and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the "forgotten" twentysomethings. <a href="Paul%20Hoggart">Paul Hoggart</a> for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing and looked forward to how Rachel's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series.

Other critics hailed it as "the British answer to "Thirtysomething""; in 1998, Meg Carter wrote in "The Independent", "More than 10 years on, Granada Television has finally produced a modern show that mines the rich seam of a generation that is as confused as it is liberated by increased choice and freedom, and that caters for an audience which has not, traditionally, watched very much ITV." <a href="Mark%20Lawson">Mark Lawson</a> compared it to the American sitcom "<a href="Friends">Friends</a>", a series that is also based around three men and three women, and featured Helen Baxendale in a guest role. In a 2003 interview with Bullen on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>'s "<a href="Front%20Row%20%28radio%29">Front Row</a>", Lawson asked whether "Friends" had influenced "Cold Feet". Bullen explained that the connection was made by media as "a useful shorthand", that he was irritated by the characters in "Friends" and "would liked to have taken a baseball bat to them".

In 2001, Andrew Billen compared the contemporary cultural relevance of the series to "<a href="The%20Way%20We%20Live%20Now%20%282001%20TV%20serial%29">The Way We Live Now</a>", as a follow-up to his comparison of the first series with "Vanity Fair": "In previous years we have seen the anguish caused by infidelity, impotence and infertility. This season the characters face the hazards thrown up by miscarriage, alcoholism and a late-flowering career. Sustaining relationships looks as hard as ever. Yet there is nothing each protagonist wants more than old-fashioned domestic bliss." The review resonated with other critics; in "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>", Linda Watson-Brown wrote an overall positive review of the series in general—dismissing the spate of "anti-"Cold Feet"" reviews—but criticised "the ease with which problems are resolved and morality used to slap the viewer in the face". The final episode set in Australia polarised critics; in a column focusing on "<a href="Chewin%27%20the%20Fat">Chewin' the Fat</a>", "Scotsman" critic Aidan Smith accused the big-budget episode "which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot" of being the point the series <a href="jumping%20the%20shark">jumped the shark</a>, and "Times" columnist <a href="Caitlin%20Moran">Caitlin Moran</a> complimented it, but was concerned that the series' original main characters—Adam and Rachel—were being sidelined by everyone including Mike Bullen.

When the fifth series began in 2003, critics welcomed its end. Paul Hoggart wrote in "The Times" that the flashback and fantasy scenes were becoming so overused on television that their use in "Cold Feet" was less surprising than it was in 1998. In "Scotland on Sunday", Helen Stewart lamented the loss of Fay Ripley and Jenny's replacement by "the bland but international crossover-friendly Jo, [...] who is sufficiently pointless to be dismissed even by her fellow characters as 'not as good as Jenny'." Stewart also criticised Hermione Norris's acting and Karen for being a "spoon-faced moaner". A brief article on the MediaGuardian website described a "revisionist backlash" as critics' negative opinions of the series contrasted with the positive reaction that greeted it in 1998.

"Cold Feet"s cast and crew were frequently praised for their depiction of real-life social issues on the series. When "Cold Feet" began, Christine Langan stated, "The real challenge was to overcome the traditional view that many of the issues we cover—jealousy, guilt, money, sexual problems, parental death—are ordinary issues, hardy perennials and, as such, not interesting enough for drama." The fourth episode of the first series was controversial due to its depiction of the characters freely discussing their sex lives; in the left-wing "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>", Andrew Billen praised it as a homage to "<a href="La%20Ronde%20%28play%29">La Ronde</a>" and, despite the sex-talk, being "intricately constructed as a farce". The right-wing tabloid "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>"s critic wrote that the episode "veered a little too close last night towards the category of 'adult entertainment', with all its connotations of sleaze and smut" and "we found ourselves immersed in their sex lives on a level of embarrassing intimacy which most people would share only with their doctor". A complaint was made by a viewer to the <a href="Independent%20Television%20Commission">Independent Television Commission</a>—the commercial television regulator—about the depiction of sex, but it was not upheld.

A scene in Series 2, Episode 4 showing Karen smoking a joint at a dinner party was debated at the writing stage; all scripts were required to be sent to Granada's Compliance department to ensure they maintained the ITC's code of conduct. The department would not allow Karen's drug use to be portrayed without some cost to her, so suggested that Karen and Adam could be arrested while rolling joints at the school reunion. Bullen thought the idea was "ludicrous" so added a scene where David berates Ramona for "her" drug use. Despite the measures taken, four people complained to the ITC about the glamorisation of drugs. The ITC dismissed the complaints. The scenes of Jo and Audrey smoking cannabis in Series 5, Episode 1 drew seven complaints to the ITC by people who thought it would give children the wrong impression of drugs. The ITC dismissed the complaints on the basis that the episode was broadcast after the <a href="watershed%20%28television%29%23United%20Kingdom">watershed</a>. Mark Lawson was unappreciative of the scene, writing that the drugs plot was a "forced jollity" compared to the other humorous scenes in the episode.

In Series 3, Adam and Rachel seek <a href="intracytoplasmic%20sperm%20injection">intracytoplasmic sperm injection</a> (ICSI) when they have trouble conceiving a child naturally. The characters take out bank loans of thousands of pounds to pay for the treatment, which is unsuccessful each time. The producers devised this storyline because IVF was a major contemporary issue and wrote the treatment as a failure because it was representative of the odds of conception in real life.

Rachel's problem with conception is soon diagnosed as being due to "partial <a href="Asherman%27s%20syndrome">Asherman's syndrome</a>", a storyline that runs through Series 3 and 4. The plot was analysed on an episode of BBC Radio 4's "<a href="Woman%27s%20Hour">Woman's Hour</a>". <a href="Ann%20Furedi">Ann Furedi</a> of BPAS, which had supplied information to the writing team during the research stages, stated that there had not been a recorded case of Asherman's syndrome in the United Kingdom since the Second World War. Further to that, she stated that the consensus among medical groups was that there was no real direct link between abortions and infertility; rather an untreated infection could increase the chances of fertility problems if it interfered with an abortion. Christine Geraghty countered that the factual accuracy of the storyline depended on how the producers wanted to portray the issue to viewers. Her opinion was backed up by an ITV statement, which said that "stories for "Cold Feet" are not just chosen in order to make people aware of the issues involved; they're also chosen for their dramatic potential and relevance to modern living". "Woman's Hour" presenter <a href="Jenni%20Murray">Jenni Murray</a> developed the discussion in an article for "The Guardian"; she mentioned that no impression was given that Rachel had suffered an incorrectly performed operation or had had to travel to eastern Europe for it, and that it was improbable that Rachel managed to conceive a child after all.

Cold Feet continued to cover social issues when it returned in 2016. The character of Pete was diagnosed with depression. Writer Mike Bullen himself has battled depression.

In a 2007 feature for "The Guardian"s "G2" supplement, screenwriter <a href="Danny%20Brocklehurst">Danny Brocklehurst</a> discussed the impact the series has had on British television, including inspiration for one of his programmes, "<a href="Talk%20to%20Me%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Talk to Me</a>". He opined that until "Cold Feet" there had not been a significant television series depicting "the wants and needs of ordinary young adults" since "Thirtysomething" concluded in 1991. Brocklehurst developed "Talk to Me" in the same manner as Bullen developed "Cold Feet", namely by basing its characters on his own experiences and friends. Both Brocklehurst and Mark Lawson have discussed similar "copycat" series, including "Hearts and Bones", "Metropolis", "Couples" and "Wonderful You". Brocklehurst noted that these series "lacked ["Cold Feet"s] warmth and believability" adding that they were "unrealistic and cynical". In 2007, Brocklehurst said:

Over four years after "Cold Feet" ended, ITV executives were still looking for a series that could comfortably replace it. On his appointment as chairman of <a href="ITV%20plc">ITV plc</a> in 2007, <a href="Michael%20Grade">Michael Grade</a> announced that he wanted the ITV network to be broadcasting long-running series like "Cold Feet" to attract the younger, upmarket viewing demographic.

In 2008, BBC One broadcast "<a href="Mutual%20Friends">Mutual Friends</a>", a six-part television series written by <a href="Anil%20Gupta%20%28writer%29">Anil Gupta</a>, which was compared to "Cold Feet". While the BBC wanted the series to match the success of "Cold Feet", producer Rob Bullock stressed that ""Cold Feet" is about a different period of life. It's about people in their early thirties. "Mutual Friends" moves things on—what's happening to our characters as they approach 40 is very different. Why do so many lives fall apart at 40? Because things haven't worked out how we hoped and we've had to turn to Plan B. The drama is all about the crisis caused by things not turning out as the characters planned." Later in 2008, ITV commissioned "<a href="Married%20Single%20Other">Married Single Other</a>", a comedy drama executive-produced by Andy Harries and directed by Declan Lowney, about three contemporary couples living in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>.

Granada Entertainment USA, the American arm of <a href="Granada%20Productions">Granada Productions</a>, tendered the series format to American networks and cable channels from late 1997. The format was sold to <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, which commissioned 13 x 60-minute episodes in May 1999 for the fall season, to be produced in association with Kerry Ehrin Productions. <a href="Cold%20Feet%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The US series</a> starred <a href="David%20Sutcliffe">David Sutcliffe</a> as Adam Williams and <a href="Jean%20Louisa%20Kelly">Jean Louisa Kelly</a> as Shelley Sullivan (the Rachel role). Low ratings lead to the series being cancelled after four episodes. In 2003 the format was sold to Italian network <a href="Mediaset">Mediaset</a> for a 2004 broadcast. In 2008, Polish broadcaster <a href="TVN%20%28Poland%29">TVN</a> secured the rights to a remake from Granada International. This version, entitled "", is set in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>. The thirteen-episode series began filming in May 2009 and was broadcast from 6 March 2010. An adaptation entitled "" has also been developed for television audiences in the Czech Republic. The creators intend the show to run for three series of 13 episodes and tell a story over seven years. The first series was broadcast from September 2009.

During and after its original run, "Cold Feet" won over 20 major awards. For its first year, "Cold Feet" received three <a href="British%20Comedy%20Awards">British Comedy Award</a> nominations; the series won in the Best TV Comedy Drama category and Nesbitt and Ripley were respectively nominated for Best TV Comedy Actor and Best TV Comedy Actress.

For the second series, it received four <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award">British Academy Television Award</a> (BAFTA) nominations—<a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20Drama%20Series">Best Drama Series</a>, Best Original Television Music, Best Graphic Design, and Best Editing (Fiction/Entertainment). At the <a href="Television%20and%20Radio%20Industries%20Club">Television and Radio Industries Club Awards</a> it won TV Comedy Programme of the Year, and a second Best TV Comedy Drama award at the British Comedy Awards. The awards for the television industry magazine "<a href="Broadcast%20%28magazine%29">Broadcast</a>" presented it with the Drama: Series or Serial award. In year three, Fay Ripley became the only actor to receive a BAFTA nomination for their work on the series; she was nominated for <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a>. At the BAFTA Craft awards, David Nicholls was nominated in the New Writer (Fiction) category, and Jon Jones was nominated in the New Director (Fiction) category. It lost out on four British Comedy Award nominations (Nesbitt and Thomson for Best TV Comedy Actor, Norris for Best TV Comedy Actress, and the third series for Best TV Comedy Drama) but won the People's Choice Award (a viewer poll). The series also scored an <a href="International%20Emmy%20Award">International Emmy Award</a> drama nomination. Series 4 won the BAFTA for Best Drama Series and the <a href="National%20Television%20Awards">National Television Award</a> for Most Popular Comedy Programme.

Penelope Rosemont

Penelope Rosemont (born 1942 in <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>) a visual artist, writer, publisher, and social activist attended <a href="Lake%20Forest%20College">Lake Forest College</a>. She has been a participant in the <a href="Surrealist">Surrealist</a> group founded by <a href="Andre%20Breton">Andre Breton</a> since 1965. With <a href="Franklin%20Rosemont">Franklin Rosemont</a>, Bernard Marszalek, Robert Green and Tor
Faegre, she established the <a href="Chicago%20Surrealist%20Group">Chicago Surrealist Group</a> in 1966. She was in 1964-1966 a member of the <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW), commonly known as the Wobblies, and was part of the national staff of <a href="Students%20for%20a%20Democratic%20Society">Students for a Democratic Society</a> (SDS) in 1967-68. Her influences include <a href="Andre%20Breton">Andre Breton</a> and <a href="Guy%20Debord">Guy Debord</a> of the <a href="Situationist%20International">Situationist International</a>, <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> and <a href="Lucy%20Parsons">Lucy Parsons</a>.

In 1986, Penelope Rosemont’s painting the “Marriage of Heaven and Hell” was included in the Venice Biennale, selected by Arturo Schwartz to be in the Art and Alchemy section. A painter, photographer, and <a href="collagist">collagist</a>, Rosemont is credited with having invented a number of surrealist collage methods including the "landscapade" and "insect music" [in which cut-out shapes are placed on the background of a musical score]. Rosemont is a writer and graphic designer for <a href="Arsenal/Surrealist%20Subversion">Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion</a> and other publications. Her painting "The Night Time is the Right Time" "was selected by the <a href="Chicago%20Jazz%20Institute">Chicago Jazz Institute</a> for the 2000 <a href="Chicago%20Jazz%20Festival">Chicago Jazz Festival</a> T-shirt". A number of Rosemont's drawings and artwork appear in her books and are particularly abundant in "Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights".

The Rosemonts write with enthusiasm about their meeting with Andre Breton and Surrealist group members during a stay in Paris in December 1965- May 1966. Penelope writes about this important period in her life in the books "Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights" and in her autobiographical work "Dreams and Everyday Life: Andre Breton, Surrealism, Rebel Worker, SDS, & the Seven Cities of Cibola, A 1960s Notebook" while Franklin discusses it in his book, "An Open Entrance into the Shut Palace of Wrong Numbers". In the " Surrealist Experiences", Penelope Rosemont writes about a nascent group of Surrealists that had already formed in Chicago, the Rebel Worker group, before they met Breton and in fact, this was the impetus to go to Paris, to meet the Surrealists they had been corresponding with. She writes that the initial plan was to go to London first and then to Paris. She writes "thanks to a mean-spirited British immigration bureaucrat," they were deported to Paris. That event was fortuitous because the surrealist exhibition L’Ecart absolu was taking place at the time; she attended a New Years Eve party organized by surrealists;and she was able to talk with Breton before he "became seriously ill a few months later."

The Rosemonts are referenced in <a href="Helena%20Lewis">Helena Lewis</a>' 1988 book on Surrealism and Politics, Dada Turns Red.. There, Lewis wrote: 

"There was also a group of young people in Chicago in the late 1960s who made a connection between Surrealism and the old IWW, The Rebel Worker in which translations of Surrealist writing appeared . . . and they also published an art anthology of Surrealist political texts, in which the editor, Franklin Rosemont, explained how Surrealism was relevant to his movement." 

The Chicago Surrealist group, under their imprint <a href="Black%20Swan%20Press">Black Swan Press</a>, published the journal <a href="Arsenal/Surrealist%20Subversion">Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion</a> sporadically from 1970 to 1989 which featured the work of <a href="Richard%20Huelsenbeck">Richard Huelsenbeck</a>, <a href="Andre%20Breton">Andre Breton</a>, <a href="Georges%20Bataille">Georges Bataille</a>, <a href="Ted%20Joans">Ted Joans</a> <a href="Jayne%20Cortez">Jayne Cortez</a> and many other Surrealists, well-known and lesser known. Franklin and Penelope Rosemont were on the editorial board, along with (for issue 4), co-editors <a href="Paul%20Garon">Paul Garon</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Jablonski">Joseph Jablonski</a> and <a href="Philip%20Lamantia">Philip Lamantia</a>.

Penelope Rosemont is the editor and wrote extensive introductions for her book "" (University of Texas, 1998), a book of over 500 pages of writing and art by women in the Surrealist movement, both past and present, dating back to the beginnings of Surrealism in the 1920s. It features <a href="Meret%20Oppenheim">Meret Oppenheim</a>, <a href="Mary%20Low">Mary Low</a>, <a href="Leonora%20Carrington">Leonora Carrington</a>, <a href="Nancy%20Cunard">Nancy Cunard</a>, <a href="Frida%20Kahlo">Frida Kahlo</a>, <a href="Dorothea%20Tanning">Dorothea Tanning</a>, <a href="Elisa%20Breton">Elisa Breton</a>, <a href="Kay%20Sage">Kay Sage</a>, <a href="Jayne%20Cortez">Jayne Cortez</a>, <a href="Rikki%20Ducornet">Rikki Ducornet</a> and over one hundred more.6
Her latest book is “Make Love, Not War: Surrealism 1968!” With Don LaCoss and Michael Lowy (Kerr Publishing, Chicago 2018)
She is the author of "Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights" (<a href="Black%20Swan%20Press">Black Swan Press</a>, 2000), and books of poetry, including "Beware of the Ice", and "Athanor" (1971).

In 1997, Black Swan Press released the book "The Forecast is Hot!, and Other Collective Declarations of the Surrealist Movement in the United States", which Penelope co-authored with Franklin Rosemont and fellow Chicago Surrealist <a href="Paul%20Garon">Paul Garon</a>.

She also edited "The Story of Mary MacLane & Other Writings" by <a href="Mary%20MacLane">Mary MacLane</a> in 1998, which was re-released by Charles H. Kerr, having originally been published in 1902. MacLane has been "hailed as the first 'New Woman' in literature, the first flapper and a precursor of surrealism."

In 2008 her memoir came out, "Dreams & Everyday Life, André Breton, Surrealism, Rebel Worker, SDS & the Seven Cities of Cibola", about her life in the 1960s from moving to Chicago to meeting Andre Breton in Paris, to London and back again to Chicago in 1968.

A collection of true Chicago stories, "Armitage Avenue Transcendentalists" edited by Rosemont and Janina Ciezadlo came out in 2009. She also wrote a forward to "Crime & Criminals: Address to the Prisoners in the Cook County Jail & Other Writings on Crime" by <a href="Clarence%20Darrow">Clarence Darrow</a>.

In addition to editing the anthology Surrealist Women, Rosemont has written extensively about women, including Toyen, specifically, as well as many Surrealist women, who are often omitted from the history of Surrealism, in her book Surrealist Experiences

In 1983 she and <a href="Franklin%20Rosemont">Franklin Rosemont</a> became directors of <a href="Charles%20H.%20Kerr%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Charles H. Kerr & Company</a>, a publisher of books on history and Chicago history

In 2001, the Rosemonts and <a href="Carlos%20Cortez">Carlos Cortez</a> received the award for their work "rescuing and re-charging" Charles H. Kerr Publishing."

Penelope Rosemont was a member of the IWW (Wobblies) and SDS in the 1960s. With <a href="Franklin%20Rosemont">Franklin Rosemont</a> she compiled a collection of pamphlets, wall posters, and periodicals focusing on the IWW acquired by the <a href="Newberry%20Library">Newberry Library</a> in 2008<ref>Newberry Library Collection abstract, https://mms.newberry.org/detail.asp?recordid=1435</> Her book "Armitage Avenue Transcendentalists" details stories in the lives of a number of activists, including famous Chicagoan <a href="Studs%20Terkel">Studs Terkel</a>.

Flag of Lithuania

The flag of Lithuania () consists of a horizontal <a href="Triband%20%28flag%29">tricolor</a> of <a href="yellow">yellow</a>, <a href="green">green</a>, and <a href="red">red</a>. It was adopted on 25 April 1918 during <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>'s first period of independence (in the 20th century) from 1918 to 1940, which ceased with the occupation first by Soviet Russia and Lithuania's annexation into the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, and then by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> (1941–1944). During the post-World War II Soviet occupation, from 1945 until 1989, the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20Lithuanian%20SSR">Soviet Lithuanian flag</a> consisted first of a generic red <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet flag</a> with the name of the republic, then changed to the red flag with <a href="white">white</a> and green bars at the bottom. 

The flag was then re-adopted on 20 March 1989, almost a year before the <a href="Act%20of%20March%2011">re-establishment of Lithuania's independence</a> and almost three years before the <a href="collapse%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">collapse of the Soviet Union</a>. The last alteration to the current flag occurred in 2004, when the <a href="aspect%20ratio">aspect ratio</a> changed from 1:2 to 3:5.

The earliest known flags with a Lithuanian identity were recorded in the 15th-century "<a href="Banderia%20Prutenorum">Banderia Prutenorum</a>", written by <a href="Jan%20D%C5%82ugosz">Jan Długosz</a>. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Grunwald">Battle of Grunwald</a> in 1410, two distinct flags were present. The majority of the 40 regiments carried a red banner depicting a <a href="Pahonia">mounted knight in pursuit</a>. This flag, known as the "<a href="Vytis">Vytis</a>", would eventually be used as the Lithuanian war flag, and again in 2004 as the state flag. 
The remainder of the regiments carried a red banner displaying the <a href="Columns%20of%20Gediminas">Columns of Gediminas</a>. Those that bore the Vytis, also known as the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Pogo%C5%84%20Litewska">Pahonia</a>, were armies from the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, while those who bore the Columns of Gediminas were from <a href="Nobility%20in%20Lithuania">noble families</a> of Lithuania. Until the end of the 18th century, when it <a href="Partitions%20of%20Poland">was annexed by the Russian Empire</a>, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania used the Vytis as its flag.

The birth of the yellow, green, and red tricolor occurred during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life to the idea of the tricolor was the <a href="Flag%20of%20France">French</a> blue, white, and red flag adopted after the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. The only tricolor that existed for Lithuania before the yellow, green, and red flag was a green, white, and red flag used to represent <a href="Lithuania%20Minor">Lithuania Minor</a>.

It is not known who originally suggested the yellow, green, and red colors, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and <a href="national%20costume">traditional dress</a>. At the <a href="Great%20Seimas%20of%20Vilnius">Great Seimas of Vilnius</a> of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as the flag of the Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by <a href="Jonas%20Basanavi%C4%8Dius">Jonas Basanavičius</a>, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was that as part of the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> or <a href="Communism">Communist</a> causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.

Debates about the national flag occurred again in 1917 during the <a href="Vilnius%20Conference">Vilnius Conference</a>. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist <a href="Antanas%20%C5%BDmuidzinavi%C4%8Dius">Antanas Žmuidzinavičius</a> decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates did not like the design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On 19 April 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the <a href="Council%20of%20Lithuania">Council of Lithuania</a>. The flag was supposed to be a tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 <a href="Constitution%20of%20Lithuania">Constitution of Lithuania</a> did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered <a href="Gold%20%28colour%29">gold</a> an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green, and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Lithuania was <a href="Occupation%20of%20the%20Baltic%20states">occupied by the Soviet Union</a> (1940–1941, 1944–1990) and <a href="Occupation%20of%20Lithuania%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> (1941–1944). The use of the national flag during this period was prohibited and prosecuted. Two flags were used during the period of Soviet occupation (1944–1989): immediately after the war, the flag consisted of a red field, golden <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a> with the <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin</a> characters "LIETUVOS TSR" (Lithuanian SSR in the <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian language</a>) above them in gold <a href="sans-serif">sans-serif</a> lettering. That flag was replaced in 1953 by the last flag used by the <a href="Lithuanian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic</a>—a red flag, with the hammer and sickle and star in the <a href="Flag%20terminology%23Description%20of%20standard%20flag%20parts%20and%20terms">hoist</a>. At the bottom of the flag, a white and green horizontal bar was placed. The red portion of the flag took of the flag's width, the white and the green .

During 1988, when the Lithuanian <a href="Singing%20Revolution">movement towards independence</a> was gaining strength, the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20Lithuanian%20SSR">Lithuanian Supreme Soviet</a> again recognized the tricolor as the national flag, by amending article 168 of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Lithuanian SSR. The flag was defined as rectangular tricolor which consists of three equally sized horizontal stripes: the upper is yellow, the middle is green, the lower is red; the flag ratio was to be 1:2 (as that of <a href="Flags%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Republics">Soviet flags</a>). This flag was confirmed by the Provisional Constitution of 11 March 1990 № I-10.

After independence from the Soviet Union, the tricolor flag was written into the new <a href="Constitution%20of%20Lithuania">Constitution of Lithuania</a>, which was adopted by a <a href="Lithuanian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201992">referendum in 1992</a>. This constitution has not specified the flag aspect ratio and therefore it remained 1:2 until 2004, when 1991 law "On the national flag and other flags" was revised by 8 July 2004 law no. IX-2331, making the flag ratio 3:5.

Passed on 26 June 1991, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Lithuanian State Flag (Law No. I-1497) governs the design, sizes and use of the state flag. The law was amended on 8 July 2004, (Law No. IX-2331) with the most notable changes including the switching of the national flag ratio from 1:2 to 3:5 and the official adoption of a historical flag as the state (government) flag. The amendment came into force on 1 September 2004, after it was approved by <a href="President%20of%20Lithuania">President</a> <a href="Valdas%20Adamkus">Valdas Adamkus</a>.

The yellow in the flag is meant to symbolize the sun and prosperity, the green is for the forests, the countryside, liberty, and hope, and the red represents the blood and bravery of those who have died for Lithuania. The proper colors of both the national and state flag are made according to the <a href="Pantone">Pantone Matching System</a>, specifically Pantone textile-paper (TP). The ratio of both the national and state flag must be 3:5, with the standard flag size to be . Different sizes of the flag can be created, but they must conform to the color codes and ratio requirements set in the law. The official Pantone colors have been published since 2004; the list below shows the official colors and their suggested equivalents:

In 2004, along with the law authorizing the change of the flag ratio, a state flag was adopted. This flag displays the national emblem in a banner form. The ratio of the flag is the same as that of the national flag, i.e. 3:5. The state flag, called the "historical national (armorial) flag" in law, was proposed by <a href="%C4%8Ceslovas%20Jur%C5%A1%C4%97nas">Česlovas Juršėnas</a>, the vice-speaker of the Seimas, and by <a href="Edmundas%20Rim%C5%A1a">Edmundas Rimša</a>, the chairman of the Commission of Heraldry. This flag was also proposed at the same time as the grand coat of arms; both were meant to honor the 750th anniversary of the coronation of <a href="Mindaugas">Mindaugas</a> in 1253. The designer of the State (historic) flag and coat of arms was <a href="Arvydas%20Ka%C5%BEdailis">Arvydas Každailis</a>. Historically, this flag was used during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Grunwald">Battle of Grunwald</a>, and has served as the government flag for <a href="Republic%20of%20Central%20Lithuania">Central Lithuania</a> from 1922 until 1939. This was one of the few flags considered to become the national flag during the drive for national independence. Several other countries, including <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, have an official national flag for civilian use and a <a href="state%20flag">state flag</a> for government use.

Under the National Flag Law, the state flag is permanently hoisted at three locations: the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Lithuania">Royal Palace of Lithuania</a>, <a href="Trakai%20Island%20Castle">Trakai Island Castle</a>, and the grounds of the <a href="Vytautas%20the%20Great%20War%20Museum">Vytautas the Great War Museum</a> in <a href="Kaunas">Kaunas</a>. In addition, the flag is hoisted at the following locations on these days:


The flag can be flown vertically or horizontally from public buildings, private homes, businesses, ships, town squares, or during official ceremonies. If the flag is flown horizontally, the yellow stripe must be at top; when flown vertically, the yellow stripe must be facing Left with the red stripe facing Right. While the flag should be flown from sunrise to sunset, government offices in Lithuania and abroad must fly the flag on a 24-hour basis. The flags must conform to the legal standards, and cannot be soiled or damaged in any way.

For <a href="mourning">mourning</a> activities, the flag can be flown in either of the following ways. The first method, commonly known as <a href="half-staff">half-staff</a>ing, is performed when the flag is hoisted to the top of the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other method is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During a <a href="funeral">funeral</a> ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the <a href="Act%20of%20the%20Re-Establishment%20of%20the%20State%20of%20Lithuania">Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania</a>, and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.

When flying the Lithuanian flag with other flags, the following is the correct order of precedence: The national flag, the historical (state) flag, flags of foreign states, the flag of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, international <a href="non-governmental%20organization">NGOs</a>, the presidential standard, military and government standards, <a href="Counties%20of%20Lithuania">county</a> flags, city flags and any others. When foreign flags are used alongside the Lithuanian flag, the flags are sorted according to their countries' names in the <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian language</a>. The only exception is when the congress or meeting held in Lithuanian dictates a different language to be used for sorting. The <a href="European%20flag">European Union flag</a> has been hoisted since Lithuania became a member of the organization. While not mentioned by name in the law, the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organisation">flag of NATO</a> can be used in Lithuania, since it belongs to that organization as well. It is also common to fly the <a href="Flag%20of%20Estonia">flags of Estonia</a> and <a href="Flag%20of%20Latvia">Latvia</a> during certain occasions, mainly the celebration of independence of the three <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a>. The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the National Flag and Other Flags governs the rules, use, protocol and manufacturing of the national and other flags used inside the country.

As part of the flag protocol, the daily display of the Lithuanian flag is encouraged, but is strongly encouraged or legally required on the following days:

Apart from these days, the flag is flown at <a href="Elections%20in%20Lithuania">election</a> polling sites. The national government, under Article 4, Section 7 of the flag law, is given the authority to call for the display of the national flag and to determine special conditions, such as marking for mourning.

A <a href="naval%20ensign">naval ensign</a> has been used by Lithuania starting in 1992. The ensign has a white background charged with a blue cross, with the national flag in the canton. The width of each cross is 1/7th of the total width of the ensign, with the ratio being 1:2. Historically, this flag was used as the ensign of the <a href="Kaunas%20Yacht%20Club">Kaunas Yacht Club</a>, but with a different ratio of 2:3. The <a href="maritime%20flag">naval jack</a> is identical to the historical state flag of Lithuania. A masthead pennant have been adopted by the <a href="Lithuanian%20Naval%20Force">Lithuanian Navy</a> to use on their ships.

The <a href="President%20of%20Lithuania">President of Lithuania</a> was officially given a standard by the <a href="Seimas">Seimas</a> in 1993. The standard is the State Emblem of Lithuania charged in the center on a single-color background. Under state law, the background color is stated as purple, but the color used in practice is dark red. The ratio of the standard is 1:1.2.

Each county of Lithuania has adopted a flag, each of them conforming to a pattern: a blue rectangle, with ten instances of the Cross of <a href="Vytis">Vytis</a> (<a href="cross%20of%20Lorraine">double cross</a> <a href="or%20%28heraldry%29">or</a>) appearing in gold, acts as a fringe to the central feature of the flag, which is chosen by the county itself. Most of the central designs were adapted from the counties' coat of arms.

Castell Coch

Castell Coch (; ) is a 19th-century <a href="Gothic%20Revival">Gothic Revival</a> castle built above the village of <a href="Tongwynlais">Tongwynlais</a> in <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a>. The first castle on the site was built by the Normans after 1081, to protect the newly conquered town of <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> and control the route along the <a href="River%20Taff">Taff Gorge</a>. Abandoned shortly afterwards, the castle's earth <a href="motte">motte</a> was reused by <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Clare%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Gilbert de Clare</a> as the basis for a new stone fortification, which he built between 1267 and 1277 to control his freshly annexed Welsh lands. This castle was likely destroyed in the <a href="native%20Welsh">native Welsh</a> rebellion of 1314. In 1760, the castle ruins were acquired by <a href="John%20Stuart%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Bute">John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute</a>, as part of a marriage settlement that brought the family vast estates in South Wales.

<a href="John%20Crichton-Stuart%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Bute">John Crichton-Stuart</a>, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, inherited the castle in 1848. One of Britain's wealthiest men, with interests in <a href="architecture">architecture</a> and <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a> studies, he employed the architect <a href="William%20Burges">William Burges</a> to reconstruct the castle, "as a country residence for occasional occupation in the summer", using the medieval remains as a basis for the design. Burges rebuilt the outside of the castle between 1875 and 1879, before turning to the interior; he died in 1881 and the work was finished by Burges's remaining team in 1891. Bute reintroduced commercial <a href="viticulture">viticulture</a> into Britain, planting a vineyard just below the castle, and wine production continued until the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. The Marquess made little use of his new retreat and in 1950 his grandson, the <a href="John%20Crichton-Stuart%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Bute">5th Marquess of Bute</a>, placed it into the care of the state. It is now controlled by the Welsh heritage agency <a href="Cadw">Cadw</a>.

Castell Coch's external features and the <a href="High%20Victorian%20Gothic">High Victorian</a> interiors led the historian David McLees to describe it as "one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition." The exterior, based on 19th-century studies by the antiquarian <a href="G.%20T.%20Clark">George Clark</a>, is relatively authentic in style, although its three stone towers were adapted by Burges to present a dramatic silhouette, closer in design to mainland European castles such as <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chillon">Chillon</a> than native British fortifications. The interiors were elaborately decorated, with specially designed furniture and fittings; the designs include extensive use of symbolism drawing on <a href="Classical%20mythology">classical</a> and <a href="legend">legend</a>ary themes. <a href="J.%20Mordaunt%20Crook">Joseph Mordaunt Crook</a> wrote that the castle represented "the learned dream world of a great patron and his favourite architect, recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy-tale castle which seems almost to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript." 

The surrounding <a href="Castell%20Coch%20Woodlands%20and%20Road%20Section">beech woods</a> contain rare plant species and unusual geological features and are protected as a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>.

The first castle on the Castell Coch site was probably built after 1081, during the <a href="Norman%20invasion%20of%20Wales">Norman invasion of Wales</a>. It formed one of a string of eight fortifications intended to defend the newly conquered town of <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> and control the route along the <a href="River%20Taff">Taff Gorge</a>. It took the form of a raised, earth-work <a href="motte">motte</a>, about across at the base and on the top, protected by the surrounding steep slopes. The 16th-century historian Rice Merrick claimed that the castle was built by the Welsh lord <a href="Ifor%20ap%20Meurig">Ifor ap Meurig</a>, but there are no records of this phase of the castle's history and modern historians doubt this account. The first castle was probably abandoned after 1093 when the Norman lordship of Glamorgan was created, changing the line of the frontier.

In 1267, <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Clare%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Gilbert de Clare</a>, who held the <a href="Glamorgan%23Lordship%20of%20Glamorgan">Lordship of Glamorgan</a>, seized the lands around the town of <a href="Senghenydd">Senghenydd</a> in the north of Glamorgan from their native Welsh ruler. <a href="Caerphilly%20Castle">Caerphilly Castle</a> was built to control the new territory and Castell Coch—strategically located between Cardiff and Caerphilly—was reoccupied. A new castle was built in stone around the motte, comprising a shell-wall, a projecting circular tower, a <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a> and a square hall above an <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a>. The north-west section of the walls was protected by a <a href="Talus%20%28fortification%29">talus</a> and the sides of the motte were <a href="Counterscarp">scarped</a> to increase their angle, all producing a small but powerful fortification. Further work followed between 1268 and 1277, which added two large towers, a turning-bridge for the gatehouse and further protection to the north-west walls.

On Gilbert's death, the castle passed to his widow <a href="Joan%20of%20Acre">Joan</a> and around this time it was referred to as "Castrum Rubeum", Latin for "the Red Castle", probably after the colour of the <a href="Red%20sandstone">sandstone</a> defences. Gilbert's son, also named <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Clare%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Gilbert</a>, inherited the property in 1307. He died at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bannockburn">Battle of Bannockburn</a> in 1314, triggering an uprising of the <a href="native%20Welsh">native Welsh</a> in the region. Castell Coch was probably destroyed by the rebels in July 1314, and possibly <a href="slighted">slighted</a> to put it beyond any further use; it was not rebuilt and the site was abandoned.

Castell Coch remained derelict; the <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a> <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a>, visiting around 1536, described it as "all in ruin, no big thing but high". The artist and illustrator <a href="Julius%20Caesar%20Ibbetson">Julius Caesar Ibbetson</a> painted the castle in 1792, depicting substantial remains and a prominent tower, with a <a href="lime%20kiln">lime kiln</a> in operation alongside the fortification. Stone from the castle may have been robbed and used to feed the kilns during this period. A similar view was sketched by an unknown artist in the early 19th century, showing more trees around the ruins; a few years later, Robert Drane recommended the site as a place for picnics and noted its abundance in wild <a href="garlic">garlic</a>.

The ruins were acquired by the <a href="Marquess%20of%20Bute">Earls of Bute</a> in 1760, when <a href="John%20Stuart%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Bute">John Stuart</a>, the 3rd Earl and, from 1794, the 1st Marquess, married <a href="Viscount%20Windsor">Lady Charlotte Windsor</a>, adding her estates in South Wales to his inheritance. John's grandson, <a href="John%20Crichton-Stuart%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Bute">John Crichton-Stuart</a>, developed the <a href="Cardiff%20Docks">Cardiff Docks</a> in the first half of the 19th century; although the docks were not especially profitable, they opened opportunities for the expansion of the coal industry in the South Wales valleys, making the Bute family extremely wealthy. The 2nd Marquess carried out exploration for <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> at Castell Coch in 1827 and considered establishing an ironworks there.

The 3rd Marquess of Bute, another <a href="John%20Crichton-Stuart%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Bute">John Crichton-Stuart</a>, inherited the castle and the family estates as a child in 1848. On his coming of age, Bute's landed estates and industrial inheritance made him one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had a wide range of interests including archaeology, theology, linguistics and history. Interest in medieval architecture increased in Britain during the 19th century, and in 1850 the antiquarian <a href="G.%20T.%20Clark">George Clark</a> surveyed Castell Coch and published his findings, the first major scholarly work about the castle. The ruins were covered in rubble, ivy, brushwood and weeds; the keep had been largely destroyed and the gatehouse was so covered with debris that Clark failed to discover it. Nonetheless, Clark considered the external walls "tolerably perfect" and advised that the castle be conserved, complete with the ivy-covered stonework.

In 1871, Bute asked his chief Cardiff engineer, John McConnochie, to excavate and clear the castle ruins. The report on the investigations was produced by <a href="William%20Burges">William Burges</a>, an architect with an interest in medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865. The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop <a href="Cardiff%20Castle">Cardiff Castle</a> in the late 1860s, and the two men became close collaborators. Burges's lavishly illustrated report, which drew extensively on Clark's earlier work, laid out two options: either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer. On receipt of the report, Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style.

The reconstruction of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875, because of the demands of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess's trustees that he was facing bankruptcy. On commencement, the Kitchen Tower, Hall Block and shell wall were rebuilt first, followed by the Well Tower and the Gatehouse, and the Keep Tower last. Burges's drawings for the proposed rebuilding survive at the Bute seat of <a href="Mount%20Stuart%20House">Mount Stuart</a>. The drawings were supplemented by a large number of wooden and plaster models, from smaller pieces to full-size models of furniture.

The bulk of the external work was complete by the end of 1879. The result closely followed Burges's original plans, with the exception of an additional watch tower intended to resemble a <a href="minaret">minaret</a>, and some defensive timber <a href="Hoarding%20%28castle%29">hoardings</a>, both of which were not undertaken. Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features, such as the drawbridge and <a href="portcullis">portcullis</a>, against surviving designs at other British castles.

Burges's team of craftsmen at Castell Coch included many who had worked with him at Cardiff Castle and elsewhere. <a href="John%20Starling%20Chapple">John Chapple</a>, his office manager, designed most of the furnishings and furniture, and <a href="William%20Frame">William Frame</a> acted as <a href="clerk%20of%20works">clerk of works</a>. <a href="Horatio%20Walter%20Lonsdale">Horatio Lonsdale</a> was Burges's chief artist, painting extensive murals at the castle. His main sculptor was <a href="Thomas%20Nicholls%20%28sculptor%29">Thomas Nicholls</a>, together with another long-time collaborator, the Italian sculptor <a href="Ceccardo%20Egidio%20Fucigna">Ceccardo Fucigna</a>.

Stimulated by antiquarian writings about British viticulture, Bute decided to reintroduce commercial <a href="grape%20vine">grape vine</a>s into Britain in 1873. He sent his gardener Andrew Pettigrew to France for training and planted a vineyard just beneath the castle in 1875. The first harvests were poor and the initial harvest in 1877 produced only 240 bottles. "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" magazine claimed that any wine produced would be so unpleasant that "it would take four men to drink it—two to hold the victim and one to pour the wine down his throat". By 1887, the output was 3,000 bottles of <a href="Sweetness%20of%20wine">sweet</a> <a href="white%20wine">white wine</a> of reasonable quality. Bute persevered, commercial success followed and 40 <a href="hogshead">hogshead</a>s of wine, including a <a href="red%20wine">red varietal</a> using <a href="Gamay">Gamay</a> grapes, were produced annually by 1894 to positive reviews.

Burges died in 1881 after catching a severe <a href="chills">chill</a> during a site visit to the castle. His brother-in-law, the architect <a href="Richard%20Popplewell%20Pullan">Richard Pullan</a>, took over the commission and delegated most of the work to Frame, who directed the work on the interior until its completion in 1891. Bute and his wife Gwendolen were consulted over the details of the interior decoration; replica family portraits based on those at Cardiff were commissioned to hang on the walls. Clark approved of the result, commenting in 1884 that the restoration was in "excellent taste". An <a href="Oratory%20%28worship%29">oratory</a> originally built on the roof of the Well Tower was removed before 1891 but in other respects the completed castle was left unaltered.

The castle was not greatly used; the Marquess rarely visited after its completion. The property had probably only been intended for limited, informal use, for example as a retreat following picnics. Although it had reception rooms suitable for large gatherings, it had only three bedrooms and was too far from Cardiff for casual visits. The restored castle initially received little interest from the architectural community, possibly because the total rebuilding of the castle ran counter to the increasingly popular late-Victorian philosophy of conserving older buildings and monuments.

Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, was given a <a href="Life%20estate">life interest</a> in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the <a href="Chaptalization">fermentation process</a>, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. <a href="John%20Crichton-Stuart%2C%204th%20Marquess%20of%20Bute">John</a>, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the <a href="Economic%20history%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Postwar%20stagnation">depression of the 1920s</a>; by 1938, the great majority of the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.

The <a href="John%20Crichton-Stuart%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Bute">5th Marquess of Bute</a>, another John, succeeded in 1947 and, in 1950, he placed the castle in the care of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Works%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Works</a>. The Marquess also disposed of Cardiff Castle, which he gave to the city, removing the family portraits from the castle before doing so. In turn, the paintings in Castell Coch were removed by the ministry and sent to Cardiff, the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Wales">National Museum of Wales</a> providing alternatives from their collection for Castell Coch. Academic interest in the property grew, with publications in the 1950s and 1960s exploring its artistic and architectural value.

Since 1984, the property has been administered by <a href="Cadw">Cadw</a>, an agency of the <a href="Welsh%20Government">Welsh Government</a>, and is open to the public; it received 69,466 visitors in 2011. The Drawing Room is available for wedding ceremonies. The castle has also been used as a location for filming.

The castle's exposed position causes it to suffer from <a href="Damp%20%28structural%29%23Rain%20penetration">penetrating damp</a> and periodic restoration work has been necessary. The stone tiles on the roof were replaced by slate in 1972, a major programme was carried out on the Keep in 2007 and interior conservation work was undertaken in 2011 to address problems in Lady Bute's Bedroom, where damp had begun to damage the finishings.

The original furnishings, many of which the Marquess removed in 1950, have mostly been recovered and returned to their original locations in the castle. Two stained-glass panels from the demolished chapel, lost since 1901, were rediscovered at an auction in 2010 and were bought by Cadw for £125,000 in 2011.

Castell Coch occupies a stretch of woodland on the slopes above the village of <a href="Tongwynlais">Tongwynlais</a> and the River Taff, about north-west of the centre of Cardiff. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic Revival in style, influenced by contemporary 19th-century French restorations. Its design combines the surviving elements of the medieval castle with 19th-century additions to produce a building which the historian Charles Kightly considered "the crowning glory of the Gothic Revival" in Britain. It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building due to its exceptional architectural and historical interest.

The castle comprises three circular towers—the Keep, the Kitchen Tower and the Well Tower—along with the Hall Block, the Gatehouse and a shell wall; the buildings almost entirely encase the original motte in stone. The older parts of the castle are constructed from crudely laid red <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> rubble and grey <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, the 19th-century additions in more precisely cut red <a href="Pennant%20sandstone">Pennant sandstone</a>. A ditch is cut out of the rock in front of the Gatehouse and leads to an eastern approach road. The castle is surrounded by woodland and the 19th-century vineyards below it have been converted into a golf course. In 1850, George Clark recorded an "outer court" of which nothing remains; this may, in fact, have been the traces of the earlier lime kiln operations around the site.

The Gatehouse is reached across a wooden bridge, incorporating a drawbridge. Burges intended the bridge to copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire in the event of attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive <a href="bret%C3%A8che">bretèche</a> and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the <a href="Madonna%20and%20Child">Madonna and Child</a> sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.

The Keep is in diameter with a square, spurred base; in the 13th century there would have been an adjacent turret, on the south-west side, containing latrines, but few traces remain. There is no evidence that the tower that Burges termed a <a href="keep">keep</a> would have fulfilled this function in the medieval period and he appears to have chosen the name because of his initial decision to locate the bedrooms of Lord and Lady Bute in the rebuilt tower. The Kitchen Tower is also across and rests on a square, spurred base. It was originally two storeys high and contained the medieval kitchen; Burgess raised its height and gave it a conical roof and chimneys. The walls of these two towers are around thick at the base, thinning to at the top. The Well Tower at in diameter is slightly narrower than the Keep or Kitchen Tower, with a well in its lowest chamber sunk into the ground. The Well Tower lacks the spurs of the other two towers and has a flat rather than curved back, facing onto the courtyard, similar to some of the towers built at Caerphilly by the de Clares.

The towers contribute to what the architectural writer <a href="Charles%20Handley-Read">Charles Handley-Read</a> considered the castle's "sculptural and dramatic exterior". Almost equal in diameter, but of differing conical roof designs and heights, and topped with copper-gilt weather vanes, they combine to produce a romantic appearance, which Matthew Williams described as bringing "a Wagnerian to the Taff Valley".

The design of the towers was influenced by the work of the contemporary French architect <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Viollet-le-Duc">Eugène Viollet-le-Duc</a>, including his restorations of <a href="Cit%C3%A9%20de%20Carcassonne">Carcassone</a> and the châteaus of <a href="Aigle">Aigle</a> and <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chillon">Chillon</a>. While the exterior of Castell Coch is relatively true to English 13th-century medieval design—albeit heavily influenced by the Gothic Revival movement—the inclusion of the conical roofs, which more closely resemble those of fortifications in France or Switzerland than Britain, is historically inaccurate. Although he mounted a historical defence (see box), Burges chose the roofs mainly for architectural effect, arguing that they appeared "more picturesque", and to provide additional room for accommodation in the castle.

The three towers lead into a small oval courtyard that sits on the top of the motte, about across lengthways. Cantilevered galleries and wall-walks run around the inside of the courtyard with neat and orderly woodwork; the historian <a href="Peter%20Floud">Peter Floud</a> critiqued it as "perhaps too much like the backcloth for an historical pageant". Burges reconstructed the shell wall that runs along the north-west side of the courtyard thick, complete with arrow holes and a battlement.

The Keep, the Well Tower and the Kitchen Tower incorporate a series of apartments, of which the main sequence, the Castellan's Rooms, lies within the Keep. The Hall, the Drawing Room, Lord Bute's Bedroom and Lady Bute's Bedroom form a suite of rooms that exemplify the High Victorian Gothic style of 19th century Britain. Unlike the exterior of the castle, which deliberately imitated the architecture of the 13th century, the interior was purely High Victorian in style. On Burges's decoration of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, Handley-Read wrote: "I have yet to see any High Victorian interiors from the hand, very largely, of one designer, to equal either in homogeneity or completeness, in quality of execution or originality of conception the best of the interiors of the Welsh castles. For sheer power of intoxication, Burges stand[s] unrivalled."

The Banqueting Hall is across with an ceiling, and occupies the whole of the first floor of the Hall Block. Burges persuaded Bute and the antiquarian George Clark that the medieval hall would have stood on the first floor. His original plan saw access via one of two equally circuitous routes through the Well Tower or around the entire internal gallery to enter the hall through a passage next to the Drawing Room. Neither approach was acceptable to Bute and at a late stage, around 1878/9, the present entrance was created by expanding a window at the head of the internal gallery.

The hall is austere; the architectural historian <a href="John%20Newman%20%28architectural%20historian%29">John Newman</a> critiqued its decoration as "dilute" and "unfocused", Crook as "anaemic". It features <a href="stencil">stencil</a>led ceilings and murals which resemble medieval manuscripts. The murals were designed by Horatio Lonsdale and executed by Campbell, Smith & Company. The furniture is by John Chapple, made in Lord Bute's workshops at Cardiff. The tapered chimney of the room, modelled on 15th-century French equivalents, contains a statue carved by Thomas Nicholls. Although the architectural historian <a href="Mark%20Girouard">Mark Girouard</a> suggested that the statue depicts the Hebrew <a href="King%20David">King David</a>, most historians believe that it shows <a href="Lucius%20of%20Britain">Lucius of Britain</a>, according to legend the founder of the <a href="diocese%20of%20Llandaff">diocese of Llandaff</a> in nearby Cardiff.

The octagonal Drawing Room occupies the first and second floors of the Keep. The ceiling is supported by vaulted stone ribs modelled on Viollet-Le-Duc's work at <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Coucy">Château de Coucy</a> and the lower and upper halves of the room are divided by a <a href="minstrels%27%20gallery">minstrels' gallery</a>. The original plans for the space involved two chambers, one on each floor, and the new design was adopted only in 1879, Burges noting at the time that he intended to "indulge in a little more ornament" than elsewhere in the castle.

The decoration of the room focuses on what Newman described as the "intertwined themes [of] the fecundity of nature and the fragility of life". A fireplace by Thomas Nicholls features the <a href="Moirai">Three Fates</a>, the trio of Greek goddesses who are depicted spinning, measuring and cutting the thread of life. The ceiling's vaulting is carved with butterflies, reaching up to a golden sunburst at the apex of the room, while plumed birds fly up into a starry sky in the intervening sections. Around the room, 58 panels, each depicting one or more unique plants, are surmounted by a mural showing animals from twenty-four of "<a href="Aesop%27s%20Fables">Aesop's Fables</a>." The plants are wild flowers from the Mediterranean, where Lord Bute spent his winter months each year. Carved birds, lizards and other wildlife decorate the doorways.

The historian Terry Measham wrote that the Drawing Room and Lady Bute's Bedroom, "so powerful in their effect, are the two most important interiors in the castle." The architectural writer Andrew Lilwall-Smith considered the Drawing Room to be "Burges's pièce de résistance", encapsulating his "romantic vision of the Middle Ages". The decoration of the ceiling, which was carried out while Burges was alive, differs in tone from the treatment of the murals, and the decoration of Lady Bute's Bedroom, which were both completed, under the direction of William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale respectively, after Burges's death. Burges's work is distinctively High Gothic in style, while the later efforts are more influenced by the softer colours and character of the <a href="Aestheticism">Aesthetic movement</a>, which had grown in popularity by the 1880s.

In comparison to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, is relatively small and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the <a href="Narcissus%20washstand">Narcissus Washstand</a> and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, <a href="The%20Tower%20House">The Tower House</a>.

This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle, making extensive use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls. Crook suggested this provided some "spartan" relief before the culmination of the castle in Lady Bute's Bedroom but Floud considered the result "thin" and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers. The bedroom would have been impractical for regular use, lacking wardrobes and other storage.

Lady Bute's Bedroom comprises the upper two floors of the Keep, with a <a href="coffer">coffer</a>ed, double-dome ceiling that rises up into the tower's conical roof. The room was completed after Burges's death and, although he had created an outline model for the room's structure, which survives, he did not undertake detailed plans for its decoration. His team attempted to fulfil his vision for the room—"would Mr Burges have done it?" William Frame asked Nicholls in a letter of 1887—but the interior decoration was the work of Lonsdale between 1887 and 1888, with considerable involvement from Bute and his wife.

The room is circular, with the window embrasures forming a sequence of <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arches</a> around the outside. It is richly decorated, with <a href="love">love</a> as the theme, displaying carved monkeys, pomegranates and grapevines on the ceiling, and nesting birds topping the pillars. Lord Bute thought the monkeys inappropriately "lascivious". Above the fireplace is a winged statue of <a href="Cupid%20and%20Psyche">Psyche</a>, the Greek goddess of the soul, carrying a heart-shaped shield which displays the arms of the Bute family. The washbasin, designed by John Chapple, has a dragon tap, and <a href="cistern">cistern</a>s for hot and cold water covered with <a href="crenellation">crenellated</a> towers. The Marchioness's scarlet and gold bed is the most notable piece of furniture in the room, modelled on a medieval original drawn by Viollet-le-Duc. Crook described the bed as being "medieval to the point of acute discomfort".

The bedroom is Moorish in style, a popular inspiration in mid-Victorian interior design, and echoes earlier work by Burges in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle and in the chancel at <a href="St%20Mary%27s%2C%20Studley%20Royal">St Mary's Church</a> at Studley Royal in Yorkshire. Lilwall-Smith likened the chamber, with its "Moorish-looking dome, maroon-and-gold painted furniture and large, low bed decorated with glass crystal orbs", to a scene from the "<a href="One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">Arabian Nights</a>". Peter Floud criticised the eclectic nature of this Moorish theme and contrasted it unfavourably with the more consistent style Burges applied to the Arab Room, suggesting that it gave the bedroom an overly theatrical, even pantomime-like, character. The historian Matthew Williams considered that Lonsdale's efforts lack the imagination and flair that Burges himself might have brought to the room.

The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, is in the Gatehouse, entered from the Drawing Room. It contains a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes <a href="murder%20holes">murder holes</a>, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour <a href="Early%20thermal%20weapons">boiling water and oil</a> on attackers.

An oratory, originally fitted to the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891, was decorated with twenty stained glass windows. Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle, while the other ten are displayed on site; two missing windows having been returned to the castle in 2011. Other rooms in the castle include Lady Margaret Bute's Bedroom, the servants' hall and the kitchen.

The woods surrounding the castle, known as the Taff Gorge complex, are among the most westerly natural <a href="beech">beech</a> woodlands in the British Isles. They contain <a href="dog%27s%20mercury">dog's mercury</a>, <a href="Allium%20ursinum">ransoms</a>, <a href="sanicle">sanicle</a>s, <a href="bird%27s-nest%20orchid">bird's-nest orchid</a>, <a href="greater%20butterfly-orchid">greater butterfly-orchid</a> and <a href="Monotropa%20hypopitys">yellow bird's nest</a> plants. The area has unusual rock outcrops, which show the point where <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> <a href="Old%20Red%20Sandstone">Old Red Sandstone</a> and <a href="Carboniferous%20Limestone">Carboniferous Limestone</a> beds meet; the Castell Coch Quarry is in the vicinity. To the southeast of the castle, a nine-hole <a href="golf%20course">golf course</a> occupies the site of the former vineyard. The area is protected as the <a href="Castell%20Coch%20Woodlands%20and%20Road%20Section">Castell Coch Woodlands and Road Section</a> Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Kate Sheppard

Katherine Wilson Sheppard ( Catherine Wilson Malcolm; 10 March 1848 – 13 July 1934) was the most prominent member of the <a href="women%27s%20suffrage%20movement%20in%20New%20Zealand">women's suffrage movement in New Zealand</a> and the country's most famous <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a>. Born in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, England, she emigrated to New Zealand with her family in 1868. There she became an active member of various religious and social organisations, including the <a href="Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union">Woman's Christian Temperance Union</a> (WCTU). In 1887 she was appointed the WCTU's National Superintendent for Franchise and Legislation, a position she used to advance the cause of <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> in New Zealand. 

Kate Sheppard promoted women's suffrage by organising petitions and public meetings, by writing letters to the press, and by developing contacts with politicians. She was the editor of "The White Ribbon", the first woman-operated newspaper in New Zealand. Through her skilful writing and persuasive public speaking, she successfully advocated women's suffrage. Her pamphlets "Ten Reasons Why the Women of New Zealand Should Vote" and "Should Women Vote?" contributed to the cause. This work culminated in a petition with 30,000 signatures calling for women's suffrage that was presented to <a href="New%20Zealand%20Parliament">parliament</a>, and the successful extension of the franchise to women in 1893. As a result, New Zealand became the first country to establish <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>.

Sheppard was the first president of the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Women%20of%20New%20Zealand">National Council of Women of New Zealand</a>, founded in 1896, and helped reform the organisation in 1918. In later life, she travelled to Britain and assisted the suffrage movement there. With failing health, she returned to New Zealand, after which she continued to be involved in writing on women's rights, although she became less politically active. She died in 1934, leaving no living descendants. 

Due to her role as the de facto leader of New Zealand's pioneering women's suffrage movement, Sheppard is widely regarded as one of New Zealand's most prominent figures. Her likeness replaced that of <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> on the front of the <a href="New%20Zealand%20ten-dollar%20note">New Zealand ten-dollar note</a> in 1991.

Kate Sheppard was born Catherine Wilson Malcolm on 10 March 1848 in Liverpool, England, to Scottish parents Jemima Crawford Souter and Andrew Wilson Malcolm. Her father, born in Scotland in 1819, was described in various documents as either a lawyer, banker, brewer's clerk or legal clerk; he married Souter in the <a href="Inner%20Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a> on 14 July 1842. Catherine was named after her paternal grandmother, also Catherine Wilson Malcolm, but preferred to spell her name "Katherine" or to abbreviate it to "Kate". She had an elder sister Marie, born in Scotland, and three younger siblings – Frank, born in Birmingham, and <a href="Isabella%20May">Isabella</a> and Robert, both born in London; evidently the family moved often during that period. Details of the children's education are unknown, though Kate's later writings demonstrate an extensive knowledge of science and law, indicating a strong education. She was known for her broad knowledge and intellectual ability. Her father loved music and ensured that the family had good musical training.

Kate's father died in 1862, while in his early forties, but left his widow with sufficient means to provide for the family. After her father's death, Kate lived with her uncle, a minister of the <a href="Free%20Church%20of%20Scotland%20%281843%E2%80%931900%29">Free Church of Scotland</a> at <a href="Nairn">Nairn</a>; he, more than anyone else, instilled in her the values of <a href="Christian%20socialism">Christian socialism</a>. During this time, the rest of the family stayed with relatives in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, where Kate later joined them.

George Beath, the future husband of Kate's sister Marie, emigrated to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in 1863, and later moved to <a href="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>. After Marie joined him there, they were married in 1867, and their first child was born the following year. Marie's accounts of Christchurch motivated Jemima to move her family to New Zealand, as she was seeking better prospects for her sons' employment and wanted to see her granddaughter. They sailed on the "<a href="Matoaka%20%281853%20ship%29">Matoaka</a>" from <a href="Gravesend">Gravesend</a> on 12 November 1868, arriving in <a href="Lyttelton%20Harbour">Lyttelton Harbour</a> on 8 February 1869.
In Christchurch, most of the family, including Kate, joined the <a href="The%20Octagon%2C%20Christchurch">Trinity Congregational Church</a>. The minister was <a href="William%20Habens">William Habens</a>, a graduate of the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> who was also Classics Master at <a href="Christchurch%20West%20High%20School">Christchurch High School</a>. Kate became part of Christchurch's intellectual and social scenes, and spent time with Marie and George's growing family.

Kate married Walter Allen Sheppard, a shop owner, at her mother's house on 21 July 1871. Walter had been elected to the <a href="Christchurch%20City%20Council">Christchurch City Council</a> in 1868, and may have impressed Kate with his knowledge of local matters. They lived on Madras Street, not far from her mother's home, and within walking distance of the city centre. The Trinity Congregational Church raised funds for a new building from 1872 to 1874, and Kate was most likely involved in this. She formed a friendship with <a href="Alfred%20Saunders">Alfred Saunders</a>, a politician and prominent temperance activist who may have influenced her ideas on women's suffrage. Sheppard and her husband arrived in England in 1877 and spent a year there, then returned to Christchurch. Their only child, Douglas, was born on 8 December 1880.

Sheppard was an active member of various religious organisations. She taught <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a>, and in 1884 was elected secretary of the newly formed Trinity Ladies' Association, a body established to visit parishioners who did not regularly attend church services. The association also helped with fundraising and did jobs for the church such as providing morning tea. Sheppard wrote reports on the work of the Association, tried to recruit new members, and worked to retain existing ones. The following year she joined the Riccarton Choral Society. Her solo in a May 1886 concert was praised in the "<a href="Lyttelton%20Times">Lyttelton Times</a>". She also served on the management committee of the <a href="YWCA">YWCA</a>.

Kate Sheppard's activism and engagement with politics began after listening to or reading about a talk by <a href="Mary%20Greenleaf%20Clement%20Leavitt">Mary Leavitt</a> from the <a href="Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union">Woman's Christian Temperance Union</a> (WCTU) of the United States. In 1885 Leavitt toured New Zealand speaking not only about the problems caused by alcohol consumption, but also the need for women to have a "voice in public affairs". She spent two weeks in Christchurch, starting with a public speech at the <a href="Isaac%20Theatre%20Royal">Theatre Royal</a> on 10 May. Journalists were impressed by the strength of public speaking displayed by a woman, something not witnessed often at that time in New Zealand. 

Sheppard became involved in establishing a Christchurch branch of the WCTU prior to the formation of a national organisation. Her initial involvement was in promoting petitions to Parliament to prevent women being employed as barmaids, and to outlaw the sale of alcohol to children. This marked the beginning of her collaborations with Alfred Saunders, who advised her on her negotiations with politicians and who wrote to the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand">Premier</a>, Sir <a href="Robert%20Stout">Robert Stout</a>, seeking to further her campaign. The barmaid petitions (including some from other parts of the country) were rejected by the Petitions Committee of Parliament later in 1885. Sheppard decided that politicians would continue to ignore petitions from women as long as women could not vote.

In 1879 universal male suffrage had been granted to all men over the age of 21 whether they owned property or not, but women were still excluded as electors. A limited number of voting rights were extended to female voters in the 1870s. Female <a href="rates%20%28tax%29">ratepayers</a> were able to vote in local body elections in 1873, and in 1877 women "householders" were given the right to vote in and stand for education boards.
The New Zealand Women's Christian Temperance Union was formed at a conference in Wellington in February 1886. Sheppard did not attend that conference, but at the second national convention in Christchurch a year later, she arrived ready to present a paper on women's suffrage, although there was no opportunity for her to do so. She was first appointed Superintendent for Relative Statistics, owing to her interest in economics. In 1887when local Franchise departments were established within the WCTUshe was appointed National Superintendent for the Franchise and Legislation.

Much of the support for moderation came from women, and the Temperance Union believed that women's suffrage could advance their aim to prohibit alcohol while promoting child and family welfare. Sheppard soon became prominent in the area of women's suffrage, but her interest in the cause went beyond practical considerations regarding temperance. Her views were made well known with her statement that "all that separates, whether of race, class, creed, or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome". Sheppard proved to be a powerful speaker and a skilled organiser, quickly building support for her cause.
The WCTU sent a deputation to Sir <a href="Julius%20Vogel">Julius Vogel</a>, a Member of Parliament and former Premier, asking him to introduce a suffrage bill to parliament. He did so in 1887, with the Female Suffrage Bill, and Sheppard campaigned for its support. In its third reading, the part dealing with women's suffrage was defeated by one vote, and the bill was withdrawn. During the <a href="New%20Zealand%20general%20election%2C%201887">general election campaign</a> later that year Sheppard encouraged WCTU members to ask parliamentary candidates questions about suffrage, but few women did so. 

In 1888 Sheppard was President of the Christchurch branch of the WCTU, and presented a report to the national convention in <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>, where the convention decided that prohibition and women's suffrage would be the organisation's central aims. Sheppard made public speeches on suffrage in Dunedin, <a href="Oamaru">Oamaru</a>, and Christchurch, developing a confident speaking style. To reinforce her message, she gave audiences leaflets produced in Britain and the United States. Sheppard then published her own single-sheet pamphlet titled "Ten Reasons Why the Women of New Zealand Should Vote", which displayed her "dry wit and logical approach". A copy was sent to every member of the <a href="New%20Zealand%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>.

The government introduced an Electoral Bill in 1888 that would continue to exclude women from suffrage, and Sheppard organised a petition requesting that the exclusion be removed. She wrote to, and later met with, Sir <a href="John%20Hall%20%28New%20Zealand%20politician%29">John Hall</a>, a well-respected Canterbury member of the House of Representatives, inviting him to present the petition and support her cause. He did so, but no action resulted. Sheppard then produced a second pamphlet, "Should Women Vote?", which presented statements on suffrage from notable people in New Zealand and overseas. The Electoral Bill was delayed until 1890, when on 5 August, Hall proposed a motion "That in the opinion of the House, the right of voting for members of the House of Representatives should be extended to women." After vigorous debate, this was passed 37 votes to 11. On 21 August, Hall moved an amendment to the Electoral Bill to give women suffrage, but it was defeated by seven votes.

Following the defeat, Hall suggested to Sheppard that a petition to parliament should be the next step. She drew up the wording for the petition, arranged for the forms to be printed, and campaigned hard for its support. During the <a href="New%20Zealand%20general%20election%2C%201890">1890 election campaign</a>, WCTU members attempted to ask all candidates about their position on women's suffrage. The petition contained 10,085 signatures (according to WCTU minutes), and Hall presented it to Parliament in 1891 as a new Electoral Bill went into committee. The petition was supported in Parliament by Hall, Alfred Saunders, and the Premier at the time, <a href="John%20Ballance">John Ballance</a>. Hall moved an amendment to the Electoral Bill to give women suffrage; it passed with a majority of 25 votes. An opponent of suffrage, <a href="Walter%20Carncross">Walter Carncross</a>, then moved an amendment which would also allow women to stand for parliament; this seemed a logical extension of Hall's amendment but was actually calculated to cause the Bill's failure in New Zealand's <a href="upper%20house">upper house</a>, the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Legislative%20Council">New Zealand Legislative Council</a>. The Bill indeed failed in the Upper House by two votes.
In 1890, Sheppard was one of the founders of the Christian Ethical Society, a discussion group for both men and women, not limited to the members of a single church. In their first few meetings the topics included selfishness, conjugal relations, and dress reform. The Society gave Sheppard more confidence debating her ideas with people from diverse backgrounds. During 1891, Sheppard began editing a page in the "Prohibitionist" on behalf of the WCTU. The "Prohibitionist" was a fortnightly temperance paper with a circulation around New Zealand of over 20,000. Sheppard used the pseudonym "Penelope" in this paper.

Sheppard promised that a second petition would be twice as large and worked through the summer to organise it; it received 20,274 women's signatures. Using paid canvassers, the Liberal MP <a href="Henry%20Fish">Henry Fish</a> organised two counter petitions, one signed by men and the other by women; they received 5,000 signatures between them. An Electoral Bill in 1892 included provision for women's suffrage and again it easily passed in the House of Representatives, but the Upper House requested that women's votes be postal rather than by ballot. As the two houses could not agree on this, the bill failed.
A <a href="1893%20Women%27s%20Suffrage%20Petition">third petition for suffrage</a>, still larger, was organised by Sheppard and presented in 1893. This time 31,872 women signedthe largest petition of any kind presented to Parliament at this point.

The Electoral Bill of 1893, which granted women full voting rights, successfully passed in the House of Representatives in August. Few MPs were willing to vote against it, fearing that women would vote against them in the general election later that year. Many therefore chose to be absent from the house during votes. Henry Fish attempted to delay the proposed statute by calling for a national referendum, but the Bill progressed to the Legislative Council. After several attempts to stymie passage failed, the legislation passed 20 votes to 18 on 8 September. The Bill now needed the Governor's signature, and although Governor <a href="David%20Boyle%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Glasgow">David Boyle</a> did not support women's suffrage and was slow to sign, he eventually did so on 19 September. Sheppard was widely acknowledged as the leader of the women's suffrage movement.

Sheppard had no time to rest, as the was only ten weeks away, and the newspapers were spreading rumours that an early election might be called to reduce the number of women enrolled. Along with the Temperance Union, she was highly active in encouraging women to register as voters. The main meeting venue in Christchurch was the <a href="Odeon%20Theatre%2C%20Christchurch">Tuam Street Hall</a>. One of her largest detractors was the liquor industry, which feared for its continued business. Despite the short notice, 88 percent of women had enrolled to vote by election date (28 November), and nearly 70 percent ended up casting a vote. Although women had gained the vote they were not eligible to stand in parliamentary elections until <a href="New%20Zealand%20general%20election%2C%201919">1919</a>, and it was not until <a href="Lyttelton%20by-election%2C%201933">1933</a> that the first woman was elected to parliament.

In around 1892 Sheppard had started bicycling around Christchurchone of the first women in the city to do so. She joined the <a href="Atalanta%20Ladies%27%20Cycling%20Club">Atalanta Ladies' Cycling Club</a>, which existed from 1892 to 1897, and was a founding committee member. The club was the first women's cycling club in New Zealand or Australia and attracted controversy as some of its members advocated "rational dress"such as <a href="Knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29">knickerbockers</a> rather than skirts for female cyclists.

In December 1893, Sheppard was elected President of the Christchurch branch of the WCTU. She chaired the first two meetings in 1894, before travelling to England with her husband and son. She was in great demand in England as a speaker to women's groups about the struggle for women's suffrage in New Zealand. In mid-1895, the WCTU launched a monthly journal, "The White Ribbon", with Sheppard as the editor, contributing to it from overseas. While in England Sheppard experienced health problems, requiring an operation, possibly a <a href="hysterectomy">hysterectomy</a>. The family returned to New Zealand at the beginning of 1896. Later that year, Sheppard was reappointed editor of "The White Ribbon".

The Canterbury Women's Institute was formed in September 1892, with Sheppard playing a leading role and taking charge of the economics department. The institute was open to both men and women and worked to reduce inequalities between them. Sheppard believed that enfranchisement was the first step towards achieving other reforms, such as reforming unfair laws on marriage, parenthood, and property, and towards eliminating the uneven treatment of the sexes in morality.

The <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Women%20of%20New%20Zealand">National Council of Women of New Zealand</a> was established in April 1896 by the Canterbury Women's Institute and ten other women's groups from throughout New Zealand, and Sheppard was elected president at its founding convention. The Council promoted the right of women to stand for Parliament, equal pay and equal opportunities for women, the removal of legal disabilities affecting women, and economic independence for married women. 

Sheppard's election as president, instead of fellow feminist Lady <a href="Anna%20Stout">Anna Stout</a>, had caused a rift. This, along with other disagreements such as whether the Council should support New Zealand's involvement in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, contributed to the organisation going into recess in 1906.

As editor of "The White Ribbon" and president of the National Council of Women, Sheppard promoted many ideas related to improving the situation and status of women. In particular, she was concerned about establishing legal and economic independence of women from men. She was not only occupied with advancing women's rights, but also promoted political reforms such as <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a>, binding <a href="referendum">referendum</a>s, and a <a href="Cabinet%20of%20New%20Zealand">Cabinet</a> elected directly by Parliament.

By 1902, Sheppard's marriage appears to have been under strain, and possibly had been for several years. Her husband sold their house and moved to England with their son, who wished to study in London. Sheppard bought new furnishings and appeared to be planning for a new permanent residence in Christchurch, but sold them in 1903, stepped down from her positions at the National Council of Women, and moved to England without any fixed date to return. On the way she briefly stopped in Canada and the United States where she met the American suffragist <a href="Carrie%20Chapman%20Catt">Carrie Chapman Catt</a>. In London, she was active in promoting women's suffrage, but her health deteriorated further, forcing her to stop this work.

In November 1904, Sheppard returned to New Zealand with her husband, but he went back to England in March the following year. She moved into the house of her long-time friends William Sidney Lovell-Smith and his wife Jennie Lovell-Smith; their third daughter, <a href="Kitty%20Lovell-Smith">Hilda Kate Lovell-Smith</a>, had been given her middle name after Sheppard. She remained relatively inactive in political circles, and stopped giving speeches, but continued to write. She prepared a display on the history of women's suffrage for the <a href="International%20Exhibition%20%281906%29">1906 Exhibition in Christchurch</a>, and wrote the pamphlet "Woman Suffrage in New Zealand" for the <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Suffrage%20Alliance">International Women's Suffrage Alliance</a> in 1907. The following year she travelled to England for her son's wedding, visiting the headquarters of the WCTU in Chicago on the way, and meeting with suffrage groups after arriving in Britain. In 1912 and 1913, she travelled with the Lovell-Smiths through India and Europe. While she did not recover her former energy, her health had stopped declining, and she continued to be effective in influencing the New Zealand women's movement. She was the first to sign a petition to the Prime Minister, <a href="Joseph%20Ward">Sir Joseph Ward</a>, in 1916, asking him to urge the British government to enfranchise women, and she revitalised the National Council of Women along with a group of other prominent suffragettes in 1918. Sheppard was elected president of the National Council that year before stepping down in 1919.

Sheppard's husband Walter died in England in 1915. Jennie Lovell-Smith died in 1924, and Sheppard and William Lovell-Smith married in 1925. Lovell-Smith died only four years later, and Sheppard herself died in Christchurch on 13 July 1934 at the age of 86. As her son Douglas had died of <a href="pernicious%20anaemia">pernicious anaemia</a> at the age of 29 in 1910, and her only grandchild, Margaret Isabel Sheppard, had died of tuberculosis at the age of 19 in 1930, Sheppard left no living direct descendants. She was buried at <a href="Addington%20Cemetery">Addington Cemetery</a>, Christchurch, in a grave with her mother and her brother Robert.

Kate Sheppard is considered to be an important figure in New Zealand's history. Since 1992 her profile has featured on the New Zealand <a href="New%20Zealand%20ten-dollar%20note">ten-dollar note</a>. A 2005 television show "<a href="New%20Zealand%27s%20Top%20100%20History%20Makers">New Zealand's Top 100 History Makers</a>" ranked Sheppard as the second most influential New Zealander of all time. Similarly, "<a href="The%20New%20Zealand%20Herald">The New Zealand Herald</a>" selected Sheppard as one of their ten greatest New Zealanders in 2013.

In 1972, <a href="Patricia%20Grimshaw">Patricia Grimshaw's</a> book "Women's Suffrage in New Zealand" identified Sheppard as the leading figure of the suffrage movement. This was the first acclaimed book to do so and its publication marked a growth in recognition of Kate Sheppard's life and activism.

In 1993, the centenary of women's suffrage in New Zealand, a group of Christchurch women established two memorials to Sheppard: the <a href="Kate%20Sheppard%20National%20Memorial">Kate Sheppard National Memorial</a>, on the banks of the <a href="Avon%20River%20%28Canterbury%29">Avon River</a>, and the <a href="Kate%20Sheppard%20Memorial%20Trust%20Award">Kate Sheppard Memorial Trust Award</a>, an annual award to women in research. That year a special paeony-style white camellia was created at Camellia Glen Nurseries in Kaupokonui, <a href="Taranaki">Taranaki</a>; white camellias were a symbol of the suffragists. It was named after Kate Sheppard and planted extensively throughout New Zealand.

The <a href="Fendalton">Fendalton</a> house at 83 Clyde Road, where the Sheppards lived from 1888 to 1902 and now known as the <a href="Kate%20Sheppard%20House">Kate Sheppard House</a>, is registered by <a href="Heritage%20New%20Zealand">Heritage New Zealand</a> as a Category I heritage building, in view of the many events relevant to women's suffrage which happened there. It was here that Sheppard pasted together the three main petitions onto sheets of wallpaper.

New Zealand playwright <a href="Mervyn%20Thompson">Mervyn Thompson</a> wrote the play "O! Temperance!" about Sheppard and the temperance movement. It was first performed in 1972 at Christchurch's <a href="Court%20Theatre%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Court Theatre</a>. In 2016 and 2017, the production "That Bloody Woman", which re-imagined Kate Sheppard's life as a punk rock musical, toured New Zealand.
Kate Sheppard Place, located within Wellington's parliament precinct, is named in her honour; it is a short one-way street running from <a href="Molesworth%20Street%2C%20Wellington">Molesworth Street</a> opposite <a href="New%20Zealand%20Parliament%20Buildings%23Parliament%20House">Parliament House</a> to the intersection of Mulgrave Street and Thorndon Quay. There is a Kate Sheppard Avenue in the Auckland suburb of <a href="Northcross">Northcross</a>. In 2014, eight intersections near Parliament in Wellington were fitted with green pedestrian lights depicting Kate Sheppard.

Several New Zealand schools have <a href="House%20system">house</a>s named after Sheppard. In 2014, <a href="Whangarei%20Girls%27%20High%20School">Whangarei Girls' High School</a> renamed a house that was named after <a href="Richard%20Seddon">Richard Seddon</a>, an opponent of women's suffrage, to Sheppard House at the request of a student.

On 8 March 2018, coinciding with International Women's Day and in celebration of the 125th anniversary of the women's suffrage movement, <a href="New%20Zealand%20Football">New Zealand Football</a> renamed its premier knockout association football tournament the <a href="Kate%20Sheppard%20Cup">Kate Sheppard Cup</a>.

Symphony No. 8 (Sibelius)

<a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Jean Sibelius</a>'s Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945.

Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a <a href="Symphony">symphonist</a>. His <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Sibelius%29">Seventh Symphony</a> of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem "<a href="Tapiola%20%28Sibelius%29">Tapiola</a>", completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to <a href="Serge%20Koussevitzky">Serge Koussevitzky</a> and the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor <a href="Basil%20Cameron">Basil Cameron</a> and to the Finnish <a href="Georg%20Schn%C3%A9evoigt">Georg Schnéevoigt</a> likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh.

After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since then, several short manuscript sketches have been tentatively identified with the Eighth, three of which (comprising less than three minutes of music) were recorded by the <a href="Helsinki%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra</a> in 2011. While a few musicologists have speculated that, if further fragments can be identified, it may be possible to reconstruct the entire work, others have suggested that this is unlikely given the ambiguity of the extant material. The propriety of publicly performing music that Sibelius himself had rejected has also been questioned.

Jean Sibelius was born in 1865 in Finland, since 1809 an autonomous <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Finland">grand duchy</a> within the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> having earlier been under Swedish control for many centuries. The country remained divided between a culturally dominant Swedish-speaking minority, to which the Sibelius family belonged, and a more nationalistically-minded Finnish-speaking, or "<a href="Fennoman%20movement">Fennoman</a>" majority. In about 1889 Sibelius met his future wife, <a href="Aino%20Sibelius">Aino Järnefelt</a>, who came from a staunch Fennoman family. Sibelius's association with the Järnefelts helped to awaken and develop his own nationalism; in 1892, the year of his marriage to Aino, he completed his first overtly nationalistic work, the symphonic suite "<a href="Kullervo%20%28Sibelius%29">Kullervo</a>". Through the 1890s, as Russian control over the duchy grew increasingly oppressive, Sibelius produced a series of works reflecting Finnish resistance to foreign rule, culminating in the tone poem "<a href="Finlandia">Finlandia</a>".

Sibelius's national stature was recognised in 1897 when he was awarded a state pension to enable him to spend more time composing. In 1904 he and Aino settled in <a href="Ainola">Ainola</a>, a country residence he built on the shores of <a href="Lake%20Tuusula">Lake Tuusula</a> in <a href="J%C3%A4rvenp%C3%A4%C3%A4">Järvenpää</a>, where they lived for the remainder of their lives. Although life at Ainola was not always calm and carefree—Sibelius was often in debt and prone to bouts of heavy drinking—he managed over the following 20 years to produce a large output of orchestral works, chamber music, piano pieces and songs, as well as lighter music. His popularity spread across Europe to the United States where, during a triumphant tour in 1914, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>. At home his status was such that his 50th birthday celebrations in 1915 were a national event, the centrepiece of which was the Helsinki premiere of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Sibelius%29">Fifth Symphony</a>.

By the mid-1920s Sibelius had acquired the status of a living national monument and was the principal cultural ambassador of his country, independent since 1917. According to his biographer Guy Rickards, he invested "his most crucial inspiration" into the seven symphonies he composed between 1898 and 1924. The Sibelius scholar <a href="James%20Hepokoski">James Hepokoski</a> considers the compact, single-movement <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Sibelius%29">Seventh Symphony</a>, which Sibelius completed in 1924, to be the composer's most remarkable symphonic achievement, "the consummate realization of his late-style rethinking of form". It was followed in 1926 by "<a href="Tapiola%20%28Sibelius%29">Tapiola</a>", a <a href="Symphonic%20poem">tone poem</a> in which, says Rickards, Sibelius "pushed orchestral resources into quite new regions ..."Tapiola" was thirty or forty years ahead of its time".

The first reference to the Eighth Symphony in Sibelius's diary is an undated entry from September 1926: “I offered to create something for America.” However, some of the initial ideas for the new symphony were almost certainly set down earlier, since it was Sibelius's compositional habit to set aside themes and motifs for use in later projects. Thus, one of the extant sketches for his Seventh Symphony, on which he was engaged in 1923–24, contains a ringed motif marked "VIII". By the autumn of 1927 Sibelius was able to inform the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" music critic <a href="Olin%20Downes">Olin Downes</a>—one of his greatest admirers—that he had set down two movements of the Eighth on paper and had composed the rest in his head.

Early in 1928 Sibelius made one of his regular visits to Berlin, to imbibe the city's musical life and to compose. He sent positive work-in-progress reports to Aino: the symphony, he said, will be "wonderful". Back home in Ainola in September, he told his sister that he was "writing a new work, which will be sent to America. It will still need time. But it will turn out well." In December 1928, however, when his Danish publisher <a href="Edition%20Wilhelm%20Hansen">Wilhelm Hansen</a> asked him how the work was developing, Sibelius was less forthcoming; the symphony existed, he said, only in his head. Thereafter Sibelius's reports of the symphony's progress became equivocal, sometimes contradictory, and difficult to follow.

Probably at the instigation of Downes, Sibelius had promised the world premiere of his new symphony to <a href="Serge%20Koussevitzky">Serge Koussevitzky</a> and the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a>. For several years, in a protracted correspondence with the conductor and Downes, Sibelius hesitated and prevaricated. In January 1930 he said the symphony was "not nearly ready and I cannot say when it will be ready", but in August that year he told Koussevitzky that a performance in the spring of 1931 was possible. Nothing resulted from this. In the summer of 1931 Sibelius told Downes that not only was the Eighth Symphony almost ready for the printers, he also had several other new works pending. Thus encouraged, in December 1931 Koussevitzky used the "Boston Evening Transcript" to announce the work for the orchestra's 1931–32 season. This brought a swift telegram from Sibelius, to the effect that the symphony would not, after all, be ready for that season.

Koussevitzky then decided to perform all of Sibelius's symphonies in the Boston Symphony's 1932–33 season, with the world premiere of the Eighth as the culmination. In June 1932 Sibelius wrote to Koussevitzky suggesting that the Eighth be scheduled for the end of October. A week later he retracted: "I am very disturbed about it. Please do not announce the performance." Further promises, for December 1932 and January 1933, brought forth no scores. Koussevitzky was by now losing hope, yet he inquired once more, in the summer of 1933. Sibelius was evasive; he made no promise of delivery but would "return to the matter at a later date". So far as Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony were concerned, the matter ended there. Sibelius had made agreements with other conductors; he had promised the European premiere to <a href="Basil%20Cameron">Basil Cameron</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a>, and the first Finnish performance to <a href="Georg%20Schn%C3%A9evoigt">Georg Schnéevoigt</a>, who had recently taken over direction of the <a href="Helsinki%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. These arrangements were, however, subject to the illusory Boston premiere, and thus were stillborn. Later in the decade, <a href="Eugene%20Ormandy">Eugene Ormandy</a>, a fervent admirer of Sibelius who directed the <a href="Philadelphia%20Orchestra">Philadelphia Orchestra</a> from 1936, is thought to have lobbied strongly for the right to perform the premiere, should the symphony in due course emerge.

During his procrastinations with Koussevitzky, Sibelius continued to work on the symphony. In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that "the symphony is advancing with rapid strides". Progress was interrupted by illness, but towards the end of the year Sibelius was confidently asserting that "I am writing my eighth symphony and I am full of youth. How can this be explained?" In May 1933, as he continued to deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: "It is as if I had come home ... I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic." Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence – sixty-eight years. It will probably be my last. Eight symphonies and a hundred songs. It has to be enough."

At some stage in that summer the formal copying of the symphony began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent a bill for making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius informed him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times as long as this excerpt, indicating that the symphony might be on a larger scale than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.

Various reports appeared to confirm that the symphony's release was imminent. The Finnish composer <a href="Leevi%20Madetoja">Leevi Madetoja</a> mentioned in 1934 that the work was virtually complete; an article by the Swedish journalist Kurt Nordfors indicated that two movements were complete and the rest sketched out. As pressure to produce the symphony increased, Sibelius became increasingly withdrawn and unwilling to discuss his progress. In December 1935, during an interview in connection with his 70th birthday celebrations, he indicated that he had discarded a whole year's work; this pointed to a full-scale revision of the Eighth. However, when "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>"s correspondent asked for details of the work's progress Sibelius became irritated. He was furious when Downes continued to pester him for information, on one occasion shouting "Ich kann nicht!" ("I cannot!").

A receipt found among Sibelius's papers refers to a "Symphonie" being bound by the firm of Weilin & Göös in August 1938. While it is not established that this transaction related to the Eighth, the Sibelius scholar Kari Kilpeläinen points out that none of the earlier symphony scores carry the unnumbered heading "Symphonie", and asks: "Could he have omitted the number to prevent news of the now completed Eighth from spreading? Or did he not give the work a number at all, because he was not satisfied with it?" The composer's daughter Katarina spoke of the self-doubt that afflicted her father at this time, aggravated by the continuing expectations and fuss that surrounded the Eighth Symphony. "He wanted it to be better than the other symphonies. Finally it became a burden, even though so much of it had already been written down. In the end I don't know whether he would have accepted what he had written."

Sibelius remained in Finland during the <a href="Winter%20War">Winter War</a> of 1939–40, despite offers of asylum in the United States. After the war ended in March 1940 he moved with his family to an apartment on Kammiokatu (later renamed Sibeliuksenkatu or 'Sibelius Street' in his honour) in the <a href="T%C3%B6%C3%B6l%C3%B6">Töölö</a> district of <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, where they remained for a year. During that time they were visited by the pianist Martti Paavola, who was able to examine the contents of Sibelius's safe. Paavola later reported to his pupil <a href="Einar%20Englund">Einar Englund</a> that among the music kept there was a symphony, "most likely the Eighth".

Back in Ainola, Sibelius busied himself by making new arrangements of old songs. However, his mind returned frequently to the now apparently moribund symphony. In February 1943 he told his secretary, <a href="Santeri%20Levas">Santeri Levas</a>, that he hoped to complete a "great work" before he died, but blamed the war for his inability to make progress: "I cannot sleep at nights when I think about it." In June he discussed the symphony with his future son-in-law <a href="Jussi%20Jalas">Jussi Jalas</a> and provided another reason for its non-completion: "For each of my symphonies I have developed a special technique. It can't be something superficial, it has to be something that has been lived though. In my new work I am struggling with precisely these issues." Sibelius also told Jalas that all rough sketches and drafts were to be burned after his death; he did not want anyone labelling these rejected scraps as "Sibelius letzten Gedanken" (Sibelius's last thoughts).

At some time in the mid-1940s, probably in summer 1945, Sibelius and Aino together burned a large number of the composer's manuscripts on the stove in the dining room at Ainola. There is no record of what was burned; while most commentators assume that the Eighth Symphony was among the works destroyed, Kilpeläinen observes that there had been at least two manuscripts of the work—the original and Voigt's copy—as well as sketches and fragments of earlier versions. It is possible, says Kilpeläinen, that Sibelius may not have burned them all. Aino, who found the process very painful, recalled later that the burning appeared to ease Sibelius's mind: "After this, my husband appeared calmer and his attitude was more optimistic. It was a happy time". The most optimistic interpretation of his action, according to "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer’s</a>" music critic David Patrick Stearns, is that he got rid of old drafts of the symphony to clear his mind for a fresh start. In 1947, after visiting Ainola, the conductor <a href="Nils-Eric%20Fougstedt">Nils-Eric Fougstedt</a> claimed to have seen a copy of the Eighth on the shelf, with separate choral parts. The musicologist <a href="Erkki%20Salmenhaara">Erkki Salmenhaara</a> posits the idea of two burnings: that of 1945 which destroyed early material, and another after Sibelius finally recognised that he could never complete the work to his satisfaction.

Although Sibelius informed his secretary in late August 1945 that the symphony had been burned, the matter remained a secret confined to the composer's private circle. During the remaining years of his life, Sibelius from time to time hinted that the Eighth Symphony project was still alive. In August 1945 he wrote to Basil Cameron: "I have finished my eighth symphony several times, but I am still not satisfied with it. I will be delighted to hand it over to you when the time comes." In fact, after the burning he had altogether abandoned creative composing; in 1951, when the Royal Philharmonic Society requested a work to mark the 1951 <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a>, Sibelius declined. As late as 1953 he told his secretary Levas that he was working on the symphony "in his mind"; only in 1954 did he admit, in a letter to the widow of his friend <a href="Adolf%20Paul">Adolf Paul</a>, that it would never be completed. Sibelius died on 20 September 1957; the next day his daughter Eva Paloheimo announced publicly that the Eighth Symphony did not exist. The burning of the manuscript became generally known later, when Aino revealed the fact to the composer's biographer <a href="Erik%20W.%20Tawaststjerna">Erik W. Tawaststjerna</a>.
Critics and commentators have pondered the reasons why Sibelius finally abandoned the symphony. Throughout his life he was prone to depression and often suffered crises of self-confidence. <a href="Alex%20Ross%20%28music%20critic%29">Alex Ross</a>, in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", quotes an entry from the composer's 1927 diary, when the Eighth Symphony was allegedly under way:

"This loneliness is driving me crazy. [...] To be able to live in the first place, I must have alcohol. Wine or whisky. That’s the matter. Abused, alone, and all my real friends are dead. My current prestige here at home is rock-bottom. Impossible to work. If only there were a solution."

Writers have pointed to the hand tremor that made writing difficult and to the alcoholism that afflicted him at numerous stages of his life. Others have argued that Sibelius's exalted status as a national hero effectively silenced him; he became afraid that any further major work would not live up to the expectations of the adoring nation. Andrew Barnett, another of the composer's many biographers, points to Sibelius's intense self-criticism; he would withhold or suppress anything that failed to meet his self-imposed standards: "It was this attitude that brought about the destruction of the Eighth Symphony, but the very same trait forced him to keep on revising the Fifth until it was perfect." The historian Mark McKenna agrees that Sibelius became stifled by a combination of perfectionism and increasing self-doubt. The myth, sustained for more than 15 years, that Sibelius was still working on the symphony was, according to McKenna, a deliberate fiction: "To admit that he had stopped completely would be to admit the unthinkable—that he was no longer a composer".

After his death Sibelius, though remaining popular with the general public, was frequently denigrated by critics who found his music dated and tedious. <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Leibowitz">René Leibowitz</a>, a proponent of the music of <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>, published a pamphlet describing Sibelius as "the worst composer in the world"; others dismissed him as irrelevant in what was perceived for a time as an irresistible movement towards <a href="atonality">atonality</a>. This climate diminished curiosity about the existence of material from a possible Sibelius Eighth, until late in the 20th century, when critical interest in the composer revived. In 1995 Kilpeläinen, who had published a survey of the Sibelius manuscripts held in the Helsinki University Library, wrote that all that could definitely be connected to the Eighth Symphony were a single page from a draft score and the ringed melody fragment marked "VIII" within the Seventh Symphony sketches. He added, however, that the library contained further Sibelius sketches from the late 1920s and early 1930s, some of which are akin to the ringed fragment and which could conceivably have been intended for the Eighth Symphony. Kilpeläinen also revealed that "[j]ust recently various documents have come to light which no one dreamt even existed. Maybe there are still some clues to the 8th Symphony hidden away and just waiting for some scholar to discover them."

In 2004, in an article entitled "On Some Apparent Sketches for Sibelius's Eighth Symphony", the musical theorist Nors Josephson identifies around 20 manuscripts or fragments held in the Helsinki University Library as being relevant to the symphony and concludes that: "Given the abundance of preserved material for this work, one looks forward with great anticipation to a thoughtful, meticulous completion of the entire composition". Another Sibelius scholar, Timo Virtanen, has examined the same material and is more restrained, concluding that although some of the sketches may relate to the Eighth Symphony, it is not possible to determine exactly which, if any, these are. Even the fragment marked "VIII", he maintains, cannot with certainty be said to relate to the symphony, since Sibelius often used both Roman and Arabic numerals to refer to themes, motifs or passages within a composition. Virtanen provides a further note of caution: "We should be aware that [the fragments] are, after all, drafts: unfinished as music, and representing only a certain stage in planning a new composition".

Despite his reservations, in October 2011 Virtanen cooperated with another scholar, Vesa Sirén, to prepare three of the more developed fragments for performance. The sketches were copied and tidied, but nothing not written by Sibelius was added to the material. Permission from the Sibelius Rights Holders was secured, and <a href="John%20Storg%C3%A5rds">John Storgårds</a>, chief conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic, agreed to play and record these excerpts at the orchestra's rehearsal session on 30 October 2011. The pieces comprise an opening segment of about a minute's duration, an eight-second fragment that might be part of a scherzo, and a final scrap of orchestral music again lasting roughly a minute. Sirén describes the music as "strange, powerful, and with daring, spicy harmonies—a step into the new even after "Tapiola" and the music for "<a href="The%20Tempest%20%28Sibelius%29">The Tempest</a>"". Stearns gives a more detailed insight: "The first excerpt is classic Sibelian announcement of a first movement. There's a genteel orchestral thunderclap that throws open the door to a harmonic world that is Sibelius' alone, but has strange dissonances unlike any other work. Another glimpse sounds like the beginning of a scherzo, surprisingly spring-like with a buoyant flute solo. Another snippet has a classic Sibelian bassoon solo, the sort that speaks of primal things and goes to a dark, wintry underworld."

Although only the first movement, copied by Voigt, is fully accepted as having been completed, the intended scale and general character of the Eighth Symphony may be inferred from several sources. Sibelius's correspondence with Voigt and with his binders, in 1933 and 1938 respectively, indicates the possibility of a notably large-scale work. Apart from Nils-Eric Fougstedt's 1947 observation, there are also indications from Voigt that the work may have contained choral elements, along the lines of <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's Ninth</a>.

From the available fragments of music, both Virtanen and Andrew Mellor of "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" detect hints of "Tapiola", particularly in the first of the three extracts. Kilpeläinen points to some of Sibelius's late minor works, in particular the "Five Esquisses" for piano Op. 114 (1929), as providing evidence that in his final compositional years Sibelius was "progressing towards a more abstract idiom: clear, ethereal images little touched by the human passions". Further originality, Kilpeläinen says, is found in the "Surusoitto" music for organ, composed in 1931 for the funeral of Sibelius's friend <a href="Akseli%20Gallen-Kallela">Akseli Gallen-Kallela</a>, a work that Aino Sibelius admitted might have been based on Eighth Symphony material: "Did the new symphony", asks Kilpeläinen, "thus also represent a modern sound unlike that of his previous style, with bleak, open tones and unresolved dissonances?" After the recording of the fragments, Storgårds could recognise the composer's late style, adding that "the harmonies are so wild and the music so exciting that I'd really love to know how he went on with this." Sibelius's only preserved comment on the music itself, as distinct from his occasional progress reports, is a remark to Schnéevoigt in December 1932: "You have no idea how clever it is".

Scholars and critics are divided in their views about the value of the recovered excerpts. On the one hand, Josephson is convinced that sufficient material exists for a reconstruction of the entire symphony and eagerly awaits the undertaking of this task. This view is echoed by Stearns: "[T]here's absolutely no reason not to attempt a completion". Others, however, are more circumspect: Virtanen, in particular, emphasises that although the music is irrefutably late Sibelius, it has not been established beyond doubt that any of it belongs to the Eighth Symphony. Sirén, who played a major role in organising the performance of the fragments, believes that completion is impossible on the basis of existing sketches, and would be dependent on further discoveries. He also surmises that Sibelius, having rejected the work, would not have relished hearing the fragments played, a viewpoint which McKenna endorses: "Watching the performance on YouTube, I could not help but think how disappointed the composer would have been to hear his unfinished music performed." Reviewing the recorded excerpts in "Gramophone", Andrew Mellor remarks that even if further manuscripts should come to light, the Sibelius Rights Holders would have full control over the material and would decide whether performance was appropriate. Mellor concludes: "We've had to wait some 80 years to hear less than three minutes of music, and the mystery of the Eighth isn't set to unfold any more rapidly from here".

Our Friends in the North

Our Friends in the North is a <a href="Television%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="television">television</a> drama <a href="Serial%20%28radio%20and%20television%29">serial</a> produced by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. It was originally broadcast in nine episodes on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> in early 1996. Written by <a href="Peter%20Flannery">Peter Flannery</a>, it tells the story of four friends from the city of <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> in <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a> over a period of 31 years, from 1964 to 1995. The story makes reference to certain political and social events which occurred during the era portrayed, some specific to Newcastle and others which affected Britain as a whole. These include general elections, police and local government corruption, the <a href="UK%20miners%27%20strike%20%281984%E2%80%931985%29">UK miners' strike (1984–1985)</a> and the <a href="Great%20Storm%20of%201987">Great Storm of 1987</a>.

The serial is commonly regarded as one of the most successful <a href="BBC%20television%20drama">BBC television drama</a>s of the 1990s, described by "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" as "a production where all ... worked to serve a writer's vision. We are not likely to look upon its like again". It has been named by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> as one of the <a href="BFI%20TV%20100">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a> of the 20th century, by "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" newspaper as the third greatest television drama of all time and by the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" magazine as one of the 40 greatest television programmes. It was awarded three <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Awards">British Academy Television Awards</a> (BAFTAs), two <a href="Royal%20Television%20Society">Royal Television Society</a> Awards, four <a href="Broadcasting%20Press%20Guild">Broadcasting Press Guild</a> Awards and a Certificate of Merit from the <a href="San%20Francisco%20International%20Film%20Festival">San Francisco International Film Festival</a>.

"Our Friends in the North" helped to establish the careers of its four lead actors, <a href="Daniel%20Craig">Daniel Craig</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a>, <a href="Gina%20McKee">Gina McKee</a> and <a href="Mark%20Strong">Mark Strong</a>. Daniel Craig's part in particular has been referred to as his <a href="breakthrough%20role">breakthrough role</a>. It was also a controversial production, as its stories were partly based on real people and events. Several years passed before it was adapted from a play, performed by the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a>, to a television drama, due in part to the BBC's fear of legal action.

Each of the nine episodes of the serial takes place in the year for which it is named; "1964", "1966", "1967", "1970", "1974", "1979", "1984", "1987" and "1995". The episodes follow the four main characters and their changing lives, careers and relationships against the backdrop of the political and social events in Britain. The four friends are Dominic 'Nicky' Hutchinson (played by <a href="Christopher%20Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a>), Mary Soulsby (<a href="Gina%20McKee">Gina McKee</a>), George 'Geordie' Peacock (<a href="Daniel%20Craig">Daniel Craig</a>) and Terry 'Tosker' Cox (<a href="Mark%20Strong">Mark Strong</a>). The series begins with "1964". Nicky returns from working with the <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> movement in the <a href="U.%20S.%20South">southern United States</a> to resume his studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Manchester">University of Manchester</a>. He is reunited with his girlfriend, Mary and best friend, Geordie, who is hoping to form a <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> <a href="band%20%28music%29">group</a> with his mate Tosker.

Nicky is persuaded to drop out of university and work for corrupt local politician Austin Donohue (<a href="Alun%20Armstrong">Alun Armstrong</a>), swayed by Donohue's apparent idealism and desire to change Newcastle for the better. This is much to the annoyance of Nicky's <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>ist father Felix (<a href="Peter%20Vaughan">Peter Vaughan</a>), who does not want his son to waste opportunities that he never had. Nicky's relationship with Mary ends when she becomes pregnant by Tosker and later marries him, which means she also drops out of university. On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive <a href="alcoholic">alcoholic</a> father, Geordie leaves for <a href="London">London</a>, where he falls in with seedy underworld baron Benny Barrett (<a href="Malcolm%20McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a>). Geordie is initially successful while employed by Barrett in his <a href="Soho">Soho</a> nightclubs and <a href="sex%20shop">sex shop</a>s. He also helps Tosker and Mary by introducing Tosker to Barrett, who lends him the money to start his own fruit and vegetable business. Tosker's former dreams of musical stardom gradually fade away. Meanwhile, Nicky realises the extent of Donohue's corrupt dealings with building contractor John Edwards (<a href="Geoffrey%20Hutchings">Geoffrey Hutchings</a>). He resigns in disgust, eventually becoming involved with <a href="Anarchism">anarchists</a> in London.

By the early 1970s, the police have cracked down on Barrett's business and their own corruption but not before Barrett has set Geordie up, sending him to prison in retaliation for an affair that Geordie had with Barrett's lover. Nicky's anarchist cell is raided, and he returns to Newcastle. Eventually Geordie returns as well. By "1979", Nicky has returned to more mainstream politics and stands for the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201979">general election</a>, but is defeated by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> candidate (<a href="Saskia%20Wickham">Saskia Wickham</a>) after a <a href="smear%20campaign">smear campaign</a>. Geordie leaves shortly before the election, not to be seen in the series again until "1987".

By "1984", Nicky is working as a photographer and Mary has divorced Tosker, who has remarried and is rapidly becoming a rich businessman. Nicky and Mary renew their relationship during the turbulent events of the <a href="UK%20miners%27%20strike%20%281984-1985%29">miners' strike</a> and eventually marry. By "1987", their marriage is falling apart; Nicky has an affair with a young student and is also forced to confront his father's <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>. He meets Geordie, now a homeless, drunken vagrant, by chance in London but his old friend disappears before he has a chance to help him. Eventually Geordie is sentenced to life in prison as a danger to the public, after setting fire to a mattress in a hostel. Despite her failing marriage to Nicky, Mary's life is becoming an increasing success and she is now a <a href="councillor">councillor</a>. Tosker, meanwhile, loses his fortune in the <a href="Black%20Monday%20%281987%29">stock market crash</a>.

The final episode, "1995", sees Nicky, who has emigrated to Italy, returning to Newcastle to oversee the funeral of his mother. Tosker has managed to rebuild his business and is about to hold the opening night of his new floating nightclub, based on a boat moored on the <a href="River%20Tyne%2C%20England">River Tyne</a> (filmed on the real club the "<a href="Tuxedo%20Princess">Tuxedo Princess</a>"). Mary, now a Labour <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> sympathetic to <a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a>, is also invited to the opening and Tosker is surprised to find Geordie back in the city as well; he has escaped from prison. Neither Mary nor Geordie make it to the opening night party but the four friends are reunited the following day at Nicky's house after his mother's funeral. Tosker leaves to be with his grandchildren and Mary leaves after agreeing to meet Nicky for lunch the next day. A desperate Nicky realises that "tomorrow's too late" and runs after Mary's car. He eventually attracts her attention and breathlessly asks, "Why not today?" to which she agrees, smiling. Geordie walks off and the series ends with him heading off into the distance across the <a href="Tyne%20Bridge">Tyne Bridge</a> after looking down at Tosker playing with his grandchildren on the boat below. As Geordie walks away and the credits fade up, the music of "<a href="Don%27t%20Look%20Back%20in%20Anger">Don't Look Back in Anger</a>" by <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a> is heard.

"Our Friends in the North" was originally written by the playwright <a href="Peter%20Flannery">Peter Flannery</a> for the <a href="theatre">theatre</a>, while he was a <a href="Artist-in-residence">writer in residence</a> for the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a> (RSC). The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company's production of "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV, Part 1</a>" and "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%202">Part 2</a>" at <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic. The original three-hour long theatre version of "Our Friends in the North", directed by <a href="John%20Caird%20%28director%29">John Caird</a> and featuring <a href="Jim%20Broadbent">Jim Broadbent</a> and <a href="Roger%20Allam">Roger Allam</a> among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at <a href="The%20Other%20Place%20%28theatre%29">The Other Place</a> in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, and then playing at The Pit, a <a href="studio%20theatre">studio theatre</a> in the <a href="Barbican%20Centre">Barbican Centre</a> in London. In its original form, the story went up only to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201979">1979 general election</a> and the coming to power of the new <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> government under <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>. The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>, chronicling <a href="Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence%20%28Rhodesia%29">UDI</a>, the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy. This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title "Our Friends in the North", a reference to how staff at <a href="BP">BP</a> in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> referred to the Rhodesian government of <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, remained.

Flannery was heavily influenced not only by his own political viewpoints and life experiences, but also by the real-life history of his home city of Newcastle during the 1960s and 1970s. Characters such as Austin Donohue and John Edwards were directly based on the real-life scandals of <a href="T.%20Dan%20Smith">T. Dan Smith</a> and <a href="John%20Poulson">John Poulson</a>, who built cheap high-rise housing projects in Newcastle that they knew to be of low quality. Flannery contacted Smith and explained that he was going to write a play based on the events of the scandal, to which Smith replied, "There is a play here of Shakespearean proportions."

The stage version of "Our Friends in the North" was seen by <a href="BBC%20television%20drama">BBC television drama</a> producer <a href="Michael%20Wearing">Michael Wearing</a> in Newcastle in 1982, and he was immediately keen on producing a television adaptation. At that time, Wearing was based at the <a href="BBC%20English%20Regions">BBC English Regions</a> Drama Department at <a href="BBC%20Birmingham">BBC Birmingham</a>, which had a specific remit for making "regional drama", and had established his reputation by producing <a href="Alan%20Bleasdale">Alan Bleasdale</a>'s "<a href="Boys%20from%20the%20Blackstuff">Boys from the Blackstuff</a>" in 1982. Wearing initially approached Flannery to adapt his play into a four-part television serial for <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>, with each episode being 50 minutes long and the Rhodesian strand dropped for practical reasons. A change of executives meant that the project did not reach production, however, Wearing persisted in trying to get it commissioned. Flannery extended the serial to six episodes, one for each <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election">United Kingdom general election</a> from 1964 to 1979. However, by this point in the mid-1980s, <a href="Michael%20Grade">Michael Grade</a> was Director of Programmes for BBC Television, and he had no interest in the project.

By 1989, Wearing had been recalled to the central BBC drama department in <a href="London">London</a> where he was made Head of Serials. This new seniority eventually allowed him to further the cause of "Our Friends in the North". Flannery wrote to the BBC's then Managing Director of Television, <a href="Will%20Wyatt">Will Wyatt</a>, "accusing him of cowardice for not approving it." The BBC was concerned not only with the budget and resources that would be required to produce the serial, but also with potential legal issues. Much of the background story was based on real-life events and people, such as Smith and Poulson and former <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="Reginald%20Maudling">Reginald Maudling</a>, upon whom another character, Claud Seabrook, was based. According to "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" newspaper, one senior BBC lawyer, Glen Del Medico, even threatened to resign if the production was made. Others tried to persuade Flannery to reset the piece "in a fictional country called Albion rather than Britain." Both Smith and Poulson died before the programme aired.

In 1992, Wearing was able to persuade the controller of BBC Two, <a href="Alan%20Yentob">Alan Yentob</a>, to commission Peter Flannery to write scripts for a new version of the project. Yentob had no great enthusiasm for "Our Friends in the North", as he remembered a meeting with Flannery in 1988, when the writer had left him unimpressed by stating that "Our Friends in the North" was about "post-war <a href="public%20housing">social housing</a> policy". As Wearing was now a head of department at the BBC, he was too busy overseeing other projects to produce "Our Friends in the North". <a href="George%20S.%20J.%20Faber">George Faber</a> was briefly attached to the project as producer before he moved on to become Head of Single Drama at the BBC. Faber was succeeded by a young producer with great enthusiasm for the project, <a href="Charles%20Pattinson">Charles Pattinson</a>.

When Yentob was succeeded as controller of BBC Two by <a href="Michael%20Jackson%20%28TV%20executive%29">Michael Jackson</a>, Pattinson was able to persuade him to commission full production on the series. This was in spite of the fact that Jackson and Wearing were not close and did not get on; Pattinson took to dealing with Jackson directly. Jackson had agreed to nine one-hour episodes but Flannery protested that each episode should be as long as it needed to be, to which Jackson agreed. The long delay in production did have the advantage of allowing Flannery to extend the story and instead of ending in 1979, it carried on into the 1990s, bringing the four central characters into <a href="middle%20age">middle age</a>. Flannery later commented that: "The project has undoubtedly benefited from the delay. I'm not sure I have". The series encountered more legal problems, when some references to the fictional businessman Alan Roe were removed, because of a perceived similarity to Sir <a href="John%20Hall%20%28businessman%29">John Hall</a>, a Newcastle businessman who had a number of things in common. The drama had originally shown Roe as taking advantage of tax subsidies to build a large shopping centre.

The scale of "Our Friends in the North" required BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote a budget of £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for the entire year. Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but none was interested. Pattinson believed it was because the story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. <a href="BBC%20Worldwide">BBC Worldwide</a>, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast of "Our Friends in the North" numbered 160; more than 3,000 <a href="Extra%20%28acting%29">extras</a> were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.

The first <a href="television%20director">director</a> approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director taking charge of the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whoever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film "<a href="Shallow%20Grave">Shallow Grave</a>" and wanted to see how that film was received before committing to "Our Friends in the North". When "Shallow Grave" proved to be a critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on "<a href="Trainspotting%20%28film%29">Trainspotting</a>". He withdrew from "Our Friends in the North". <a href="Peter%20Hall%20%28director%29">Sir Peter Hall</a> was also briefly considered, but he too had other production commitments.

Two directors were finally chosen to helm the project. <a href="Stuart%20Urban">Stuart Urban</a> was assigned the first five episodes and <a href="Simon%20Cellan%20Jones">Simon Cellan Jones</a> the final four. However, after completing the first two episodes and some of the shooting for the third, Urban left the project after disagreements with the production team. Peter Flannery was concerned that Urban's directorial style was not suited to the material that he had written. Christopher Eccleston's viewpoint is that Urban was "only interested in painting pretty pictures." Pattinson agreed that a change was needed, and Michael Jackson agreed to a change of director mid-way through production, which was unusual for a British television drama of this type so far into proceedings. Director <a href="Pedr%20James">Pedr James</a>, who had recently directed <a href="Martin%20Chuzzlewit%20%28TV%20series%29">an adaptation of "Martin Chuzzlewit"</a> for Michael Wearing's department, was hired to shoot the remainder of what were to have been Urban's episodes.

Of the actors cast in the four leading roles, only Gina McKee was a native of <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a>, and she was from <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> rather than from Newcastle. McKee related strongly to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts and was very keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether it would be possible to age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that she would not be given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where efforts to make her appear to be in her 50s resulted in her resembling a <a href="drag%20queen">drag queen</a>.

Christopher Eccleston was the only one of the four lead actors who was already an established television face, having previously co-starred in the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> crime drama series "<a href="Cracker%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Cracker</a>". Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film "Shallow Grave" in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle <a href="Geordie">Geordie accent</a>. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.

Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for the role of Geordie. At the audition, he performed the Geordie accent very poorly, however, he won the part and it came to be regarded as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series "<a href="Auf%20Wiedersehen%2C%20Pet">Auf Wiedersehen, Pet</a>", which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair did not speak for the entire period that "Our Friends in the North" was filming.

Among the supporting roles, one of the highest-profile pieces of casting was <a href="Malcolm%20McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a> as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from "1966" through to "1979", but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban as part of the first block of filming, as opposed to the rest of the production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.

It was Daniel Craig's performance in "Our Friends in the North" that first brought him to the attention of producer <a href="Barbara%20Broccoli">Barbara Broccoli</a>, who later cast him in the role of secret agent <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> in the <a href="James%20Bond%20in%20film">long-running film series</a>. Christopher Eccleston also later went on to achieve notoriety in a <a href="Cult%20following">cult</a> screen role when he appeared as the <a href="Ninth%20Doctor">Ninth Doctor</a> in the BBC science-fiction series "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" in 2005. Since then various media articles have noted the coincidence of the future James Bond and "Doctor Who" leads having co-starred in the same production earlier in their careers.

After Stuart Urban left the production and the decision had been made to re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television.

Production of the new version of the opening episode took place in what was to have been a three-week break for the cast between production blocks. Gina McKee was initially very concerned about having her character's early life story changed when she had already based elements of her later performance on the previously-established version. Eccleston was also unhappy about the sudden changes. However, McKee felt that the new version of episode one eventually made for a much stronger opening to the story.

Due to budgetary constraints, the production was not able to shoot the remounted scenes of episode one in the north-east, and they instead had to be filmed in and around <a href="Watford">Watford</a>. Beach-set scenes were shot at <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a> rather than <a href="Whitley%20Bay">Whitley Bay</a>, which was obvious to locals on screen due to the presence of pebbles on the beach, which are not present at Whitley. This led to some critics mockingly referring to the production as "Our Friends in the South".

Contemporary popular music was used throughout the production to evoke the feel of the year in which each episode was set. The BBC's existing agreements with various music publishers and record labels meant that the production team was easily able to obtain the rights to use most of the desired songs. A particular piece of synchronicity occurred in the final episode, "1995", which Cellan Jones had decided to close with the song "<a href="Don%27t%20Look%20Back%20in%20Anger">Don't Look Back in Anger</a>" by <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a>. While the serial was in production, it was just another track from their "<a href="%28What%27s%20the%20Story%29%20Morning%20Glory%3F">(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</a>" album. However, during transmission of "Our Friends in the North," it was released as a single, and to Cellan Jones's delight, it was at the top of the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> in the week of the final episode's transmission.

"Our Friends in the North" was broadcast in nine episodes on BBC Two at 9pm on Monday nights, from 15 January to 11 March 1996. The episode lengths varied, with "1966" being the shortest at 63 minutes, 48 seconds and "1987" the longest at 74 minutes, 40 seconds. The total running time of the serial is 623 minutes.

The first episode of "Our Friends in the North" gained 5.1 million viewers on its original transmission, and the first six episodes each gained between 4.5 and 5.5 million viewers. In terms of viewing figures, the series became BBC Two's most successful weekly drama for five years.

Both during and after its original transmission on BBC Two, the serial was generally praised by the critics. Reviewing the first episode in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" newspaper, Ian Bell wrote: "Flannery's script is faultless; funny, chilling, evocative, spare, linguistically precise. The four young friends about to share 31 hellish years in the life of modern Britain are excellently played."

The conclusion of the serial in March brought similar praise. ""Our Friends in the North" confounded the gloomier predictions about its content and proved that there was an audience for political material, provided that it found its way to the screen through lives imagined in emotional detail ... It will be remembered for an intimate sense of character, powerful enough to make you forgive its faults and stay loyal to the end," was the verdict of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" on the final episode. Writing in the same newspaper the following day, <a href="Jeffrey%20Richards">Jeffrey Richards</a> added that "Monday night's final episode of "Our Friends in the North" has left many people bereft. The serial captivated much of the country, sketching a panoramic view of life in Britain from the sixties to the nineties ... At once sweeping and intimate, both moving and angry, simultaneously historical and contemporary, it has followed in the distinguished footsteps of BBC series such as "<a href="Boys%20from%20the%20Blackstuff">Boys from the Blackstuff</a>"."

However, the response was not exclusively positive. In "<a href="Independent%20on%20Sunday%23The%20Independent%20on%20Sunday">The Independent on Sunday</a>", columnist <a href="Lucy%20Ellmann">Lucy Ellmann</a> criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since "1964" except a few grey hairs ... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, "Peter Flannery seems to want to suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties."

Michael Jackson, the BBC Two controller who had finally commissioned production of the serial, felt that even though it was successful, its <a href="social%20realism">social realist</a> form was outdated. The academic <a href="Georgina%20Born">Georgina Born</a>, writing in 2004, also felt that although the serial had its strengths, it also contained "involuntary marks of pastiche" in its treatment of social realism.

In contrast, the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s <a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a> website praises the serial for its realistic and un-clichéd depiction of life in the <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a>, stating that: "Unlike many depictions of the North-East, it has fully rounded characters with authentic regional accents. It's clearly a real place, not a generic 'up North'."

At the <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Awards">British Academy Television Awards</a> (BAFTAs) in 1997, "Our Friends in the North" won the award for Best Drama Serial, ahead of other nominees "<a href="The%20Crow%20Road%20%28TV%20series%29">The Crow Road</a>", "The Fragile Heart" and "<a href="Gulliver%27s%20Travels%20%28TV%20miniseries%29">Gulliver's Travels</a>". At the same ceremony, Gina McKee won the Best Actress category. Both Christopher Eccleston and <a href="Peter%20Vaughan">Peter Vaughan</a> (who played Nicky's father, Felix) were nominated for the Best Actor award for their performances in "Our Friends in the North", but they lost to <a href="Nigel%20Hawthorne">Nigel Hawthorne</a> for his role in "<a href="The%20Fragile%20Heart">The Fragile Heart</a>". Also at the 1997 BAFTAs, Peter Flannery was presented with the honorary <a href="Dennis%20Potter">Dennis Potter</a> Award for his work on the serial. "Our Friends in the North" also gained BAFTA nominations for costume design, sound, and photography and lighting.

The <a href="Royal%20Television%20Society">Royal Television Society</a> Awards covering the year 1996 saw "Our Friends in the North" win the Best Drama Serial category, and Peter Flannery was given the Writer's Award. Peter Vaughan also gained another Best Actor nomination for his role as Felix. At the 1997 <a href="Broadcasting%20Press%20Guild">Broadcasting Press Guild</a> Awards, "Our Friends in the North" won the categories for Best Drama Series or Serial, Best Actor (Eccleston), Best Actress (McKee) and the Writer's Award for Peter Flannery.

In the United States, "Our Friends in the North" was awarded a Certificate of Merit in the Television Drama Miniseries category at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20International%20Film%20Festival">San Francisco International Film Festival</a> in 1997.

In 2000, the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> conducted a <a href="BFI%20TV%20100">poll of industry professionals</a> to find the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, with "Our Friends in the North" finishing in twenty-fifth position, eighth position out of the dramas featured on the list. The commentary for the "Our Friends in the North" entry on the BFI website described it as a "powerful and evocative drama series ... The series impressed with its ambition, humanity and willingness to see the ambiguities beyond the rhetoric." The serial was also included in an alphabetical list of the 40 greatest TV shows published by the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" magazine in August 2003, chosen by their television editor Alison Graham. In January 2010, the website of "The Guardian" newspaper produced a list of "The top 50 TV dramas of all time," in which "Our Friends in the North" was ranked in third position.

Following the success of "Our Friends in the North", Flannery proposed a "kind of <a href="prequel">prequel</a>" to the serial under the title of "Our Friends in the South". This would have told the story of the <a href="Jarrow%20March">Jarrow March</a>. Although the BBC initially took up the project, it did not progress to script stage and was eventually abandoned.

"Our Friends in the North" was given a repeat run on BBC Two the year following its original broadcast, running on Saturday evenings from 19 July to 13 September 1997. It received a second repeat run on the BBC ten years after its original broadcast, running on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> from 8 February to 29 March 2006. In the early 2000s, the serial was also repeated on the <a href="Alibi%20%28TV%20channel%29">UK Drama</a> channel.

In April 1997, the serial was released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> by <a href="Bertelsmann%20Music%20Group">BMG Video</a> in two separate sets, "1964 – 1974" and "1979 – 1995". In 2002, BMG released the complete series on <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, which along with the original episodes contained several <a href="DVD-Video%23Extra%20features">extra features</a>, including a retrospective discussion of the series by Wearing, Pattinson, Flannery, James and Cellan Jones, and specially shot interviews with Eccleston and McKee. Simply Media brought out a second DVD release of the serial in September 2010, although on this occasion there were no extra features. This edition contained an edit not present on the 2002 BMG release; most of the song "Don't Look Back In Anger" by Oasis is removed at the end of the final episode, fading out early and the credits instead running in silence.

"Our Friends in the North" has been invoked on several occasions as a comparison when similar drama programmes have been screened on British television. The year following "Our Friends in the North"s broadcast, <a href="Tony%20Marchant%20%28playwright%29">Tony Marchant</a>'s drama serial "<a href="Holding%20On%20%28TV%20series%29">Holding On</a>" was promoted by the BBC as being an ""Our Friends in the South"," after Marchant made the comparison when discussing it with executives. The 2001 BBC Two drama serial "<a href="In%20a%20Land%20of%20Plenty">In a Land of Plenty</a>" was previewed by "The Observer" newspaper as being "the most ambitious television drama since "Our Friends in the North"." The writer <a href="Paula%20Milne">Paula Milne</a> drew inspiration from "Our Friends in the North" for her own "<a href="White%20Heat%20%28TV%20series%29">White Heat</a>" (2012); she felt that "Our Friends in the North" had been too centred on white, male, heterosexual characters, and she deliberately wanted to counter that focus.

The original stage version of "Our Friends in the North" was revived in Newcastle by <a href="Northern%20Stage%2C%20Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Northern Stage</a> in 2007, with 14 cast members playing 40 characters.

In August 2016, Flannery was interviewed for an event, part of the Whitley Bay Film Festival, that celebrated the 20th anniversary of the series being broadcast.

Superb fairywren

The superb fairywren ("Malurus cyaneus") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> in the <a href="Australasian%20wren">Australasian wren</a> family, Maluridae, and is common and familiar across south-eastern Australia. The species is sedentary and <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a>, also exhibiting a high degree of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>; the male in breeding plumage has a striking bright blue forehead, ear <a href="covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a>, mantle, and tail, with a black mask and black or dark blue throat. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous, as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. Six subspecies groups are recognized: three larger and darker forms from Tasmania, Flinders and King Island respectively, and three smaller and paler forms from mainland Australia and Kangaroo Island.

Like other fairywrens, the superb fairywren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics; the birds are socially <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a> and sexually <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behaviour%23Promiscuity">promiscuous</a>, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.

The superb fairywren can be found in almost any area that has at least a little dense undergrowth for shelter, including grasslands with scattered shrubs, moderately thick forest, woodland, heaths, and domestic <a href="garden">garden</a>s. It has adapted well to the urban environment and is common in suburban Sydney, <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> and <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. The superb fairywren eats mostly insects and supplements its diet with seeds.

The superb fairywren is one of eleven species of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Malurus">Malurus</a>", commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Within the genus, the superb fairywren's closest relative is the <a href="splendid%20fairywren">splendid fairywren</a>; these two "blue wrens" are also related to the <a href="purple-crowned%20fairywren">purple-crowned fairywren</a> of northwestern Australia.

<a href="William%20Anderson%20%28naturalist%29">William Anderson</a>, surgeon and <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> on <a href="James%20Cook">Captain James Cook's</a> <a href="Third%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">third voyage</a>, collected the first superb fairywren specimen in 1777 while traveling off the coast of eastern Tasmania, in <a href="Bruny%20Island">Bruny Island</a>'s <a href="Adventure%20Bay%2C%20Tasmania">Adventure Bay</a>. He classified it in the genus "<a href="Wagtail">Motacilla</a>" because its tail reminded him of the European <a href="wagtail">wagtail</a>s. Anderson did not live to publish his findings, although his assistant William Ellis described the bird in 1782. The genus "Malurus" was later described by <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> in 1816, giving the bird its current scientific name.

Shortly after the <a href="First%20Fleet">First Fleet</a>'s arrival at <a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a>, Sydney, the bird gained the common name superb warbler. In the 1920s came common names "wren" and "wren-warbler"—both from its similarity to the European <a href="wren">wren</a>—and "fairywren". The bird has also been called Mormon wren, a reference to observations of one blue-<a href="plumage">plumage</a>d bird accompanied by many brown-plumaged birds, which were incorrectly assumed to be all female. The <a href="Ngarrindjeri">Ngarrindjeri</a> people of the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> and <a href="Coorong">Coorong</a> regions called it "waatji pulyeri", meaning "little one of the "waatji" (lignum) bush", and the <a href="Gunai%20people">Gunai</a> called it "deeydgun", meaning "little bird with long tail". Both it and the <a href="variegated%20fairywren">variegated fairywren</a> were known as "muruduwin" to the local <a href="Eora">Eora</a> and <a href="Darug%20people">Darug</a> inhabitants of the Sydney basin. Other alternative names for the superb fairywren include the Australian fairywren, blue wren, superb blue fairywren, and superb blue wren.

Like other fairywrens, the superb fairywren is unrelated to the true <a href="wren">wren</a>. It was previously classified as a member of the Old World flycatcher family <a href="Muscicapidae">Muscicapidae</a> and later as a member of the warbler family <a href="Sylviidae">Sylviidae</a> before being placed in the newly recognised <a href="Maluridae">Maluridae</a> in 1975. More recently, <a href="DNA">DNA</a> analysis has shown the family Maluridae to be related to the Meliphagidae (<a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s), and the <a href="Pardalotidae">Pardalotidae</a> (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies) in the large superfamily <a href="Meliphagoidea">Meliphagoidea</a>.

Six <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are currently recognized:


In his 1982 monograph, Schodde proposed a southern origin for the common ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At some time in the past it was split into south-western (splendid) and south-eastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. In the east, the superb fairywren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was low and the island was connected with the rest of the continent via a land bridge. This gave rise to the subspecies "cyaneus" as it became isolated when the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the <a href="white-shouldered%20fairywren">white-shouldered</a>, <a href="white-winged%20fairywren">white-winged</a> and <a href="red-backed%20fairywren">red-backed fairywren</a>s.

The superb fairywren is long and weighs , with males on average slightly larger than females. The average tail length is , among the shortest in the genus. Averaging in subspecies "cyaneus" and in subspecies "cyanochlamys", the bill is relatively long, narrow and pointed and wider at the base. Wider than it is deep, the bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing for or picking insects off their environs.

Like other fairywrens, the superb fairywren is notable for its marked <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting with black and grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter. Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly <a href="iridescent">iridescent</a> because of the flattened and twisted surface of the <a href="barbule">barbule</a>s. The blue plumage also reflects <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the <a href="Electromagnetic%20spectrum">spectrum</a>.

Vocal communication among superb fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and <a href="mobbing">mobbing</a>, or defending a territory. The basic, or Type I, song is a 1–4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10–20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females. Males also possess a peculiar song-like Type II vocalization, which is given in response to the calls of predatory birds, commonly <a href="grey%20butcherbird">grey butcherbird</a>s. The purpose of this behaviour, which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens, remains unknown. It is not a warning call, but in fact gives away the location of the vocalizing male to the predator. It may serve to announce male fitness, but this is far from certain. The superb fairywrens' alarm call is a series of brief sharp "chit"s, universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators. Females also emit a "purr" while incubating. The bird appears to also use vocalisations as a password for its chicks to give it a chance to avoid <a href="Horsfield%27s%20bronze%20cuckoo">cuckoo</a> parasites.

The superb fairywren is common throughout most of the relatively wet and fertile south-eastern corner of the continent, from the south-east of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> (including <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a> and Adelaide) and the tip of the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a>, through all of <a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia">Victoria</a>, <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, coastal and sub-coastal <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and Queensland, through the <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> area and extending inland – north to the <a href="Dawson%20River%20%28Queensland%29">Dawson River</a> and west to <a href="Blackall%2C%20Queensland">Blackall</a>; it is a common bird in the suburbs of Sydney, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. It is found in wooded areas, generally with plenty of undergrowth, and has also adapted to urban existence and can be found in gardens and urban parks as long as there is an undergrowth of native plants nearby. Lantana ("<a href="Lantana%20camara">Lantana camara</a>"), a prolific weed in Australia, has also been beneficial in providing shelter in disturbed areas, as has the introduced and invasive <a href="blackberry">blackberry</a> Unlike other fairywrens, it appears to benefit from the urban environment and has out-competed the introduced <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a> in one study on the grounds of the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> in Canberra. Colonies of wrens can be found in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20Sydney">Hyde Park</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Sydney">Royal Botanic Gardens</a> in Sydney's urbanized centre. It is not found in dense forest nor in alpine environments. Forestry plantations of <a href="pine">pine</a> and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.

Like all fairywrens, the superb fairywren is an active and restless feeder, particularly on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement is a series of jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright, and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.

The superb fairywren is a <a href="cooperative%20breeding">cooperative breeding</a> species, with pairs or groups of 3–5 birds maintaining and defending small <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territories</a> year-round. The group consists of a social pair with one or more male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though they may not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. These birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.

Major nest predators include <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a>s, <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s, <a href="laughing%20kookaburra">laughing kookaburra</a>, <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s, <a href="crow">crow</a>s and <a href="raven">raven</a>s, <a href="shrike-thrush">shrike-thrush</a>es as well as introduced mammals such as the <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a> , <a href="cat">cat</a> and <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a>. Superb fairywrens may utilise a <a href="Distraction%20display">'rodent-run' display</a> to distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. A field study in Canberra found that superb fairywrens that lived in areas frequented by <a href="noisy%20miner">noisy miner</a>s recognised miner alarm calls and took flight, and had learnt to ignore their non-alarm calls, while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners did not respond to miner alarm calls. This suggests the species has adapted and learned to discriminate and respond to another species' vocalisations.

Several courtship displays by superb fairywren males have been recorded. The 'sea horse flight', named for its <a href="seahorse">seahorse</a>-like undulations, is one such display. During this exaggerated flight, the male—with his neck extended and his head feathers erect—tilts his body from horizontal to vertical, and descends slowly and springs upwards by rapidly beating his wings after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display may be seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.

During the reproductive season, males of this and other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> and sexually <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behaviour%23Promiscuity">promiscuous</a>: pairs will bond for life, though both males and females will regularly <a href="animal%20sexual%20behavior">mate</a> with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.

Breeding occurs from spring through to late summer; the nest is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and <a href="spider%20web">spider web</a>s, with an entrance in one side generally close to the ground, under , and in thick vegetation. Two or more broods may be laid in an extended breeding season. A clutch of three or four matte white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring . The eggs are incubated for 14 days, after which they hatch within 24 hours. Newborn chicks are blind, red and featherless, though quickly darken as feathers grow. Their eyes open by day five or six and are fully feathered by day 10. All group members feed and remove <a href="fecal%20sac">fecal sac</a>s for 10–14 days. Fledglings are able to feed themselves by day 40 but remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group or assuming a dominant position in the original group. In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods and repel cuckoos or predators. Superb fairywrens also commonly play host to the brood parasite <a href="Horsfield%27s%20bronze%20cuckoo">Horsfield's bronze cuckoo</a> and, less commonly, the <a href="shining%20bronze%20cuckoo">shining bronze cuckoo</a> and <a href="fan-tailed%20cuckoo">fan-tailed cuckoo</a>.

Superb fairywrens are predominantly <a href="insectivorous">insectivorous</a>. They eat a wide range of small creatures (mostly insects such as ants, grasshoppers, <a href="shield%20bug">shield bug</a>s, flies, <a href="weevil">weevil</a>s and various larvae) as well as small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit. Their foraging, termed 'hop-searching', occurs on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres high. Because this foraging practice renders them vulnerable to predators, birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups. During winter, when food may be scarce, ants are an important 'last resort' food, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet. Nestlings, in contrast to adult birds, are fed a diet of larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers.

The superb fairywren breeding male is used as an emblem by the <a href="Bird%20Observation%20%26amp%3B%20Conservation%20Australia">Bird Observation & Conservation Australia</a>. On 12 August 1999, a superb fairywren was mistakenly illustrated for an <a href="Australia%20Post">Australia Post</a> 45c pre-stamped envelope meant to depict a <a href="splendid%20fairywren">splendid fairywren</a>. Called the blue wren as it was then known, it had previously featured on a 2s.5d. stamp, released in 1964, which was discontinued with the advent of decimal currency.

California State Route 57

State Route 57 (SR 57), also known as the Orange Freeway for most of its length, is a north–south <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a> in the <a href="Greater%20Los%20Angeles%20Area">Greater Los Angeles Area</a> of <a href="California">California</a>. It connects the <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">interchange</a> of <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) and <a href="California%20State%20Route%2022">SR 22</a> near downtown <a href="Orange%2C%20California">Orange</a>, locally known as the <a href="Orange%20Crush%20interchange">Orange Crush</a>, to the <a href="Glendora%20Curve">Glendora Curve</a> interchange with <a href="Interstate%20210%20%28California%29">I-210</a> and <a href="California%20State%20Route%20210">SR 210</a> in <a href="Glendora%2C%20California">Glendora</a>. The highway provides a route across several spurs of the <a href="Peninsular%20Ranges">Peninsular Ranges</a>, linking the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Basin">Los Angeles Basin</a> with the <a href="Pomona%20Valley">Pomona Valley</a> and <a href="San%20Gabriel%20Valley">San Gabriel Valley</a>.

A predecessor to this road ran through <a href="Brea%20Canyon">Brea Canyon</a> by the early 20th century and was added to the state highway system. The freeway was built in stages during the 1950s, one of which included the Brea Canyon Freeway; SR 57 was designated as part of the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>. The final portion of the present-day Orange Freeway was not completed until the mid 1970s. The latest piece of SR 57 to be added was formerly part of I-210, after SR 210 was legislatively extended to <a href="San%20Bernardino%2C%20California">San Bernardino</a> in 1998. An unconstructed extension from Santa Ana south to <a href="Huntington%20Beach%2C%20California">Huntington Beach</a> remains in the legal definition of SR 57, and has been studied as a <a href="toll%20road">toll road</a> above the <a href="Santa%20Ana%20River">Santa Ana River</a>.

SR 57 begins at the <a href="Orange%20Crush%20interchange">Orange Crush interchange</a> near downtown <a href="Orange%2C%20California">Orange</a>, where it meets the northwest–southeast <a href="Santa%20Ana%20Freeway">Santa Ana Freeway</a> (<a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">I-5</a>) and the east–west <a href="Garden%20Grove%20Freeway">Garden Grove Freeway</a> (SR 22). The Orange Crush interchange, which had long been considered a major <a href="bottleneck%20%28road%29">bottleneck</a>, was rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s. The freeway heads north from the junction and soon crosses to the west side of the <a href="Santa%20Ana%20River">Santa Ana River</a>, continuing north through suburban portions of <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim</a> and passing next to <a href="Anaheim%20Regional%20Transportation%20Intermodal%20Center">Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center</a>, <a href="Angel%20Stadium%20of%20Anaheim">Angel Stadium</a> and <a href="Honda%20Center">Honda Center</a>. In northern Anaheim, SR 57 meets the <a href="Riverside%20Freeway">Riverside Freeway</a> (<a href="California%20State%20Route%2091">SR 91</a>). SR 57 briefly passes through <a href="Placentia%2C%20California">Placentia</a> and <a href="Fullerton%2C%20California">Fullerton</a>, providing access to <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20Fullerton">California State University, Fullerton</a>, and <a href="The%20Bruery">The Bruery</a>. As it crosses <a href="Imperial%20Highway">Imperial Highway</a> (<a href="California%20State%20Route%2090">SR 90</a>) near the <a href="Brea%20Mall">Brea Mall</a> and enters <a href="Brea%2C%20California">Brea</a>, SR 57 enters more rugged terrain before climbing through Brea Canyon, the gap between the <a href="Chino%20Hills">Chino Hills</a> and <a href="Puente%20Hills">Puente Hills</a>. Near the rim of the canyon, the highway curves north out of the Brea Canyon, and descends slightly to a junction with the <a href="Pomona%20Freeway">Pomona Freeway</a> (<a href="California%20State%20Route%2060">SR 60</a>) in <a href="Diamond%20Bar%2C%20California">Diamond Bar</a>, right on the edge of the <a href="San%20Gabriel%20Valley">San Gabriel Valley</a>.

A short <a href="overlap%20%28road%29">overlap</a> carries SR 57 traffic on the same roadway as SR 60. The two routes head northeast through an arm of the <a href="San%20Gabriel%20Valley">San Gabriel Valley</a>; after they split, SR 57 ascends slightly and then slopes through the edge of the <a href="Puente%20Hills">Puente Hills</a> and into the west end of the <a href="Pomona%20Valley">Pomona Valley</a>. Here it meets the <a href="San%20Bernardino%20Freeway">San Bernardino Freeway</a> (<a href="Interstate%2010%20%28California%29">I-10</a>) and <a href="Chino%20Valley%20Freeway">Chino Valley Freeway</a> (<a href="California%20State%20Route%2071">SR 71</a>) at the four-level <a href="Kellogg%20Hill%20Interchange">Kellogg Hill Interchange</a>. In the north half of that interchange, SR 57 enters the <a href="San%20Jose%20Hills">San Jose Hills</a>, climbing to its highest elevation before descending back into the connected San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys and ending at the <a href="Glendora%20Curve">Glendora Curve</a> interchange with the <a href="Foothill%20Freeway">Foothill Freeway</a> (<a href="Interstate%20210%20%28California%29">I-210</a>) in <a href="Glendora%2C%20California">Glendora</a>.

<a href="High-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane">High-occupancy vehicle lane</a>s (HOV) exist in the <a href="median%20%28road%29">median</a> of SR 57 south of SR 60 in Diamond Bar. Elevated ramps allow HOV traffic bound to or from Brea Canyon to connect with I-5 towards the southeast, SR 91 towards the west, or SR 60 towards the east without entering the main lanes.

SR 57 is legally eligible for the <a href="State%20Scenic%20Highway%20System%20%28California%29">State Scenic Highway System</a> through <a href="Brea%20Canyon">Brea Canyon</a>, between <a href="California%20State%20Route%2090">SR 90</a> and <a href="California%20State%20Route%2060">SR 60</a>, though it has not officially been designated as a scenic highway by the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a>. The entire route is in the <a href="California%20Freeway%20and%20Expressway%20System">California Freeway and Expressway System</a>, and is a freeway for its entire constructed length. SR 57 is also part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a> (NHS), a network of highways that are essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The highway from SR 1 to SR 60 in Diamond Bar is officially designated as the Orange Freeway. In 2013, SR 57 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 129,000 between SR 60 and Sunset Crossing Road in Diamond Bar, and 278,500 between SR 91 in Anaheim and Orangethorpe Avenue in Placentia, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

The road through Brea Canyon was <a href="oiled%20dirt">oiled dirt</a> by the late 1910s, providing a good connection across an outbranching of the <a href="Peninsular%20Ranges">Peninsular Ranges</a> between the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Basin">Los Angeles Basin</a> and Pomona Valley. This road left the main coast highway (<a href="Harbor%20Boulevard">Harbor Boulevard</a>) at <a href="Fullerton%2C%20California">Fullerton</a> and followed the present Brea Boulevard and Brea Canyon Road, merging with the <a href="Valley%20Boulevard">Valley Boulevard</a> from Los Angeles near <a href="Walnut%2C%20California">Walnut</a> and continuing east to <a href="Pomona%2C%20California">Pomona</a> via Valley and <a href="Pomona%20Boulevard">Pomona Boulevard</a>s. <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California">Los Angeles County</a> paved the road in concrete in early 1923, and in 1931 it was added to the state highway system as a branch of <a href="Legislative%20Route%2019%20%28California%20pre-1964%29">Route 19</a>. Until then, Route 19 had connected <a href="Legislative%20Route%209%20%28California%20pre-1964%29">Route 9</a> near <a href="Claremont%2C%20California">Claremont</a> with <a href="Riverside%2C%20California">Riverside</a>, following Garey Avenue and <a href="Mission%20Boulevard%20%28Southern%20California%29">Mission Boulevard</a> through Pomona.

The state built a bypass of the Valley Boulevard portion of the route in the early-to-mid-1930s, leaving the old road near Diamond Bar and heading northeast through the foothills, along the present freeway alignment and Mission Boulevard. To the south, the legislature added then-unrelated Route 180 along State College Boulevard in 1933, connecting <a href="Legislative%20Route%202%20%28California%20pre-1964%29">Route 2</a> (I-5) near the Santa Ana River with <a href="Legislative%20Route%20175%20%28California%20pre-1964%29">Route 175</a> (Orangethorpe Avenue, later replaced by <a href="California%20State%20Route%2091">SR 91</a>) near Placentia. By 1955, the Brea Canyon Freeway was proposed to begin at the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) near La Veta Avenue in <a href="Santa%20Ana%2C%20California">Santa Ana</a> and head north, paralleling Routes 180 and 19 to Pomona. The portion northeast of <a href="Diamond%20Bar%2C%20California">Diamond Bar</a> into Pomona soon became part of the planned Pomona Freeway, and the name of the remainder was changed to Orange Freeway. The state legislature altered the definition of Route 19 to reflect this in 1957 by moving its south end to Santa Ana.

Then, in 1957, the northernmost part of present SR 57 was added to the state highway system as part of <a href="Legislative%20Route%20240%20%28California%20pre-1964%29">Route 240</a>, which the legislature designated along the route planned for I-210. This became part of the proposed <a href="Temescal%20Freeway">Temescal Freeway</a>, later the <a href="Corona%20Freeway">Corona Freeway</a>; a southerly extension of the Orange Freeway to <a href="Legislative%20Route%2060%20%28California%20pre-1964%29">Legislative Route 60</a> (<a href="California%20State%20Route%201">SR 1</a>) near <a href="Huntington%20Beach%2C%20California">Huntington Beach</a> was added in 1959 as Route 273. Also in 1959, the legislature created Route 272, extending the line of the Orange Freeway north from the Pomona Freeway to the Temescal Freeway, completing the proposed freeway corridor that is now SR 57. When the entire route, except Route 240 which was still part of I-210, was redesignated SR 57 in the <a href="1964%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 renumbering</a>, none of these proposed freeways had been built; the only constructed segment was the old surface road from <a href="Fullerton%2C%20California">Fullerton</a> towards Pomona. The part of old Route 19 east of Route 272 became part of <a href="California%20State%20Route%2060">SR 60</a>. As part of the same renumbering, Route 180 on State College Boulevard became Route 250, which was amended the next year to provide for its deletion once that portion of the SR 57 freeway was completed (between I-5 and <a href="California%20State%20Route%2091">SR 91</a>).
A <a href="groundbreaking%20ceremony">groundbreaking ceremony</a> was held in Placentia on January 30, 1967, to begin construction of the Orange Freeway. The first portion was dedicated on May 16, 1969, and opened soon after, extending north from the Riverside Freeway (<a href="California%20State%20Route%2091">SR 91</a>) to <a href="Nutwood%20Avenue">Nutwood Avenue</a> in Fullerton. Over the next few years, the freeway was completed from SR 91 north to I-10, and I-210 was built north to the present end of SR 57; the Pomona Freeway (<a href="California%20State%20Route%2060">SR 60</a>), which <a href="overlap%20%28road%29">overlaps</a> it through <a href="Diamond%20Bar%2C%20California">Diamond Bar</a>, was constructed at the same time. The last pieces of that portion were the freeway through Brea Canyon, which opened March 13, 1972, and the four-level <a href="Kellogg%20Hill">Kellogg Hill</a> Interchange at I-10, which was dedicated May 1, 1972, and opened soon thereafter. Finally, the Orange Freeway was extended south from SR 91 to I-5 in the mid-1970s, allowing Route 250 to be turned back to local governments, though the subsequent deletion from the Streets and Highways Code did not take place until 1981. With the extension of <a href="California%20State%20Route%20210">SR 210</a> around <a href="San%20Bernardino%2C%20California">San Bernardino</a> in 1998, the former easternmost piece of I-210 to the Kellogg Hill Interchange instead became a northerly extension of SR 57, though it remains officially part of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>.

The southerly extension to Huntington Beach remains unconstructed. In 1986, Orange County's plans were for a toll road elevated above the Santa Ana River rather than through existing neighborhoods, only extending south to the <a href="Interstate%20405%20%28California%29">San Diego Freeway</a> (I-405) in <a href="Costa%20Mesa%2C%20California">Costa Mesa</a> with connections to the <a href="Corona%20del%20Mar%20Freeway">Corona del Mar Freeway</a> (<a href="California%20State%20Route%2073">SR 73</a>); this was largely inspired by congestion on <a href="SR%2055%20%28CA%29">SR 55</a> through the Santa Ana area. The extension was considered by Caltrans as two 11.2-mile-long (18.0 km), two-lane <a href="viaduct">viaduct</a>s that would cost $950 million. The toll road <a href="Government-granted%20monopoly">franchise</a> that <a href="American%20Transportation%20Development">American Transportation Development</a> (ATD) held for this portion of SR 57 expired in January 2001, after a request to delay the expiration until January 2007. Following this, ATD sued to restore the franchise, and this case lasted until November 2003. The termination was due to ATD not beginning the construction during the first ten years of the franchise, after it had been enacted by the state legislature.

In April 2009, the <a href="Orange%20County%20Transportation%20Authority">Orange County Transportation Authority</a> continued to study the extension of SR 57, where the freeway would travel along the Santa Ana River and terminate at I-405 in <a href="Fountain%20Valley%2C%20California">Fountain Valley</a>.

The northbound widening between Katella Avenue and SR 91 was finished in 2014. To keep the flow of the northbound fifth lane which ends after the Orangewood Avenue exit and resumes after the Katella Avenue exit, Caltrans and OCTA plan to widen that 0.5 mile strip of road to add one more lane in the northbound direction.

Strepsirrhini

Strepsirrhini or Strepsirhini (; ) is a <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">suborder</a> of <a href="primate">primate</a>s that includes the <a href="Lemuriformes">lemuriform</a> primates, which consist of the <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s of <a href="Fauna%20of%20Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, <a href="galago">galago</a>s ("bushbabies") and <a href="potto">potto</a>s from <a href="Fauna%20of%20Africa">Africa</a>, and the <a href="loris">loris</a>es from <a href="Fauna%20of%20India">India</a> and <a href="southeast%20Asia">southeast Asia</a>. Collectively they are referred to as strepsirrhines. Also belonging to the suborder are the extinct <a href="Adapiformes">adapiform</a> primates that thrived during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> in Europe, North America, and Asia, but disappeared from most of the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> as the climate cooled. Adapiforms are sometimes referred to as being "lemur-like", although the diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms does not support this comparison.

Strepsirrhines are defined by their "wet" (moist) <a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a> (the tip of the snout) - hence the colloquial but inaccurate term "wet-nosed" - similar to the rhineria of dogs and cats. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized <a href="simian">simian</a>s, large <a href="Olfactory%20bulb">olfactory lobes</a> for smell, a <a href="vomeronasal%20organ">vomeronasal organ</a> to detect <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s, and a <a href="bicornuate%20uterus">bicornuate uterus</a> with an <a href="Placentation">epitheliochorial placenta</a>. Their eyes contain a <a href="Tapetum%20lucidum">reflective layer</a> to improve their <a href="night%20vision">night vision</a>, and their <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">eye sockets</a> include a <a href="Postorbital%20bar">ring of bone</a> around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>, whereas <a href="haplorhine">haplorhine</a> primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a>, a specialized set of teeth in the front, lower part of the mouth mostly used for combing fur during <a href="Personal%20grooming">grooming</a>.

Many of today's living strepsirrhines are <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a> due to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>, hunting for <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>, and live capture for the <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a> trade. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines are behaviorally diverse, although all are primarily <a href="arboreal%20locomotion">arboreal</a> (tree-dwelling). Most living lemuriforms are <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a>, while most adapiforms were <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a>. Both living and extinct groups primarily fed on <a href="frugivore">fruit</a>, <a href="folivore">leaves</a>, and <a href="insectivore">insects</a>.

The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> name Strepsirrhini derives from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> στρεψίς ("strepsis" or "a turning [inward])" and ῥινός ("rhinos" or "nose"), which refers to the appearance of the sinuous (comma-shaped) nostrils on the <a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a> or wet nose. The name was first used by French <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a> <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Geoffroy%20Saint-Hilaire">Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</a> in 1812 as a <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">subordinal</a> rank comparable to Platyrrhini (<a href="New%20World%20monkey">New World monkey</a>s) and Catarrhini (<a href="Old%20World%20monkey">Old World monkey</a>s). In his <a href="Species%20description">description</a>, he mentioned ""Les narines terminales et sinueuses"" ("Nostrils terminal and winding").

When British <a href="Zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="Reginald%20Innes%20Pocock">Reginald Innes Pocock</a> revived Strepsirrhini and defined <a href="Haplorhini">Haplorhini</a> in 1918, he omitted the second "r" from both ("Strepsirhini" and "Haplorhini" instead of "Strepsirrhini" and "Haplorrhini"), although he did not remove the second "r" from Platyrrhini or Catarrhini, both of which were also named by É. Geoffroy in 1812. Following Pocock, many researchers continued to spell Strepsirrhini with a single "r" until <a href="Primatology">primatologists</a> Paulina Jenkins and Prue Napier pointed out the error in 1987.

Strepsirrhines include the extinct adapiforms and the <a href="Lemuriformes">lemuriform</a> primates, which include lemurs and lorisoids (<a href="loris">loris</a>es, <a href="potto">potto</a>s, and <a href="galago">galago</a>s). Strepsirrhines diverged from the haplorhine primates near the beginning of the primate <a href="Adaptive%20radiation">radiation</a> between 55 and 90 mya. Older divergence dates are based on <a href="Molecular%20clock">genetic analysis</a> estimates, while younger dates are based on the scarce <a href="Fossil">fossil record</a>. Lemuriform primates may have evolved from either <a href="Cercamoniinae">cercamoniines</a> or <a href="Sivaladapidae">sivaladapids</a>, both of which were adapiforms that may have originated in Asia. They were once thought to have evolved from <a href="Adapidae">adapids</a>, a more specialized and younger branch of adapiform primarily from Europe.
Lemurs <a href="Oceanic%20dispersal">rafted</a> from Africa to Madagascar between 47 and 54 mya, whereas the lorises split from the African galagos around 40 mya and later colonized Asia. The lemuriforms, and particularly the lemurs of Madagascar, are often portrayed inappropriately as "<a href="living%20fossil">living fossil</a>s" or as examples of "<a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a>", or "inferior" primates. These views have historically hindered the understanding of <a href="Evolution%20of%20mammals">mammalian evolution</a> and the evolution of strepsirrhine traits, such as their reliance on smell (<a href="olfaction">olfaction</a>), characteristics of their skeletal anatomy, and their brain size, which is relatively small. In the case of lemurs, <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> has driven this isolated population of primates to diversify significantly and fill a rich variety of <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s, despite their smaller and less complex brains compared to simians.

The divergence between strepsirrhines, simians, and tarsiers likely followed almost immediately after primates first evolved. Although few fossils of <a href="Extant%20taxon">living</a> primate groups – lemuriforms, tarsiers, and simians – are known from the Early to Middle Eocene, evidence from genetics and recent fossil finds both suggest they may have been present during the early <a href="adaptive%20radiation">adaptive radiation</a>.

The origin of the earliest primates that the simians (strepsirrhines) and tarsiers (haplorhines) both evolved from is a mystery. Both their place of origin and the group from which they emerged are uncertain. Although the <a href="Fossil">fossil record</a> demonstrating their initial <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiation</a> across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics (where primates most likely first developed) is very sparse, particularly around the time that primates and other major <a href="clade">clade</a>s of <a href="eutheria">eutheria</a>n mammals first appeared.

Lacking detailed tropical fossils, <a href="Genetics">geneticists</a> and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lineages and the amount of time since they <a href="Genetic%20divergence">diverged</a>. Using this <a href="molecular%20clock">molecular clock</a>, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80–90 mya, nearly 40 million years before the first examples appear in the fossil record.
The early primates include both <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> and <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> small-bodied species, and all were arboreal, with hands and feet specially adapted for maneuvering on small branches. <a href="Plesiadapiformes">Plesiadapiforms</a> from the early <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> are sometimes considered "archaic primates", because their teeth resembled those of early primates and because they possessed adaptations to living in trees, such as a divergent big toe (<a href="hallux">hallux</a>). Although plesiadapiforms were closely related to primates, they may represent a <a href="Paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> group from which primates may or may not have directly evolved, and some <a href="Genus">genera</a> may have been more closely related to <a href="colugo">colugo</a>s, which are thought to be more closely related to primates.

The first true primates (euprimates) do not appear in the fossil record until the early <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> (~55 mya), at which point they radiated across the Northern Hemisphere during a brief period of rapid <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a> known as the <a href="Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene%20Thermal%20Maximum">Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>. These first primates included "<a href="Cantius">Cantius</a>", "<a href="Donrussellia">Donrussellia</a>", "<a href="Altanius">Altanius</a>", and "<a href="Teilhardina">Teilhardina</a>" on the northern continents, as well as the more questionable (and fragmentary) fossil "<a href="Altiatlasius">Altiatlasius</a>" from Paleocene Africa. These earliest <a href="List%20of%20fossil%20primates">fossil primates</a> are often divided into two groups, adapiforms and <a href="Omomyiformes">omomyiforms</a>. Both appeared suddenly in the fossil record without <a href="Transitional%20fossil">transitional forms</a> to indicate ancestry, and both groups were rich in diversity and were widespread throughout the Eocene.

The last branch to develop were the adapiforms, a diverse and widespread group that thrived during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> (56 to 34 million years ago <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a><nowiki>]</nowiki>) in Europe, North America, and Asia. They disappeared from most of the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> as the climate cooled: The last of the adapiforms died out at the end of the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> (~7 mya).

<a href="Adapiformes">Adapiform primates</a> are extinct strepsirrhines that shared many anatomical similarities with lemurs. They are sometimes referred to as lemur-like primates, although the diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms do not support this analogy.

Like the living strepsirrhines, adapiforms were extremely diverse, with at least 30 genera and 80 species known from the fossil record as of the early 2000s. They diversified across <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a> during the Eocene, some reaching North America via a <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a>.They were among the most common mammals found in the fossil beds from that time. A few rare species have also been found in northern Africa. The most basal of the adapiforms include the genera "Cantius" from North America and Europe and "Donrussellia" from Europe. The latter bears the most <a href="Symplesiomorphy">ancestral traits</a>, so it is often considered a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> or <a href="stem%20group">stem group</a> of the other adapiforms.

Adapiforms are often divided into three major groups:

The relationship between adapiform and lemuriform primates has not been clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early Eocene, although their most basal members share enough dental similarities to suggest that they diverged during the Paleocene (66–55 mya).

Lemuriform origins are unclear and debated. American <a href="Paleontology">paleontologist</a> <a href="Philip%20D.%20Gingerich">Philip Gingerich</a> proposed that lemuriform primates evolved from one of several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the front lower teeth of adapids and the <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a> of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not strongly supported due to a lack of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.

Until discoveries of three 40-million-year-old fossil lorisoids ("<a href="Karanisia">Karanisia</a>", "<a href="Saharagalago">Saharagalago</a>", and "<a href="Wadilemur">Wadilemur</a>") in the <a href="Faiyum%20Oasis">El Fayum deposits</a> of Egypt between 1997 and 2005, the oldest known lemuriforms had come from the early Miocene (~20 mya) of <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> and <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>. These newer finds demonstrate that lemuriform primates were present during the middle Eocene in Afro-Arabia and that the lemuriform lineage and all other strepsirrhine taxa had diverged before then. "<a href="Djebelemur">Djebelemur</a>" from <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> dates to the late early or early middle Eocene (52 to 46 mya) and has been considered a cercamoniine, but also may have been a stem lemuriform. <a href="Azibiidae">Azibiids</a> from <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> date to roughly the same time and may be a sister group of the <a href="Djebelemuridae">djebelemurid</a>s. Together with "<a href="Plesiopithecus">Plesiopithecus</a>" from the late Eocene Egypt, the three may qualify as the stem lemuriforms from Africa.

Molecular clock estimates indicate that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, approximately 62 mya. Between 47 and 54 mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by <a href="Oceanic%20dispersal">rafting</a>. In isolation, the lemurs diversified and filled the niches often filled by monkeys and apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, approximately 40 mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.

The taxonomy of strepsirrhines is controversial and has a complicated history. Confused taxonomic terminology and oversimplified anatomical comparisons have created misconceptions about primate and strepsirrhine <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogeny</a>, illustrated by the media attention surrounding the single <a href="Darwinius">"Ida" fossil</a> in 2009.
Strepsirrhine primates were first grouped under the genus "Lemur" by Swedish taxonomist <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition of "Systema Naturae"</a> published in 1758. At the time, only three species were recognized, one of which (the colugo) is no longer recognized as a primate. In 1785, Dutch naturalist <a href="Pieter%20Boddaert">Pieter Boddaert</a> divided the genus "Lemur" into two genera: "Prosimia" for the lemurs, colugos, and tarsiers and "Tardigradus" for the lorises. Ten years later, É. Geoffroy and <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> grouped the tarsiers and galagos due to similarities in their hindlimb <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, a view supported by German zoologist <a href="Johann%20Karl%20Wilhelm%20Illiger">Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger</a>, who placed them in the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Macrotarsi while placing the lemurs and tarsiers in the family Prosimia (Prosimii) in 1811. The use of the tarsier-galago classification continued for many years until 1898, when Dutch zoologist <a href="Ambrosius%20Hubrecht">Ambrosius Hubrecht</a> demonstrated two different types of <a href="placentation">placentation</a> (formation of a <a href="placenta">placenta</a>) in the two groups.

English <a href="Comparative%20anatomy">comparative anatomist</a> <a href="William%20Henry%20Flower">William Henry Flower</a> created the <a href="Taxonomic%20rank">suborder</a> Lemuroidea in 1883 to distinguish these primates from the simians, which were grouped under English <a href="Biology">biologist</a> <a href="St.%20George%20Jackson%20Mivart">St. George Jackson Mivart</a>'s suborder Anthropoidea (=Simiiformes). According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea contained the families Lemuridae (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (<a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a>), and Tarsiidae (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, É. Geoffroy first named the suborder Strepsirrhini, in which he included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared the structure of the nose and reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist <a href="William%20Charles%20Osman%20Hill">William Charles Osman Hill</a> wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used. Since then, primate taxonomy has shifted between Strepsirrhini-Haplorhini and Prosimii-Anthropoidea multiple times.

Most of the academic literature provides a basic framework for primate taxonomy, usually including several potential taxonomic schemes. Although most experts agree upon <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogeny</a>, many disagree about nearly every level of primate classification.

The most commonly recurring debate in primatology during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 2000s concerned the phylogenetic position of tarsiers compared to both simians and the other prosimians. Tarsiers are most often placed in either the suborder Haplorhini with the simians or in the suborder Prosimii with the strepsirrhines. Prosimii is one of the two traditional primate suborders and is based on <a href="evolutionary%20grade">evolutionary grade</a>s (groups united by anatomical traits) rather than phylogenetic clades, while the Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini taxonomy was based on evolutionary relationships. Yet both systems persist because the Prosimii-Anthropoidea taxonomy is familiar and frequently seen in the research literature and textbooks.

Strepsirrhines are traditionally characterized by several <a href="Symplesiomorphy">symplesiomorphic</a> (ancestral) traits not shared with the simians, particularly the rhinarium. Other symplesiomorphies include long <a href="snout">snout</a>s, convoluted <a href="Nasal%20concha">maxilloturbinals</a>, relatively large <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>s, and smaller brains. The toothcomb is a <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphy</a> (shared, derived trait) seen among lemuriforms, although it is frequently and incorrectly used to define the strepsirrhine clade. Strepsirrhine primates are also united in possessing an <a href="Placentation%23Placentation%20in%20mammals">epitheliochorial placenta</a>. Unlike the tarsiers and simians, strepsirrhines are capable of <a href="Biosynthesis">producing</a> their own <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a> and do not need it supplied in their diet. Further genetic evidence for the relationship between tarsiers and simians as a haplorhine clade is the shared possession of three <a href="Retrotransposon%23SINEs">SINE markers</a>.

Because of their historically mixed assemblages which included tarsiers and close relatives of primates, both Prosimii and Strepsirrhini have been considered <a href="Wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxa</a> for "lower primates". Regardless, the strepsirrhine and haplorrhine clades are generally accepted and viewed as the preferred taxonomic division. Yet tarsiers still closely resemble both strepsirrhines and simians in different ways, and since the early split between strepsirrhines, tarsiers and simians is ancient and hard to resolve, a third taxonomic arrangement with three suborders is sometimes used: Prosimii, Tarsiiformes, and Anthropoidea. More often, the term "prosimian" is no longer used in official taxonomy, but is still used to illustrate the behavioral ecology of tarsiers relative to the other primates.

In addition to the controversy over tarsiers, the debate over the origins of simians once called the strepsirrhine clade into question. Arguments for an evolutionary link between adapiforms and simians made by paleontologists Gingerich, <a href="Elwyn%20L.%20Simons">Elwyn L. Simons</a>, <a href="David%20Tab%20Rasmussen">Tab Rasmussen</a>, and others could have potentially excluded adapiforms from Strepsirrhini. In 1975, Gingerich proposed a new suborder, Simiolemuriformes, to suggest that strepsirrhines are more closely related to simians than tarsiers. However, no clear relationship between the two had been demonstrated by the early 2000s. The idea reemerged briefly in 2009 during the media attention surrounding "<a href="Darwinius">Darwinius masillae</a>" (dubbed "Ida"), a cercamoniine from Germany that was touted as a "<a href="Transitional%20fossil">missing link</a> between humans and earlier primates" (simians and adapiforms). However, the cladistic analysis was flawed and the phylogenetic inferences and terminology were vague. Although the authors noted that "Darwinius" was not a "fossil lemur", they did emphasize the absence of a toothcomb, which adapiforms did not possess.

Within Strepsirrhini, two common classifications include either two infraorders (Adapiformes and Lemuriformes) or three infraorders (Adapiformes, Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes). A less common taxonomy places the aye-aye (Daubentoniidae) in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes. In some cases, plesiadapiforms are included within the order Primates, in which case Euprimates is sometimes treated as a suborder, with Strepsirrhini becoming an infraorder, and the Lemuriformes and others become parvorders. Regardless of the infraordinal taxonomy, Strepsirrhini is composed of three ranked superfamilies and 14 families, seven of which are extinct. Three of these extinct families included the recently extinct <a href="Subfossil%20lemur">giant lemurs</a> of Madagascar, many of which died out within the last 1,000 years following human arrival on the island.
When Strepsirrhini is divided into two infraorders, the clade containing all toothcombed primates can be called "lemuriforms". When it is divided into three infraorders, the term "lemuriforms" refers only to Madagascar's lemurs, and the toothcombed primates are referred to as either "crown strepsirrhines" or "extant strepsirrhines". Confusion of this specific terminology with the general term "strepsirrhine", along with oversimplified anatomical comparisons and vague phylogenetic inferences, can lead to misconceptions about primate phylogeny and misunderstandings about primates from the Eocene, as seen with the media coverage of "Darwinius". Because the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as "primitive" strepsirrhines, lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines. They are included in Strepsirrhini, and are considered basal members of the clade. Although their status as true primates is not questioned, the questionable relationship between adapiforms and other living and fossil primates leads to multiple classifications within Strepsirrhini. Often, adapiforms are placed in their own infraorder due to anatomical differences with lemuriforms and their unclear relationship. When shared traits with lemuriforms (which may or may not be synapomorphic) are emphasized, they are sometimes reduced to families within the infraorder Lemuriformes (or superfamily Lemuroidea).

The first fossil primate described was the adapiform "<a href="Adapis">Adapis parisiensis</a>" by French naturalist <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> in 1821, who compared it to a <a href="hyrax">hyrax</a> (""le Daman""), then considered a member of a now obsolete group called <a href="Pachydermata">pachyderms</a>. It was not recognized as a primate until it was reevaluated in the early 1870s. Originally, adapiforms were all included under the family Adapidae, which was divided into two or three subfamilies: Adapinae, Notharctinae, and sometimes Sivaladapinae. All North American adapiforms were lumped under Notharctinae, while the Old World forms were usually assigned to Adapinae. Around the 1990s, two distinct groups of European "adapids" began to emerge, based on differences in the <a href="Postcrania">postcranial skeleton</a> and the teeth. One of these two European forms was identified as cercamoniines, which were allied with the notharctids found mostly in North America, while the other group falls into the traditional adapid classification. The three major adapiform divisions are now typically regarded as three families within Adapiformes (Notharctidae, Adapidae and Sivaladapidae), but other divisions ranging from one to five families are used as well.

All lemuriforms possess a specialized dental structure called a “toothcomb”, with the exception of the aye-aye, in which the structure has been modified into two continually growing (hypselodont) <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s (or <a href="Canine%20tooth">canine teeth</a>), similar to those of <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms.

Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a <a href="grooming%20claw">grooming claw</a> on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws. The toothcomb consists of either two or four lower incisors and procumbent lower canine teeth followed by a canine-shaped <a href="premolar">premolar</a>. It is used to comb the fur during oral grooming. Shed hairs that accumulate between the teeth of the toothcomb are removed by the <a href="sublingua">sublingua</a> or "under-tongue". Lemuriforms also possess a <a href="grooming%20claw">grooming claw</a> on the second digit of each foot for scratching. Adapiforms did not possess a toothcomb. Instead, their lower incisors varied in orientation—from somewhat procumbent to somewhat vertical—and the lower canines were projected upwards and were often prominent. Adapiforms may have had a grooming claw, but there is little evidence of this.

Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a <a href="postorbital%20bar">postorbital bar</a>, a protective ring of bone created by a connection between the <a href="Frontal%20bone">frontal</a> and <a href="zygomatic%20bone">zygomatic bone</a>s. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving <a href="Stereopsis">stereoscopic vision</a>, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the <a href="retina">retina</a> of the eye, called a <a href="tapetum%20lucidum">tapetum lucidum</a> (consisting of <a href="riboflavin">riboflavin</a> crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a <a href="Fovea%20centralis">fovea</a>, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.

Strepsirrhine primates have a brain relatively comparable to or slightly larger in size than most mammals. Compared to simians, however, they have a relatively small brain-to-body size ratio. Strepsirrhines are also traditionally noted for their unfused <a href="Symphysis%20menti">mandibular symphysis</a> (two halves of the lower jaw), however, fusion of the mandibular symphysis was common in adapiforms, notably "Notharctus". Also, several extinct giant lemurs exhibited a fused mandibular symphysis.

Many nocturnal species have large, independently movable ears, although there are significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the <a href="Middle%20ear">middle</a> and <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a> of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the <a href="tympanic%20cavity">tympanic cavity</a>, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the <a href="ectotympanic%20ring">ectotympanic ring</a>, which supports the <a href="eardrum">eardrum</a>, free within the <a href="auditory%20bulla">auditory bulla</a>. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached to the edge of the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs.
Both lorisoids and <a href="Cheirogaleidae">cheirogaleid</a> lemurs have replaced the <a href="internal%20carotid%20artery">internal carotid artery</a> with an enlarged <a href="ascending%20pharyngeal%20artery">ascending pharyngeal artery</a>.
Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the <a href="talus%20bone">talus bone</a> and <a href="fibula">fibula</a> meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the <a href="Flexor%20hallucis%20longus%20muscle">flexor fibularis</a> tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.

Sexual dichromatism (different coloration patterns between males and females) can be seen in most brown lemur species, but otherwise lemurs show very little if any difference in body size or weight between sexes. This lack of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> is not characteristic of all strepsirrhines. Some adapiforms were sexually dimorphic, with males bearing a larger <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> (a ridge of bone on the top of the skull to which jaw muscles attach) and canine teeth. Lorisoids exhibit some sexual dimorphism, but males are typically no more than 20 percent larger than females.

Strepsirrhines have a long snout that ends in a moist and touch-sensitive <a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a>, similar to that of dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is surrounded by <a href="Whiskers">vibrissae</a> that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while <a href="olfactory%20receptor">olfactory receptor</a>s of the <a href="Olfactory%20system">main olfactory system</a> lining the <a href="Nasal%20concha">ethmoturbinals</a> detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.

The surface of the rhinarium does not have any olfactory receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (<a href="Merkel%20cell">Merkel cell</a>s). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous membrane</a> called the <a href="philtrum">philtrum</a>, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (<a href="Diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastema</a>) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.

The strepsirrhine rhinarium can collect relatively non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s) and transmit them to the <a href="vomeronasal%20organ">vomeronasal organ</a> (VNO), which is located below and in front of the <a href="nasal%20cavity">nasal cavity</a>, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased <a href="Duct%20%28anatomy%29">duct</a>-like structure made of <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramen</a>), which pass through the <a href="hard%20palate">hard palate</a> at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the <a href="Olfaction%23Accessory%20olfactory%20system">accessory olfactory bulb</a>, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the <a href="amygdala">amygdala</a>, which handles emotions, and then to the <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a>, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.

All lemuriforms have a VNO, as do tarsiers and some New World monkeys. Adapiforms exhibit the gap between the upper incisors, which indicates the presence of a VNO, but there is some disagreement over whether or not they possessed a rhinarium.

Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, where the maternal blood does not come in direct contact with the fetal <a href="chorion">chorion</a> like it does in the <a href="Placentation%23Placentation%20in%20mammals">hemochorial placenta</a> of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine <a href="uterus">uterus</a> has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar <a href="gestation%20period">gestation period</a>s to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a>, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.

Most primates have two <a href="mammary%20gland">mammary gland</a>s, but the number and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines. Lorises have two pairs, while others, like the ring-tailed lemur, have one pair on the chest (pectoral). The aye-aye also has two mammary glands, but they are located near the groin (inguinal). In females, the <a href="clitoris">clitoris</a> is sometimes enlarged and pendulous, <a href="pseudo-penis">resembling the male penis</a>, which can make sex identification difficult for human observers. The clitoris may also have a bony structure in it, similar to the <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip.

Approximately three-quarters of all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, sleeping in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their competition with the simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living in the absence of simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, <a href="mouse%20lemur">mouse lemur</a>s, <a href="woolly%20lemur">woolly lemur</a>s, and <a href="sportive%20lemur">sportive lemur</a>s are nocturnal, while <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a>s and most of their kin, <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s, and <a href="indri">indri</a> are diurnal. Yet some or all of the <a href="True%20lemur">brown lemurs</a> ("Eulemur") are <a href="cathemeral">cathemeral</a>, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and <a href="predation">predation</a>. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the <a href="tapetum%20lucidum">tapetum lucidum</a> behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of "<a href="Pronycticebus">Pronycticebus</a>" and "<a href="Godinotia">Godinotia</a>" from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.

Reproduction in most strepsirrhine species tends to be seasonal, particularly in lemurs. Key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include the length of the wet season, subsequent food availability, and the maturation time of the species. Like other primates, strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders compared to other mammals. Their gestation period and interbirth intervals are usually long, and the young develop slowly, just like in haplorhine primates. Unlike simians, some strepsirrhines produce two or three offspring, although some produce only a single offspring. Those that produce multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young. These two traits are thought to be <a href="Symplesiomorphy">plesiomorphic</a> (ancestral) for primates. The young are <a href="precocial">precocial</a> (relatively mature and mobile) at birth, but not as coordinated as <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s (hoofed mammals). Infant care by the mother is relatively prolonged compared to many other mammals, and in some cases, the infants cling to the mother's fur with their hands and feet.

Despite their relatively smaller brains compared to other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which may be due to adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as <a href="Tool%20use%20by%20animals">tools in the wild</a>, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.

The nocturnal strepsirrhines have been traditionally described as "solitary", although this term is no longer favored by the researchers who study them. Many are considered "solitary foragers", but many exhibit complex and diverse social organization, often overlapping <a href="home%20range">home range</a>s, initiating social contact at night, and sharing sleeping sites during the day. Even the mating systems are variable, as seen in woolly lemurs, which live in <a href="Monogamous%20pairing%20in%20animals">monogamous</a> <a href="breeding%20pair">breeding pair</a>s. Because of this social diversity among these <a href="solitary%20but%20social">solitary but social</a> primates, whose level of social interaction is comparable to that of diurnal simians, alternative classifications have been proposed to emphasize their gregarious, dispersed, or solitary nature.

Among extant strepsirrhines, only the diurnal and cathemeral lemurs have evolved to live in <a href="Multi-male%20group">multi-male/multi-female groups</a>, comparable to most living simians. This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families (<a href="Indriidae">Indriidae</a> and <a href="Lemuridae">Lemuridae</a>), is thought to have evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is fairly common in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (<a href="Social%20grooming">allogrooming</a>). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their grooming claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth.

Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on <a href="scent%20marking">scent marking</a> for much of their communication. This involves smearing secretions from <a href="Epidermis%20%28skin%29">epidermal scent glands</a> on tree branches, along with <a href="urine">urine</a> and <a href="feces">feces</a>. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (<a href="urine%20washing">urine washing</a>). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and <a href="Alarm%20signal">alarm calls</a> are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained by the lack of light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a>.

Living strepsirrhines are predominantly arboreal, with only the ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedally</a> (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and <a href="bamboo%20lemur">bamboo lemur</a>s leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for <a href="vertical%20clinging%20and%20leaping">vertical clinging and leaping</a>. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.

Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons suggest a variety of locomotor behavior. The European adapids "Adapis", "<a href="Palaeolemur">Palaeolemur</a>", and "<a href="Leptadapis">Leptadapis</a>" shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although they may have been quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both "<a href="Notharctus">Notharctus</a>" and "<a href="Smilodectes">Smilodectes</a>" from North America and "<a href="Europolemur">Europolemur</a>" from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids "Cantius" and "Pronycticebus" appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.

Primates primarily feed on fruits (including seeds), leaves (including flowers), and animal prey (<a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, small vertebrates, and eggs). Diets vary markedly between strepsirrhine species. Like other leaf-eating (<a href="Folivore">folivorous</a>) primates, some strepsirrhines can digest <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> and <a href="hemicellulose">hemicellulose</a>. Some strepsirrhines, such as the galagos, <a href="slender%20loris">slender loris</a>es, and <a href="angwantibo">angwantibo</a>s, are primarily <a href="Insectivore">insectivorous</a>. Other species, such as <a href="fork-marked%20lemur">fork-marked lemur</a>s and <a href="Needle-clawed%20bushbaby">needle-clawed bushbabies</a>, specialize on tree gum, while indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs are folivores. Many strepsirrhines are <a href="frugivore">frugivore</a>s (fruit eaters), and others, like the ring-tailed lemur and mouse lemurs, are <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>s, eating a mix of fruit, leaves, and animal matter.

Among the adapiforms, frugivory seems to have been the most common diet, particularly for medium-sized to large species, such as "Cantius", "<a href="Pelycodus">Pelycodus</a>" and "<a href="Cercamonius">Cercamonius</a>". Folivory was also common among the medium and large-sized adapiforms, including "Smilodectes", "Notharctus", "Adapis" and "Leptadapis". Sharp <a href="Cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a> on the teeth of some of the smaller adapiforms, such as "<a href="Anchomomys">Anchomomys</a>" and "Donrussellia", indicate that they were either partly or primarily insectivorous.
The now extinct adapiform primates were primarily found across North America, Asia, and Europe, with a few species in Africa. They flourished during the Eocene when those regions were more tropical in nature, and they disappeared when the climate became cooler and drier. Today, the lemuriforms are confined in the tropics, ranging between 28° S to 26° N latitude. Lorises are found both in <a href="equatorial%20Africa">equatorial Africa</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, while the galagos are limited to the forests and woodlands of <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>. Lemurs are <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to Madagascar, although much of their diversity and habitat has been lost due to recent human activity.

As with nearly all primates, strepsirrhines typically reside in <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>s. These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of <a href="Sympatry">sympatric species</a>. In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, as many as 11 or 12 species share the same forests, and prior to human arrival, some forests had nearly double that diversity. Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny forest</a> on the southern tip of the island, although the lemur communities in these regions are not as rich.

Like all other non-human primates, strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity, particularly <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> in tropical regions. Much of their habitat has been converted for human use, such as agriculture and pasture. The threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories: <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>, hunting (for <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a> or <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a>), and live capture for export or local <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a> trade. Although hunting is often prohibited, the laws protecting them are rarely enforced. In Madagascar, local taboos known as "<a href="Fady%20%28taboo%29">fady</a>" sometimes help protect lemur species, although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.

In 2012, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) announced that lemurs were the "most endangered mammals", due largely to elevated <a href="Illegal%20logging%20in%20Madagascar">illegal logging</a> and hunting following a <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">political crisis in 2009</a>. In Southeast Asia, slow lorises are threatened by the exotic pet trade and traditional medicine, in addition to habitat destruction. Both lemurs and <a href="slow%20loris">slow loris</a>es are protected from commercial international trade under <a href="CITES">CITES Appendix I</a>.

Mount Mazama

Mount Mazama ("Giiwas" in the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> language <a href="Klamath%20language">Klamath</a>) is a <a href="complex%20volcano">complex volcano</a> in the <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> segment of the <a href="Cascade%20Volcanoes">Cascade Volcanic Arc</a> and the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>, in the United States, that was destroyed due to a major eruption that took place 7,700 years ago. Located in <a href="Klamath%20County%2C%20Oregon">Klamath County</a>, the volcano resides to the north of the border between Oregon and <a href="California">California</a> in the southern Cascades. Its collapsed <a href="caldera">caldera</a> holds <a href="Crater%20Lake">Crater Lake</a>, and the entire mountain is located within <a href="Crater%20Lake%20National%20Park">Crater Lake National Park</a>. Mazama has an elevation of 8,157 feet (2,486 m) and Crater Lake reaches a depth of , making it the deepest freshwater body in the United States and the second deepest in North America after <a href="Great%20Slave%20Lake">Great Slave Lake</a> in Canada.

Mazama formed as a group of overlapping volcanic edifices such as <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a>es and small <a href="stratovolcano">composite cones</a>, becoming active intermittently until its climactic eruption. Mazama's caldera was created about 7,700 years ago by this enormous eruption, the largest within the Cascade Volcanic Arc in a million years. The eruption also destroyed Mazama's summit, reducing its approximate height by about . Much of the edifice fell into the volcano's partially emptied neck and <a href="magma%20chamber">magma chamber</a>. The region is undergoing extension of <a href="Plate%20tectonics">tectonic plates</a>, and it features numerous volcanic landforms and faults. Though Mazama is currently dormant, the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> believes that future eruptions are likely, though on a smaller scale than the climactic eruption; Mazama poses a threat to the nearby surroundings if it resumes activity.

Indigenous populations have inhabited the area around Mazama and Crater Lake for at least 10,000 years, and the volcano plays an important role in local folklore. White settlers first reached the region in the mid-19th century. Since the late 1800s, the area has been extensively studied by scientists for its geological phenomena and more recently for its potential sources of <a href="geothermal%20energy">geothermal energy</a>. Crater Lake and Mazama's remnants sustain diverse ecosystems, which are closely monitored by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> because of their remoteness and ecological importance. Recreational activities including <a href="hiking">hiking</a>, <a href="cycling">biking</a>, <a href="snowshoe%20running">snowshoeing</a>, fishing, and <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country skiing</a> are available, and during the summer, campgrounds and lodges at Crater Lake are open to visitors.

Mount Mazama lies in <a href="Klamath%20County%2C%20Oregon">Klamath County</a>, within the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, north of the border between Oregon and <a href="California">California</a>. It lies in the southern portion of the Cascade Range. <a href="Crater%20Lake">Crater Lake</a> sits partly inside the volcano's caldera, with a depth of ; it is the deepest body of freshwater in the United States and the second deepest in North America after <a href="Great%20Slave%20Lake">Great Slave Lake</a> in Canada. Before its caldera-forming eruption, Mazama stood at an elevation between , placing it about above the lake; this would have made it Oregon's highest peak. The <a href="Global%20Volcanism%20Program">Global Volcanism Program</a> currently lists its elevation at , while the <a href="Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System">Geographic Names Information System</a> provides an elevation of .

Crater Lake National Park covers an area of , including forest areas, alpine terrain, the Crater Lake, and the vast majority of Mount Mazama. A <a href="wilderness%20area">wilderness area</a>, it was dedicated in 1902 and is overseen by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>. It receives about 500,000 visitors each year, and these tourists can go hiking, take bike, ranger-guided, and trolley tours, swim, fish, camp, and participate in other recreational activities. While the Park area remains open throughout the year, certain roads and facilities close in the winter season.

There was frequent <a href="glacier">glacier</a> formation on the mountain as Mazama developed. They carved trenches in the flanks of the volcano in addition to U-shaped valleys under the base of the volcanic cone. These can be seen at three large glacial canyons on its southern slopes: Kerr Notch, Munson Balley, and Sun Notch. Whenever eruptions took place in the presence of ice, lava was chilled by glaciers, creating <a href="volcanic%20glass">glassy</a> <a href="Scree">talus</a> deposits. Sometimes, the lava coursed into areas previously carved by glaciers like at Sentinel Rock, filling canyons with volcanic rock. <a href="Moraine">Moraine</a>s occur up to from the rim of Mazama's caldera, and there are <a href="glacial%20striation">glacial striation</a>s visible at several sites in the area. When the climactic eruption occurred, the climate was warm and dry, and the most recent period of glacial advance ceased about 27,000 years ago, so by the time Mazama collapsed, ice was likely only present at higher elevations. Using <a href="Argon%E2%80%93argon%20dating">argon geochronology</a> and paleoclimatic records, scientists have identified that the Sand Creek, Sun Creek, and Annie Creek canyons were carved by the advance of ice over lava flows, pushing debris towards Klamath Marsh and Klamath Graben or nearby rivers. A glacial <a href="cirque">cirque</a> can be seen on Mount Scott's northwestern flank, and glacial <a href="till">till</a> occurs on Mazama's slopes, especially on the western slopes and at lower elevations. Till and <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> sediments occur in the caldera walls, forming particularly thick deposits under Roundtop and Wineglass. Many <a href="lava%20flow">lava flow</a>s that were glaciated have since been covered by more recent lava flows.

Crater Lake formed from a network of lakes and ponds, eventually reaching a depth of . Lake levels rose while the <a href="Wizard%20Island">Wizard Island</a> landform inside the crater was forming. Water interacted with lava flows to form <a href="pillow%20lava">pillow lava</a>. Because of climate change patterns over time, Crater Lake's surface level has changed, dropping as much as for example at the beginning of the 1900s. The water from precipitation nearly equals water lost to evaporation and drainage, most leakage taking place at the Wineglass deposit at the northern side of the crater, without which the lake would likely have overflowed at the northern side.

Average snowfall in the Crater Lake area has been decreasing since the 1930s. Crater Lake's mean surface water temperatures have increased about since the 1960s. Though this may eventually cause <a href="algae">algae</a> to grow and obscure the water, Crater Lake remains one of the cleanest bodies of water in the world.

Crater Lake National Park and the area surrounding Mount Mazama range in elevation from , providing diverse habitats. In the Cascades, the topography and elevation have influenced local climate patterns, also shaping global climate when volcanic gas and dust have been released into the atmosphere. The southern region of the park supports <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">ponderosa pine</a> forests, and for elevations from , <a href="mixed%20coniferous%20forest">mixed coniferous</a>, <a href="fir">fir</a>, and hemlock forests are common. <a href="Montane%20ecosystems%23Subalpine%20zone">Subalpine zones</a> occur above , often featuring <a href="Pinus%20albicaulis">whitebark pine</a>.

<a href="Disturbance%20%28ecology%29">Ecological disturbances</a> tend to cause decreasing damage with increasing distance from the source, but volcanic eruptions can lead to more uniform patterns of disruption for their surrounding landscapes. The immediate surroundings of Mazama continue to recover from the eruption.

There are more than 50 mammal species in Crater Lake National Park. Opossum species such as the <a href="Virginia%20opossum">Virginia opossum</a> can be found infrequently, while shrew and mole species in the park area include <a href="marsh%20shrew">marsh shrew</a>s, <a href="Pacific%20shrew">Pacific shrew</a>s, <a href="American%20water%20shrew">American water shrew</a>s, <a href="fog%20shrew">fog shrew</a>s, <a href="Trowbridge%27s%20shrew">Trowbridge's shrew</a>s, <a href="vagrant%20shrew">vagrant shrew</a>s, <a href="American%20shrew%20mole">American shrew mole</a>s, and <a href="broad-footed%20mole">broad-footed mole</a>s. Bats frequently sighted within the park area include the <a href="little%20brown%20bat">little brown bat</a>, <a href="hoary%20bat">hoary bat</a>, and <a href="big%20brown%20bat">big brown bat</a>, while the <a href="California%20myotis">California myotis</a>, <a href="silver-haired%20bat">silver-haired bat</a>, <a href="Yuma%20myotis">Yuma myotis</a>, <a href="long-eared%20myotis">long-eared myotis</a>, <a href="long-legged%20myotis">long-legged myotis</a>, and <a href="pallid%20bat">pallid bat</a> are more rare. There are populations of <a href="American%20pika">American pika</a>s, <a href="snowshoe%20hare">snowshoe hare</a>s, and <a href="white-tailed%20jackrabbit">white-tailed jackrabbit</a>s in the region, as well as many rodent species. Chipmunks like <a href="yellow-pine%20chipmunk">yellow-pine chipmunk</a>s, <a href="least%20chipmunk">least chipmunk</a>s, <a href="Siskiyou%20chipmunk">Siskiyou chipmunk</a>s, and <a href="Townsend%27s%20chipmunk">Townsend's chipmunk</a>s can be seen, along with various beaver species including <a href="mountain%20beaver">mountain beaver</a>s and <a href="North%20American%20beaver">North American beaver</a>s. The mammals of the National Park area also include various species of squirrel, mice, <a href="vole">vole</a>, and gophers, as well as <a href="yellow-bellied%20marmot">yellow-bellied marmot</a>s and <a href="North%20American%20porcupine">North American porcupine</a>s. <a href="Carnivore">Carnivorous</a> mammals consist of <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s, <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es, <a href="gray%20fox">gray fox</a>es, <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="marten">marten</a>s, <a href="Fisher%20%28animal%29">fishers</a>, <a href="stoat">ermines</a>, <a href="long-tailed%20weasel">long-tailed weasel</a>s, <a href="mink">mink</a>s, <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>s, <a href="American%20badger">American badger</a>s, <a href="western%20spotted%20skunk">western spotted skunk</a>s, <a href="striped%20skunk">striped skunk</a>s, <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">North American river otter</a>s, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s, and <a href="lynx">lynx</a>es such as <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s. <a href="Elk">Elk</a>, <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a>, and <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a>s can also be found, though more frequently during the summer season.

Bird species in the Crater Lake National Park area include various <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">biological families</a>. Common bird species include <a href="hairy%20woodpecker">hairy woodpecker</a>s, <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a>s, <a href="Dendragapus">blue grouse</a>s, <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a>s, <a href="dark-eyed%20junco">dark-eyed junco</a>s, <a href="mountain%20chickadee">mountain chickadee</a>s, <a href="red-breasted%20nuthatch">red-breasted nuthatch</a>es, <a href="brown%20creeper">brown creeper</a>s, <a href="Clark%27s%20nutcracker">Clark's nutcracker</a>s, and <a href="grey%20jay">grey jay</a>s, which are visible throughout the year; <a href="American%20kestrel">American kestrel</a>s, <a href="northern%20flicker">northern flicker</a>s, <a href="golden-crowned%20kinglet">golden-crowned kinglet</a>s, <a href="Cordilleran%20flycatcher">Cordilleran flycatcher</a>s, <a href="Steller%27s%20jay">Steller's jay</a>s, <a href="western%20tanager">western tanager</a>s, <a href="Swainson%27s%20thrush">Swainson's thrush</a>es, <a href="hermit%20thrush">hermit thrush</a>es, <a href="American%20robin">American robin</a>s, and <a href="rufous%20hummingbird">rufous hummingbird</a>s that frequent the area in the summer season; and <a href="mountain%20bluebird">mountain</a> and <a href="western%20bluebird">western bluebird</a>s in the fall and summer. <a href="Olive-sided%20flycatcher">Olive-sided flycatcher</a>s and <a href="chipping%20sparrow">chipping sparrow</a>s are common during the spring and summer seasons, while <a href="yellow-rumped%20warbler">yellow-rumped warbler</a>s, <a href="pine%20siskin">pine siskin</a>s, and <a href="Cassin%27s%20finch">Cassin's finch</a>es can frequently be seen during spring, summer, and fall.

In the early 20th century, <a href="Bull%20trout">Bull trout</a> were present in many streams and river throughout the National Park area, particularly the Sun Creek and lower Annie Creek areas. Locals began stocking streams with non-native trout populations, forcing Brook trout to compete for resources and leading to their local extinction in Annie Creek, along with a significant decline in Sun Creek by the end of the 1980s. By 1992, Crater Lake National Park initiated a bull trout conservation project, removing <a href="invasive%20species">invasive</a> fish populations with electrofishing, snorkeling, and introduction of the toxin and inhibitor of cellular respiration <a href="antimycin%20A">antimycin A</a>. They also created small barriers to keep new trout from reaching Sun Creek. In 1999, Bull trout were considered a "threatened" species by the Endangered Species Act, though locally, there are now about 2,000 Bull trout in the stream, almost ten times as many as the low point for Bull trout abundance at just 200 fish. The project now works with the state government to expand Bull trout distributions from Sun Creek into neighboring forests with fish barriers and removal of invasive fish species.

Climate change threatens the American pika populations in the Crater Lake area, as they cannot tolerate warm weather because their fur does not release heat efficiently. Climate change might be diminishing their food supply via disturbances of vegetation growth patterns. At least three pika populations in Oregon have disappeared within the past few decades. Likewise, as a result of climate change, <a href="mountain%20pine%20beetle">mountain pine beetle</a> infestations have become more frequent among Whitebark pines on the rim of Crater Lake and present on nearby peaks. The National Park Service estimates that roughly half of the whitebark pines in Crater Lake National Park have died or are dying. Because the ecosystem in Crater Lake is isolated from the regional area, it holds particular interest from ecologists, so the United States National Park Service closely monitors human and natural changes to the lake environment.

The <a href="Klamath%20people">Klamath</a> <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> of the area believed that Mount Mazama was inhabited by <a href="Llao">Llao</a>, their "Chief of the <a href="underworld">Below World</a>." After the mountain destroyed itself the Klamaths recounted the events as a great battle between Llao and his rival Skell, their sky god, or "Chief of the Above World." Though the narrative has several slightly different iterations, commonly the legend goes that Llao saw a beautiful Klamath woman, the daughter of a chief, and became angry when she refused his offer of immortality if she would be his consort. Furious, Llao emerged from Mazama and threw fire upon the people beneath the mountain, and Skell stood on Mount Shasta, trying to defend the people against Llao's fury. As the earth shook and volcanic rock fell from the sky, two holy men sacrificed themselves to Mount Mazama's crater, and Skell was able to force Llao back into the volcano, which then collapsed on top of him; other accounts tell that Skell smashed the peak on top of Llao. Torrential rain followed, filling in the hole left by Mazama's collapse to form Crater Lake.

Native American people have lived in the area near Mazama for at least 10,000 years. At least part of the surrounding vicinity was occupied by indigenous populations when Mazama resumed activity about 8,000 years ago, following about 20,000 years of dormancy. Most evidence suggests that Mazama served as a camp site, but not a permanent place of habitation. <a href="Sagebrush">Sagebrush</a> sandals have been discovered to the east of the mountain. These populations faced an increasingly dry climate and the hazards associated with volcanic activity. In civilizations south of Mazama, stories about the volcano's eruption have been transmitted for many generations. Native populations did not tell settlers about the area because it held sacred importance among tribes throughout Oregon and northern California. <a href="Shamanism">Shamans</a> did not allow local Native Americans to look towards Crater Lake, and the Klamath people believed that just looking at Mazama would cause death. Though there are no tribal legends surrounding Crater Lake, some Native Americans still refuse to look at the water.

During the 1800s, one Klamath leader named Lalek predicted scientific discoveries that described Mount Mazama's destruction, claiming that it had collapsed as a result of a particularly violent eruption. Geologists had not discovered this mechanism for caldera formation yet, but the hypothesis was recorded by the soldier William M. Colvig in 1865, and then reprinted in Ella Clark's "Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest".

The last major volcanic landform in the Cascade Range identified by white settlers, Mazama was first visited by non-indigenous people in the spring of 1853. Eleven miners from <a href="Yreka%2C%20California">Yreka, California</a> stopped at a mercantile store in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Oregon">Jacksonville, Oregon</a> owned by Isaac Skeeters, boasting that they knew where to find a gold mine called "Lost Cabin." Financed by a successful gold miner named <a href="John%20Wesley%20Hillman">John Wesley Hillman</a>, Skeeters led a team with ten other Oregonians to find the mine. On June 12, they reached Crater Lake, which Skeeters noted had the bluest water he had ever seen, suggesting they name it "Deep Blue Lake." Though their trip failed to procure gold before running low on provisions, they returned with the discovery of the lake, though it was forgotten amidst the absence of gold in that region.

By 1862, a separate group of Oregon prospectors led by <a href="Chauncey%20Nye">Chauncey Nye</a> reached the Crater Lake area. Nye authored an article for the Jacksonville "Oregon Sentinel" in which he wrote that he had named the depression Blue Lake for its color, the first published description of the lake. <a href="Fort%20Klamath">Fort Klamath</a> was established in 1863, to the southeast of the current boundaries of the National Park area. A wagon road was built to the Fort from the Rogue River Valley as a result. On August 1, 1865, the lake was encountered by hunters on the road, and a party of soldiers and civilians went to see the lake after hearing of their observations. Sergeant Orsen Stearns climbed down into the caldera, followed shortly after by Captain F. B. Sprague, who thought they should name the lake "Lake Majesty." The newspaper editor Jim Sutton and a group of people visited Crater Lake in August 1869, using a boat to reach Wizard Island and publishing an article about their experience in the Jacksonville newspaper. Sutton suggested the new name of "Crater Lake".

Mount Mazama received its English name from <a href="William%20Gladstone%20Steel">William G. Steel</a> in 1896, the founder of the climbing club The <a href="Mazamas">Mazamas</a>, which formed at <a href="Mount%20Hood">Mount Hood</a> in 1894. The word comes from a Native American word meaning "mountain goat", derived from an Aztec term to refer to "small deer." Steel gave <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> geologist Joseph S. Diller the idea for Mazama's name to help promote national park status for the vicinity by using his organization as the inspiration for the mountain's name. Crater Lake is called "Giiwas" in the Klamath language. Steel had helped map Crater Lake in 1886 with <a href="Clarence%20Dutton">Clarence Dutton</a> of the United States Geological Survey. The conservation movement in the United States was gaining traction, so Steel's efforts to preserve the Mazama area were achieved on two scales, first with the creation of the local Cascade Range Forest Reserve in 1893, and then on May 22, 1902 with the recognition of Crater Lake National Park.

A few decades after its discovery, Mazama began attracting geological interest. After conducting research at Mazama during the 1880s, in 1902, Joseph S. Diller published a major report with the United States Geological Survey concerning Crater Lake National Park. In the study, he and co-author Horace B. Patton made the claim that Mazama had collapsed instead of being blown apart, the first American geologists to do so. Their work was followed by research led by <a href="Howel%20Williams">Howel Williams</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, which was published in 1942. In the paper, Williams mapped the volcano's <a href="dacite">dacite</a> and andesite lava flow deposits. During the 1980s, Charles Bacon and other United States Geological Survey geologists expanded on Williams's work, determining more specific details about its caldera formation.

Studies of heat flow and the water chemistry in Crater Lake and the alteration of rocks older than 120,000 years ago suggest that <a href="hydrothermal%20circulation">hydrothermal</a> areas exist in the Mazama vicinity. Most springs show similar chemistry, from the weathering of volcanic glass and <a href="pyroxene">clinopyroxene</a>. These features probably formed due to processes related to residual heat from the magma chamber that produced the climactic Mazama eruption 7,700 years ago. The lake shows <a href="convective%20mixing">convective mixing</a> that cycles every three years as thermal fluid moves into the lake through its floor, creating <a href="hot%20spring">thermal springs</a> that formed silica spires with heights up to . As a result, the California Energy Company drilled two geothermal exploration wells: the MZI-11A with a depth of to the east of the national park barrier at the Scott Creek Drainage, and the MZII-1 with a depth of to the south of the same boundary and to the east of Annie Creek. The maximum temperature they have observed at the southern well is , while the maximum temperature was at the eastern well. The convective heat discharge in Crater Lake marks the third largest in the Cascades, after the Austin Hot Springs and at <a href="Lassen%20Volcanic%20National%20Park">Lassen Volcanic National Park</a>. Scientists from the United States Geological Survey think that sources for geothermal energy use exist at Mazama and Crater Lake.

Produced by the subduction of the <a href="Juan%20de%20Fuca%20Plate">Juan de Fuca tectonic plate</a>, which moves slowly in a northeastward direction with the <a href="Gorda%20Plate">Gorda tectonic plate</a> under the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American tectonic plate</a>, Mazama is part of the <a href="Cascade%20Volcanoes">Cascade Volcanic Arc</a> that stretches from northern California to southern Washington state. Mazama sits among a region of <a href="Extensional%20tectonics">crustal extension</a> marked by <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">fault zones</a>, including north–south-trending <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Dip-slip%20faults">normal</a> faults such as the Annie Spring fault within the West Klamath Lake fault zone, which might produce damaging earthquakes. Likewise, the Red Cone Spring fault cuts through <a href="basaltic%20andesite">basaltic andesite</a> deposits at Red Cone from 35,000 years ago; together, the two faults move at an average rate of each year. There do not appear to be faults present in the Crater Lake caldera wall, but the volcano induced a <a href="stress%20field">stress field</a> in the upper crust nearby.

Mazama is underlain by the <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> High Cascade <a href="basalt">basalt</a> and <a href="mafic">mafic</a> (rich in magnesium and iron) <a href="andesite">andesite</a> to the west and southwest, with high-volume <a href="rhyodacite">rhyodacite</a> lava flows from 600,000 to 700,000 years old underlying Mazama deposits to the south, southeast, east, and northeast. It is a major Cascade volcano, and is located at the intersection of the Cascade Range and Klamath graben, the north–northwest trending <a href="Structural%20basin">basin</a> also surrounded by fault zones. The <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range Province</a> lies to the east. Mazama lies within the broad segment of the Cascades arc, where smaller volcanoes are common because of melting patterns of the <a href="Mantle%20%28geology%29">Earth's mantle</a> within the region. Erupting magma that ranged from high-alumina olivine <a href="tholeiite">tholeiite</a> to magnesian basaltic andesite, these volcanoes show increased contents of <a href="subduction">subduction</a>-produced or melted fluids that mixed with another magma chamber in the mantle. These magmas vary from 47.6 percent to 73.2 percent <a href="silicon%20dioxide">silicon dioxide</a>.

Mazama and Crater Lake form part of the Mazama reach of the Oregon Cascades, which stretches for from Timber Crater to the Big Bunchgrass shield volcano. This includes 175 Quaternary volcanic vents within a belt that ranges from in width, which has a high vent density with many shields and monogenetic volcanic centers. After <a href="Newberry%20Volcano">Newberry Volcano</a>, Mazama is the second largest Quaternary volcanic edifice in Oregon, and the most voluminous, with an overall volume of . Mazama is the newest of the Quaternary calderas in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, which also include the Newberry calderas and the caldera at the <a href="Medicine%20Lake%20Volcano">Medicine Lake Volcano</a>. Quaternary monogenetic volcanism throughout Oregon's High Cascades includes cinder cones, <a href="lava%20field">lava field</a>s, and small shield volcanoes, which have produced lava ranging from low-potassium, high-alumina olivine tholeiite to medium-potassium <a href="calc-alkaline%20magma%20series">calc-alkaline</a> basalt, basaltic andesite to <a href="shoshonite">shoshonitic</a> basaltic andesite.

The Mazama volcanic complex originally formed as a cluster of overlapping edifices. Made up of shield volcanoes and small stratocones, it had an irregular shape. <a href="Mount%20Scott%20%28Klamath%20County%2C%20Oregon%29">Mount Scott</a>, at a height of , marks the oldest visible remnant of this original cluster. Scott was the first of the composite volcanoes that created the Mazama complex, formed by a quick and active cone-building phase and becoming inactive long before the most recent eruption at Mazama. With time, eruptive activity moved to the west, creating the Applegate Peak and Garfield Peak cones on the southern flanks of the volcanic center. <a href="Hawaiian%20eruptions">Hawaiian eruptions</a> from neighboring shield volcanoes also built up Mazama, producing basaltic andesite lava flows that ranged from on average in thickness. These flows, present on the southern, western, and eastern walls of Mazama’s caldera, also contained <a href="volcanic%20bomb">lava bombs</a>. Viscous eruptions of andesitic lava that reached thicknesses of several hundred feet further built up Mazama’s cones, creating a solid, dense interior rich with angular <a href="Lava%23Block%20lava%20flows">lava blocks</a>.

Prior to its collapse, Mazama was originally speculated to stand at a height of . Research by Howel Williams superimposed the Crater Lake caldera on other Cascade stratovolcanoes including <a href="Mount%20Shasta">Mount Shasta</a> in California and <a href="Mount%20Rainier">Mount Rainier</a> in Washington state, and concluded that Mazama actually stood at pre-collapse, which has been accepted as the standard estimate by geologists. By the Holocene, the Mazama volcano was made up of several, clustered peaks with Mount Scott on the eastern end and Hillman Peak on the far west side. The volcanoes likely rose in elevation from east to west, and they also featured volcanic cones and lava domes on their southern flanks. <a href="pyramidal%20peak">Glacial horns</a> like the Watchman lava flow were also present, and the mountain may or may not have sustained glaciers close to the summit. At the time of its collapse, Mount Mazama encompassed an area of and represented one of the major volcanoes in the High Cascades branch of the greater Cascade Range. It was the largest volcanic edifice between Mount Shasta in California and the <a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28Oregon%29">Three Sisters</a> complex in Oregon. Before the eruption, it had been significantly altered by glacial erosion, which carved U-shaped valleys on its southern and southeastern slopes. The northern and western sides of the caldera do not exhibit prominent evidence of glacial erosion, since they feature lava flows that only underwent alteration by late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> epoch glacial motion. Outside of the caldera, most hills show evidence of glacial alteration except those from the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> epoch and low elevation landforms including Pleistocene lava domes and cinder cones. Mount Scott has also been heavily eroded by ice, and the Union Peak volcano now consists only of a pyramidal horn.

Though it now has dimensions of and a width of , scientists think the original collapse diameter was . It now includes several small lava domes and cinder cones, including Wizard Island and the underwater volcano Merriam Cone. The highest elevation in the Mazama Complex is now Mount Scott, located at an elevation of , with a relief of above Crater Lake's surface waters. Except for the tallest slopes of the complex, all cones have been covered with deposits from the climactic eruption at Mazama 7,700 years ago. Scientists now use the exposed contents of the caldera rim wall to investigate eruptions and mapping the eruptive history of the region. Throughout its known eruptions, Mazama has produced 43 percent rhyodacite, 42 percent andesite, 15 percent dacite, and less than 1 percent basaltic andesite. All of the rhyodacite has been produced within the past 30,000 years of activity, suggesting that regional and local distribution of compositions were not uniform over time. Andesite and dacite lava flows from the volcano usually have <a href="plagioclase">plagioclase</a> as their major phenocryst, though augite and hypersthene are also present, the latter more abundant. Olivine form minor phenocrysts, which are found throughout lava flows from Mazama, and hornblende can be found in some andesite lava flows. Basalt and mafic andesite lava flows from Mazama and nearby eruptive vents have relatively higher amounts of olivine and lack hypersthene, and the mafic andesite deposits display textures that indicate they underwent greater mixing than andesite and dacite deposits.

In the western United States and Canada, volcanic ash often forms distinct layers among recent geological deposits, which can be used for <a href="stratigraphy">stratigraphy</a> among geologists and <a href="Stratigraphy%20%28archaeology%29">archaeologists</a>. Given the large distribution of the historic eruption of Mount Mazama, <a href="Mazama%20Ash">Mazama Ash</a> serves as a common geological marker. Mazama Ash had a minimum fallout area of , while ash from the nearby Glacier Peak volcano, known as Glacier Peak Ash, encompassed an area of more than . Mazama Ash is the most widely distributed tephra layer from the late Quaternary in the United States and southwestern Canada, extending to eight states to the west and three Canadian provinces. Mazama Ash forms orange colored deposits.

Like the Glacier Peak Ash deposits, Mazama Ash is well-preserved in the Pacific Northwest. It is distinguishable from the lump pumice deposits from the Glacier Peak volcano, which contains more phenocrysts. Mazama Ash also has more soda, yttrium, ytterbium, and zirconium, and less silica and lime than eruptive products from Glacier Peak. and it forms finer deposits than Glacier Peak Ash.

With an age between 6,000 and 7,000 years, Mazama Ash corresponds to the estimated time for Mazama's climactic eruption 6,600 years ago, identified by <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a> of wood charred by ashflows. Some of the Glacier Peak ash has been found in strata beneath Mazama Ash in Washington state and in eastern <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, to the southeast of Glacier Peak. Studies of Glacier Peak Ash deposits suggest that they are older than Mazama Ash, at about 12,000 years old. Glacier Peak Ash has not been found in deposits less than 10,000 years old, and nearly all human artifacts have been found above its deposits, except for a site at Birch Creek where non diagnostic artifacts were discovered beneath Glacier Peak Ash.

Formed of a complex of stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes, there are about 35 known <a href="parasitic%20cone">satellite vents</a> in the Mazama complex. Mazama is surrounded by monogenetic cinder cones, lava fields, and shield volcanoes made up of calc-alkaline basalt and andesite, tholeiite, and shoshonitic andesite. Varying in age from 600,000 to 40,000 years old, these edifices closely resemble other monogenetic volcanoes in the High Cascades. Extending from the eastern half of Mazama and to the southeast lies a volcanic field consisting of rhyodacitic lava domes and lava flows between 700,000 and 600,000 years old, which encompasses an area of more than . This large field is underlain by rhyodacite in its southeastern segment, and is cut by north–south trending normal faults.

Moving from west to northwest, Mazama stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes grow progressively younger. The oldest, at 400,000 years old, occur at Phantom Ship and Mount Scott, while the youngest can be found at the Hillman Peak stratovolcano, dated to 70,000 years old. There are also andesite flows at the northern rim of Mazama dated to between 50,000 and 40,000 years old. Shield volcanoes near Mazama feature lava flows made of <a href="agglutination">agglutinated</a> mafic andesite, which form sheets about thick, as well as more deposits from more viscous andesite and dacite magma that reach thicknesses up to . Many of these deposits (both dacitic and andesitic) contain undercooled, crystal-poor segments of andesite, including at Mount Scott and Phantom Cone. Lava and ice interactions are suggested by exposures of glassy <a href="breccia">breccia</a> in Mazama's caldera, and lava flows cover glaciated lava deposits.

About 70,000 years ago, several <a href="silicic">silicic</a> (rich in silicon dioxide), explosive eruptions occurred, including a significant event at Pumice Castle on the eastern wall of Mazama. This formed welded deposits near the vent, also forming non-welded deposits to the south and on the northern part of Mazama. Between 40,000 years ago and Mazama's major eruption, no andesitic or dacitic volcanism took place. However, rhyodacitic magma was erupted at Grouse Hill, Steel Bay, and Redcloud Cliff in the form of pumice and lava flows made of hornblende-phyric, or chemically evolved, rhyodacite. During this period of the late Pleistocene or early Holocene, lava domes such as those at Sharp Peak, Grouse Hill, and Merriam Point formed, sharing chemical compositions with silica contents at about 70%.

<a href="Pyroclastic%20rock">Pyroclastic</a> cones at Mazama include Wizard Island, Bald Crater, Maklaks Crater (also known as Diller Cone) and Forgotten Cone. In addition to its crater, referred to as Williams Crater or the Forgotten Crater, Mazama's various volcanic vents occur at Cleetwood, Llao Rock, and Redcloud, which are located at elevations of , , and , respectively. Nearby cinder cones include Bear Butte, Crater Peak, Desert Cone, Lookout Butte, Pothole Butte, Red Cone, Scout Hill, and Union Peak. There are at least 13 cinder cones within Crater Lake National Park, and at least eleven more in the nearby area. They were fed by a different magma chamber than Mazama, though they likely received magma from basaltic andesite reservoirs in the vicinity. The exception is Williams crater, which erupted basalt and dacite and got silicic lava from the western part of Mazama's magma chamber. Stratovolcanoes in Mazama's vicinity consist of Sentinel Rock, Mount Scott, Phantom Cone, Dutton Cliff, and Danger Bay.

Mazama has a few composite cones in the vicinity of the caldera. At about 420,000 years old, Mount Scott has a conical shape, but has been extensively altered by Pleistocene glacial erosion, which carved a large cirque on its western flank and smaller ones on its eastern and northeastern sides. Scott lacks a summit crater. Hillman Peak was the youngest composite cone in the Mazama eruptive center, forming about 70,000 years ago. It lies on the southwestern side of the caldera, and it represents the highest point on the Mazama rim, rising above Crater Lake. The cone was cut down the middle during Mazama’s collapse post-eruption, creating a cross-section of its interior composition.

Shield volcanoes that contributed to Mazama’s growth only erupted for several hundred to several thousand years. They erupted rapidly, spraying fluid lava that included lava bombs and incandescent fragments. Llao shield on the northwestern side of the Mazama complex shows a representative structure for the shields that helped form Mazama.

The Mazama vicinity formed gradually, its earliest deposits consisting of dacite from up to 1.28 million years ago. Between 725,000 and 500,000 years ago, rhyodacite was erupted, eventually forming a lava dome field with a volume of and dimensions of . This featured up to 40 rhyodacitic domes and lava flows, produced between 470,000 and 410,000 years ago before stratocone formation began.

Mazama formed as a group of overlapping volcanic edifices, which included shield volcanoes and small composite cones. 
Cone-building eruptions took place within short periods of time. Shield volcanoes fed Mazama's expansion with basaltic andesite lava flows that covered large expanses on the slopes of the mountain. Forming lava fountains similar to those observed in <a href="Hawaiian%20eruption">Hawaiian eruption</a>s, the shield volcanoes erupted incandescent lava bombs and were deposited on the southern, western, and eastern flanks of the complex. They have average thicknesses of . Roughly 215,000 years ago, another flank vent erupted dacitic lava that coursed to the west for at least , with volcanic <a href="Dike%20%28geology%29">dike</a>s that trend toward the vent still present in the Mazama caldera wall. The complex remained inactive for about 40,000 years before it resumed activity, erupting andesitic lava from another flank vent, building a large shield volcano from 170,000 to 120,000 years ago. Other andesitic lava deposits can be observed in the caldera wall's northern side. The Mazama complex was inactive between 100,000 and 75,000 years ago. About 75,000 years ago, the volcano erupted effusive lava flows of andesite that formed thick deposits below Hillman Peak that extended at least from the caldera rim.

Many of the major cone-creating eruptions at Mazama were effusive rather than violently explosive, but explosive eruptions about 70,000 years ago yielded silicic lava that created thick pyroclastic deposits. These deposits include Pumice Castle, an orange edifice at the eastern wall of the caldera, which formed by the fusion of glassy pumice fragments. Similar activity on the northern side of Cloudcap and the eastern segment of Llao Rock that ejected dacitic tephra and pyroclastic rock also formed fused edifices. About 50,000 years ago, a vent at Mazama erupted the Watchman flow, which filled a canyon at the southwestern wall of the complex. From 50,000 to 40,000 years ago, Mazama vents continued to erupt andesite lava flows onto the northern and southwestern slopes and create dacite lava domes on the southern flanks. These domes often collapsed and produced <a href="pyroclastic%20flows">pyroclastic flows</a> that coursed down the southern slope of the volcano, forming deposits up to Devil's Backbone, a craggy volcanic dike that was exhumed when the volcano collapsed.

Throughout its eruptive history, Mazama has produced basaltic andesite, andesite, and dacite lava. About 40,000 years ago, it underwent a dramatic shift to solely rhyodacite lava, which was highly viscous and had a silica content at about 70 percent. Between 30,000 and 25,000 years ago, rhyodacitic eruptions occurred at the complex, yielding pumiceous <a href="tephra">tephra</a> and lava flows from Grouse Hill, Steel Bay, and Redcloud Cliff. At Redcloud Cliff, a lava flow formed with glassy columns that touched glaciers, creating a large, inverted stone triangle on the eastern rim of Mazama. These same eruptions formed a nearly vertical-walled crater, producing pumice and creating a dome over the Redcloud vent. Grouse Hill's lava flow deposit and lava dome formed at about the same time, about 27,000 years ago. At the end of this eruptive sequence, rhyodacite lava domes formed on the northeastern slopes of the volcano.

Between 100 and 200 years prior to the climactic eruption, Llao Rock, a thick block of dark lava with a volume of , was produced from a rhyodacite flow erupted from Mazama. It has a round center and extensions on the sides, resembling a <a href="bird%20of%20prey">bird of prey</a>. The formation of Llao Rock was preceded by explosive eruptions of rhyodacite, creating pumice and ash that were ejected high into the atmosphere and carried for several hundred miles into northern and eastern Washington state, eastern Oregon, and western Nevada. A large crater formed but was filled by subsequent lava flows. Shortly before the major, caldera-forming eruption at Mazama, the Cleetwood flow was produced. Also composed of rhyodacite lava, it originated from a vent on the northern side of the complex located eastward of Llao Rock. It likely only occurred weeks or months before the major eruption, as Mazama's collapse formed a backward flow of lava when it cut through the Cleetwood lava, suggesting that the Cleetwood lava was still hot enough to flow and move. Tephra from the last major eruption that was emplaced atop Cleetwood deposits has been altered by heat and gas from the Cleetwood lava. Both these eruptive periods took place on the northern flank of the Mazama complex, not far from the magma chamber that produced the climactic eruption shortly after.

Mazama's climactic eruption has been dated to about 6,845 ± 50 years ago via radiocarbon dating, or about 7,700 years ago via <a href="dendrochronology">dendrochronology</a>. Other scientists have determined ages of 6,730 ± 40 years ago or roughly 7,470–7,620 calendar years ago, as well as 7,627 ± 150 calendar years ago. Fallout from the eruption continued for roughly three years, though the major eruption only occurred for a few days. The eruption is thought to have occurred during autumn, as inferred from pollen data.

The eruptive activity that lead to Mazama's collapse proceeded in two phases. During the first phase, shortly after the eruption of the Cleetwood flow, a vent at a higher elevation on the northern side of the Mazama complex (but still below the summit) produced a high ash column into the <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a>. Ash extended to eight states in the west and three Canadian provinces. As a result, Mazama Ash has become a commonly used benchmark for measuring the relative age of objects, compared to its orange colored deposits. Pumice deposits reached depths of adjacent to Mazama's base, still reaching thicknesses more than as far as to the northeast. The ejecta featured blocks of medium-grain <a href="granodiorite">granodiorite</a>, as well as inclusions of <a href="diabase">diabase</a>, <a href="quartz%20diorite">quartz diorite</a>, <a href="granite">granite</a>, <a href="aplite">aplite</a>, and <a href="granophyre">granophyre</a>. Ashfall layers have been eroded by pyroclastic flows and with time, but they are still visible at Hillman Peak and along the Cleetwood Trail. The Plinian column from the eruption devastated the area hundreds of miles north and northeast of Mazama, but to the southwest and west, little pumice or ash were deposited.

The eruption's character changed dramatically as the column of pumice and ash collapsed. The exact cause is not well understood; it may have been the result of the enormous weight of the tephra or the expansion of the eruptive vent. The sudden deposition of so much pumice generated pyroclastic flows that moved down the northern side of the volcano, coursing west–east from Llao Rock to Redcloud Cliff. The first of these pyroclastic flows were deposited at superheated temperatures, welding fragments and creating the Wineglass welded tuff, which consists of big blocks of orange-brown and gray rock. These emplacements can only be observed on the northern slopes; they are absent from the southern slopes of the volcano.

Mazama was covered with incandescent pumice. The extreme weight of eruptive material began to push down on the volcano's summit, similar to a <a href="piston">piston</a>. Eventually, the top of Mazama's magma chamber <a href="subsidence">subsided</a>, and concentric openings formed by the summit, producing smaller vents surrounding the main eruptive cone. Pumice ejected from these new fractures created rapid pyroclastic flows that coursed down all the sides of Mazama, traveling over tall ridges and summits of subfeatures and extending tens of miles from their vents. These flows altered the surfaces surrounding Mazama, removing ashfall and then depositing their contents in nearby valleys. Some of the flows traveled more than from their source, destroying <a href="timber">timber</a> in their paths, while others deposited their rock into river valleys to the north and west of Mazama, leaving layers of pumice between in thickness. Ash clouds also rose up from the pyroclastic flows. Pyroclastic flows also moved to the east, reaching more than from the base of Mazama. These deposits have diameters between , though they are punctuated by pumice blocks with diameters of that extend as far as from Mazama's summit. Flows containing pumice coursed into the Annie Creek and Sun Creek canyons southward of Mazama, depositing of material, which have still not been fully eroded after almost 8,000 years. To the southeast, pyroclastic flows coursed into Sand Creek and extended more than in that direction, some reaching Klamath Marsh, the Williamson River, and the Klamath Lakes.

Mazama's eruptive activity drew from deeper layers of the magma chamber that fed its climactic eruption, with denser layers of andesite and basaltic andesite lying beneath lighter layers of rhyodacite. The last of the pyroclastic flows erupted contained andesitic, gray scoria that was deposited above the pale orange and yellow rhyodacite pumice from earlier phases of the eruption. The final eruptions formed the Pumice Desert, a treeless plain on the northern and northeastern side of Mazama, as well as filling the Pumice Creek valley and parts of the Klamath Marsh. Reaching thicknesses between , the emplacements from these flows yielded fumarolic activity, still detectable in the Annie Creek and Sand Creek canyons. Erosion from rain and stream flow has left pipes from the andesitic lava flows as columns and spires.

Prior to collapse, the Mazama edifice had an estimated volume of , though it may have exceeded taking glacial erosion into account. After the climactic eruption, Mazama's peak was completely destroyed, replaced by a depression with a depth of surrounded by cliffs. The volume of magma ejected from Mazama more or less equals the volume from the peak that collapsed, which scientists have estimated at between of lava. The lava produced was zoned vertically according to arrangement within the source magma chamber, and was calc-alkaline in composition. It consisted of roughly 90 percent uniform rhyodacitic pumice, which contained about 10 percent <a href="phenocryst">phenocryst</a>s, the rest made up of crystalline andesite scoria and mafic crystals. The eruption released aerosol that lowered temperatures globally in the Northern Hemisphere, with estimates of for one to three years after the eruption. The temperature changes were possibly greater than the effects of the <a href="1815%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20Tambora">1815 eruption of Mount Tambora</a>. Mazama's climactic eruption produced stratospheric mass loadings of of <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>, with an estimated minimum <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a> <a href="degassing">degassing</a> of during its eruption. Aerosol from the eruption traveled as far as <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, falling for as long as six years.

The United States Geological Survey has referred to the 7,700 years ago Mazama eruption as the largest explosive eruption within the Cascades in the past million years, and one of the largest eruptions during the Holocene epoch. Considering Mazama's eruptive output within the past 420,000 years, it may have produced more than of eruptive volume, making it either the third or fourth most productive Quaternary volcanic center in the Cascade Range. The eruption had a <a href="Volcanic%20Explosivity%20Index">Volcanic Explosivity Index</a> of 7, as determined from eruption cloud height, eruptive volume, and qualitative observations.

Since the climactic eruption 7,700 years ago, all eruptive activity at Mazama has occurred within the caldera. After the caldera formed, the original crater was widened by avalanches from the walls. These gave a scalloped profile to the caldera, such as the coves at Llao Bay, Steel Bay, and Grotto Cove. The Chaski slide, for example, the most prominent landslide detectable on the caldera wall, occurred long after the formation of the crater. Located on the southern side, it contains lava blocks between in length, many of which now reside underwater on the floor of Crater Lake. As the crater filled with landslides, lava, and water, the caldera's appearance changed over time. New cones and lava fields have formed inside the caldera, all of which have been submerged except for Wizard Island. Mapping the caldera floor with high-resolution multibeam echo sounders, vehicle-motion sounders and navigators, and a dual-differential global positioning system (DGPS), scientists from the US government and universities detected volcanoes and landslide deposits under the water. Between 7,700 and 7,200 years ago, the central lava platform, the Merriam Cone, and Wizard Island were produced, as well as lava flows. These eruptions produced of andesitic lava, half of that in the Wizard Island cone. Wizard Island lava interacted with water to form breccia piles, and as the water levels rose, only the top of the Wizard Island edifice stayed above the water. The edifice has a lavaberg shape, as it sits above a larger, ovular pedestal rising above the floor of Crater Lake; just two percent of Wizard Island sits above the water surface. At the summit of the above-water cone, a small lava flow from a lava fountain appears, located on the southwestern flank. There is also a volcanic plug poking out of the crater floor as a body of dark lava. Lava blocks with diameters of can be seen along the rim of the crater, possibly produced from later stages of cone-building eruptions that created Wizard Island. The central platform was created by a similar vent eastward of Wizard Island, made up of effusive lava that created lava fields northward and eastward of its vent. Merriam cone does not have a summit crater, but rises to above the northern lake floor. Merriam cone was produced underwater, and was probably formed at the same or similar time as Wizard Island and the central platform.

Mazama was last active about 4,800 years ago, when an eruption took place near Wizard Island's eastern base. This eruption took place underwater, and it produced viscous lava that created a rhyodacite lava dome, about 2,400 years after the first period of postcaldera activity. Given that Mazama has had periods of sporadic eruptions for 420,000 years, the United States Geological Survey thinks that it is "virtually certain" that Mazama will erupt again in the future. Mazama is considered dormant, but it remains monitored by the United States Geological Survey <a href="Cascades%20Volcano%20Observatory">Cascades Volcano Observatory</a>. Future eruptions would likely take place near the western side of the complex and within the caldera rim; they could occur underwater. The ejection of lava rich in gas from shallow water could produce huge ash columns, but submarine eruptions at deeper depths may decrease the explosiveness of the event. Nonetheless, the rapid mixing of water and lava could produce dangerous <a href="pyroclastic%20surge">pyroclastic surge</a>s, which are more gaseous and less solid than pyroclastic flows. Such flows could pass over topographic barriers, move rock fragments at rapid speeds of , and travel several miles from their vent. Mazama is unlikely to produce mudflows far from the caldera, though a nearby vent outside the caldera could erupt and mix with snow. Eruptions are unlikely to produce waves that extend beyond Crater Lake, but powerful explosions could produce tall waves in the caldera. An eruption as explosive as the one 7,700 years ago is unlikely given that it would require larger volumes of magma than are known to be available within the Mazama vicinity. Moreover, landslides could flood adjacent shoreline regions, but they are not likely to induce failure of the caldera's walls, as they rise more than above the lake's surface. Earthquakes from the nearby West Klamath Lake fault zone could reach magnitudes up to 7.0 on the <a href="Richter%20scale">Richter scale</a>, but these only occur every 3,000 to 10,000 years; they could generate tall waves by creating landslides. Though local earthquakes from volcanic activity would create motion in the lake, they would likely only reach maximum magnitudes of 5.0 on the Richter scale. However, Crater Lake is poorly monitored, and not highly active seismically among the Cascade volcanoes. The largest earthquake threat originates from the <a href="Cascadia%20subduction%20zone">Cascadia subduction zone</a>, which could produce earthquakes with a magnitude of 8 or 9 that could lead to huge waves in Crater Lake.

Though the population within of Mount Mazama is only about 50 people, more than 270,000 live within of the volcano. Even so, highly consequential eruptions at Mazama seem unlikely in the near future. Large, pyroclastic eruptions like the climactic eruption are unlikely for thousands of years. Similarly, the release of lethal gases like carbon dioxide from Crater Lake, similar to the eruption from <a href="Lake%20Nyos">Lake Nyos</a> in <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> in 1986, is unlikely as a result of the natural mixing of deep and surface water within the lake. There is no known mechanism by which Crater Lake's water could be catastrophically drained or by which the caldera walls would fail suddenly. Even minor hydrothermal explosions could potentially be dangerous, as the ejection of ballistic blocks or tall waves could threaten people standing near the lake, traveling at speeds from . Likewise, landslides could threaten visitors to the national park or researchers by creating tsunami-sized waves, also potentially damaging infrastructure surrounding the lake.

Located north of the city of <a href="Klamath%20Falls%2C%20Oregon">Klamath Falls</a> and northeast of <a href="Medford%2C%20Oregon">Medford</a>, Crater Lake can be reached from <a href="U.S.%20Route%2097">U.S. Route 97</a> on the east, on the southwest by Highway 62, and on the northwest by Highway 138. Crater Lake and the remnants of Mount Mazama can be seen from Rim Drive, a road that surrounds the caldera, which is the only part within the Crater Lake National Park where vehicles are permitted. The Garfield Peak Trail, which runs east from the Crater Lake Lodge, offers views from above the lake's surface, with Mount Shasta visible southward. Another trail runs for from Rim Drive's eastern edge to Mount Scott, which offers views of central and southern Oregon such as the Three Sisters located north of Mazama and Mount Thielsen, also to the north. The Cleetwood trail leads for down the northern flank of the caldera rim, eventually reaching Cleetwood Cove where boat trips run from late June or early July throughout the summer season to Wizard Island. Wizard Island can be climbed, offering views of Crater Lake.

Because Mount Mazama lies within a national park area, collecting rocks within the vicinity is prohibited unless a permit is obtained. The park's facilities lie at Rim Village, at the southern edge of the caldera. Lodging and camping facilities open during the summer season between May and October. No lodges, gas stations, or camping areas remain open from October through late May. Popular activities within Crater Lake National Park include <a href="cycling">biking</a>, fishing, <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country skiing</a>, and <a href="snowshoe%20running">snowshoeing</a>.

Territorial Force

The Territorial Force was a part-time volunteer component of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, created in 1908 to augment British land forces without resorting to <a href="conscription">conscription</a>. The new organisation consolidated the 19th-century <a href="Volunteer%20Force">Volunteer Force</a> and <a href="yeomanry">yeomanry</a> into a unified auxiliary, commanded by the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> and administered by local <a href="County%20Territorial%20Association">County Territorial Association</a>s. The Territorial Force was designed to reinforce the regular army in expeditionary operations abroad, but because of political opposition it was assigned to home defence. Members were liable for service anywhere in the UK and could not be compelled to serve overseas. In the first two months of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, territorials volunteered for foreign service in significant numbers, allowing territorial units to be deployed abroad. They saw their first action on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> during the initial <a href="Race%20to%20the%20Sea">German offensive of 1914</a>, and the force filled the gap between the near destruction of the regular army that year and the arrival of the <a href="Kitchener%27s%20Army">New Army</a> in 1915. Territorial units were deployed to <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> in 1915 and, following the failure of that campaign, provided the bulk of the British contribution to allied forces in the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a>. By the war's end, the Territorial Force had fielded twenty-three infantry divisions and two mounted divisions on foreign soil. It was demobilised after the war and reconstituted in 1921 as the <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a>.

The force experienced problems throughout its existence. On establishment, fewer than 40 per cent of the men in the previous auxiliary institutions transferred into it, and it was consistently under strength until the outbreak of the First World War. It was not considered to be an effective military force by the regular army and was denigrated by the proponents of conscription. <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> chose to concentrate the Territorial Force on home defence and raise the <a href="Kitchener%27s%20Army">New Army</a> to reinforce the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF) in France, a decision which disappointed the territorials. The need to replace heavy losses suffered by the BEF before the New Army was ready forced Kitchener to deploy territorial units overseas, compromising the force's ability to defend the homeland. To replace foreign-service units, the Territorial Force was doubled in size by creating a second line which mirrored the organisation of the original, first-line units. Second-line units assumed responsibility for home defence and provided replacement drafts to the first line. The second line competed with the New Army for limited resources, and was poorly equipped and armed. The provision of replacements to the first line compromised the second-line's home defence capabilities until a third line was raised to take over responsibility for territorial recruitment and training. The second line's duties were further complicated by the expectation, later confirmed, that it too would be deployed overseas.

Territorial units were initially deployed overseas to free up regular units from non-combat duties. On the Western Front, individual <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s were attached to regular army formations and sent into action, and the territorials were credited with playing a key role in stopping the German offensive. The first complete territorial <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> to be deployed to a combat zone arrived in France in March 1915. Territorial divisions began participating in offensive operations on the Western Front from June 1915 and at Gallipoli later that year. Because of the way it was constituted and recruited, the Territorial Force possessed an identity that was distinct from the regular army and the New Army. This became increasingly diluted as heavy casualties were replaced with conscripted recruits following the introduction of compulsory service in early 1916. The Territorial Force was further eroded as a separate institution when County Territorial Associations were relieved of most of their administrative responsibilities. By the war's end, there was little to distinguish between regular, territorial and New Army formations.

The <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> of the late 19th century was a small, professional organisation designed to garrison the <a href="British%20Empire">empire</a> and maintain order at home, with no capacity to provide an <a href="Expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary force</a> in a major war. It was augmented in its home duties by three part-time volunteer institutions, the <a href="Militia%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">militia</a>, the <a href="Volunteer%20Force">Volunteer Force</a> and the <a href="yeomanry">yeomanry</a>. <a href="Battalion">Battalion</a>s of the militia and Volunteer Force had been linked with regular army <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s since 1872, and the militia was often used as a source of recruitment into the regular army. The terms of service for all three auxiliaries made service overseas voluntary. The <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> exposed weaknesses in the ability of the regular army to counter <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a> which required additional manpower to overcome. The only reinforcements available were the auxiliaries – nearly 46,000 militiamen served in South Africa and another 74,000 were enlisted into the regular army; some 20,000 men of the Volunteer Force volunteered for active service in South Africa; and the yeomanry provided the nucleus of the separate <a href="Imperial%20Yeomanry">Imperial Yeomanry</a> for which over 34,000 volunteered.

The war placed a significant strain on the regular forces. Against a background of invasion scares in the press, <a href="George%20Wyndham">George Wyndham</a>, <a href="Under-Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Under-Secretary of State for War</a>, conceded in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> in February 1900 that instead of augmenting the regular army's defence of the British coast, the auxiliary forces were the main defence. The questionable performance of the volunteers, caused by poor standards of efficiency and training, led to doubts in both government and the regular army about the auxiliary's ability to meet such a challenge. The war also exposed the difficulty in relying on auxiliary forces which were not liable for service overseas as a source of reinforcements for the regular army in times of crisis. In 1903, the Director of General Mobilisation and Military Intelligence reported an excess of home defence forces which could not be relied upon to expand the army in foreign campaigns. The utility of such forces was brought further into question by British military planning; the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> formed the primary defence against invasion, and studies in 1903 and 1908 concluded that the threat of invasion was negligible, despite popular perceptions to the contrary.

The first reform efforts were undertaken in 1901 by <a href="St%20John%20Brodrick%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Midleton">William St John Brodrick</a>, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a>. They were designed to improve the training of the auxiliary forces and transform the yeomanry from <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> to <a href="mounted%20infantry">mounted infantry</a>. Brodrick's efforts were met with opposition from auxiliary interests in the government, and the yeomanry in particular proved resistant to change. A royal commission on auxiliary forces concluded in 1904 that they were not fit to defend the country unaided and that the only effective solution would be to introduce <a href="conscription">conscription</a>. This option, regarded as political suicide by all parties, was immediately rejected. Brodrick's successor, <a href="H.%20O.%20Arnold-Forster">H. O. Arnold-Forster</a>, also failed to overcome opposition to his reform efforts. In December 1905, a <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> government took office, bringing in <a href="Richard%20Haldane%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Haldane">Richard Haldane</a> as the Secretary of State for War. His vision was a nation that could be mobilised for war without resorting to conscription – a "real national army, formed by the people". His solution was the Territorial Force, financed, trained and commanded centrally by the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> and raised, supplied and administered by local <a href="County%20Territorial%20Association">County Territorial Association</a>s.

Haldane was able to overcome opposition and pass the <a href="Territorial%20and%20Reserve%20Forces%20Act%201907">Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907</a> which created the force, though not without compromise. His plan to give civic, business and trade union leaders a major role in running the County Territorial Associations was significantly reduced in the face of opposition to civilian encroachment in military affairs. Instead, the associations were chaired by <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant">Lord Lieutenant</a>s and run by traditional county military elites. Militia representatives refused to accept Haldane's plans to allocate a proportion of the militia as a reserve for the regular army and incorporate the remainder into the Territorial Force. After three attempts to persuade them, Haldane abolished the militia and created the <a href="Special%20Reserve">Special Reserve</a>.

Crucially, Haldane's efforts were based on the premise that home defence rested with the navy and that the imperative for army reform was to provide an expeditionary capability. His reorganisation of the regular army created a six-division Expeditionary Force, and his plan was for the Territorial Force to reinforce it after six months of training following mobilisation. Representatives of the existing auxiliary forces and elements within the Liberal party opposed any foreign service obligation. To ensure their support, Haldane declared the Territorial Force's purpose to be home defence when he introduced his reforms in Parliament, despite having stressed an overseas role eight days previously. The last-minute change caused significant difficulties for the force throughout its existence.

The Territorial Force was established on 1 April 1908 by the amalgamation of the Volunteer Force and the yeomanry. The Volunteer Force battalions became the infantry component of the Territorial Force and were more closely integrated into regular army regimental establishments they had previously been linked to; for example, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Volunteer Battalions of the regular army's <a href="Gloucestershire%20Regiment">Gloucestershire Regiment</a> became the regiment's 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions (Territorial Force). The infantry was organised into 14 territorial <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisions</a>, each of three <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s. The yeomanry regiments became the mounted component of the Territorial Force, organised into 14 mounted brigades. Brigades and divisions were equipped with integral supporting arms along regular army lines, comprising territorial units of artillery (totalling 182 <a href="Horse%20artillery">horse</a> and <a href="Field%20artillery">field</a> batteries), engineers and signals, along with supply, medical and veterinary services. Each territorial unit was assigned a specific role either in coastal defence, supplementing 81 territorial companies of the <a href="Royal%20Garrison%20Artillery">Royal Garrison Artillery</a> manning fixed defences, or as part of the mobile <a href="Central%20Force">Central Force</a>. Training was managed by a permanent staff of regular army personnel attached to territorial units.

Recruits to the Territorial Force had to be aged between 17 and 35. They enlisted for a four-year term which could be extended by an obligatory year in times of crisis. Members could terminate their enlistment on three months' notice and payment of a fine. Recruits were required to attend a minimum of 40 drill periods in their first year and 20 per year thereafter. All members were required to attend between eight and fifteen days of annual camp. The force was liable to serve anywhere in the UK. Members were not required to serve overseas but could volunteer to do so. Haldane, who still regarded the force's primary function to be the expansion of the Expeditionary Force, hoped that up to a quarter of all territorials would volunteer on <a href="mobilisation">mobilisation</a>. The Imperial Service Obligation was introduced in 1910 to allow territorials to volunteer in advance. It was illegal to amalgamate or disband territorial units or transfer members between them.

The reforms were not received well by the auxiliaries. The exclusion of the militia rendered Haldane's target of just over 314,000 officers and men for the Territorial Force unattainable. The new terms of service imposed an increased commitment on members compared to that demanded by the previous auxiliary institutions. By 1 June 1908, the force had attracted less than 145,000 recruits. Despite considerable efforts to promote the new organisation to the former auxiliary institutions, less than 40 per cent of all existing auxiliaries transferred into it. The County Territorial Associations emphasised pride in a local territorial identity in their efforts to recruit new members, and used imagery of local scenes under attack to encourage enlistment. In general, the force attracted recruits from the working class, though they were mainly <a href="artisan">artisan</a>s rather than the unskilled labourers who filled the ranks of the regular army. In some units, middle and working classes served together. Units which recruited from the more affluent urban centres contained a significant proportion of well-educated <a href="white-collar%20worker">white-collar worker</a>s. Territorial officers were predominantly middle class, meaning that in some units there was little to separate officers from other ranks in terms of social status.
Territorial officers were regarded as social inferiors by the regular army's more privileged officer corps. The territorials' relatively narrow social spectrum resulted in a less formal system of self-discipline than the rigid, hierarchical discipline of the regular army, feeding a professional prejudice against the amateur auxiliary. The regular army had no more faith in the territorials' abilities than it had in those of the force's predecessors. The force's standards of training and musketry were suspect, and the reputation of the territorial artillery was so poor that there were calls for it to be disbanded. Regular officers, fearing for their career prospects, often resisted postings as territorial <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>s. The <a href="Army%20Council%20%281904%29">Army Council</a> predicted that, even after six months of intensive training on mobilisation, the force would not reach a standard at which two territorial divisions could be considered the equal of one regular division as planned. In 1908 and 1914, it was decided that two of the army's six expeditionary divisions should be retained in the UK for home defence, so ineffective was the Territorial Force perceived to be in the role it was created to perform.

In 1910, <a href="Reginald%20Brett%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Esher">Lord Esher</a>, pro-conscription chairman of the London County Territorial Association, wrote in the "<a href="National%20Review%20%28London%29">National Review</a>" that the country would have to choose between an under-strength voluntary auxiliary and compulsory service. In his opinion, the Territorial Force was the last chance for the volunteer tradition, and its failure would pave the way for conscription. Advocacy for compulsory service was led by the <a href="National%20Service%20League">National Service League</a> (NSL), which regarded reliance on a naval defence against invasion as complacent and a strong home army as essential. A bill sponsored by the NSL in 1909 proposed using the Territorial Force as the framework for a conscripted home army. When that failed, the league became increasingly antagonistic towards the auxiliary. The force was denigrated for its excessive youth, inefficiency and consistently low numbers, and ridiculed in the popular press as the "Territorial Farce". The NSL's president – the former <a href="Commander-in-Chief%20of%20the%20Forces">Commander-in-Chief of the Forces</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Roberts%2C%201st%20Earl%20Roberts">Lord Roberts</a> – enlisted the support of serving officers in a campaign against it, and in 1913 the Army Council declared its support for conscription. Even prominent members of the force itself favoured compulsory service, and by April 1913 ten County Territorial Associations had expressed support for it.

The relationship between the County Territorial Associations and the War Office was often acrimonious. The associations frequently complained about excessive bureaucracy and inadequate finance. The military authorities begrudged the money that could have been spent on the regular army being wasted on what they perceived as an inefficient, amateur auxiliary. Efforts to provide adequate facilities, for example, were undermined by slow responses from the War Office which, when finally forthcoming, often rejected the associations' plans outright or refused to allocate the full financing requested. In 1909, the <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> association complained that "most of our association are businessmen and are unable to understand why it takes ten weeks and upwards to reply" after waiting for a response to its proposed purchase of a site for a field ambulance unit. <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> lost three sites for a proposed new drill hall because the War Office took so long to approve plans, and <a href="Essex">Essex</a> had to wait five years before it received approval for the construction of new rifle <a href="Shooting%20range">ranges</a>. Good facilities were regarded by the associations as important for efficiency, unit "<a href="esprit%20de%20corps">esprit de corps</a>" and recruitment, and the authorities' parsimony and apparent obstruction was seen as undermining these.

The force failed to retain large numbers of men after their initial enlistment expired, and it consistently fell short of its established strength. It reached a peak of 268,000 men in 1909 when invasion scares prompted a surge in recruitment, but by 1913 numbers had declined to less than 246,000, and the officer corps was nearly 20 per cent under-subscribed. In 1910, a third of the force had not completed the minimum level of musketry training. Only 155,000 territorials completed the full 15-day annual camp in 1912, and around 6,000 did not attend at all. In 1909, some 37 per cent of the rank and file were under 20 years old; in the opinion of the <a href="Inspector-General%20of%20the%20Forces">Inspector-General of the Home Forces</a>, this proportion rendered the force too immature to be effective. In 1913, approximately 40,000 territorials were under 19 years old, the minimum age at which they could volunteer for service overseas. Barely seven per cent of the force had accepted the Imperial Service Obligation, seriously compromising its viability as a reinforcement for the Expeditionary Force. Because the military authorities regarded the Territorial Force as weak and saw no value in an auxiliary that was not liable for foreign service, they prioritised expenditure on the regular army, leaving the force armed with obsolete weapons.

On the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> by-passed the Territorial Force and, with the approval of the military authorities, raised instead a '<a href="Kitchener%27s%20Army">New Army</a>' of volunteers to expand the regular army. His decision was based not only on professional prejudice – he regarded the territorials as a joke, led by "middle-aged professional men who were allowed to put on uniform and play at soldiers" – but also on an appreciation of the constraints imposed by the force's constitution. He feared that the County Territorial Associations would be unable to cope with the task of recruiting and training large numbers. He also believed that because so few territorials had thus far volunteered for foreign service, the Territorial Force was better suited for home defence than as a means of expanding the army overseas.

At the end of July, territorial Special Service Sections began patrolling the east coast. On the day before the declaration of war, the <a href="167th%20%281st%20London%29%20Brigade">1st London Brigade</a> was dispersed by platoons to protect the rail network between London and Southampton. The remainder of the Territorial Force was mobilised on the evening of 4 August 1914, and war stations were quickly occupied by those units with bases located nearby. By 6 August, for example, units of the <a href="43rd%20%28Wessex%29%20Infantry%20Division">Wessex Division</a> were concentrated at Plymouth while those of the <a href="50th%20%28Northumbrian%29%20Division">Northumbrian Division</a> took up positions in the east coast defences, and the following day elements of the <a href="53rd%20%28Welsh%29%20Infantry%20Division">Welsh Division</a> were gathered in the area of <a href="Pembroke%20Dock">Pembroke Dock</a>. Some formations assembled close to their bases before moving on to their war stations. The <a href="51st%20%28Highland%29%20Division">Highland Division</a>, for example, gathered at various locations north of <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> before proceeding to <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a>, north of London. Defence duties resulted in some divisions being dispersed; a brigade of the <a href="49th%20%28West%20Riding%29%20Infantry%20Division">West Riding Division</a>, for example, was deployed to watch the east coast while the rest of the division guarded railways and munitions factories inland, and the brigades of the <a href="54th%20%28East%20Anglian%29%20Infantry%20Division">East Anglian Division</a> were widely scattered about <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>.

On 13 August 1914, Kitchener signalled a willingness to deploy overseas those territorial units in which 80 per cent of the men (reduced to 60 per cent at the end of the month) had accepted the Imperial Service Obligation. Despite the low uptake before the war, 72 per cent of the rank and file volunteered for foreign service by the end of September. The first full territorial divisions to be deployed overseas were used to free up imperial garrisons. The <a href="42nd%20%28East%20Lancashire%29%20Division">East Lancashire Division</a> was sent to Egypt in September, and three territorial divisions had been deployed to India by January 1915. Territorial battalions released regular troops stationed at Aden, <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, Gibraltar and <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. Five regular army divisions were created from the troops released by the territorials' deployments. The extent to which territorials accepted the obligation varied considerably between battalions; some registered 90 per cent or more acceptance, others less than 50 per cent. The difficulties were not restricted to the rank and file, and many battalions sailed for foreign service with officers who had been newly promoted or recruited to replace those who had chosen to remain at home.
The territorials faced difficulties as they trained up to operational standard. Some artillery units did not get an opportunity to practise with live ammunition until January 1915. Rifle practice suffered due to lack of rifles, practice ammunition and ranges on which to use them. Because there was insufficient transport, a motley collection of carts, private vehicles and lorries were pressed into service. The animals used to pull the non-motorised transport or mount the yeomanry ranged in pedigree from half-blind <a href="Pit%20pony">pit ponies</a> to show horses. The Territorial Force competed with the New Army for recruits, and the War Office prioritised the latter for training and equipment. Many of the regular army staff posted to territorial units were recalled to their parent regiments, and those professionals that still remained were transferred to territorial reserve units in January 1915. Training proved difficult for formations that were widely dispersed as part of their defence duties, and was complicated for all by the need to reorganise the territorial battalions' outdated eight-<a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> structure to the army's standard four-company battalion.

On 15 August, County Territorial Associations began raising second-line units to replace those scheduled for foreign service. The ranks of the second line were filled by those territorials who could not or did not accept the Imperial Service Obligation. In November, associations started raising third-line units to take over from the second-line units the responsibility for providing replacement drafts to territorial combat units. Territorial battalions were numbered according to line so that, for example, the three lines of the 6th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, became the 1/6th, 2/6th and 3/6th Battalions. In May 1915, territorial divisions were numbered in order of their deployment overseas; the East Lancashire Division, for example, became the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division.

Second-line units immediately assumed that the third line would take over their home-based duties, in the belief that second-line divisions would be deployed overseas. Many second-line battalions refused to take recruits who had not accepted the Imperial Service Obligation, a practice that was not officially sanctioned until March 1915 when the option to enlist only for home service was abolished. The deployment of second-line units overseas was officially endorsed in mid 1915. Until the third line was ready, the conflicting demands to supply drafts, defend the homeland and prepare for deployment caused problems for the second line. In May 1915, Kitchener informed the War Cabinet that the second line was so denuded of trained men as to render it unreliable for home defence. Only in 1916 could the War Office promise that the second line would no longer be trawled for replacements to be sent to the first line. By this time, second-line battalion establishments had been reduced to 400 men, less than half the number normally serving in an infantry battalion at full strength. It took on average 27 months to prepare a second-line formation for active service, compared to eight months for the first line, and the second line often lacked sufficient weapons and ammunition. The desire among the second-line commanders to maintain a level of training and efficiency in readiness for their own deployment led to friction with their first-line counterparts, who accused the second line of holding back the best men and sending sub-standard replacements to the first line.

When the regular army suffered high attrition during the opening battles in France, Kitchener came under pressure to make up the losses. With the New Army not yet ready, he was forced to fall back on the territorials. Despite the preference of General <a href="Ian%20Hamilton%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Ian Hamilton</a>, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces, for the Territorial Force to be deployed to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in complete brigades and divisions, it was deployed piecemeal. Because of the pressing need for troops, individual battalions were sent as soon as they reached a degree of efficiency and attached to regular brigades. There was little logic in the choice of units deployed. Some that had been positively assessed remained at home while less well prepared units were deployed, often without enough equipment and only after being hastily brought up to strength. The first territorial unit to arrive was the 1/14th Battalion (<a href="London%20Scottish%20%28regiment%29">London Scottish</a>), <a href="London%20Regiment%20%281908-1938%29">London Regiment</a>, in September 1914. By December, twenty-two infantry battalions, seven yeomanry regiments, and one medical and three engineer units had been sent.

Territorial battalions were initially allocated to <a href="line%20of%20communication">line-of-communication</a> duties for up to three weeks before being assigned to regular army brigades. From February 1915, with 48 infantry battalions in-country, they were sent directly to their host divisions. On arrival at the front, the territorials would spend several days in further training behind the lines before undergoing a period of trench acclimatisation. When the battalion was considered proficient, or when the pressure to relieve a regular unit became too severe, the territorials were allocated their own sector of the front. The time between arriving at brigade and taking over the trenches varied from between six days to one month.

The territorials were thrown into the defensive battles of the initial German offensive during the <a href="Race%20to%20the%20Sea">Race to the Sea</a>. Among the first to see action was the London Scottish, which suffered 640 casualties on 31 October 1914 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281914%29">Battle of Messines</a>. It was in action again during the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">First Battle of Ypres</a> in November, and was praised as a "glorious lead and example" to the rest of the Territorial Force by Field Marshal Sir <a href="John%20French%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Ypres">John French</a>, commander of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF). As the territorials completed their training and the threat of invasion receded, complete divisions were deployed to combat theatres. The first to depart was the <a href="46th%20%28North%20Midland%29%20Division">46th (North Midland) Division</a>, which arrived on the Western Front in March 1915. By July, all 14 first-line divisions had been deployed overseas.

The <a href="149th%20%28Northumberland%29%20Brigade">Northumberland Brigade</a> of the Northumbrian Division became the first territorial formation larger than a battalion to fight under its own command when it participated in an abortive counter-attack on 26 April 1915 during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a>. It suffered 1,954 casualties and earned a personal congratulation from French. The division had deployed only three days earlier; the rest of its units were attached piecemeal to other formations and immediately thrown into the desperate fighting, earning further praise from French for their tenacity and determination. Several other territorial battalions attached to regular army formations fought with distinction in the defence of Ypres, at the cost of heavy casualties. The three battalions of the <a href="Monmouthshire%20Regiment">Monmouthshire Regiment</a> were temporarily amalgamated into a single composite battalion, as were three battalions of the London Regiment. Battlefield amalgamations were a military necessity which threatened the legal protections on territorial unit integrity.

Although the territorials were proving their worth in defensive operations, the commanders of the regular formations to which they were attached still did not trust their abilities. The regulars regarded the primary function of the territorials to be the release of regular battalions for offensive operations. The territorials were employed in the construction and maintenance of trenches, and generally performed only supporting actions in the attacks at <a href="Battle%20of%20Neuve%20Chapelle">Neuve Chapelle</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Aubers%20Ridge">Aubers Ridge</a> in early 1915. An exception was the 1/13th Battalion (<a href="Kensington%20Regiment%20%28Princess%20Louise%27s%29">Kensington</a>), London Regiment. During the Battle of Aubers Ridge, the Kensingtons became the first territorial battalion to be deployed in the first wave of a major assault, and was the only battalion to achieve its objective on the day. But the Territorial Force had filled the gaps created in the regular army by the German offensive of 1914, and French wrote that it would have been impossible to halt the German advance without it.

The 51st (Highland) Division participated in an attack on 15 June 1915 in the Second Action of Givenchy, part of the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Artois">Second Battle of Artois</a>. The division had lost several of its original battalions to piecemeal deployment and had been brought up to strength only a month before it arrived in France, largely by the attachment of a brigade from the <a href="55th%20%28West%20Lancashire%29%20Infantry%20Division">55th (West Lancashire) Division</a>. It was the first experience in assault for the two battalions that spearheaded the division's attack. They succeeded in reaching the German second line of defences, but when the regular forces on their right did not the territorials were forced to retire with heavy losses. A professionally planned and executed assault by the <a href="47th%20%281/2nd%20London%29%20Division">47th (1/2nd London) Division</a> was one of the few successes in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Loos">Battle of Loos</a> on 25 September, but the 46th (North Midland) Division suffered 3,643 casualties in a failed assault against the <a href="Hohenzollern%20Redoubt">Hohenzollern Redoubt</a> on 13 October. To Lieutenant-General Sir <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Douglas Haig</a>, commander of the <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">First Army</a>, the 46th Division's failure demonstrated that "some territorial units still need training and discipline".
By the summer of 1915, six complete territorial divisions had been deployed to France. Many of the 52 territorial units still attached to regular army formations were returned to their own parent commands. This allowed the professionals to remove from their formations an element made awkward by its specific terms of service. The regulars found the territorials to be slow to move and recuperate, and better in static defence than attack. Nevertheless, the reshuffle indicated that the Territorial Force had exceeded the expectations of the military authorities, and the territorials' time with the regulars generally resulted in a strong camaraderie and mutual respect between the two. French reported in February 1915 the praise of his commanders for their territorials, who were "fast approaching, if they had not already reached, the standards of efficiency of the regular infantry".

There were eight first-line territorial divisions on the Western Front at the start of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a> on 1 July 1916. Two of them, the 46th (North Midland) Division and the <a href="56th%20%28London%29%20Infantry%20Division">56th (1/1st London) Division</a>, went into action on the first day in a disastrous <a href="attack%20on%20the%20Gommecourt%20Salient">attack on the Gommecourt Salient</a>, a diversionary operation conducted by the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Third Army</a>. Two more territorial divisions, the <a href="48th%20%28South%20Midland%29%20Division">48th (South Midland)</a> and the 49th (West Riding), were among the initial 25 divisions of the <a href="Fourth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Fourth Army</a> which bore the brunt of the fighting during the four and a half months of the Somme offensive. The 49th Division was committed piecemeal on the first day to the fighting around the <a href="Capture%20of%20Schwaben%20Redoubt">Schwaben Redoubt</a>, and two battalions of the 48th Division were attached to the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">4th Division</a> and participated in the first day's fighting. The 48th Division itself went into action on 16 July, and by the end of September the remaining four territorial divisions – the 47th (1/2nd London), 50th (Northumbrian), 51st (Highland) and 55th (West Lancashire) – had relieved battle-weary units and gone into action.
Although the 46th Division's poor performance at Gommecourt cemented a perception that it was a failed unit and the 49th Division's standing was little better, the territorials generally emerged from the Somme with enhanced reputations. This was echoed by Brigadier-General C. B. Prowse, a brigade commander in the 4th Division, who commented, "I did not before think much of the territorials, but by God they can fight". The Battle of the Somme marked the high point of the Territorial Force as a recognisable entity distinct from the regular and New Army forces. It suffered some 84,000 casualties during the offensive, and the indiscriminate replacement of these with recruits who had been conscripted into the army rather than volunteering specifically for the Territorial Force marked the beginning of the end for the territorial identity.

Fourteen second-line divisions were formed during the war, eight of which were deployed overseas. The first to fight in a major battle was the <a href="61st%20%282nd%20South%20Midland%29%20Division">61st (2nd South Midland) Division</a>. Its constituent units were raised in September and October 1914, and their training was indicative of the difficulties faced by the second line in general. New recruits paraded without uniforms until October and lived at home until the division assembled in January 1915. The infantry was equipped with old Japanese <a href="Arisaka">Arisaka</a> rifles, antique <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim</a> machine-guns and dummy <a href="Lewis%20gun">Lewis gun</a>s constructed from wood. The divisional artillery, having initially drilled with cart-mounted logs, was equipped first with obsolete French <a href="De%20Bange%2090%20mm%20cannon">90 mm cannons</a>, then with outdated <a href="Ordnance%20BLC%2015-pounder">15-pounder guns</a> and <a href="BL%205-inch%20howitzer">5-inch howitzers</a> handed down from the first line. The division was not issued with modern weapons until it began intensive training in March 1916, in preparation for its deployment to France at the end of May. Battalion strengths fluctuated throughout training as men were drafted to first-line units. The division was still only at two-thirds strength when it attacked at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fromelles">Battle of Fromelles</a> in July 1916 alongside the <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">Australian 5th Division</a>. The heavy casualties suffered by the Australians were blamed on the failure of the territorials' assaulting battalions to take a key position.

By August 1915, four territorial infantry divisions and a yeomanry mounted division, deployed without its horses as infantry, had reinforced British Empire forces engaged in the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>. Their landings were chaotic; the <a href="125th%20%28Lancashire%20Fusiliers%29%20Brigade">125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade</a>, for example, landed nearly a week before the other two brigades of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. The infantry were rushed into battle without any opportunity to acclimatise, and the 54th (East Anglian) Division did not receive any formal instruction about the nature of the campaign for the first four weeks of its participation in it. Some battalions of the 53rd (Welsh) Division were second-line units and had still been supplying replacement drafts to first-line units, and the division was given only two weeks notice that it was to go to Gallipoli.

The 42nd Division impressed the regulars with its spirit in the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Krithia">Third Battle of Krithia</a> on 4 June. The <a href="155th%20%28South%20Scottish%29%20Brigade">155th (South Scottish) Brigade</a> of the <a href="52nd%20%28Lowland%29%20Infantry%20Division">52nd (Lowland) Division</a> assaulted with such determination in July that it overran its objective and came under fire from French allies. The <a href="156th%20%28Scottish%20Rifles%29%20Brigade">156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade</a> suffered over 50 per cent casualties in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gully%20Ravine">Battle of Gully Ravine</a> on 28 June, and a battalion of the 54th Division was slaughtered when it advanced too far during an attack on 12 August. The same month, the yeomen of the <a href="2nd%20Mounted%20Division">2nd Mounted Division</a> suffered 30 per cent casualties during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Scimitar%20Hill">Battle of Scimitar Hill</a>, and had to be relieved by six dismounted yeomanry brigades which landed in October.

The campaign ended in withdrawal in January 1916. Although Hamilton, appointed to command the <a href="Mediterranean%20Expeditionary%20Force">Mediterranean Expeditionary Force</a> in March 1915, praised the courage of the territorials, he criticised the performance of the 53rd and 54th Divisions. His comments failed to recognise the difficulties the two divisions had faced with the loss of many of their trained men transferred to other units before their arrival at Gallipoli. Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Da Costa, <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">GSO1</a> of the 54th Division, refuted accusations by Lieutenant-General Sir <a href="Frederick%20Stopford">Frederick Stopford</a>, commander of <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">IX Corps</a>, that the division lacked attacking spirit and was badly led. Da Costa claimed that its poor performance was entirely due to the way it had been "chucked ashore" and thrown into a poorly-coordinated and ill-defined attack.

Following a successful British defence of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>, the <a href="Egyptian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Egyptian Expeditionary Force</a> (EEF) was formed in March 1916 and went over to the offensive against German and <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> forces in the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a>. The EEF comprised forces from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and India, and the British contribution was predominantly territorial. Most of the infantry was provided by the four territorial divisions that had fought at Gallipoli. When the 42nd Division was transferred to France in March 1917, it was replaced in July by the second-line <a href="60th%20%282/2nd%20London%29%20Division">60th (2/2nd London) Division</a>. The latter, having already fought during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Doiran%20%281917%29">Battle of Doiran</a> in <a href="Macedonian%20Front">Salonika</a>, played a key role in the capture of Jerusalem on 9 December.

The yeomanry provided 18 dismounted regiments which fought as infantry and, in 1917, were formed into the <a href="74th%20%28Yeomanry%29%20Division">74th (Yeomanry) Division</a>. This division was transferred to France in 1918 along with the 52nd (Lowland) Division. Five brigades of yeomanry fought in the mounted role, and in 1917 three of them were formed into the <a href="Yeomanry%20Mounted%20Division">Yeomanry Mounted Division</a>. The yeomanry mounted some of the last cavalry charges ever made by British forces; the <a href="Charge%20at%20Huj">Charge at Huj</a> on 8 November 1917 by the 1/1st <a href="Warwickshire%20Yeomanry">Warwickshire Yeomanry</a> and 1/1st <a href="Queen%27s%20Own%20Worcestershire%20Hussars">Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars</a>, followed five days later with a charge by the 1/1st <a href="Royal%20Buckinghamshire%20Yeomanry">Royal Bucks Hussars</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mughar%20Ridge">Battle of Mughar Ridge</a>. By the end of a campaign in which the EEF had advanced across the Sinai, through Palestine, and into Syria, territorial casualties numbered over 32,000 – more than the 29,000 suffered by British regular, Australian, New Zealand and Indian forces combined.

The much maligned 46th (North Midland) Division redeemed itself in 1918 in a hazardous attack during the <a href="Battle%20of%20St%20Quentin%20Canal">Battle of St Quentin Canal</a>. The operation was successfully spearheaded by the <a href="Staffordshire%20Brigade">137th (Staffordshire) Brigade</a>, which included two battalions that were almost disbanded because of their alleged poor performance at Gommecourt two years earlier. The seven untested second-line divisions saw their first actions in 1917. They generally suffered, undeservedly, from poor reputations, although the <a href="58th%20%282/1st%20London%29%20Division">58th (2/1st London)</a> and <a href="62nd%20%282nd%20West%20Riding%29%20Division">62nd (2nd West Riding)</a> Divisions were well regarded by the war's end. The 51st (Highland) Division, whose men labelled themselves as 'duds' after a slow start, and the two London first-line divisions were among the best in the BEF by 1918. A reputation for dependability resulted in the 48th (South Midland) Division being transferred to <a href="Italian%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Italy</a> to relieve the regular <a href="7th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Infantry Division</a> in March 1918. Several territorial divisions overcame poor initial impressions to become effective, dependable formations by the end of the war. The 61st (2nd South Midland) Division, for example, blamed for the failure at Fromelles, was commended by Lieutenant-General <a href="Hubert%20Gough">Hubert Gough</a>, commander of the <a href="Fifth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Fifth Army</a>, as the best performing of his 11 front-line divisions in the initial onslaught of the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> in March 1918.

As the war progressed, Britain began to struggle with manpower shortages, prompting changes which affected the territorials. The <a href="63rd%20%282nd%20Northumbrian%29%20Division">63rd (2nd Northumbrian)</a> and <a href="65th%20%282nd%20Lowland%29%20Division">65th (2nd Lowland)</a> Divisions had already been disbanded in July 1916 and March 1917 respectively. The remaining four home-based divisions lost their territorial affiliation when they were reconstituted as part of the <a href="British%20Army%20First%20World%20War%20reserve%20brigades">Training Reserve</a> over the winter of 1917/1918. In early 1918, every brigade in the BEF was reduced from four to three battalions. The reductions targeted second-line and New Army units, and resulted in the amalgamation of 44 territorial battalions and the disbandment of a further 21. In July, the 50th (Northumbrian) Division was left with a single territorial battalion when it was reorganised following heavy losses during the Spring Offensive. Its other territorial battalions, having fought in most battles since the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, were reduced to a cadre or disbanded. All but one battalion in each brigade of the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 60th (2/2nd London) Division in Palestine were transferred to France and replaced with Indian battalions in 1916. The <a href="75th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">75th Division</a> was formed in Egypt in March 1917 with territorial units transferred from India, though it too was subsequently 'indianised'. Several territorial battalions from the 42nd (East Lancashire), 46th (North Midland) and <a href="59th%20%282nd%20North%20Midland%29%20Division">59th (2nd North Midland)</a> Divisions were reduced to training cadres, demobilised or disbanded shortly before the war's end. The apparent cull of territorial units added to the grievances harboured by the Territorial Force about its treatment by the military authorities.

Many territorial battalions had strong individual identities based on the geography of their recruitment. The ranks had been filled by men who, at least until direct voluntary recruitment into the Territorial Force ceased in December 1915, had chosen the force in preference to the new or regular armies. They had elected to join local regiments and been imbued with an "esprit de corps" during their training in those regiments' own second and later third lines. The strong sense of locality was reinforced by a shared civilian background – it was not uncommon for territorials to be employed in the same office, mill or factory – and many territorial memoirs betray a sense of family or club. A similar sentiment was exploited in raising the New Army <a href="pals%20battalion">pals battalion</a>s, but in the Territorial Force this was reinforced by a pedigree that New Army units did not possess; most territorial units could trace a lineage back to the early or mid 19th century through units of yeomanry or volunteers which had for generations been a part of local communities and social life.

In the first half of the war, territorial casualties were generally replaced with drafts from a battalion's own reserve. Although there were some cases of replacements being sourced from different regions or non-territorial units, in mid-1916 the ranks of the territorial units were still largely populated by men who had volunteered specifically for service as a territorial in their local regiment. The legal protections for this were stripped away by the Military Service Acts of 1916. These permitted the amalgamation and disbandment of units and the transfer of territorials between them, introduced conscription, and required territorials either to accept the Imperial Service Obligation or leave the force and become liable for conscription.

The last recruits to voluntarily enlist in a specific unit of the Territorial Force before the choice was removed, and who had trained in that unit's third line alongside neighbours and colleagues, had been drafted to their front-line units by May 1916. In September 1916, the regiment-based system for training New Army units was centralised into the Training Reserve. Separately, the 194 territorial third-line units were amalgamated into 87 Reserve Battalions. They retained responsibility for supplying replacements to the first- and second-line units, but when unable to do so, replacements were sent from the Training Reserve. The system was organised by region, so even if a battalion did not receive replacements from its own regiment they were generally sourced from an appropriate locality, but it did not guarantee unit integrity.
After the heavy losses sustained during the Somme offensive, dilution of the territorial identity accelerated because of the influx of replacements who had no territorial affiliation. Some units still maintained a regional identity; the 56th (1/1st London) Division, for example, retained its essentially London character despite the fact that the four battalions of its <a href="168th%20%282nd%20London%29%20Brigade">168th Brigade</a> received replacements from at least 26 different regiments during the battle. Others experienced substantial dilution by the end of the offensive; the 149th (Northumberland) Brigade, for example, received large numbers of replacements from East Anglia, <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>, London and the <a href="The%20Midlands">Midlands</a>. By March 1917, a significant proportion of the men in the second-line 61st (2nd South Midland) Division came from outside the <a href="South%20Midlands">South Midlands</a> due to the replacement of losses suffered at the Battle of Fromelles. By the end of the year, the same trend could be seen in the first-line 48th (South Midland) Division.

The indiscriminate replacement of casualties prompted rueful comments about the damage being done to the nature of the Territorial Force. The historian <a href="C.%20R.%20M.%20F.%20Cruttwell">C. R. M. F. Cruttwell</a>, serving with the 1/4th Battalion, <a href="Royal%20Berkshire%20Regiment">Royal Berkshire Regiment</a>, lamented that, by the end of 1916, the battalion had "lost its exclusive Berkshire character which, at the beginning of the war, had been its unique possession". For the 1/6th Battalion, <a href="West%20Yorkshire%20Regiment">West Yorkshire Regiment</a>, losses during the Battle of the Somme had damaged its "territorial influence". Criticisms of the drafting system were voiced in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, and territorial representatives expressed concern that the force's unique character was being lost. Military authorities stated their desire to replenish units with replacements from the same regiment or regimental district, but stressed that the Military Service Acts had removed any obligation to do so and that military expediency sometimes necessitated not doing so.

As the availability of men of military age dwindled, it became increasingly difficult to source replacements from some sparsely populated regions. The largely rurally recruited 48th (South Midland) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions became increasingly diluted as the war progressed, while the more urbanised recruitment areas of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division allowed it to remain essentially a <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> formation throughout. By the war's end, very few battalions still retained more than a handful of men who had embarked with them at the start of the war. The territorial units that fought in 1917 and 1918, subject to the same system of replacements as the rest of the British land forces, bore little resemblance beyond a geographic origin to those that had sailed in 1914 and 1915. By 1918, there was little to differentiate between regular, territorial and New Army divisions.

Failure to guarantee the integrity of its units was the most contentious of several grievances felt by the territorials against what they perceived as a hostile and patronising attitude from the military authorities. Territorial officers and specialists such as doctors, vets, drivers, cooks and dispatch riders received less pay than their counterparts in New Army and regular units. Officers were considered junior to their regular counterparts of the same rank, leading some to remove the 'T' insignia from their uniforms as a badge of inferiority, and commanders of second-line brigades and third-line battalions were a rank lower than their regular counterparts. Although the Territorial Force provided many officers for the regular army, very few were appointed to higher commands, despite pre-war promises by Haldane that they would be. In 1918, government efforts to defend the military record on senior territorial promotions failed to acknowledge that most were temporary and in home units. <a href="Ian%20Macpherson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Strathcarron">Ian Macpherson</a>, Under-Secretary of State for War, conceded that just ten territorial officers commanded brigades and only three had been promoted to highest grade of General Staff Officer. The territorials received scant recognition for their early enthusiasm. The Army Council refused to grant any special decorations for those who had accepted the Imperial Service Obligation before the war. The <a href="Territorial%20War%20Medal">Territorial War Medal</a>, awarded to those who had volunteered for service overseas in the first months of the war, was denied to volunteers who had been held back even though they rendered invaluable service training the rest of the army. Those who served in India received no campaign medal.

The three territorial divisions sent to India in 1914 felt penalised by their early readiness. The men were placed on lower, peacetime rates of pay; gunners had to purchase equipment that should have been issued; officers attending courses were not fully reimbursed for their hotel expenses; and <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s promoted after arrival had to protest before they received the pay increase to which they were entitled. The divisions were still stationed there at the war's end, despite promises made by Kitchener that they would be redeployed to France within a year. Indications that they would be the first to be demobilised proved false when the outbreak of the <a href="Third%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Third Anglo-Afghan War</a> forced the government to retain some territorial units in India until 1920. The poor treatment of the territorials in India resulted in low support across south-west England and the <a href="home%20counties">home counties</a>, the regions from which the three divisions were recruited, when the Territorial Force was reconstituted after the war.

The County Territorial Associations experienced a steady erosion of responsibilities as the war progressed. Although disappointed by Kitchener's decision to bypass the Territorial Force, the associations assisted in recruiting the New Army alongside their own work raising and equipping territorial units. The <a href="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a>, Denbighshire and <a href="East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">East Riding</a> associations, for example, together raised 11 New Army units in December 1914. The associations performed remarkably well in equipping their units, despite the fact that the War Office prioritised New Army units and, in the case of the <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a> associations, threatened to penalise manufacturers who dealt with any institution other than the War Office. The competitive nature of the system led to supply according to highest bidder rather than military necessity and, in consequence, inflated prices. As a result, the territorials were relieved of responsibility for the purchase and supply of equipment in favour of a centralised system in May 1915.

In December 1915, direct recruitment into the Territorial Force ceased. The next year, the associations were rendered largely superfluous when administration of several territorial services, including the second- and third-line units and <a href="Home%20Service%20Battalions">Home Service Battalions</a>, was taken from them. In March 1917, many territorial depots were shut down as a result of War Office centralisation, and later the same year territorial records offices were closed. The Council of County Territorial Associations met in September to discuss the loss of responsibilities and the apparent erosion of the Territorial Force. A delegation in October to <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a>, Secretary of State for War, resulted only in the associations being given responsibility for the <a href="Volunteer%20Training%20Corps">Volunteer Training Corps</a> (VTC). Regarded as a poor substitute for the Territorial Force, the VTC was recruited from those not eligible for active service, mainly due to age. It was widely denigrated as "Grandpa's Regiment" and "George's Wrecks", from the armbands inscribed with the letters "GR" (for "Georgius Rex"), which was all the uniform the government was initially willing to provide them with.

Between August 1914 and December 1915, the Territorial Force had attracted nearly 726,000 recruits, approximately half the number that had volunteered for the New Army over the same period. It had raised 692 battalions by the war's end, compared with 267 regular or reserve battalions and 557 New Army battalions. The force deployed 318 battalions overseas, compared to the New Army's 404, and fielded 23 infantry and two mounted divisions on foreign soil, compared to the New Army's 30 infantry divisions. Seventy-one awards of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, Britain's highest award for valour, were made to territorial soldiers, including two of only three <a href="Medal%20bar">bars</a> ever awarded. The territorials had suffered some 577,000 casualties in the period 1914–1920. Compromised in conception and ridiculed in peacetime, the Territorial Force had filled the gap between what was effectively the destruction of the regular army in the opening campaigns of the war and the arrival of the New Armies in 1915.

Demobilisation of the Territorial Force commenced in December 1918, and the debate about its reconstitution was begun. The service rendered by the force during the war and the considerable political influence it possessed ensured its survival, but there was an extended discussion about what role it should play. In the absence of any invasion threat, there was no requirement to maintain a significant force for home defence, and a part-time body of volunteers could have no place in the imperial garrison. With conscription established as the means of expanding the regular army in a major conflict, which the <a href="Ten%20Year%20Rule">Ten Year Rule</a> anyway regarded as unlikely, there was no need to maintain a body of volunteers for this role. The only purpose military authorities could find for the Territorial Force was the provision of drafts to reinforce the army in medium-scale conflicts within the empire. Accordingly, the War Office recommended in March 1919 that the force should be liable for service overseas and receive no guarantees about unit integrity.

<a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, the Secretary of State for War responsible for reconstituting the force, considered a mandatory imperial obligation unfair and resisted its imposition. The territorial representatives recognised the necessity of such an obligation, but opposed the force being used simply as a reserve of manpower for the army, rather than operating as a second line in its own brigades and divisions as Haldane had intended. Territorial support for the imperial obligation eventually persuaded Churchill to accept it, and concerns about unit integrity were allayed by "The Pledge", Churchill's promise that the force would be deployed as complete units and fight in its own formations. The final sticking point was resolved by the resurrection of the militia to provide reinforcement drafts to the regular army.

Another issue was military aid to the civil power during the industrial unrest that followed the war. The thinly-stretched army was reluctant to become involved, so Churchill proposed using the territorials. Concerns that the force would be deployed to break strikes adversely affected recruitment, which had recommenced on 1 February 1920, resulting in promises that the force would not be so used. The government nevertheless deployed the Territorial Force in all but name during the miner's strike of April 1921 by the hasty establishment of the Defence Force. The new organisation relied heavily on territorial facilities and personnel, and its units were given territorial designations. Territorials were specially invited to enlist. Although those that did were required to resign from the Territorial Force, their service in the Defence Force counted towards their territorial obligations, and they were automatically re-admitted to the Territorial Force once their service in the Defence Force was completed.

The Territorial Force was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the <a href="Territorial%20Army%20and%20Militia%20Act%201921">Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921</a> and renamed in October as the <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a>. The difficulties posed in the war by an auxiliary that maintained a separate identity from the regular army were still enshrined in the reconstituted auxiliary. They were finally addressed by the Armed Forces (Conditions of Service) Act, passed on the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> in September 1939. Restrictions on territorial terms of service and transfer between units were removed, and territorial status was suspended for the duration. The next war would be fought from the start by a single, integrated army.

Since its release, "Echoes" has received several video game industry awards, as well as spots on "top games" lists by Nintendo Power and IGN. Over 800,000 copies of the game were sold worldwide. In 2009, an enhanced version was released for <a href="Wii">Wii</a> as a standalone game in Japan and as part of "" internationally.

"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes" is an <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> in which the player controls the protagonist <a href="Samus%20Aran">Samus Aran</a> from a <a href="First%20person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> perspective, and it takes place in an <a href="Linearity%20%28video%20games%29">open-ended</a> world with interconnected regions. Gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets, <a href="Platform%20game">platform jumping</a>, and shooting enemies. Progress through the game requires both dimensions to be explored, using <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s that Samus acquires over time. Equipment players collect include the Screw Attack, which allows Samus to somersault in midair and <a href="Wall%20jump">off certain surfaces</a>, and new <a href="Directed-energy%20weapon">beam weapons</a> that have limited ammunition.

The game's <a href="head-up%20display">head-up display</a> simulates the inside of Samus's helmet and features a radar, map, missile ammunition meter and health meter. Several visors are available, and each performs a different function. One, also seen in the previous game, is a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses, interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators and retrieves text entries from certain sources. The others reveal and highlight interdimensional objects or cloaked enemies, and create a <a href="Sonar">visual representation of sound</a>.

"Echoes" feature two <a href="Parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">parallel dimensions</a>, Light Aether and Dark Aether, where changes in either dimension often reflect changes in the other. Although the maps in both dimensions have the same general layout, rooms often vary in their designs, creatures, and objects. Dark Aether's atmosphere is caustic and damages Samus's <a href="Powered%20exoskeleton">Power Suit</a>, requiring the player to move between designated "safe zones" that allow Samus's <a href="Health%20%28game%20mechanism%29">health</a> to be regained slowly. Safe zones are either permanent, or need to be activated by firing certain beam weapons at <a href="Force%20field%20%28science%20fiction%29">force field</a> generators. Power Suit upgrades can reduce or nullify damage caused by the atmosphere.

"Echoes" also features a <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> mode that allows up to four players to engage in combat using a <a href="Split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">split screen</a>. It has six arenas and two modes: <a href="Deathmatch%20%28gaming%29">Deathmatch</a>, in which players attempt to kill their opponents as many times as possible within a set amount of time; and Bounty, which focuses on collecting coins that injured characters drop. Multiplayer in "Echoes" features the same control scheme as the single-player mode, including the lock-on system for <a href="circle%20strafing">circle strafing</a> while targeting.

"Echoes" takes place on a <a href="rogue%20planet">rogue planet</a> in the Dasha region, Aether, inhabited by a race known as the Luminoth. The Luminoth lived peacefully, protecting the planet's pure natural energy, which they call the "Light of Aether". Five decades before the game's events, a <a href="Metroid%20%28series%29%23Antagonists">Phazon</a> meteor collides into the planet and leaves a scar causing environmental damage and splitting the planetary energy. The split creates another planet in an alternate dimension, Dark Aether, a mirror version of Aether that is dark, arid, and has a poisonous atmosphere. Dark Aether becomes home to the Ing, cruel shapeshifting creatures who intend to destroy the Luminoth, and are able to possess bodies of the living, the dead, and the <a href="Artificial%20intelligence">artificially intelligent</a>. Eventually, the Ing and the Luminoth engage in a war over the planet's energywhichever race controls it is capable of destroying the other.

Around this time, Space Pirates set up a base on Aether after detecting the <a href="mutagenic">mutagenic</a> substance Phazon on the planet. A Galactic Federation Marine Corps patrol ship encounters one of the Pirates' supply ships leaving the planet and an altercation follows. Both ships suffer heavy damage, and after the Federation loses contact with the Marines, they call the bounty hunter <a href="Samus%20Aran">Samus Aran</a> to investigate.

While looking for the Marines near Aether, Samus's ship is damaged by severe lightning storms from the planet. Said storms have caused <a href="electromagnetic%20interference">electromagnetic interference</a> that prevented the Marines from communicating with the Federation. Samus finds the troops dead and surrounded by hive creatures called Splinters. The deceased Marines suddenly rise and attack her, apparently possessed, and she fights them off. Samus then encounters her evil <a href="doppelg%C3%A4nger">doppelgänger</a>, <a href="Dark%20Samus">Dark Samus</a>, for the first time, and after a small skirmish Dark Samus jumps through a portal. Samus decides to follow her through it and ends up on Dark Aether, a vile trans-dimensional duplicate of Aether, where she is attacked by a group of dark creatures called Ing, who capture Samus and after stealing the weapons from her suit throw her back through the portal.

Upon returning to Aether, Samus learns that the Marines were attacked and killed by Ing-possessed Splinters, and decides to enter a nearby alien temple structure to look for clues. When she reaches the structure, she meets U-Mos, the last remaining sentinel of the Luminoth, an alien race that have fought against the Ing for decades. They are now on the verge of defeat. He tells Samus that after a meteor struck Aether, the impact was so devastating, it created "Dark Aether", from which the Ing spawned. He also tells Samus that the Ing have taken virtually all of the 'Light of Aether', the entire collective planetary energy for Aether that keeps the planet stable, and begs her to retrieve it, for if either world gains all this energy, the other will perish.

Samus goes to three regionsthe Agon Wastes, a parched, rocky, desert wasteland region; Torvus Bog, a drenched swamp area that houses a partially submerged hydrosubstation; and the Sanctuary Fortress, a highly advanced cliffside fortress built by the Luminoth filled with corrupted robots that serves as the Ing hive in Dark Aetherto retrieve the Light of Aether and return it to the Luminoth temples. Samus fights Space Pirates, Dark Samus, and monstrous Ing guardians on her mission. After Samus retrieves three pieces of the Light of Aether, she enters the Ing's Sky Temple and faces the Emperor Ing, the strongest Ing who guards the remaining Light of Aether. Samus defeats the creature and retrieves the last remaining energy, causing Dark Aether to become critically unstable and collapse; however, her path out of the temple is blocked by a horribly altered and unstable Dark Samus. After defeating her foe, Samus escapes as the dark world disappears around her.

Returning to U-Mos, Samus finds that the Luminoth were in a state of hibernation but have now awakened. After a brief celebration, Samus leaves Aether in her repaired gunship. If the player completes the game with all of the items obtained, Dark Samus is shown reforming herself above Aether.

After the critical and commercial success of "Metroid Prime", Nintendo asked Retro Studios to produce a sequel. The developers decided against recycling the features of the first game, and instead used new sound models, weapon effects, and art designs. They also implemented the Screw Attack and wall jumping features seen in previous "Metroid" games, which were not incorporated in the first "Prime" due to time constraints. Another element considered for the previous game was the multiplayer component. Since the game was a first-person adventure and its deathmatch mode could not easily replicate other shooters in the market, Retro just tried to "make a multiplayer experience that fans of Metroid games would instantly know and recognise".

The staff opted for a more immersive storyline, with increased use of <a href="cut%20scene">cut scene</a>s and a plot that focused less on the Space Pirates and Metroids that permeate the rest of the series. Retro decided that the game would follow a theme of light and dark, which originated from "something that everyone understands: the conflict between good and evil". Mike Wikan, the game's senior designer, elaborated on the theme: "We wanted a push and pull, the whole game is pushing and pulling you back and forth between the dark and the light. It ended up being that we wanted something that would feed into that dichotomy, that conflict between the two, and how the player's basic abilities reflect that." The developers asked the producers of "", another Nintendo game, for advice because the game also used the theme of parallel worlds.

In developing Dark Samus, Retro wanted to create a character that was similar to Samus and be the same size, as opposed to the enormous monsters of "Metroid Prime". One of the inspirations for the character was a boss battle in "", where Samus fights a mirror image of herself. The developers considered Dark Samus a "natural choice" for the game because it fit in well with the "dramatic feel of dark and light".

Retro decided to make the game more challenging than "Metroid Prime"—which was supposed to familiarize players with the control scheme—and felt that "with the second "Prime", we had the ability or the freedom" to do so. They wanted "Echoes" to be focused towards a <a href="hardcore%20gamers">hardcore</a> audience by making the player "always worried about his health", so more <a href="Boss%20%28video%20games%29">mini-bosses</a> were added to provide unique boss fights. After the game's release, the developers admitted that it was more difficult to develop than they first imagined, and Michael Kelbaugh, Retro Studios' president, commented: "We wanted to expand and add to the title, and not just slam out a sequel. Nintendo doesn't do things that way." Retro tried to include some extras, such as a hidden version of "<a href="Super%20Metroid">Super Metroid</a>", but were halted by the short development time. Producer Kensuke Tanabe later revealed that the game was just about thirty percent complete three months before the strict deadline Nintendo had set for a release in the 2004 holiday season.

The music for "Metroid Prime 2: Echoes" was composed by <a href="Kenji%20Yamamoto%20%28composer%20born%201964%29">Kenji Yamamoto</a>. The themes used for areas on Dark Aether are dark variations of the themes used for the same areas on Light Aether. Some <a href="remix">remix</a>es of music from the previous "Metroid" games were also used, with the escape theme being a remix of "<a href="Metroid">Metroid</a>"s "Escape" theme, the "Hunters" multiplayer theme taking on "Super Metroid"s "Upper Brinstar" theme, and the theme for the underwater Torvus region, the "Lower Brinstar" theme from the same game.

"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes" was originally released for the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> in North America on November 15, 2004, Europe on November 26, and in Australia on December 2. The <a href="PAL">PAL</a> version of "Echoes" have lacked the standard 50 Hz mode, and offered 60 Hz mode only. In Japan, it was later released on May 26, 2005, titled "Metroid Prime 2: Dark Echoes".

Nintendo launched several websites to initiate a <a href="viral%20marketing">viral marketing</a> campaign for "Echoes", with inspiration drawn from "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>"s <a href="alternate%20reality%20game">alternate reality game</a> "<a href="I%20Love%20Bees">I Love Bees</a>". The websites included Luminoth Temple, an <a href="Internet%20forum">Internet forum</a>; Channel 51, a <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theory</a> website that featured <a href="Film%20grain">grainy</a> <a href="QuickTime">QuickTime</a> videos of "Metroid Prime 2" as if it were footage of extraterrestrials; Orbis Labs, which sold a "self-contained armored machine" called "Battle Sphere", similar to the Morph Ball; and Athena Astronautics, which advertised sending women into space, featured a <a href="blog">blog</a>, and offered job positions for <a href="bounty%20hunter">bounty hunter</a>s on <a href="Monster%20%28website%29">Monster.com</a>. Athena Astronautics gave a random selection of 25 people who replied to the offer an "interactive training manual", which was in fact a free copy of "Metroid Prime 2: Echoes".

A "Metroid"-related spoof of "I Love Bees" appeared online in October 2004, to which Nintendo reacted by stating that it was not involved with it. The campaign featured similarly named domain names such as ilovebeams.com, which each had an image of Samus with the caption: "<a href="All%20your%20base%20are%20belong%20to%20us">All your bees are belong to us</a>. Never send a man to do a woman's job."

"Echoes" was released in Japan in 2009 for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> console, as part of the "<a href="New%20Play%20Control%21">New Play Control!</a>" series. It has revamped controls that use the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a>'s pointing functionality, similar to those of "". The credit system from "Corruption" is also included to unlock the original bonus content, as well as the ability to take snapshots of gameplay. The difficulty of the boss battles in "Echoes" was also lowered. The Wii version of "Echoes" was later released in North America on August 24, 2009, as part of "", a <a href="video%20game%20compilation">single-disc compilation</a> that also includes "<a href="Metroid%20Prime">Metroid Prime</a>" and "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption". Both "Prime" and "Echoes" contain all of the enhancements found in their Japanese "New Play Control!" counterparts. The compilation was <a href="List%20of%20Wii%20games%20on%20Wii%20U%20eShop">re-released</a> on the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a>'s <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">Nintendo eShop</a> on January 29, 2015.

"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes" was critically acclaimed upon release. When comparing it to its predecessor, "Metroid Prime", <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Brad Shoemaker said that "Echoes" was as good as its predecessor, and delivered everything he expected. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s <a href="Matt%20Casamassina">Matt Casamassina</a> called the gameplay "superb" and "nearly flawless", and Vicious Sid of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" praised "Echoes" as "an extraordinary return to form". "Echoes" was considered one of the best single-player experiences on the GameCube by Kristan Reed of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>, who also considered the story to be "intricately designed and elaborately constructed into a coherent environment". GameSpot and IGN praised the campaign as a lengthy and rewarding adventure and appreciated the minimum 20 hours required to complete the game. The game was considered suitable for players of any age by "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>", which called "Echoes" essential for anyone who owned a GameCube. The theme's dynamics between dark and light was lauded by "GamePro", along with the "simple, quirky, and ridiculously addictive" multiplayer mode.

"Echoes"s graphics and design received significant praise; GameSpot considered it some of the best on the GameCube, and IGN called it "gorgeous" and "one of the prettiest GameCube titles". "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s Nick Gillett found the game entertaining and stated that its maps, terrain, and bestiary made the game an amazing epic space adventure. Bryn Williams from <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> complimented the game's controls and level design, commenting that the game was challenging but fair.

A major criticism of "Echoes" focused on the game's high difficulty, with "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" declaring that "not only are the boss fights unforgiving, the environment is sometimes difficult to follow". Some reviewers found it difficult to search for the Sky Temple keys. GameSpot criticized this mechanism and called it "a <a href="scavenger%20hunt">scavenger hunt</a> much tougher than the rest of the game", and <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> said that the only purpose it served was to artificially extend the game's length. The game's multiplayer mode was also considered unsatisfying. GameSpy called it a "secondary feature", "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>"s Jason Hill called it "bland and dull" and Eurogamer said that the single-player features did not translate well to that mode. "Game Informer" criticized the multiplayer mode because of its inclusion of the lock-on mechanism, considering it a feature that made multiplayer too simple.

IGN was critical of "Echoes" graphics and noted that the textures sometimes blurred when viewed up close, and the <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a> occasionally decreased. Publications including IGN and "The Independent" considered the gameplay too similar to "Metroid Prime", while "GamePro" was unhappy that the game did not have a customizable control scheme. "Computer and Video Games" and "The Age" were disappointed that "Echoes" was not as innovative in terms of gameplay as "Metroid Prime". "The Age" review also found the control scheme "unwieldy" and the difficulty "unforgiving". Serge Pennings of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" noted there were too few opportunities to save the game while playing, an aspect "<a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>" also criticized by saying that most of the game's difficulty was "because the save system is poorly implemented and downright cheap".

"Echoes" won an award in almost every category it was nominated for at the 2004 "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" Awards, and won awards for Best GameCube Game of 2004 from IGN, "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>", and GameSpy. It was rated the 174th best game made on a Nintendo system in "Nintendo Power"s Top 200 Games list, the 74th best game by <a href="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> users, the 15th best GameCube game by IGN, and the 13th best by GameSpy.

"Echoes" sold 470,000 copies in North America in December 2004. It was the ninth best-selling game in its debut month in Japan with 16,105 copies sold, ranking it behind "<a href="Yu%20Yu%20Hakusho%20Forever">Yu Yu Hakusho Forever</a>" and "". By August 2009, 800,000 copies had sold worldwide.

Mark Satin

Mark Ivor Satin (born November 16, 1946) is an American political theorist, author, and newsletter publisher. He is best known for contributing to the development and dissemination of three political perspectives – <a href="Nonviolence">neopacifism</a> in the 1960s, <a href="New%20Age%23Politics">New Age politics</a> in the 1970s and 1980s, and <a href="radical%20centrism">radical centrism</a> in the 1990s and 2000s. Satin's work is sometimes seen as building toward a new political ideology, and then it is often labeled "transformational", "post-liberal", or "post-Marxist". One historian calls Satin's writing "post-hip".

After emigrating to Canada at the age of 20 to avoid serving in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, Satin co-founded the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme, which helped bring American war resisters to Canada. He also wrote the "Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada" (1968), which sold nearly 100,000 copies. After a period that author <a href="Marilyn%20Ferguson">Marilyn Ferguson</a> describes as Satin's "anti-ambition experiment", Satin wrote "New Age Politics" (1978), which identifies an emergent "third force" in North America pursuing such goals as <a href="simple%20living">simple living</a>, decentralism, and global responsibility. Satin spread his ideas by co-founding an American political organization, the <a href="New%20World%20Alliance">New World Alliance</a>, and by publishing an international political newsletter, "New Options". He also co-drafted the foundational statement of the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Green Party</a>, "Ten Key Values".

Following a period of political disillusion, spent mainly in law school and practicing business law, Satin launched a new political newsletter and wrote a book, "Radical Middle" (2004). Both projects criticized political partisanship and sought to promote mutual learning and innovative policy syntheses across social and cultural divides. In an interview, Satin contrasts the old radical slogan "Dare to struggle, dare to win" with his radical-middle version, "Dare to synthesize, dare to take it all in".

Satin has been described as "colorful" and "intense", and all his initiatives have been controversial. Bringing war resisters to Canada was opposed by many in the anti-Vietnam War movement. "New Age Politics" was not welcomed by many on the traditional left or right, and "Radical Middle" dismayed an even broader segment of the American political community. Even Satin's personal life has generated controversy.

Many mid-1960s American <a href="Left-wing%20politics">radicals</a> came from small cities in the Midwest and Southwest, as did Satin: he grew up in <a href="Moorhead%2C%20Minnesota">Moorhead, Minnesota</a>, and <a href="Wichita%20Falls%2C%20Texas">Wichita Falls, Texas</a>. His father, who saw combat in <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>, was a college professor and author of a Cold War-era textbook on Western civilization. His mother was a homemaker.

As a youth, Satin was restless and rebellious, and his behavior did not change after leaving for university. In early 1965, at age 18, he dropped out of the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign">University of Illinois</a> to work with the <a href="Student%20Nonviolent%20Coordinating%20Committee">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a> in <a href="Holly%20Springs%2C%20Mississippi">Holly Springs, Mississippi</a>. Later that year, he was told to leave <a href="Midwestern%20State%20University">Midwestern State University</a>, in Texas, for refusing to sign a loyalty oath to the United States Constitution. In 1966 he became president of a <a href="Students%20for%20a%20Democratic%20Society">Students for a Democratic Society</a> chapter at the <a href="Binghamton%20University">State University of New York at Binghamton</a>, and helped recruit nearly 20% of the student body to join. One term later he dropped out, then emigrated to Canada to avoid serving in the Vietnam War.

Just before Satin left for Canada, his father told him he was trying to destroy himself. His mother told the "<a href="Ladies%27%20Home%20Journal">Ladies' Home Journal</a>" she could not condone her son's actions. Satin says he arrived in Canada feeling bewildered and unsupported. According to press accounts, many Vietnam War resisters arrived feeling much the same way.

As 1967 began, many American <a href="Pacifism">pacifists</a> and radicals did not look favorably on emigration to Canada as a means of resisting the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. For some this reflected a core conviction that effective war resistance requires self-sacrifice. For others it was a matter of strategy – emigration was said to be less useful than going to jail
or deserting the military, or was said to abet the war by siphoning off the opposition. At first, Students for a Democratic Society and many <a href="Quakers">Quaker</a> draft counselors opposed promoting the Canadian alternative, and Canada's largest counseling group, the Anti-Draft Programme of the Student Union for Peace Action (SUPA) – whose board consisted largely of Quakers and radicals – was sympathetic to such calls for prudence. In January 1967 its spokesman warned an American audience that immigration was difficult and that the Programme was not willing to act as "baby sitters" for Americans after they arrived. He added that he was tired of talking to the press.

When Mark Satin was hired as director of the Programme in April 1967, he attempted to change its culture. He also tried to change the attitude of the war resistance movement toward emigration. His efforts continued after SUPA collapsed and he co-founded the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme, with largely the same board of directors, in October 1967. Instead of praising self-sacrifice, he emphasized the importance of self-preservation and self-development to social change. Rather than sympathizing with pacifists' and radicals' strategic concerns, he rebutted them, telling "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that massive emigration of draft-age Americans could help end the war, and telling another reporter that going to jail was bad public relations.

Where the Programme once publicized the difficulties of immigration, Satin emphasized the competence of his draft counseling operation, and even told of giving cash to immigrants who were without funds.
Instead of refusing to "baby sit" Americans after they arrived, Satin made post-emigration assistance a top priority. The office soon sported comfortable furniture, a hot plate, and free food; within a few months, 200 Torontonians had opened their homes to war resisters and a job-finding service had been established. Finally, rather than expressing indifference to reporters, Satin courted them, and many responded, beginning with a May 1967 article in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">The New York Times Magazine</a>" that included a large picture of Satin counseling Vietnam War resisters in the refurbished office. Some of the publicity focused on Satin as much as on his cause. According to historian <a href="Pierre%20Berton">Pierre Berton</a>, Satin was so visible that he became the unofficial spokesman for war resisters in Canada.

Satin defined himself as a neopacifist or quasi-pacifist – flexible, media-savvy, and entrepreneurial. He told one journalist he might have fought against Hitler. He was not necessarily opposed to the draft, telling reporters he would support it for a defensive army or to help eliminate poverty, illiteracy, and racial discrimination. He avoided the intellectual framework of traditional pacifism and socialism. Sometimes he spoke with emotion, as when he described the United States to "The New York Times Magazine" as "[t]hat godawful sick, foul country; could anything be worse?" Sometimes he spoke poetically, as when he told author <a href="Jules%20Witcover">Jules Witcover</a>, "It's colder here, but you feel warm because you know you're not trying to kill people." Instead of identifying with older pacifists, he identified with a 17-year-old character from the pen of <a href="J.%20D.%20Salinger">J. D. Salinger</a>: "I was <a href="Holden%20Caulfield">Holden Caulfield</a>", he said in 2008, "just standing and catching in the rye."

The results of Satin's approach were noticeable: the Programme went from averaging fewer than three visitors, letters, and phone calls per day just before he arrived, to averaging 50 per day nine months later. In addition, the American anti-war movement became more accepting of emigration to Canada – for example, author <a href="Myra%20MacPherson">Myra MacPherson</a> reports that Satin's "Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada" could be obtained at every draft counseling office in the U.S. However, Satin's approach was distressing to the traditional pacifists and socialists on the Programme's board. The board clashed with Satin over at least 10 political, strategic, and performance issues. The most intractable may have been over the extent of the publicity. There were also concerns about Satin's personal issues; for example, one war resister claims to have heard him say, "Anonymity would kill me". In May 1968, the board finally fired him.

Before Satin was fired, he conceived and wrote, and edited guest chapters for, the "Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada", published in January 1968 by the House of Anansi Press in partnership with the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme. The Programme had issued brochures on emigration before – including a 12-page version under Satin's watch – but the "Manual" was different, a comprehensive, 45,000-word book, and it quickly turned into an "underground bestseller". Many years later, Toronto newspapers reported that nearly 100,000 copies of the "Manual" had been sold. One journalist calls it the "first entirely Canadian-published bestseller in the United States".

The Programme was initially hesitant about producing the "Manual", which promised to draw even more war resisters and publicity to it. "The [board] didn't even want me to write it", Satin says. "I wrote it at night, in the SUPA office, three or four nights a week after counseling guys and gals 8 to 10 hours a day – pounded it out in several drafts over several months on SUPA's ancient Underwood typewriter." When it finally appeared, some leading periodicals helped put it on the map. For example, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Review%20of%20Books">The New York Review of Books</a>" called it "useful", and "The New York Times" said it contains advice about everything from how to qualify as an immigrant to jobs, housing, schools, politics, culture, and even the snow. After the war, sociologist John Hagan found that more than a third of young American emigrants to Canada had read the "Manual" while still in the United States, and nearly another quarter obtained it after they arrived.

The "Manual" reflected Satin's neopacifist politics. Commentators routinely characterized it as caustic, responsible, and supportive. The first part of the "Manual", on emigration, suggests that self-preservation is more important than sacrifice to a dubious cause. The second half, on Canada, spotlights opportunities for self-development and social innovation. According to Canadian social historian David Churchill, the "Manual" helped some Canadians begin to see Toronto as socially inclusive, politically progressive, and counter-cultural.

Inevitably, the "Manual" became a lightning rod for controversy. Some observers took issue with its perspective on Canada; most notably, "The Cambridge Companion to Canadian Literature" criticizes its "condescending tone" in describing Canada's resources. Elements in the U.S. and Canadian governments may have been upset by the "Manual". According to journalist <a href="Lynn%20Coady">Lynn Coady</a>, the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP) attempted to wiretap the House of Anansi Press's offices. In addition, Anansi co-founder <a href="Dave%20Godfrey">Dave Godfrey</a> is convinced a 10-day government audit of the press was generated by FBI–RCMP concerns. Many people did not want the Programme to encourage draft-eligible Americans to emigrate to Canada, and Satin routinely denied that the "Manual" encouraged emigration. But few observers believed him, then or later. The first sentence of an article in "The New York Times" from 1968 describes the "Manual" as "a major bid to encourage Americans to evade military conscription". Canadian essayist <a href="Robert%20Fulford%20%28journalist%29">Robert Fulford</a> remembers the "Manual" as offering an enthusiastic welcome to draft dodgers. Even a House of Anansi Press anthology from 2007 concedes that the "Manual" is "coyly titled".

Satin was fired from the Programme soon after the appearance of the second edition of the "Manual", which had a print run of 20,000. His name was removed from the title page of most subsequent editions. According to a study of the "Manual" by critic Joseph Jones in "<a href="Canadian%20Notes%20%26amp%3B%20Queries">Canadian Notes & Queries</a>", a literary journal, some later editions experienced a falloff in quality. Nevertheless, Jones says the "Manual" stands as an icon of its age. It made significant appearances in at least five 20th-century novels, including <a href="John%20Irving">John Irving</a>'s "A Prayer for Owen Meany", and it continues to be pored over by journalists,
historians, social scientists, creative writers, <a href="social%20movement">social movement</a> strategists, and graduate students. In 2017 the "Manual" was re-issued as a Canadian "classic" by the original publisher, with an introduction by Canadian historian <a href="James%20Laxer">James Laxer</a> and a politically charged afterword by Satin, then in his 70th year.

Until the 1990s, literary critic <a href="William%20Zinsser">William Zinsser</a> says, <a href="memoir">memoir</a> writers tended to conceal their most personal and embarrassing memories. In the 1970s Satin wrote a book revealing many such memories as a neopacifist activist during the years 1964–66, "Confessions of a Young Exile", published by Gage, a Toronto publishing house soon to merge with Macmillan of Canada. "Confessions" is "a remarkable exercise in self-exposure", playwright <a href="John%20Lazarus%20%28playwright%29">John Lazarus</a> says in a review. "The insights into the hero's motives and fears are so honest, and so mortifyingly true, that it soon becomes evident that the [naive] tone is deliberate."

To some reviewers, Satin appears to have had a political goal – encouraging activists to establish common ground with ordinary North Americans on the basis of their shared confusion and humanity. For example, Jackie Hooper, writing in "<a href="The%20Province">The Province</a>", argues that the purity of motives projected by many pacifist activists is unconvincing, and recommends Satin's more complex view: "Satin's emigration wasn't dictated totally by his idealism. More often than not, he talked himself into radical positions ... as a result of trying to impress his peers or his girlfriend, or rebelling against middle-class parental authority". <a href="Roy%20MacSkimming">Roy MacSkimming</a>, book editor of the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>", says Satin portrayed himself as "idealistic" but also troubled and uncertain, wanting to fit in yet also longing to be unique.

Some reviewers were unenthusiastic. For example, Dennis Duffy, writing in "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>", describes Satin's memoir as a "story about a young man who doesn't grow up". In addition, Satin's publisher began having reservations about him. Many years later, the "Toronto Star" reported that the publisher decided not to let Satin do any publicity for the book, because of his potentially offensive views.

In the 21st century, "Confessions" was discussed at length by literary critics Rachel Adams in the "<a href="Yale%20Journal%20of%20Criticism">Yale Journal of Criticism</a>" and <a href="Robert%20McGill%20%28writer%29">Robert McGill</a> in his book "War Is Here". Both had been drawn to Satin's text because of their interest in the figure of the "draft dodger" in literature, and both depict Satin's journey from Moorhead to Canada as politically complex and sexually charged.

As the 1970s began, the New Left faded away, and many movements arose in its wake – among them the <a href="Feminist%20movement">feminist</a>, <a href="Men%20and%20feminism">men's liberation</a>, <a href="Spirituality">spiritual</a>, <a href="Human%20Potential%20Movement">human potential</a>, <a href="Environmental%20movement">ecology</a>, <a href="appropriate%20technology">appropriate technology</a>, <a href="intentional%20community">intentional community</a>, and <a href="holistic%20health">holistic health</a> movements. After graduating from the <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a> in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or as a reporter for Canada's underground press. He also took up residence in a free-love commune. "One fierce winter's day", he says, "... it dawned on me that the ideas and energies from the various 'fringe' movements [were] beginning to generate a coherent new politics. But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics (instead of merely bits and pieces of it)". Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions. He wrote, designed, typeset, and printed the first edition of "New Age Politics" himself, in 1976. A 240-page edition was published by Vancouver's Whitecap Books in 1978, and a 349-page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979. It is now widely regarded as the "first", "most ambitious", or "most adequate" attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post-socialist politics arising in the wake of the New Left. Some academics say it offers a new ideology.
At the heart of "New Age Politics" is a critique of the consciousness we all supposedly share, a "six-sided prison" that has kept us all trapped for hundreds of years. The six sides of the "prison" are said to be: patriarchal attitudes, egocentricity, scientific single vision, the bureaucratic mentality, nationalism (xenophobia), and the "big city outlook" (fear of nature). Since consciousness, according to Satin, ultimately determines our institutions, prison consciousness is said to be ultimately responsible for "monolithic" institutions that offer us little in the way of freedom of choice or connection with others. Some representative monolithic institutions are: bureaucratic government, automobile-centered transportation systems, attorney-centered law, doctor-centered health care, and church-centered spirituality.

To explain how to break free of the prison and its institutions, Satin develops a "psychocultural" class analysis that reveals the existence of "life-", "thing-", and "death-oriented" classes. According to Satin, life-oriented individuals constitute an emerging "third force" in post-industrial nations. The third force is generating a "prison-free" consciousness consisting of <a href="Androgyny">androgynous</a> attitudes, spirituality, multiple perspectives, a cooperative mentality, local-and-global identities, and an ecological outlook. To transform prison society, Satin argues, the third force is going to have to launch an "evolutionary movement" to replace – or at least supplement – monolithic institutions with life-affirming, "biolithic" ones. Some representative biolithic institutions are: <a href="deliberative%20democracy">deliberative democracy</a> as an alternative to bureaucratic government, bicycles and mass transit as an alternative to the private automobile, and mediation as an alternative to attorney-centered law. According to Satin, the third force will not have to overthrow capitalism, since Western civilization – not capitalism – is said to be responsible for the prison. But the third force will want to foster a prison-free New Age capitalism through intelligent regulation and elimination of all subsidies.

The reaction to "New Age Politics" was, and continues to be, highly polarized. Many of the movements Satin drew upon to construct his synthesis received it favorably, though some took exception to the title. Some maverick liberals and <a href="Libertarianism">libertarians</a> are drawn to the book. It was eventually published in Sweden and Germany, and European New Age political thinkers came to see it as a precursor of their own work. Others see it as proto-Green. Ever since its first appearance, though, and continuing into the 21st century, "New Age Politics" has been a target of criticism for two groups in the United States: conservative Christians and left-wing intellectuals.

Among conservative Christians, there are cultural, political, and moral objections. Attorney <a href="Constance%20Cumbey">Constance Cumbey</a> warns that the book can be "seductive" to those who lack an adequate Biblical education. Theologians <a href="Tim%20LaHaye">Tim LaHaye</a> and Ron Rhodes are convinced Satin wants a centralized and coercive world government. Moral philosopher <a href="Douglas%20Groothuis">Douglas Groothuis</a> says Satin's vision is unsound because it lacks an absolute standard of good and evil. Among left-leaning academics, criticism focuses on Satin's theoretical underpinnings. Political scientist Michael Cummings takes issue with the idea that consciousness is ultimately determining. Science-and-society professor David Hess rejects the idea that economic class analysis should give way to psychocultural class analysis. A lengthy, systemic critique of "New Age Politics", by communication studies professor <a href="Dana%20L.%20Cloud">Dana L. Cloud</a>, accuses it of employing a "therapeutic rhetoric[] generated to console activists after the failure of post-1968 revolutionary movements and to legitimate participation in liberal politics".

After U.S. President Jimmy Carter pardoned
Vietnam War resisters in 1977, Satin began giving talks on "New Age Politics" in the United States. His first talk received a standing ovation, and he wept. Every talk seemed to lead to two or three more, and "the response at New Age gatherings, community events, fairs, bookstores, living rooms, and college campuses" kept Satin going for two years. By the second year he began laying the groundwork for the <a href="New%20World%20Alliance">New World Alliance</a>, a national political organization based in Washington, D.C. "I went systematically to 24 cities and regions from coast to coast", he told the authors of the book "Networking". "I stopped when I found 500 [accomplished] people who said they'd answer a questionnaire ... on what a New Age-oriented political organization should be like – what its politics should be, what its projects should be, and how its first directors should be chosen.".

The New World Alliance convened its first "governing council" meeting in New York City in 1979. The 39-member council was chosen by the questionnaire-answerers themselves, out of 89 who volunteered to be on the ballot. Political scientist Arthur Stein describes the council as an eclectic collection of educators, feminists, businesspeople, futurists, think-tank fellows, and activists. One of the council's announced goals was to break down the division between left and right. Another was to help facilitate a thorough transformation of society. Satin was named staff member of the Alliance.

Expectations ran high among supporters of a post-liberal, post-Marxist politics, and the governing council did initiate several projects. For example, a series of "Political Awareness Seminars" attempted to help participants understand and learn to work with their political opponents. In addition, a "Transformation Platform" attempted to synthesize left- and right-wing approaches to dozens of public policy issues. But within three years the Alliance fell apart, unable to establish stable chapters in any major cities. Author <a href="Jerome%20Clark">Jerome Clark</a> suggests the cause was the Alliance's commitment to consensus-building in all its groups and projects; within months, he notes, one member was complaining that the Alliance had turned into a "diddler's cult". Another explanation focuses on the failure – or inability – of the hyper-democratic questionnaire process to select an appropriate governing council.

Satin was devastated by the decline of the Alliance, and engaged in unhappy bouts of public criticism and self-criticism. "We would rather be good than do good", he told editor <a href="Kevin%20Kelly%20%28editor%29">Kevin Kelly</a>. "We would rather be pure than mature. We are the Beautiful Losers." As time went on, though, the Alliance came to be regarded positively by many observers. For example, author <a href="Corinne%20McLaughlin">Corinne McLaughlin</a> sees it as one of the first groups to offer an agenda for the new transformational politics. In an academic text, political scientist Stephen Woolpert acknowledges it as a precursor of North American Green parties.

After four or five New World Alliance governing council meetings, Satin became tired of what he saw as empty rhetoric, and decided to do something practical – start a political newsletter. He raised $91,000 to launch the venture, from 517 people he had met on his travels, and within a few years had built it into what think-tank scholar <a href="George%20Weigel">George Weigel</a> described as "one of the hottest political newsletters in Washington[, D.C.]. ... [It] has gotten a fair amount of [national] attention, and perhaps even some influence, because it self-consciously styles itself 'post-liberal'." Satin published 75 issues of "New Options" from 1984 to 1992, virtually half a million words. He wrote nearly all the articles. In 1989 "New Options" received "<a href="Utne%20Reader">Utne Reader</a>"'s first "Alternative Press Award for General Excellence: Best Publication from 10,000 to 30,000 Circulation". In 1990 "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" identified "New Options" as one of 10 periodicals spearheading "The Ideology Shuffle". Twenty-five of its articles were published as a book by a university press.
Satin wanted "New Options" to make the visionary perspective of "New Age Politics" seem pragmatic and realizable. He also wanted "New Options" to spread the New Age political ideology more effectively than the New World Alliance had done. To those ends, he challenged traditional views across the political spectrum, and he expanded the scope of politics to include subjects like love and relationships. In her book "Do You Believe in Magic?", culture critic Annie Gottlieb says "New Options" offered:
an explosive short course in political possibility. ... What are the best books and groups in the consumer empowerment (not "protection") and neighborhood self-reliance movements? Who is working on practical, compassionate, populist alternatives to the welfare state and the big-business state? What is the best way to cut the budget deficit? What can we learn from the Sri Lankan Sarvodaya (local self-help) and Polish Solidarity movements? Each issue presents ideas, names and addresses, and a crossfire of reader debate.
"I think the reason "New Options" works is it has a particular tone", Satin told one reporter. "It's as idealistic as many of us were in the 1960s, but ... without the childishness".

"New Options" owed its rise to more than just content and tone, however. Positioning was also a factor. The New Age political movement was cresting in the 1980s, and it needed a political periodical. Satin's book "New Age Politics" had helped define the movement, and the "New Options" advisory board – a collection of prominent post-liberal thinkers – gave the newsletter further credibility. At the outset it included <a href="Lester%20R.%20Brown">Lester R. Brown</a>, <a href="Ernest%20Callenbach">Ernest Callenbach</a>, <a href="Fritjof%20Capra">Fritjof Capra</a>, <a href="Vincent%20Harding">Vincent Harding</a>, <a href="Willis%20Harman">Willis Harman</a>, <a href="Hazel%20Henderson">Hazel Henderson</a>, <a href="Petra%20Kelly">Petra Kelly</a>, <a href="Amory%20Lovins">Amory Lovins</a>, <a href="Joanna%20Macy">Joanna Macy</a>, <a href="Robin%20Morgan">Robin Morgan</a>, <a href="John%20Naisbitt">John Naisbitt</a>, <a href="Jeremy%20Rifkin">Jeremy Rifkin</a>, <a href="Carl%20Rogers">Carl Rogers</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Roszak%20%28scholar%29">Theodore Roszak</a>, <a href="Kirkpatrick%20Sale">Kirkpatrick Sale</a>, <a href="Charlene%20Spretnak">Charlene Spretnak</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Theobald">Robert Theobald</a>, and over the years it added such figures as <a href="Herman%20Daly">Herman Daly</a>, <a href="Marilyn%20Ferguson">Marilyn Ferguson</a>, <a href="Jane%20Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a>, <a href="Winona%20LaDuke">Winona LaDuke</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Rodale">Robert Rodale</a>.

"New Options" did not succeed in all quarters. <a href="Jules%20Feiffer">Jules Feiffer</a>, for example, often seen as being on the liberal-left, called it "irritating" and "neo-yuppie". <a href="Jason%20McQuinn">Jason McQuinn</a>, often seen as a radical,
objected to what he perceived as its relentless American optimism. <a href="George%20Weigel">George Weigel</a>, often seen as a conservative, said it consisted largely of a cleverly repackaged leftism. Satin himself turned out to be one of the newsletter's critics. "I could have edited "New Options" forever", he wrote in 2004. "But, increasingly, I was becoming dissatisfied with my hyper-idealistic politics". His experiences in the U.S. Green politics movement contributed to that dissatisfaction.

By the mid-1980s, Green parties were making inroads all over the world. A slogan of the <a href="Alliance%20%2790/The%20Greens">West German Greens</a> was, "We are neither left nor right; we are in front". Some observers, notably <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">British Green Party</a> liaison <a href="Sara%20Parkin">Sara Parkin</a>, saw the New World Alliance and "New Options Newsletter" as Green entities. Others saw the early Greens as one expression of New Age politics. In 1984, Satin was invited to the founding meeting of the U.S. Green politics movement, and he became a founding member.
The meeting chose him, along with political theorist <a href="Charlene%20Spretnak">Charlene Spretnak</a>, to draft its foundational political statement, "Ten Key Values". Some accounts recognize futurist and activist Eleanor LeCain as a co-equal drafter. The drafters drew on suggestions recorded on a flip chart during a marathon plenary brainstorming session, as well as on suggestions received by Satin and Spretnak during the meeting and for many weeks afterward.

The original "Ten Key Values" statement was approved by the Greens' national steering committee and released in late 1984. The values in the original statement are: Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, Personal and Social Responsibility, Nonviolence, Decentralization, Community-based Economics, Postpatriarchal Values, Respect for Diversity, Global Responsibility, and Future Focus. One unusual aspect, say many observers, is the way the values are described; instead of declaratory statements full of "shoulds" and "musts", each value is followed by a series of open-ended questions. "That idea ... came from Mark Satin", Spretnak told scholar <a href="Greta%20Gaard">Greta Gaard</a> in 1997. Its effect, says sociologist Paul Lichterman, was to promote dialogue and creative thinking in local Green groups across the U.S.

The original values statement was, and remains, controversial. U.S. Green Party co-founder <a href="John%20Rensenbrink">John Rensenbrink</a> credits it with helping to unify the often contentious Greens. However, party co-founder <a href="Howie%20Hawkins">Howie Hawkins</a> sees it as just a watered-down, "spiritual", and "New Age" version of the German Greens' <a href="Ten%20key%20values">Four Pillars</a> statement. Greta Gaard says it fails to call for the elimination of capitalism or racism. Looking back after 20 years, Green activist Brian Tokar said that "the voice of the original [values] questions is distinctly personal ... and aims to avoid fundamental conflicts with elite social and cultural norms." A "modified" list of the Ten Key Values became part of the U.S. Greens' political platform. However, all the open-ended questions were replaced by declaratory sentences, and the U.S. Greens have come to be regarded as a party of the left, rather than one seeking to be neither left nor right.

Satin himself became increasingly critical of the Greens. He gave a featured speech at the U.S. Green gathering in 1987 urging them to avoid hyper-detailed platform writing and other projects and specialize in one thing – running people for office who endorse the Ten Key Values. But the speech failed to persuade. After the Green gathering in 1989, he urged them to abandon hippie-era fears of money, authority, and leadership. After the 1990 gathering he complained "I've been Pure before," an allusion to his time in the New World Alliance. According to Greta Gaard, he then bid farewell to the Greens, but recognized it as a loss: "Whatever I may think of their internal battles and political prospects, the Greens are My People. Their life choices are my life choices; their failings mirror my own." Within a year of voicing those words, he stopped "New Options Newsletter" and applied to law school.

The 1990s are remembered, by many in the West, as a time of relative prosperity and satisfaction. According to some historians, visionary politics appeared to be on the decline. However, even after Satin entered <a href="New%20York%20University%20School%20of%20Law">New York University School of Law</a> in 1992, he expressed no desire to abandon his project of helping to construct a post-liberal, post-Marxist ideology. He did admit to being disillusioned with his approach. "I knew my views (and I personally) would benefit from engagement with the real world of commerce and professional ambition", he wrote.
After graduating in 1995, Satin worked for a Manhattan law firm focusing on complex business litigation. He also wrote about financial and legal issues. He did not dislike his work, but felt he was "sleepwalking" because he was not doing what he loved, writing about visionary politics. With six former law school classmates, he began planning a political newsletter that could accommodate all he was learning about business and law. In 1998 he returned to Washington, D.C., to launch "Radical Middle Newsletter".

As the title indicates, it sought to distance itself from New Age politics. If the term "New Age" suggests utopianism, the term "radical middle" suggests, for Satin and others, keeping at least one foot firmly on the ground. Satin attempted to embrace the promise but also the balance implied by the term. One feature story is entitled "Tough on Terrorism, and Tough on the Causes of Terrorism". Another feature story attempts to go beyond polarized positions on biotechnology. Another argues that corporate activity abroad can best be seen as neither inherently moral nor inherently imperialistic, but as a "chance for mutual learning". The board of advisors of "Radical Middle Newsletter" signaled Satin's new direction. It was politically diverse, and many of its members sought to promote dialogue or collaboration across ideological divides. By the end of 2004 it included <a href="John%20Avlon">John Avlon</a>, <a href="Don%20Edward%20Beck">Don Edward Beck</a>, <a href="Jerry%20H.%20Bentley">Jerry H. Bentley</a>, <a href="Esther%20Dyson">Esther Dyson</a>, <a href="Mark%20P.%20Painter">Mark P. Painter</a>, Shelley Alpern of the <a href="Socially%20responsible%20investing">Social Investment Forum</a>, <a href="James%20Fallows">James Fallows</a> of the <a href="New%20America%20Foundation">New America Foundation</a>, <a href="Jane%20Mansbridge">Jane Mansbridge</a> of the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20School%20of%20Government">Harvard Kennedy School</a>, <a href="John%20D.%20Marks">John D. Marks</a> and Susan Collin Marks of <a href="Search%20for%20Common%20Ground">Search for Common Ground</a>, and <a href="William%20Ury">William Ury</a>, co-author of "<a href="Getting%20to%20Yes">Getting to Yes</a>".

"Radical Middle Newsletter" proved controversial. Many responded positively to Satin's new direction. A professor of management, for example, wrote that unlike Satin's former newsletter, "Radical Middle" spoke about "reality". Scholarly books began citing articles from the newsletter. In a book on globalization, <a href="Walter%20Truett%20Anderson">Walter Truett Anderson</a> said "Radical Middle" "carries the encouraging news of an emerging group with a different voice, one that is 'nuanced, hopeful, adult'. ... It is essentially a willingness to listen to both sides of the argument." But three objections were often heard. Some critics accused Satin of misguided policy proposals, as when peace studies scholar <a href="Michael%20N.%20Nagler">Michael N. Nagler</a> wrote that the article "praising humanitarian military intervention as the 'peace movement' of our time, is nothing short of an insult ... to the "real" peace movement" [emphasis in original]. Other critics accused Satin of abandoning his old constituency, as when author and former "New Options" advisor <a href="David%20Korten">David Korten</a> chided him for consciously choosing pragmatism over idealism. There were also accusations of elitism, as when the executive editor of "<a href="Yes%21%20%28U.S.%20magazine%29">Yes!</a>" magazine said Satin favored globalization because it appealed to his interests and those of his "law school buddies".

"New Options Newsletter" was based on the theories set forth in "New Age Politics". But Satin's approach to his radical middle project was eclectic and experimental. His contribution to radical centrist political theory, the book "Radical Middle", was not published until 2004, the newsletter's sixth year. Until then, the only glimpse Satin gave of his larger vision appeared in an article he wrote for an academic journal.

Satin's book "Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now", published by Westview Press and Basic Books in 2004, attempts to present radical centrism as a political ideology. It is considered one of the two or three "most persuasive" or most representative books on the subject, and it received the "Best Book Award" for 2003 and 2004 from the Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics of the <a href="American%20Political%20Science%20Association">American Political Science Association</a>. It also generated – like all of Satin's works – criticism and controversy.
Satin presents "Radical Middle" as a revised and evolved version of his "New Age Politics" book, rather than as a rejection of it. Some observers had always seen him as a radical centrist. As early as 1980, author Marilyn Ferguson identified him as part of what she called the "Radical Center". In 1987, culture critic Annie Gottlieb said Satin was trying to prompt the New Age and New Left to evolve into a "New Center". But the revisions Satin introduces are substantial. Instead of defining politics as a means for creating the ideal society, as he did in "New Age Politics", he defines radical middle politics as "idealism without illusions" – more creative and future-oriented than politics-as-usual, but willing to face "the hard facts on the ground". Rather than arguing that change will be brought about by a third force, he says most Americans are already radical middle – "we're very practical folks, and we're very idealistic and visionary as well."

Although Satin argues in "New Age Politics" that Americans need to change their consciousness and decentralize their institutions, in "Radical Middle" he says they can build a good society if they adopt and live by Four Key Values: maximize choices for all Americans, give every American a fair start, maximize every American's human potential, and help the peoples of the developing world. Instead of finding those values in the writings of contemporary theorists, Satin says they are just new versions of the values that inspired 18th-century American revolutionaries: liberty, equality, pursuit-of-happiness, and fraternity, respectively. He calls <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> the radical middle's favorite Founding Father, and says Franklin "wanted us to invent a uniquely American politics that served ordinary people by creatively borrowing from all points of view."

In "New Age Politics", Satin chooses not to focus on the details of public policy. In "Radical Middle", however, Satin develops a raft of policy proposals rooted in the Four Key Values. (Among them: universal access to private, preventive health insurance, class-based rather than race-based affirmative action, mandatory national service, and opening U.S. markets to more products from poor nations.) In "New Age Politics", Satin calls on "life-oriented" people to become radical activists for a New Age society. In "Radical Middle", Satin calls on people of every political stripe to work from within for social change congruent with the Four Key Values.

Satin's mandatory national service proposal drew significant media coverage, in part because of his status as a draft refuser. Satin argues that a draft could work in the United States if it applied to all young people, without exception, and if it gave everyone a choice in how they would serve. He proposes three service options: military (with generous benefits), homeland security (at prevailing wages), and community care (at subsistence wages). On <a href="Voice%20of%20America">Voice of America</a> radio, Satin presented his proposal as one drawing equally from the best of the left and the right. On <a href="NPR">National Public Radio</a>, he emphasized its fairness.

"Radical Middle" provokes three kinds of responses: skeptical, pragmatic, and visionary. Skeptical respondents tend to find Satin's beyond-left-and-right policy proposals to be unrealistic and arrogant. For example, political writer <a href="Charles%20R.%20Morris">Charles R. Morris</a> says "Satin's nostrums" echo the "glibness and overweening self-confidence ... in Roosevelt's brain trust, or in John F. Kennedy's." Similarly, the policy director of the <a href="Democratic%20Leadership%20Council">Democratic Leadership Council</a> says Satin's book "ultimately places him in the sturdy tradition of 'idealistic' American reformers who think smart and principled people unencumbered by political constraints can change everything."

Pragmatic observers tend to applaud Satin's willingness to borrow good ideas from the left and the right. But these respondents are typically more drawn to Satin as a policy advocate – or as a counterweight to partisan <a href="Militant%20%28word%29">militants</a> like <a href="Ann%20Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> – than they are to him as a political theorist. For example, Robert Olson of the <a href="World%20Future%20Society">World Future Society</a> warns Satin against presenting the radical middle as a new ideology.

Visionary respondents typically appreciate Satin's work as a policy advocate. But they also see him as attempting something rarer and, according to spiritual writer Carter Phipps, richer – raising politics to a higher level by synthesizing truths from all the political ideologies. Author <a href="Corinne%20McLaughlin">Corinne McLaughlin</a> identifies Satin as one of those creating an ideology about ideologies. She quotes him:
Coming up with a solution is not a matter of adopting correct political beliefs. It is, rather, a matter of learning to listen – really, listen – to everyone in the circle of humanity, and to take their insights into account. For everyone has a true and unique perspective on the whole. [Many] years ago the burning question was, How radical are you? Hopefully someday soon the question will be, How much can you synthesize? How much do you dare to take in?

Life changed for Satin after writing and publicizing his "Radical Middle" book. In 2006, at the age of 60, he moved from Washington, D.C., to the San Francisco Bay Area to reconcile with his father, from whom he had been estranged for 40 years. "With the perspective of time and experience," Satin told one reporter, "I can see [my father] was not altogether out to lunch." Later that year Satin discovered his only life partner. He describes it as "no accident".

In 2009 Satin revealed he was losing his eyesight as a result of <a href="macular%20edema">macular edema</a> and <a href="diabetic%20retinopathy">diabetic retinopathy</a>. He stopped producing "Radical Middle Newsletter" but expressed a desire to write a final political book. From 2009 to 2011 he presented occasional guest lectures on "life and political ideologies" in peace studies classes at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. In 2015 he helped produce a "40th Anniversary Edition" of his book "New Age Politics", and in 2017 he helped produce a 50th anniversary edition of his "Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada".

Mark Satin has been a controversial public figure since the age of 20. Assessments of his significance vary widely.

Some observers see him as an exemplary figure. David Armstrong, for example, in his study of independent American journalism, presents Satin as an embodiment of the "do-it-yourself spirit" that makes an independent press possible. Futurists Jessica Lipnack and Jeffrey Stamps portray Satin as a pioneer "networker" who spent two years riding the bus across the U.S. in an attempt to connect like-minded thinkers and activists. <a href="Marilyn%20Ferguson">Marilyn Ferguson</a>, author of "The Aquarian Conspiracy", says that by engaging in a lifelong series of personal and political experiments with few resources, Satin is playing the role of the holy "<a href="Foolishness%20for%20Christ">Fool</a>" for his time.

Other observers stress the freshness of Satin's political vision. Social scientists <a href="The%20Cultural%20Creatives">Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson</a>, for example, argue that Satin anticipated the perspectives of 21st century social movements better than nearly anyone. <a href="Humanistic%20psychology">Humanistic psychologist</a> John Amodeo says Satin is one of the few political theorists to grasp the connection between personal growth and constructive political change. Ecofeminist <a href="Greta%20Gaard">Greta Gaard</a> claims that Satin "played a significant role in facilitating the articulation of Green political thought". Policy analyst <a href="Michael%20Edwards%20%28academic%29">Michael Edwards</a> sees Satin as a pioneering <a href="transpartisan">trans-partisan</a> thinker. Peace researcher <a href="Hanna%20Newcombe">Hanna Newcombe</a> finds a spiritual dimension in Satin's politics. Political scientist Christa Slaton's short list of "nonacademic" transformationalists consists of <a href="Alvin%20Toffler">Alvin and Heidi Toffler</a>, <a href="Fritjof%20Capra">Fritjof Capra</a>, Marilyn Ferguson, <a href="Hazel%20Henderson">Hazel Henderson</a>, <a href="Betty%20Friedan">Betty Friedan</a>, <a href="E.%20F.%20Schumacher">E. F. Schumacher</a>, <a href="John%20Naisbitt">John Naisbitt</a>, and Mark Satin.

Some see Satin as a classic example of the perpetual rebel and trace the cause back to his early years. For example, author Roger Neville Williams focuses on the harshness and "paternalistic rectitude" of Satin's parents. Novelist <a href="Dan%20Wakefield">Dan Wakefield</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>", says Satin grew up in a small city in northern Minnesota like Bob Dylan but did not have a guitar to express himself with. According to historian <a href="Frank%20Kusch">Frank Kusch</a>, the seeds for rebellion were planted when Satin's parents moved him at age 16 from liberal Minnesota to still-segregated Texas.

Although many observers praise or are intrigued by Satin, many find him dismaying. Memoirist <a href="George%20Fetherling">George Fetherling</a>, for example, remembers him as a publicity hound. Literary critic Dennis Duffy calls him incapable of learning from his experiences. Green Party activist <a href="Howie%20Hawkins">Howie Hawkins</a> sees him as "virulently anti-left". The "<a href="Washington%20Monthly">Washington Monthly</a>" portrayed him in his 50s as a former New Age "guru", and "<a href="Commonweal%20%28magazine%29">Commonweal</a>" compares reading him to listening to glass shards grate against a blackboard.

Other observers see Satin as an emotionally wounded figure. For example, historian <a href="Pierre%20Berton">Pierre Berton</a> calls him a "footloose wanderer" and says he hitchhiked across Canada 16 times. Culture critic Annie Gottlieb, who attributes Satin's wounds to his struggle against the Vietnam War, points out that even as a successful newsletter publisher in Washington, DC, he paid himself the salary of a monk.

The major substantive criticisms of Satin's work have remained constant over time. His ideas are sometimes said to be superficial; they were characterized as childish in the 1960s, naive in the 1970s, poorly reasoned in the 1980s and 1990s, and overly simple in the 2000s. His ideas have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious, or as non-political in the sense of not being capable of challenging existing power structures. His work is sometimes said to be largely borrowed from others, a charge that first surfaced with regard to his draft dodger manual, and was repeated to varying degree by critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism.

Satin has long been faulted for mixing views from different parts of his political odyssey. In the 1970s, for example, "Toronto Star" editor <a href="Robert%20Nielsen">Robert Nielsen</a> argued that Satin's leftist pacifism warps his New Age vision. Three decades later, public-policy analyst Gadi Dechter argued that Satin's New Age emotionalism and impracticality blunt his radical-centrist message. At 58, Satin suggested his message could not be understood without appreciating all the strands of his personal and political journey:

From my New Left years I took a love of political struggle. From my New Age years I took a conviction that politics needs to be about more than endless struggle – that responsible human beings need to search for reconciliation and healing and mutually acceptable solutions. From my time in the legal profession I took an understanding (and it is no small understanding) that sincerity and passion are not enough – that to be truly effective in the world one needs to be credible and expert. ...

Many Americans are living complicated lives now – few of us have moved through life in a straight line. I think many of us would benefit from trying to gather and synthesize the difficult political lessons we've learned over the course of our lives.

Bob Feller

Robert William Andrew Feller (November 3, 1918December 15, 2010), nicknamed "The Heater from Van Meter", "Bullet Bob", and "Rapid Robert", was an American <a href="baseball">baseball</a> <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> who played 18 seasons in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) for the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. Feller pitched from 1936 to 1941 and from 1945 to 1956, interrupted only by a four-year engagement in the Navy. In a career spanning 570 games, Feller pitched 3,827 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings</a> and posted a <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">win–loss record</a> of 266–162, with 279 <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a>s, 44 <a href="shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutout</a>s, and a 3.25 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA).

A prodigy who bypassed the <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor leagues</a>, Feller first played for the Indians at the age of 17. His career was interrupted by four years of military service in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, during which time he served as <a href="Chief%20Petty%20Officer%20%28United%20States%29">Chief Petty Officer</a> aboard the . Feller became the first pitcher to win 24 games in a season before the age of 21. During his career, he threw <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a>s in 1940, 1946, and 1951. Feller also recorded 12 <a href="one-hitter%20%28baseball%29">one-hitters</a> (his no-hitters and one-hitters were records at the time of his retirement). He helped the Indians win a <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> title in <a href="1948%20World%20Series">1948</a> and an <a href="American%20League">American League</a>-record 111 wins and the <a href="pennant%20%28sports%29">pennant</a> in 1954. Feller led the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> in <a href="win%20%28baseball%29">wins</a> six times and in <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>s seven times. In 1946, he recorded 348 strikeouts, a total not exceeded for 19 years. An eight-time <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a>, Feller was ranked 36th on "<a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a>"s list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was named the publication's "greatest <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> of his time". He was a finalist for the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Century%20Team">Major League Baseball All-Century Team</a> in 1999.

<a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> member <a href="Ted%20Williams">Ted Williams</a> called Feller "the fastest and best pitcher I ever saw during my career." <a href="Hall%20of%20Famer">Hall of Famer</a> <a href="Stan%20Musial">Stan Musial</a> believed he was "probably the greatest pitcher of our era." He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 on his first ballot appearance; at the time only three players ever had a higher percentage of ballot votes. He was elected the inaugural President of the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%27%20Association">Major League Baseball Players' Association</a> and participated in <a href="barnstorm%20%28sports%29">exhibition games</a> which featured players from both the Major and <a href="Negro%20Leagues">Negro Leagues</a>. Feller died at the age of 92 in 2010.

Feller played primarily as a <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> or <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a>, and emulated <a href="Rogers%20Hornsby">Rogers Hornsby</a>'s batting stance. From the age of 15, he began to pitch for the Oakviews after a starting pitcher was injured; while doing so, Feller continued to play American Legion baseball. His catcher during this period was <a href="Nile%20Kinnick">Nile Kinnick</a>, who later became a member of the <a href="College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">College Football Hall of Fame</a>.

A student at <a href="Van%20Meter">Van Meter</a> High School, Feller was a starting pitcher for the school's baseball team. During this time he continued to play on the Farmers Union team in the <a href="American%20Amateur%20Baseball%20Congress">American Amateur Baseball Congress</a>, and had 19 wins and four losses for Farmers Union one season. He also was the starting <a href="center%20%28basketball%29">center</a> for the high school basketball team. By the age of 16, Feller possessed what critics judged a high quality <a href="fastball">fastball</a>; major league scouts traveled to <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a> to watch him in the annual national baseball tournament. After the game, several big league clubs offered signing bonuses with their contract offers, but he had already been signed to a professional contract with the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>.

In 1936, Feller was signed by <a href="Cy%20Slapnicka">Cy Slapnicka</a>, a <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">scout</a> for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While scouting Feller, Slapnicka said, "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had the heart of a lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." Feller was assigned to the <a href="Fargo-Moorhead%20Twins">Fargo-Moorhead Twins</a> and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named <a href="general%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a> of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Pelicans%20%28baseball%29">New Orleans Pelicans</a>. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder <a href="Tommy%20Henrich">Tommy Henrich</a>, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games <a href="List%20of%20baseball%20players%20who%20went%20directly%20to%20Major%20League%20Baseball">without visiting either farm club</a>. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">Commissioner</a> <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president <a href="Alva%20Bradley">Alva Bradley</a>, but awarded both Feller and Henrich <a href="free%20agent">free agency</a> and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity."

Feller joined the Indians and made his Major League debut on July 19, 1936 in a relief appearance against the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a>. A month later on August 23, Feller made his first career start against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>. Indians <a href="Manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> <a href="Steve%20O%27Neill">Steve O'Neill</a> had <a href="Denny%20Galehouse">Denny Galehouse</a> warmed up in the bullpen in case the 17-year-old Feller had early troubles, but he struck out all three batters he faced in the first inning, and recorded 15 <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>s in earning his first career win. His strikeout total was the highest for a (starting) pitching debut. Three weeks later, he struck out 17 batters, tying a single-game strikeout record previously set by <a href="Dizzy%20Dean">Dizzy Dean</a>, in a win over the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>. He finished the season with a 5–3 record, having appeared in 14 games; he had 47 <a href="base%20on%20balls">walks</a> and 76 strikeouts in 62 innings. Feller's fame reached such a level that when he returned to Van Meter for his senior year of high school, the governor of Iowa greeted him. His record-setting rookie year made him, according to baseball writer <a href="Richard%20Goldstein%20%28writer%20born%201942%29">Richard Goldstein</a>, "the best-known young person in America, with the possible exception of <a href="Shirley%20Temple">Shirley Temple</a>." Feller's entrance to the big leagues was later described:

As the 1937 season began, Feller appeared on the cover of the April 19, 1937 issue of <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time"</a> magazine. In his first appearance of the season on April 24, Feller suffered an injury to his elbow while throwing a <a href="curveball">curveball</a>. He spent April and May healing the arm, and in May graduated from high school; the ceremony aired nationally on <a href="NBC%20Radio">NBC Radio</a>. In mid-May, the Indians considered ending Feller's season early. "We're not taking any chances on that arm and we're not going to allow him to pitch again until the last trace of soreness has disappeared", said Slapnicka. On May 18 Feller appeared in his first game since April 24 but did not record an out. He did not pitch again until June 22, when he recorded two innings, then returned to normal pitching duties on July 4.

On October 2, <a href="1938%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1938</a>, Feller was the starting pitcher against the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>. Detroit's <a href="Hank%20Greenberg">Hank Greenberg</a> was two home runs short of <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>'s then-single-season record of 60 home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struck out Detroit's <a href="Pete%20Fox">Pete Fox</a> and passed it, to set a modern <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20single-game%20strikeout%20leaders">major league record</a> of 18 strikeouts, when he struck out <a href="Chet%20Laabs">Chet Laabs</a> for the fifth time that day. Greenberg said, "Feller's curve was jumping wickedly and with that and his fast ball, he was murder." Feller did not earn a win, however, as the Indians lost, 4–1. "It was one of those days when everything feels perfect, your arm, your coordination, your concentration, everything. There was drama in the air because of Greenberg's attempt to break Ruth's record, and the excitement grew even greater when my strikeouts started to add up", Feller said. For the 1938 season, Feller led all pitchers with 208 walks and 240 strikeouts. In 1939, Feller received his first career Opening Day start against the Tigers after a match against the Browns was rained out. He won the game 5–1, after allowing three hits. On <a href="Mother%27s%20Day">Mother's Day</a>, Feller pitched against the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> with his family in attendance. One pitch was fouled off by <a href="Marv%20Owen">Marv Owen</a> into the seats and into the face of Feller's mother; he went on to win the game. Feller finished the 1939 season having led the AL in wins (24), complete games (24) and innings pitched (296.2) and led the majors for a second consecutive year in both walks (142) and strikeouts (246).
<a href="Opening%20Day">Opening Day</a> of the 1940 season featured a <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a> from Feller against the Chicago White Sox. Feller was assisted by Indians <a href="second%20baseman">second baseman</a> <a href="Ray%20Mack">Ray Mack</a> when he made a diving play to record the final out. This is the only no-hitter to be thrown on Opening Day in major league history. He followed his no-hitter with a six-run, three-inning performance in his next start, however, in a game against the Detroit Tigers. By the end of the season he had a 27–11 record, his win total the best in the majors that season and a career-high for Feller. He accomplished a <a href="pitching%20triple%20crown">pitching triple crown</a> for the 1940 season as he led the AL in ERA (2.61), wins (27) and strikeouts (261) (the latter two led the entire majors). Feller also led the majors with 31 complete games and 320.1 innings pitched, and won the <a href="Sporting%20News%20Player%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">"Sporting News" Player of the Year Award</a>. Feller later assessed his first few years in the majors: "I relied on the catcher too much. It's swell to have a good catcher calling 'em for you, but the pitcher should take responsibility on his own shoulders."

Due to Feller's pitching speed, <a href="Lew%20Fonseca">Lew Fonseca</a> was commissioned by the Office of the Commissioner to pit Feller's fastball against a <a href="Harley-Davidson">Harley-Davidson</a> motorcycle in a speed trial. The test was conducted in Chicago's Lincoln Park and required Feller to hit a target in diameter, away. The motorcycle passed Feller going and with a head start but the ball beat the bike to the target by three feet (0.91 m). Feller's throw was calculated at the time to have reached 98.6 mph (158.7 km/h), and later 104 mph (167 km/h) using updated measuring methods.

Feller again led the majors in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched (343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best on the season. That year, <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> talked about Feller's pitching ability, stating "I don't think anyone is ever going to throw a ball faster than he does. And his curveball isn't human." Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>", which said: "... he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70. They represent of city, town, and village in the land, speak of him familiarly as 'Bob', and talk about him by the hour, with enthusiasm."

The United States entered World War II with the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941. Feller heard about the bombing while returning from a visit to his terminally ill father at <a href="Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa">Des Moines</a> to Chicago where he was to sign a new Indians contract. Two days later, he volunteered for the United States Navy, becoming the first American professional athlete to enlist. Originally he tried to enlist as a fighter pilot but failed hearing tests. Feller attended basic training at Norfolk Naval Base and served as a physical fitness instructor there. He also pitched in baseball games hosted by the military. Although he had received a military exemption owing to his father's failing health, he wanted to serve in combat missions. Feller said, "I told them I wanted to ... get into combat; wanted to do something besides standing around handing out balls and bats and making ball fields out of coral reefs." Feller was assigned to the ; he had hoped to serve on the , but nearly all servicemen from Iowa had requested a place on that ship, and Feller was not selected.

Shortly before Feller left for combat, his father died of brain cancer in early January 1943. Five days later he married Virginia Winther, whom he met while in Florida for spring training; she was a student at <a href="Rollins%20College">Rollins College</a>. After the marriage, Feller returned to service as Gun Captain aboard the "Alabama" and kept his pitching arm in shape by throwing near a gun turret. Feller and the "Alabama" crew spent most of 1943 in the British Isles along with , but in August were reassigned to the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific Theater of Operations</a>. Feller's first taste of direct combat was at <a href="Operation%20Galvanic">Operation Galvanic</a> in November 1943. The "Alabama" also served during <a href="Operation%20Flintlock%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Operation Flintlock</a> while primarily being used as an escort battleship in 1944. Feller participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> before his combat duty ended in January 1945; he spent the rest of the war at the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Naval%20Training%20Station">Great Lakes Naval Training Station</a> as an instructor.

When the war ended, Feller was discharged as a <a href="Chief%20Petty%20Officer%20%28United%20States%29">Chief Petty Officer</a> on August 22, 1945. Feller was decorated with six campaign ribbons and eight <a href="battle%20star">battle star</a>s while serving on missions in both the Pacific and North Atlantic, and he was made an honorary member of the <a href="Green%20Berets">Green Berets</a> later in life.

Feller pitched for the Norfolk Naval Station's Bluejackets baseball team, which in 1942 went 92-8, and later for the <a href="Naval%20Station%20Great%20Lakes">Naval Station Great Lakes</a> team.

In the period from early spring 1945 to late summer 1945, Feller's naval duties were again at Great Lakes Naval station, where he replaced <a href="Mickey%20Cochrane">Mickey Cochrane</a> as manager of the baseball program, as well as an active pitcher for the team.

Upon arrival in Cleveland after his discharge, Feller was honored with a civic luncheon on August 24, 1945, with more than 1,000 people in attendance at the Carter Hotel. Feller said to the crowd: "The real heroes didn't come home." Later that day, the city held a parade and Feller was the starting pitcher in the Indians' game against the Detroit Tigers. Feller allowed four hits in the game and earned a win in the Indians' 4–2 victory. "I was so tired from all the receptions I didn't know if I could finish the game", Feller said. For the 1945 season, he appeared in nine games and notched a 5–3 record with 59 strikeouts and 2.50 ERA.

Before the 1946 season, Feller signed a $50,000 contract for the year, including a bonus for attendance, as the Indians felt many were attending baseball games primarily to see him; he was offered $100,000 by <a href="Jorge%20Pasquel">Jorge Pasquel</a> to play in the <a href="Mexican%20League">Mexican League</a>, but declined to leave the States again. Feller recorded his second career no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the New York Yankees. He allowed five walks and struck out 11 Yankees. Feller said of the game, "The no-hitter on opening day in Chicago is the one that gets all the attention. But my no-hitter at Yankee Stadium was against a much better team than the White Sox. There was no comparison. I had to pitch to Tommy Henrich, <a href="Charlie%20Keller">Charlie Keller</a> and Joe DiMaggio in the ninth inning to get the Yankees out." At one point during the season (as Feller thought he might be nearing <a href="Rube%20Waddell">Rube Waddell</a>'s AL record for strikeouts), Feller confirmed Waddell's record of 344 strikeouts with the AL office as opposed to 349. In his last appearance of the season on September 29, Feller threw five strikeouts against the Detroit Tigers to set the then-AL single-season strikeout record. During the 1946 season, he registered career-highs in strikeouts (348), games started (42) and games pitched (48), shutouts (10), complete games (36) and innings pitched (377.1)—all major league bests that season. Feller finished 26–15 with an ERA of 2.18, the latter a career-low. Nearly 20 years later, Feller recalled, "For the 1946 season, though, the Indians were so thin in pitching that Boudreau decided I was to pitch every fourth day, regardless of rainouts, open dates, or anything else."

Feller began 1947 by setting up a <a href="barnstorm%20%28sports%29">barnstorming</a> tour, pitting his own selected team against a <a href="Negro%20league%20baseball">Negro league baseball</a> team led by <a href="Satchel%20Paige">Satchel Paige</a>. Feller's team included <a href="Stan%20Musial">Stan Musial</a> and <a href="Phil%20Rizzuto">Phil Rizzuto</a> while Paige's included <a href="Buck%20O%27Neil">Buck O'Neil</a> and <a href="Hilton%20Smith">Hilton Smith</a>. They played in 22 games across the United States, and at the conclusion of the tour, each player had made nearly as much money as the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> made as a team for their <a href="1946%20World%20Series">1946 World Series</a> win. Against the St. Louis Browns in Feller's second start of the season, he extended his major league record for one-hitters when he recorded his ninth one-hit game in a shutout win on April 22. In a June 13 game against the Philadelphia Athletics, having already amassed 10 strikeouts through four innings, Feller fell from the mound, which rain had made slippery, and injured his back. "My fastball was never the same after that", Feller said. He ended the season as the AL leader in wins (20) and shutouts (5), and led the majors in strikeouts (196) and innings pitched (299).

In <a href="1948%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1948</a>, the Indians had one of their finest seasons, though Feller experienced a season that had more ups and downs. Feller was selected to represent the AL All-Stars for the seventh time in his career in the <a href="1948%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1948 All-Star Game</a> but declined to play, feeling that his performance did not warrant selection as an All-Star. At one point he was winless for a month, and by July 22, his record was 9–12. <a href="Lou%20Boudreau">Lou Boudreau</a>, the Indians' <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a>, declared "we sink or swim with Feller", and continued to pick him. Feller proceeded to go 10–3 for the remainder of his appearances to finish the season with a record of 19–15, a league-leading 164 strikeouts, and a 3.56 ERA. The Indians won a one-game playoff against the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> to determine the team to represent the AL in the World Series; it was the first time the team had won the pennant since the 1920 season.

Feller started Game One of the 1948 World Series against the NL-champion <a href="Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29">Boston Braves</a>. In the eighth inning, Feller and Boudreau appeared to have picked off the Braves' <a href="Phil%20Masi">Phil Masi</a> as he attempted to <a href="stolen%20base">steal a base</a>, but umpire <a href="Bill%20Stewart%20%28sports%20official%29">Bill Stewart</a> ruled he was safe. Masi scored the only run of the game on a Braves single. Despite surrendering just two hits on 85 pitches for the game, Feller and the Indians lost 1–0. Later, photographs showed that Boudreau had tagged Masi out by two feet. Feller said, "Stewart was the only guy in the park who thought he was safe." Feller was again named the starter in Game Five, which set an attendance record; the 86,288 fans in Cleveland was the then-largest attendance at a baseball game. The Braves put up three runs in the top of the first inning. The Indians came back to tie the game, but by the seventh inning the Braves regained the lead for good and Feller was removed from the game. He finished having allowed eight hits and seven earned runs. Lemon won Game Six and gave the Indians their second World Series championship. After the Indians returned to Cleveland and were given a victory parade, Feller said, "This is as good as being President."

After taking a pay cut to start the 1949 season, Feller pitched on Opening Day against the St. Louis Browns. During the game, he injured his shoulder and missed the rest of April. His performances were mixed in the rest of the season and he finished the year with a 15-14 record and a 3.75 ERA. Before the 1950 season, Feller suggested to Indians management he take a pay cut, and did so. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg said, "He himself made the suggestion. In fact, he offered to take more than the 25 per cent maximum pay cut allowed. There was absolutely nothing to it. We all agreed quickly on the figure after Bob showed up yesterday." In a win over the Detroit Tigers in the second game of a doubleheader, Feller became the 53rd pitcher to win 200 games. Throughout the year, players noted that his velocity had returned, and, winning games with finesse rather than power, he was again effective. He finished the year with 16 wins and a 3.43 ERA.

On July 1, 1951, Feller recorded his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. "I was depending on my slider and I didn't begin to think of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to keep it in the back of my mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after <a href="Larry%20Corcoran">Larry Corcoran</a> and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with <a href="Early%20Wynn">Early Wynn</a> and <a href="Mike%20Garcia%20%28baseball%2C%20born%201923%29">Mike Garcia</a>, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the <a href="Sporting%20News%20Pitcher%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">"Sporting News" Pitcher of the Year</a>.

Feller started the 1952 season with three wins in his first five starts; one of the losses was an April 23 one-hitter against <a href="Bob%20Cain">Bob Cain</a>, who also allowed only one hit. Feller struggled for the rest of the season, and after an argument with an umpire over a strike call in late August, manager <a href="Al%20L%C3%B3pez">Al López</a> shut Feller down for the season. He finished the season with a 9–13 record and a 4.74 ERA. He improved the following year, winning 10 games and losing 7 in 25 starts after Lopez gave him extra days of rest between appearances. The Indians won 111 regular season games during 1954, beating an AL record previously held by the <a href="1927%20New%20York%20Yankees">1927 New York Yankees</a>. The 35-year-old Feller finished 13–3 on the year, earning his 250th pitching victory in a May 23 win and his 2,500th career strikeout in a win on June 12.

The Indians played against the <a href="History%20of%20the%20New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> in the <a href="1954%20World%20Series">1954 World Series</a>, but unlike the 1948 Series, Feller did not make an appearance. The Indians were swept in four games by the Giants. Indians manager Al López said of not starting Feller, "I know Feller wanted to start one of the games in the 1954 World Series (when the Indians were swept by the New York Giants), though we never really talked about it ... If we had won the first or second game in New York, I was going to start Feller in Cleveland in the fourth game. But when we didn't (win either game in New York), why in the hell was I going to pitch Feller? He was the fifth starter on the club at that time, and wasn't the Feller he'd been (earlier in his career)." In 1955, Feller spent part of the season as a starter, then was moved to the bullpen later in the season. He won and lost four games each in 25 appearances. During the offseason, he became chairman of the Ohio <a href="March%20of%20Dimes">March of Dimes</a> and served as player representative for the American League. He worked with <a href="National%20League">National League</a> representative <a href="Robin%20Roberts%20%28baseball%29">Robin Roberts</a> throughout the offseason, discussing the possibility of player arbitration and pensions with baseball owners; he then became president of the Baseball Players' Association.

In the 1956 season, Feller started four games and appeared in 15 others, and finished with an 0–4 record and career-worst 4.97 ERA. The Indians held "Bob Feller Night" on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told "The Plain Dealer": "I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time." Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or a job with the Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, "We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, there will always be a job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization." On December 28 Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, "I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken the edge off the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years." He continued, "What if I did pitch another year, so what? I would have to come to the decision I am making now, some time."
He spent his entire career of 18 seasons with the Indians, being one of "The Big Four" in the Indians' pitching rotation in the 1950s, along with <a href="Bob%20Lemon">Bob Lemon</a>, Early Wynn and Mike Garcia. Feller shares the Major League record of 12 one-hitters with <a href="Nolan%20Ryan">Nolan Ryan</a>, and was the first pitcher to win 20 or more games before the age of 21. He ended his career with 266 wins, 2,581 strikeouts and 279 complete games. Over the course of his career, he led the AL in strikeouts seven times and walks four times. Upon his retirement, Feller held the major league record for most walks in a career (1,764), and holds the 20th-century record for most walks in a season (208 in 1938). The Indians retired his jersey number, 19, on December 27, 1956.

In 1962, Feller was elected to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum</a> along with <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>. Both were the first to be elected on their first ballot appearance since the original induction class of 1936. At the time of his induction only <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> (98.2%), Babe Ruth (95.1%), and <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a> (95.1%) had a higher percentage of ballot votes. In 2010, after Feller had been admitted to hospice, a reporter released a story recalling a 2007 interview with an aged Feller where he brought up Feller and Robinson's occasional dislike for each other. "They overhyped Jackie Robinson. He was a good baserunner. He was a fair hitter. He was an average second baseman. He was not as good a ballplayer as <a href="Larry%20Doby">Larry Doby</a>. There were a lot of better black ballplayers than Jackie Robinson," said Feller.

Throughout his career, Feller played exhibition games during the off-season, playing in towns unaccustomed to seeing major league ballplayers. His exhibition tours often featured other big leaguers and <a href="Negro%20league%20baseball">Negro League</a> players, like <a href="Satchel%20Paige">Satchel Paige</a>, who was also a teammate of Feller's with the Indians. Other players included <a href="Stan%20Musial">Stan Musial</a>, <a href="Mickey%20Vernon">Mickey Vernon</a>, and <a href="Jeff%20Heath">Jeff Heath</a>. During a barnstorming tour in 1945, Feller pitched against <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> after he had been signed by the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>. He told a reporter in Los Angeles he believed Robinson was too muscle-bound to succeed against pitching in the major leagues although Robinson recorded two hits off Feller. Players had to notify the Commissioner of Baseball, <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A.B. "Happy" Chandler</a>, before participating in exhibition games and were not allowed to begin games before the conclusion of the major-league season. Feller wrote to Chandler, challenging the league's limit on the number of games that were allowed to be played and proposing an increase; the Commissioner agreed to Feller's proposal. To minimize travel time, Feller employed airplanes, such as two <a href="Douglas%20DC-3">DC-3</a>s in 1947, to transport players from town to town. Feller's involvement, as well as that of other major league players, was the subject of meetings between the Commissioner and AL and NL presidents.

In 1947, Feller announced that he would pitch in the <a href="Cuban%20League">Cuban winter league</a> during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession". Feller also believed it was "grossly unfair" that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him." Feller's barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details made him one of the wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer <a href="John%20Sickels">John Sickels</a> suggested: "They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro League players were just as good as the Major League players."

Feller estimated that military service cost him at least 100 career wins. Based on his exceptional 1941 and 1946 seasons, it is likely that Feller would have finished his career with more than 300 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts. Feller said "I know in my heart I would have ended up a lot closer to 400 than 300 if I hadn't spent four seasons in the Navy. But don't take that as a complaint. I'm happy I got home in one piece."

There is footage of a Feller fastball being clocked by Army ordnance equipment (used to measure <a href="artillery%20shell">artillery shell</a> velocity) and registering at . However, this took place in the later years of his career and the speed of the ball was measured as it crossed the plate (whereas later methods measure the speed as it leaves the pitcher's hand). With primitive equipment Feller was at one point measured at . Feller once mentioned that he was clocked at at Lincoln Park in Chicago. He also threw the second fastest pitch ever officially recorded, at , in a game in 1946 at <a href="Griffith%20Stadium">Griffith Stadium</a>. Feller said a 1974 test involving Nolan Ryan would be evaluated when he threw the ball rather than when it reached home plate, and as columnist Milton Richman wrote, Feller said "<a href="Sandy%20Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a> had the best live fast ball he ever saw." 
<a href="Ted%20Williams">Ted Williams</a> said, "Three days before he pitched I would start thinking about Robert Feller, Bob Feller. I'd sit in my room thinking about him all the time. God I loved it ... <a href="Allie%20Reynolds">Allie Reynolds</a> of the Yankees was tough, and I might think about him for 24 hours before a game, but Robert Feller: I'd think about him for three days." Feller was ranked 36th on "<a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a>"'s list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's "greatest pitcher of his time" as well as a finalist for the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Century%20Team">Major League Baseball All-Century Team</a> in 1999. Each year, <a href="American%20Legion%20Baseball%23Awards">American Legion Baseball</a> presents the "Bob Feller Pitching Award" to the pitcher "with the most strikeouts in regional and national competition."

Feller was elected the inaugural president of the Major League Baseball Players' Association in 1956. As president, he appeared before <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to speak about baseball's <a href="reserve%20clause">reserve clause</a>. Feller was the first player to get a franchise to agree to a share of game receipts when he was the starting pitcher for Indians' games. He was also the earliest player to <a href="Incorporation%20%28business%29">incorporate</a> himself (as Ro-Fel, Inc.). He was also one of the first players to work for the right of a player to enter <a href="Free%20agent">free agency</a>.

Feller and his wife, Virginia Winther, had three sons, Steve, Martin, and Bruce. The couple divorced in 1971; from the divorce settlement, Virginia received the house she and Feller had built. Virginia died on May 6, 1981 in her home in <a href="Shaker%20Heights%2C%20Ohio">Shaker Heights, Ohio</a>. In retirement, Feller lived with his second wife, Anne Feller, in <a href="Gates%20Mills%2C%20Ohio">Gates Mills</a>, a suburb of Cleveland.

Feller is credited with being the first baseball star to sign autographs at baseball memorabilia conventions, and was such a frequent guest at such events that one <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> writer speculated that he may have signed more autographs than any other person.

In June 2009, at the age of 90, Feller was one of the starting pitchers at the inaugural <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Classic">Baseball Hall of Fame Classic</a>, which replaced the <a href="Doubleday%20Field">Hall of Fame Game</a> at <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, New York</a>. Feller was treated for <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> in August 2010. By October, Feller was fitted with a <a href="pacemaker">pacemaker</a> and was diagnosed with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="Candidiasis">thrush</a>, an infection of the mucous membrane lining the mouth and throat. He was transferred on December 8 from the <a href="Cleveland%20Clinic">Cleveland Clinic</a> to <a href="hospice%20care">hospice care</a>. On December 15, Feller died of complications from leukemia at 92.

Of Feller's death, Mike Hegan, Indians broadcaster and son of former Feller teammate and battery mate <a href="Jim%20Hegan">Jim Hegan</a>, stated, "The Indians of the 40s and 50s were the face of the city of Cleveland and Bob was the face of the Indians. But, Bob transcended more than that era. In this day of free agency and switching teams, Bob Feller remained loyal to the city and the team for over 70 years. You will likely not see that kind of mutual loyalty and admiration ever again." In 2010, the "Cleveland Indians Man of the Year Award" was renamed the "<a href="Bob%20Feller%20Man%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Bob Feller Man of the Year Award</a>".

On Opening Day of the 2011 season, the Indians invited Feller's widow, Anne, to present a silent first pitch. During pregame introductions, Cleveland players wore a No. 19 jersey in honor of Feller. For the entire 2011 season the players' uniforms were outfitted with an outline of Feller's pitching motion. The organization also made a permanent memorial of the press-box seat that Feller used in later life.

The Bob Feller Museum opened in Van Meter, Iowa, on June 10, 1995. Designed by Feller's son Stephen, on land donated by Brenton Banks, the museum has two rooms that contain Feller memorabilia and items from his own collection. The Feller bat used by Babe Ruth when he made his last public appearance at Yankee Stadium is at the museum. Feller said a teammate had stolen the bat and eventually it was purchased by the sports card company <a href="Upper%20Deck">Upper Deck</a> for $107,000. Feller later offered the company $95,000 in return for the bat.

Branded to Kill

The studio was unhappy with the original script and called in Suzuki to rewrite and direct it at the last minute. Suzuki came up with many of his ideas the night before or on the set while <a href="Filmmaking">filming</a>, and welcomed ideas from his collaborators. He gave the film a <a href="Satire">satirical</a>, anarchic and visually eclectic bent which the studio had previously warned him away from. It was a commercial and critical disappointment and Suzuki was ostensibly fired for making "movies that make no sense and no money". Suzuki successfully sued Nikkatsu with support from student groups, like-minded filmmakers and the general public and caused a major controversy through the Japanese film industry. Suzuki was <a href="blacklist">blacklist</a>ed and did not make another feature film for 10 years but became a <a href="counterculture">counterculture</a> hero.

The film grew a strong following, which expanded overseas in the 1980s, and has established itself as a <a href="Cult%20film">cult classic</a>. Film critics and enthusiasts now regard it as an <a href="Absurdism">absurdist</a> <a href="masterpiece">masterpiece</a>. It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as <a href="Jim%20Jarmusch">Jim Jarmusch</a>, <a href="John%20Woo">John Woo</a>, <a href="Chan-wook%20Park">Chan-wook Park</a> and <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>, and composer <a href="John%20Zorn">John Zorn</a>. Thirty-four years after "Branded to Kill", Suzuki filmed "<a href="Pistol%20Opera">Pistol Opera</a>" (2001) with Nikkatsu, a loose sequel to the former. The company has also hosted two major <a href="retrospective">retrospective</a>s spotlighting his career.

Goro Hanada, the Japanese underworld's third-ranked hitman, and his wife, Mami, fly into <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> and are met by Kasuga, a formerly ranked hitman turned taxi driver. Kasuga petitions Hanada to assist him in breaking back into the profession. Hanada agrees and the three go to a club owned by the <a href="yakuza">yakuza</a> boss Michihiko Yabuhara. The two men are hired to escort a client from Sagami Beach to <a href="Nagano%2C%20Nagano">Nagano</a>. After the meeting, Yabuhara covertly seduces Hanada's wife.

Hanada and Kasuga pick up a car designated for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in the back seat. They dispose of the body, then meet the client and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a <a href="Death%20drive">deathwish</a>, stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.

Yabuhara hires Hanada to kill four men, the first three being a customs officer, an <a href="ocularist">ocularist</a> and a jewellery dealer. Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter leans over the sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts his way into the third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears at his door and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.

During the job a <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a> lands on the barrel of his rifle causing him to miss his target and kill an innocent bystander. Misako tells him that he will now lose his rank and be killed. Hanada makes plans to leave the country but is shot by his wife, who then sets fire to their apartment and flees. His belt buckle, however, stopped the bullet and he escapes the building.

He finds Misako and they go to her apartment. After alternating failed attempts by him to seduce her and them to kill each other, she succumbs to his advances when he promises to kill her. Afterwards, he finds he cannot as he has fallen in love with her. In a state of confusion he wanders the streets and passes out on the side of the road. The next day he finds his wife at Yabuhara's club. She tries to seduce him, then fakes hysteria and tells him Yabuhara paid her to kill him and that the three men he had killed had stolen from Yabuhara's diamond smuggling operation, and the foreigner was an investigator sent by the supplier. Unmoved, Hanada kills her, gets drunk and waits for Yabuhara to return. Yabuhara arrives already dead with a bullet hole through the centre of his forehead.

Hanada returns to Misako's apartment where a film projector has been set up. It depicts Misako bound and tortured and directs him to a <a href="Breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a>, where the following day he is to be killed. Hanada submits to the demand but kills the killers instead. The former client arrives and announces himself as the legendary Number One Killer. He says he will kill Hanada but, in thanks for the work he has done, is only giving a warning at present.

Hanada holes up in Misako's apartment and Number One begins an extended siege, taunting Hanada with threatening phone calls and forbidding him to leave the apartment. Eventually, Number One moves in with the now exhausted and inebriated Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him. They agree to a temporary truce and set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day and then disappears during the meal.

At the apartment, Hanada finds a note and another film from Number One stating he will be waiting at a <a href="gym">gym</a>nasium with Misako. Hanada waits at the gymnasium but Number One does not show. As a bedraggled Hanada rises to leave, a tape recorder switches on explaining, "This is the way Number One works", he exhausts you and then kills you. Hanada puts a headband across his forehead and climbs into a boxing ring. Number One appears and shoots him. The headband stops the bullet and Hanada returns fire. Number One slumps to the ground but manages to shoot him a few times before dying. Hanada leaps and staggers around the ring declaring himself the new Number One. Misako enters the arena and, crazed, he instinctively shoots her dead, then falls from the ring.


The <a href="Nikkatsu">Nikkatsu</a> Company conceived "Branded to Kill" as a low-budget hitman film, a subgenre of the studio's yakuza-oriented movies. Their standard <a href="B%20movie">B movie</a> <a href="shooting%20schedule">shooting schedule</a> was applied, one week for <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a>, 25 days to <a href="Filmmaking">shoot</a> and three days for <a href="post-production">post-production</a>. The budget was set at approximately <a href="Japanese%20yen">yen</a>. Shortly before filming began, with the release date already set, the script was deemed "inappropriate" by the head office and contract <a href="Film%20director">director</a> <a href="Seijun%20Suzuki">Seijun Suzuki</a> was brought in to do a rewrite. Studio head Kyūsaku Hori told Suzuki he had had to read it twice before he understood it. Suzuki suggested they drop the script but was ordered to proceed. The rewrite was done with his frequent collaborator <a href="Takeo%20Kimura">Takeo Kimura</a> and six <a href="assistant%20director">assistant director</a>s, including Atsushi Yamatoya (who also played Killer Number Four). The eight men had worked under the joint <a href="pen%20name">pen name</a> Hachiro Guryu ("Group of Eight") since the mid-1960s. Nikkatsu was building <a href="leading%20man">leading man</a> Joe Shishido into a star and assigned him to the film. They specified that the script was to be written with this aim. The film also marks Shishido's first nude scene. Suzuki originally wanted <a href="Kiwako%20Taichi">Kiwako Taichi</a>, a new talent from the famous theatre troupe <a href="Bungakuza">Bungakuza</a>, for the <a href="Leading%20lady">female lead</a> but she took a part in another film. Instead, Suzuki selected <a href="Annu%20Mari">Annu Mari</a>, another new actress who had been working in Nikkatsu's music halls. In casting the role of Hanada's wife, Suzuki selected Mariko Ogawa from outside of the studio as none of the contract actresses would do nude scenes.

Suzuki did not use <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>s and disliked pre-planning. He preferred to come up with ideas either the night before or on the set as he felt that the only person who should know what is going to happen is the director. He also felt that it was sudden inspiration that made the picture. An example is the addition of the Number Three Killer's rice-sniffing habit. Suzuki explained that he wanted to present a quintessentially "<a href="Japanese%20people">Japanese</a>" killer, "If he were Italian, he'd get turned on by macaroni, right?" Suzuki has commended Shishido on his similar drive to make the action scenes as physical and interesting as possible. In directing his actors, Suzuki let them play their roles as they saw fit and only intervened when they went "off track". For nude scenes the actors wore "<a href="maebari">maebari</a>", or adhesive strips, over their genitals in accordance with <a href="censorship">censorship</a> practices. The film was edited in one day, a task made easy by Suzuki's method of shooting only the necessary footage. He had picked up the habit during his years working as an assistant director for <a href="Shochiku">Shochiku</a> when <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a> remained sparse after <a href="World%20War%20II">the war</a>. <a href="Post-production">Post-production</a> was completed on June 14, 1967, the day before the film was released.

Like many of its yakuza film contemporaries, "Branded to Kill" shows the influence of the <a href="James%20Bond%20film%20series">James Bond films</a> and <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, though the film's conventional genre basis was combined with <a href="satire">satire</a>, <a href="kabuki">kabuki</a> stylistics and a <a href="Pop%20art%20in%20Japan">pop art</a> aesthetic. It was further set apart from its peers, and Seijun Suzuki's previous films, through its <a href="Gothic%20fiction">gothic</a> sensibilities, unusual atonal score and what artist and academic <a href="Philip%20Brophy">Philip Brophy</a> called a "heightened otherness". The result has been alternately ascribed as a work of <a href="surrealism">surrealism</a>, <a href="absurdism">absurdism</a>, the <a href="avant%20garde">avant garde</a> and included in the <a href="Japanese%20New%20Wave">Japanese New Wave</a> movement, though not through any stated intention of its director. Suzuki employed a wide variety of techniques and claimed his singular focus was to make the film as entertaining as possible.

Genre conventions are satirized and mocked throughout the film. In American noirs, heroes, or <a href="anti-hero">anti-hero</a>es, typically strive to be the best in their field. Here the process was formalized into a rankings system obsessed over by its players. The <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>—a noir staple—Misako, does not simply entice the protagonist and bring the threat of death but obsesses him and is obsessed with all things death herself. She tries to kill him, wants to kill herself and surrounds herself with dead things. Hanada's libido is as present as that of the protagonists of similar films of the period, such as <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a>, though perversely exaggerated. Reviewer Rumsey Taylor likened Hanada's boiled rice sniffing fetish to Bond's "<a href="shaken%2C%20not%20stirred">shaken, not stirred</a>" martini order. The film also deviates from the opening killer-for-hire scenario to touch on such varied subgenres as <a href="Psychosexual%20development">psychosexual</a> romance, American Gothic thriller and "<a href="The%20Odd%20Couple%20%28film%29">Odd Couple</a>" <a href="slapstick">slapstick</a>.

The film industry is a subject of satire as well. For example, Japanese <a href="censorship">censorship</a> often involved masking prohibited sections of the screen. Here Suzuki preemptively masked his own compositions but animated them and incorporated them into the film's design. In the story, after Hanada finds he is unable to kill Misako he wanders the streets in a state of confusion. The screen is obscured by animated images with accompanying sounds associated to her. The effects contributed to the eclectic visual and sound design while signifying his obsessive love. Author Stephen Teo proposed that the antagonistic relationship between Hanada and Number One may have been analogous of Suzuki's relationship with studio president Kyūsaku Hori. He compared Hanada's antagonizers to those who had been pressuring Suzuki to rein in his style over the previous two years. Teo cited Number One's sleeping with his eyes open and urinating where he sits, which the character explains as techniques one must master to become a "top professional."

The film was shot in black and white Nikkatsuscope (synonymous with <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a> at a 2.35:1 <a href="Aspect%20ratio%20%28image%29">aspect ratio</a>). Due to the wide frame, moving a character forward did not produce the dynamic effect Suzuki desired. Instead, he relied on spotlighting and <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a> imagery to create excitement and suspense. Conventional framing and <a href="film%20grammar">film grammar</a> were disregarded in favour of spontaneous inspiration. In editing, Suzuki frequently abandoned continuity, favouring abstract jumps in time and space as he found it made the film more interesting. Critic David Chute suggested that Suzuki's stylistics had intensified—in seeming congruence with the studio's demands that he conform:

"Branded to Kill" was released to Japanese theatres on June 15, 1967, in a <a href="Double%20feature">double bill</a> with <a href="Sh%C5%8Dgor%C5%8D%20Nishimura">Shōgorō Nishimura</a>'s "<a href="Burning%20Nature">Burning Nature</a>". The films were financially unsuccessful and the former fared likewise among critics. "<a href="Kinema%20Junpo">Kinema Junpo</a>" magazine reported that the films "resulted in less than viewers at <a href="Asakusa">Asakusa</a> and <a href="Shinjuku%2C%20Tokyo">Shinjuku</a> and about 500 at <a href="Y%C5%ABrakuch%C5%8D">Yurakucho</a> on the second day." Both <a href="Joe%20Shishido">Joe Shishido</a> and Yamatoya Atsushi later recounted having seen "Branded to Kill" in practically empty theatres, the latter on its opening night. Iijima Kōichi, a critic for the film journal "Eiga Geijutsu", wrote that "the woman buys a mink coat and thinks only about having sex. The man wants to kill and feels nostalgic about the smell of boiling rice. We cannot help being confused. We do not go to theaters to be puzzled." <a href="Nikkatsu">Nikkatsu</a> Studios had been criticized for catering to rebellious youth audiences, a specialty of contract director Seijun Suzuki, whose films had grown increasingly anarchic through the 1960s. This had earned him a large following but it had also drawn the ire of studio head Kyūsaku Hori. On April 25, 1968, Suzuki received a telephone call from a company secretary informing him that he would not be receiving his salary that month. Two of Suzuki's friends met with Hori the next day and were told, "Suzuki's films were incomprehensible, that they did not make any money and that Suzuki might as well give up his career as a director as he would not be making films for any other companies."

A student <a href="film%20society">film society</a> run by Kazuko Kawakita, the Cineclub Study Group, was planning to include "Branded to Kill" in a retrospective honouring Suzuki's works but Hori refused them and withdrew all of his films from circulation. With support from the Cineclub, similar student groups, fellow filmmakers and the general public—which included the <a href="Picketing%20%28protest%29">picketing</a> of the company's Hibiya offices and the formation of the Seijun Suzuki Joint Struggle Committee—Suzuki sued Nikkatsu for wrongful dismissal. During the three-and-a-half year trial the circumstances under which the film was made and Suzuki was fired came to light. He had been made into a <a href="scapegoat">scapegoat</a> for the company's dire financial straits and was meant to serve as an example on the outset of an attempted company-wide restructuring. A <a href="Settlement%20%28law%29">settlement</a> was reached on December 24, 1971, in the amount of one million yen, a fraction of his original claim, as well as a public apology from Hori. In a separate agreement "Branded to Kill" and his previous film, "<a href="Fighting%20Elegy">Fighting Elegy</a>", were donated to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art%2C%20Tokyo">Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art</a>'s Film Centre. The events turned Suzuki into a legend and shook the film world. "Branded to Kill", along with other of his films, played to "packed audiences who wildly applauded" at all-night revivals in and around Tokyo. However, Suzuki was <a href="blacklist">blacklist</a>ed by the major studios and did not make another feature film until "<a href="A%20Tale%20of%20Sorrow%20and%20Sadness">A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness</a>" (1977) ten years after "Branded to Kill". In the meantime, he subsisted on commercial and television work and writing books of essays.

"Branded to Kill" first reached international audiences in the 1980s, featuring in various <a href="film%20festival">film festival</a>s and retrospectives dedicated wholly or partially to Suzuki, which was followed by home video releases in the late 1990s. It garnered a reputation as one of his most unconventional, revered Nikkatsu films and an international <a href="Cult%20film">cult classic</a>. It has been declared a <a href="masterpiece">masterpiece</a> by the likes of film critic Chuck Stephens, writer and musician <a href="Chris%20D.">Chris D.</a>, composer <a href="John%20Zorn">John Zorn</a> and film director <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>. Writer and critic <a href="Tony%20Rayns">Tony Rayns</a> noted, "Suzuki mocks everything from the clichés of yakuza fiction to the conventions of Japanese censorship in this extraordinary thriller, which rivals <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>' "<a href="The%20Lady%20from%20Shanghai">Lady from Shanghai</a>" in its harsh eroticism, not to mention its visual fireworks." Modified comparisons to the films of a "gonzo <a href="Samuel%20Fuller">Sam Fuller</a>", or <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>, assuming one "factor[s] out Godard's politics and self-consciousness", are not uncommon. In a 1992 "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine article, film director <a href="Jim%20Jarmusch">Jim Jarmusch</a> affectionately recommended it as, "Probably the strangest and most perverse 'hit man' story in cinema." Jasper Sharp of the Midnight Eye wrote, "[It] is a bloody marvellous looking film and arguably the pinnacle of the director's strikingly eclectic style."

However, the workings of the plot remain elusive to most. Sharp digressed, "[T]o be honest it isn't the most accessible of films and for those unfamiliar with Suzuki's unorthodox and seemingly disjointed style it will probably take a couple of viewings before the bare bones of the plot begin to emerge." As Zorn has put it, "plot and narrative devices take a back seat to mood, music, and the sensuality of visual images." Japanese film historian <a href="Donald%20Richie">Donald Richie</a> thus encapsulated the film, "An inventive and ultimately anarchic take on gangster thrillers. [The] script flounders midway and Suzuki tries on the bizarre for its own sake." David Chute conceded that in labeling the film incomprehensible, "[i]f you consider the movie soberly, it's hard to deny the bosses had a point". On a conciliatory note, Rayns commented, "Maybe the break with Nikkatsu was inevitable; it's hard to see how Suzuki could have gone further in the genre than this."

After another unrelated 10-year hiatus, Suzuki and Nikkatsu reunited for the "Style to Kill" retrospective, held in April, 2001, at Theatre Shinjuku in Tokyo. It featured 28 films by Suzuki, including "Branded to Kill". Suzuki appeared at the gala opening with star <a href="Annu%20Mari">Annu Mari</a>. Joe Shishido appeared for a talk session at an all-night, four-film screening. An accompanying "Branded to Kill" visual directory was published. The following year, the Tanomi Company produced a limited edition "Joe the Ace" <a href="action%20figure">action figure</a> based on Shishido's character in the film, complete with a miniature <a href="rice%20cooker">rice cooker</a>. In 2006, Nikkatsu celebrated the 50th anniversary of Suzuki's directorial debut by hosting the "Seijun Suzuki 48 Film Challenge" retrospective at the 19th <a href="Tokyo%20International%20Film%20Festival">Tokyo International Film Festival</a>. It showcased all of his films. He and Mari were again in attendance.
As one of Seijun Suzuki's most influential films, "Branded to Kill" has been acknowledged as a source of inspiration by such internationally renowned directors as <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>'s <a href="John%20Woo">John Woo</a>, South Korea's <a href="Chan-wook%20Park">Chan-wook Park</a> and America's <a href="Jim%20Jarmusch">Jim Jarmusch</a> and <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>. Jarmusch listed it as his favourite hitman film, alongside "<a href="Le%20Samoura%C3%AF">Le Samouraï</a>" (also 1967), and thanked Suzuki in the screen credits of his own hitman film "" (1999). Most notably, Jarmusch mirrored a scene in which the protagonist kills a target by shooting up from a basement through a sink drain. He went so far as to screen the film for Suzuki when the two met in Tokyo. Critics have noted "Branded to Kill's" influence on the films of <a href="Wong%20Kar-wai">Wong Kar-wai</a>, such as his hitman film "<a href="Fallen%20Angels%20%281995%20film%29">Fallen Angels</a>" (1995), as well as <a href="Johnnie%20To">Johnnie To</a>'s "<a href="Fulltime%20Killer">Fulltime Killer</a>" (2001). However, "Branded to Kill" was most influential in its native Japan. The film's premise, in which hitmen try to kill each other in competition for the Number One rank, is spoofed in films such as <a href="Takeshi%20Kitano">Takeshi Kitano</a>'s "<a href="Getting%20Any%3F">Getting Any?</a>" (1995) and <a href="Sabu%20%28director%29">Sabu</a>'s "<a href="Postman%20Blues">Postman Blues</a>" (1997), which features a character named Hitman Joe. "Branded to Kill" played a role in the development of the long-running <a href="Lupin%20III">Lupin III</a> franchise. It also had a profound impact, through Suzuki's firing and the resulting student uprising, in the beginnings of the movement film, usually <a href="underground%20film">underground</a> or <a href="anti-establishment">anti-establishment</a> films which focused on issues of import to audiences, as opposed to production line genre pictures.

Thirty-four years after "Branded to Kill", Suzuki directed "<a href="Pistol%20Opera">Pistol Opera</a>" (2001), a loose sequel co-produced by <a href="Shochiku">Shochiku</a> and filmed at Nikkatsu. The character Goro Hanada returns as a mentor figure to the new Number Three, played by <a href="Makiko%20Esumi">Makiko Esumi</a>. However, Joe Shishido was replaced by <a href="Mikijiro%20Hira">Mikijiro Hira</a> in the role of Hanada. Suzuki has said that the original intention was for Shishido to play the character again but that the film's producer, Satoru Ogura, wanted Hira for the role. Reviews were of a favourable nature on par with its predecessor. <a href="Jonathan%20Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> supposed, "Can I call a film a masterpiece without being sure that I understand it? I think so ..." Although some, such as <a href="Elvis%20Mitchell">Elvis Mitchell</a> for <a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>, felt its zeal fell slightly short of the original.

"Branded to Kill" was initially made available in Japan by Nikkatsu in <a href="VHS">VHS</a> format, first on February 10, 1987, then a second version on June 10, 1994. Both versions were censored for nudity with a black bar obscuring half of the frame during the relevant scenes. The first uncensored release since the film's theatrical debut was an October 26, 2001, <a href="DVD-video">DVD</a> from Nikkatsu. It included an interview with <a href="Seijun%20Suzuki">Seijun Suzuki</a>, two with <a href="Joe%20Shishido">Joe Shishido</a>, an <a href="Annu%20Mari">Annu Mari</a> photo gallery and the original <a href="Trailer%20%28promotion%29">film trailers</a> for it and several other Suzuki films. The release was one of three linked to the "Style to Kill" theatrical <a href="retrospective">retrospective</a>. In conjunction with the 50th anniversary of Suzuki's directorial debut, the film was included in the first of two six-film DVD box sets which was released October 1, 2006. All six titles included <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a> tracks featuring Suzuki with various collaborators, those being Annu Mari and <a href="assistant%20director">assistant director</a> Masami Kuzū for "Branded to Kill".

The first North American copy surfaced in the early 1990s at <a href="Kim%27s%20Video%20and%20Music">Kim's Video</a> in New York in a video series titled "Dark of the Sun" devoted to obscure <a href="Asian%20cinema">Asian cinema</a>, assembled by John Zorn, albeit without English <a href="Subtitle%20%28captioning%29">subtitles</a>. <a href="The%20Criterion%20Collection">The Criterion Collection</a> released the film in the United States and Canada on <a href="laserdisc">laserdisc</a> in 1998, followed by a DVD on February 23, 1999, both containing a 15-minute interview with Suzuki, poster gallery of Shishido films and liner notes by Zorn. Home Vision Cinema release a VHS version on June 16, 2000. Both companies conjunctively released "Tokyo Drifter" in all three formats in addition to a VHS collection packaging the two films together. In the United Kingdom, Second Sight Films released a DVD on February 25, 2002, and a VHS on March 11, 2002. Yume Pictures released a new DVD on February 26, 2007, as a part of their Suzuki collection, featuring a 36-minute interview with the director, trailers and liner notes by Tony Rayns. <a href="Madman%20Entertainment">Madman Entertainment</a>'s <a href="Eastern%20Eye">Eastern Eye</a> label released the film on DVD in Australia and New Zealand on May 2, 2007. It also contained the original trailer, a photo gallery and liner notes.

Forty years after the film's original release, on February 23, 2007, the Japanese record label Think issued the soundtrack on Compact Disc through its "Cine Jazz" series, which focused on 1960s Nikkatsu <a href="action%20film">action film</a>s. The music was culled from Naozumi Yamamoto's score. Atsushi Yamatoya wrote the lyrics for the "Killing Blues" themes. Listings 27 through 29 are bonus <a href="karaoke">karaoke</a> tracks.

Steve Lukather

Steven Lee Lukather (born October 21, 1957) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer, best known as a founding member of <a href="Toto%20%28band%29">Toto</a>. A prolific <a href="session%20musician">session musician</a>, Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather was a prominent contributor to several studio albums by <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, including "<a href="Thriller%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Thriller</a>", the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20albums">best-selling album of all time</a>. Lukather has released seven solo albums, the latest of which, "<a href="Transition%20%28Steve%20Lukather%20album%29">Transition</a>", was released in January 2013.

In 1976, when Lukather was nineteen years old, he was invited by his high school friends <a href="David%20Paich">David Paich</a> and the Porcaro brothers <a href="Steve%20Porcaro">Steve</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Porcaro">Jeff</a> to join them in forming their band, Toto. He has been a member of the band ever since it began, and is still fully contributing to their album composition and touring. Lukather's reputation as a guitarist and his association with Paich and the Porcaro brothers, who also became established artists, allowed him to secure a steady flow of session work in the 1970s and 1980s. Lukather has been nominated for twelve <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s, and has won five. While his work with Toto was predominantly based on <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a> music and his solo work ventures into <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> and <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, many of Lukather's side-projects are focused on <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a>. He held a long-time collaboration with jazz guitarist <a href="Larry%20Carlton">Larry Carlton</a> that produced a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy</a>-winning live album, and he was a member of the jazz fusion band Los Lobotomys, a collaboration of notable session musicians. Since 2012, Lukather has toured with former <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatles</a> drummer <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a>'s live supergroup, the <a href="Ringo%20Starr%20%26amp%3B%20His%20All-Starr%20Band">All-Starr Band</a>.

Influenced by such blues-rock guitarists as <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Page">Jimmy Page</a>, and such jazz fusion players as <a href="Al%20Di%20Meola">Al Di Meola</a> and <a href="Frank%20Gambale">Frank Gambale</a>, Lukather is known for a "melodic and intense" playing style. He is also recognized for his efficiency in the studio, often recording tracks in one take using minimal sound processing. While he once used many guitar effects in the studio and on stage, he now frequently disparages such practice, and instead advocates clean tones and minimal studio processing. Lukather plays primarily a signature electric guitar manufactured by <a href="Music%20Man%20%28company%29">Ernie Ball Music Man</a> bearing his nickname, Luke. He also plays <a href="Yamaha%20Corporation">Yamaha</a> and <a href="Ovation%20Guitar%20Company">Ovation</a> Adamas series acoustic–electric guitars.

Steven Lee Lukather was born on October 21, 1957, in the <a href="San%20Fernando%20Valley">San Fernando Valley</a>, California. He first played keyboards and drums, and then taught himself how to play the guitar starting at age seven, when his father bought him a Kay acoustic guitar and a copy of <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> album "<a href="Meet%20the%20Beatles">Meet the Beatles</a>". Lukather has said that the album "changed his life" and that he was greatly influenced by the guitar playing of <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a> in particular.

At <a href="Grant%20High%20School%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Grant High School</a>, Lukather met David Paich and the Porcaro brothers (<a href="Jeff%20Porcaro">Jeff</a>, <a href="Steve%20Porcaro">Steve</a>, and <a href="Mike%20Porcaro">Mike</a>), all of whom eventually became members of Toto. Lukather, who had been a self-taught musician, began taking guitar lessons from <a href="Jimmy%20Wyble">Jimmy Wyble</a>. With Wyble, Lukather expanded his knowledge of wider aspects of music, including <a href="orchestration">orchestration</a>. It was during this period in the early 1970s that Lukather became interested in the idea of becoming a <a href="session%20musician">session musician</a>, a <a href="vocation">vocation</a> that provided opportunities to play with a variety of famous musicians.

Jeff Porcaro, who had been playing drums with <a href="Steely%20Dan">Steely Dan</a> since 1973, became a mentor to Lukather and furthered his interest in session work. Lukather's first job in the music industry was studio work with <a href="Boz%20Scaggs">Boz Scaggs</a>, after which Paich and Jeff Porcaro—who had become prominent session musicians in their own right—asked Lukather to join them in forming Toto in 1976 along with <a href="Bobby%20Kimball">Bobby Kimball</a>, <a href="David%20Hungate">David Hungate</a>, and <a href="Steve%20Porcaro">Steve Porcaro</a>.

Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's "<a href="Toto%20%28album%29">Toto</a>"—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role.
Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including <a href="Bobby%20Kimball">Bobby Kimball</a>, <a href="Fergie%20Frederiksen">Fergie Frederiksen</a>, and <a href="Joseph%20Williams%20%28musician%29">Joseph Williams</a>. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, <a href="Jean-Michel%20Byron">Jean-Michel Byron</a>, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's "<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Desire">Kingdom of Desire</a>" and 1995's "<a href="Tambu%20%28album%29">Tambu</a>" except for two instrumental tracks. The "<a href="Tambu%20%28album%29">Tambu</a>" single "I Will Remember", co-written by Lukather and <a href="Stan%20Lynch">Stan Lynch</a>, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some "Tambu" reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of <a href="backup%20singers">backup singers</a> and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's "<a href="Toto%20XX">Toto XX</a>" that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.

Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing almost every track starting in the late 1980s. Lukather admitted that the reason why he has no songwriting contributions on the first two Toto albums was that he wasn't writing many songs at the time, because he was intimidated by the talent of the band's chief songwriter, David Paich. He credits Paich himself with encouraging him to contribute more songs to the band. He wrote very few of Toto's songs by himself, an exception being the hit single "<a href="I%20Won%27t%20Hold%20You%20Back">I Won't Hold You Back</a>" from "<a href="Toto%20IV">Toto IV</a>". Lukather has said that writing lyrics is not one of his strengths. Thus, he collaborated with other band members to complete song ideas and make them into viable album tracks. Lukather's official site claims he contributed to writing all of the songs on Toto's 2006 album "<a href="Falling%20in%20Between">Falling in Between</a>", even though "Spiritual Man" officially credits Paich as the sole writer.

By 2008, Lukather was the only remaining, original Toto member still performing with the band: Bobby Kimball was also in the band at the time, but earlier had been absent from it for some time – whereas Lukather has been with Toto since its formation. However, in June of the same year, Lukather decided to leave Toto. This decision directly led to the official dissolution of the band. In a 2011 interview discussing his career with Toto, Lukather indicated that the band had evolved too far from its original incarnation and that he was dealing with the physical and mental toll of recording and performing. In February 2010, the band announced that they would reunite to support Toto bassist <a href="Mike%20Porcaro">Mike Porcaro</a>, who was diagnosed with <a href="Amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">Lou Gehrig's disease</a>. They continued to tour on a limited basis in 2011 and 2012.

Although Lukather indicated in April 2011 that the band would not record any further material, Toto announced a heavy international tour schedule and new studio album in March 2014. In March 2015 "<a href="Toto%20XIV">Toto XIV</a>" was released.

Lukather achieved notoriaty in the 1970s and 1980s as one of the most sought-after session guitarists in Los Angeles, playing with a wide range of artists from <a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a> to <a href="Warren%20Zevon">Warren Zevon</a>. He has performed on over 1,500 <a href="Gramophone%20record">records</a> spanning 36 years. Music journalist <a href="Jude%20Gold">Jude Gold</a> noted, "It's hard to name a guitarist who has had a more prolific and fulfilling career than Steve Lukather." Lukather credits fellow Toto members <a href="David%20Paich">David Paich</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Porcaro">Jeff Porcaro</a> for getting him exposure in the industry—although he lamented in an April 2011 interview that opportunities for <a href="session%20musician">session musician</a>s have curtailed in recent years: "There is no 'session guy' thing any more—not like it was. It's not like the old days when I was doing 25 sessions a week. All the studios are gone. The budgets are gone. The record companies are all gone." His own output as a session musician has slowed along with the rest of the <a href="music%20industry">industry</a>—as of 2009, Lukather stated he was only doing a few sessions a year.

Named by <a href="Gibson%20Guitar%20Corporation">Gibson Guitar Corporation</a> as one of the Top 10 session guitarists of all time, Lukather has performed on many notable tracks. He performed the guitar solo for <a href="Olivia%20Newton-John">Olivia Newton-John</a>'s popular 1981 single "<a href="Physical%20%28Olivia%20Newton-John%20song%29">Physical</a>", which was "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"'s Number One single of the 1980s. Other notable session performances include <a href="Earth%2C%20Wind%20%26amp%3B%20Fire">Earth, Wind & Fire</a>'s "<a href="Faces%20%28Earth%2C%20Wind%20%26amp%3B%20Fire%20album%29">Faces</a>" album soloing on the tracks "Back on the Road" and "You Went Away", two tracks from the <a href="Lionel%20Richie">Lionel Richie</a> album "<a href="Can%27t%20Slow%20Down%20%28Lionel%20Richie%20album%29">Can't Slow Down</a>", and the <a href="Richard%20Marx">Richard Marx</a> album "<a href="Repeat%20Offender%20%28Richard%20Marx%20album%29">Repeat Offender</a>". Lukather and Jeff Porcaro were heavily involved in the recording of virtually all of Michael Jackson's "<a href="Thriller%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Thriller</a>". In addition to recording guitar tracks, Lukather has also written or produced music for <a href="Lionel%20Richie">Lionel Richie</a>, <a href="Richard%20Marx">Richard Marx</a>, <a href="Chicago%20%28band%29">Chicago</a>, <a href="Donna%20Summer">Donna Summer</a>, and <a href="The%20Tubes">The Tubes</a>. He won a Grammy award in 1982 for the <a href="George%20Benson">George Benson</a> song "<a href="Turn%20Your%20Love%20Around">Turn Your Love Around</a>".

Lukather has released seven solo studio albums: "<a href="Lukather">Lukather</a>" (1989), "<a href="Candyman%20%28album%29">Candyman</a>" (1994), "<a href="Luke%20%28album%29">Luke</a>" (1997), "<a href="Santamental">Santamental</a>" (2003), "<a href="Ever%20Changing%20Times">Ever Changing Times</a>" (2008), "<a href="All%27s%20Well%20That%20Ends%20Well%20%28Steve%20Lukather%20album%29">All's Well That Ends Well</a>" (2010), and "<a href="Transition%20%28Steve%20Lukather%20album%29">Transition</a>" (2013).

The 1989 album "<a href="Lukather">Lukather</a>" came about after Toto had been recording and playing for 11 years, and the consensus among the band members was to take a break. As Lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on Toto albums, he decided to pursue a solo album, with the intention of presenting a dimension of his music that fans would be unfamiliar with. He collaborated with many notable musicians, including <a href="Eddie%20Van%20Halen">Eddie Van Halen</a>, Richard Marx, <a href="Jan%20Hammer">Jan Hammer</a>, <a href="Steve%20Stevens">Steve Stevens</a>, and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich. Lukather has said that the album was produced very simply, and that a lot of ambient studio noise—counting off on various tracks, for instance—is audible on it. He also credits bands <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a>, <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, and guitarists <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Beck">Jeff Beck</a>, and <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> as influences on the album. The single "Swear Your Love" came from the album.

"<a href="Candyman%20%28album%29">Candyman</a>", recorded and mastered from March 1993 through November 1993, was a collaboration of musicians who were for the most part also in Lukather's band Los Lobotomys. Toto familiars <a href="Simon%20Phillips%20%28drummer%29">Simon Phillips</a> and David Paich participated as well as <a href="David%20Garfield">David Garfield</a>, John Peña, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, <a href="Fee%20Waybill">Fee Waybill</a>, <a href="Richard%20Page%20%28musician%29">Richard Page</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Rodgers">Paul Rodgers</a>. Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a>. Some international fans were confused about whether "Candyman" was a Steve Lukather album or a Los Lobotomys album. The Japanese and US releases of "Candyman" were under the Los Lobotomys name rather than Lukather's; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song "<a href="Red%20House%20%28song%29">Red House</a>". The European release of "Candyman" was credited to Lukather alone. Additionally, the touring band for the album was sometimes introduced as "Steve Lukather and Los Lobotomys" and sometimes as just "Los Lobotomys". The song "Borrowed Time" was released as a single in Europe and included "Red House" as a <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side</a>.

Lukather describes 1997's "Luke" as a much different and more "introspective" album than his previous two solo efforts. The album is a concentrated collection of many of Lukather's musical influences, and he deliberately let those influences come out on the album. "Luke" is an experimental album, and like "Candyman" it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards. "Luke" also features instrumentation not heard on previous Lukather albums: <a href="Pedal%20steel%20guitar">pedal steel</a>, <a href="Harmonica">Harmonica</a>s, <a href="Mellotron">Mellotron</a>s, and experimental guitar, bass, and drum sounds. The US version of "Luke" includes a version of the <a href="Jeff%20Beck">Jeff Beck</a> song "The Pump". The song "Hate Everything About U" was released as a single.

"<a href="Santamental">Santamental</a>", released in October 2003, is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, <a href="Slash%20%28musician%29">Slash</a>, <a href="Steve%20Vai">Steve Vai</a>, and drummer <a href="Gregg%20Bissonette">Gregg Bissonette</a>. When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist <a href="Larry%20Carlton">Larry Carlton</a>, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, "But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record."

The musicians Lukather chose for "Santamental", most of whom were involved in the hard-rock genre, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for "<a href="Joy%20to%20the%20World">Joy to the World</a>" after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing. Vai provided guitar work for "<a href="Carol%20of%20the%20Bells">Carol of the Bells</a>" along with Lukather's son Trevor, then 14 years old. Slash, who recorded his part in one take, played on the Lukather/Stan Lynch composition "Broken Heart for Christmas". Lukather spoke highly of Slash after the project, calling him the "<a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a> of our generation". Well-known session guitarist <a href="Michael%20Landau">Michael Landau</a> played on the song "Look Out For Angels", and there is a version of "<a href="Jingle%20Bells">Jingle Bells</a>" featuring a <a href="big%20band">big band</a> and sung by <a href="Sammy%20Davis%2C%20Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a> "Santamental" was recorded in six days, after which Lukather proclaimed it "his first and last Christmas album".

"<a href="Ever%20Changing%20Times">Ever Changing Times</a>", released on February 22, 2008, is a collection of songs Lukather recorded in 2007 between Toto tours. The album contains contributions from fellow session musicians <a href="Bill%20Champlin">Bill Champlin</a>, <a href="Abe%20Laboriel%2C%20Jr.">Abe Laboriel, Jr.</a>, <a href="Leland%20Sklar">Leland Sklar</a>, <a href="Steve%20Porcaro">Steve Porcaro</a>, and many others. Lukather's son Trevor contributed as well. <a href="Joseph%20Williams%20%28musician%29">Joseph Williams</a> provides backing vocals on five of the tracks. Lukather wrote the songs for the album in a hotel room with his son and a handful of other musicians, using basic equipment. His song-writing philosophy is that if a song sounds good with only guitars and vocals, it will likely sound good after a full production. Lukather collaborated with Grammy Award-winning engineer and producer Steve MacMillan on the project, with the goal of introducing some new methods and techniques into the recording process. Lukather described the final tracks as "perfectly imperfect", preferring to record with the five-piece backing band in one room and in one take. MacMillan encouraged Lukather to use "organic, vintage tones". As a result, Lukather eschewed <a href="Effects%20unit">effects</a> and played the guitar parts directly through tube amplifiers manufactured by <a href="Marshall%20Amplification">Marshall</a>, <a href="Vox%20%28musical%20equipment%29">Vox</a>, and some boutique brands. Lukather commented that MacMillan served as a valuable "second set of ears" in the studio, often encouraging him to keep parts that he normally would have discarded. As Toto had recently disbanded when "<a href="Ever%20Changing%20Times">Ever Changing Times</a>" was released, Lukather embarked on a solo tour to promote the album. The shows featured a mixture of songs from the album, songs written for other side projects, and "a few Toto obscurities".

Lukather's sixth studio album, "<a href="All%27s%20Well%20That%20Ends%20Well%20%28Steve%20Lukather%20album%29">All's Well That Ends Well</a>", was released on October 11, 2010, in Europe and Japan, and November 16 as a digital download worldwide. The material was written predominantly in collaboration with longtime associate <a href="C.%20J.%20Vanston">C. J. Vanston</a>, and the album features stalwart musicians from Lukather's touring band. Songwriter <a href="Randy%20Goodrum">Randy Goodrum</a>, who has collaborated with Lukather many times over the years including on the 1986 Toto single "<a href="I%27ll%20Be%20over%20You">I'll Be over You</a>", contributes to the track "Brody's". "All's Well That Ends Well" draws from Lukather's personal experiences in the two years since "Ever Changing Times". Critic Arlene Weiss noted that the album features three distinct flavors of music: one that "bares [Lukather's] soul and emotional heartache", one that pans elements of popular culture like <a href="TMZ.com">TMZ.com</a>, and one that expresses optimism and enthusiasm about the future. While Lukather focused on instrumental writing and production on previous albums but collaborated with lyricists, he wrote much of the lyrics for "All's Well That Ends Well" himself. Lukather describes the album as being a "real" and "honest" reflection of the period between 2008 and 2010, when he experienced difficulties within his private life.

In December 2011, Lukather announced the beginning of work on "<a href="Transition%20%28Steve%20Lukather%20album%29">Transition</a>". The album was produced with songwriter and record producer C.J. Vanston and involved musicians <a href="Chad%20Smith">Chad Smith</a>, <a href="Gregg%20Bissonette">Gregg Bissonette</a>, <a href="Leland%20Sklar">Leland Sklar</a>, <a href="Steve%20Weingart">Steve Weingart</a>, and others. Throughout 2012, Lukather released notes and news of the album development through his web site. The title was announced on October 12, 2012. The album was released January 21, 2013.

When not working with Toto, Lukather has participated in numerous side projects including playing with <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a> band Los Lobotomys and with other session musicians, and touring with Larry Carlton, <a href="Joe%20Satriani">Joe Satriani</a>, Steve Vai, and others.

Lukather was a long-time member of the band Los Lobotomys, a collaboration of session musicians including <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="Bebop">be-bop</a> player David "Creatchy" Garfield and Toto drummer <a href="Jeff%20Porcaro">Jeff Porcaro</a>, replaced after his death by <a href="Simon%20Phillips%20%28drummer%29">Simon Phillips</a>, who also replaced Porcaro in Toto. Los Lobotomys formed in the mid-1980s and played regular shows in the Los Angeles area, often inviting whatever session musicians happened to be available and in the area. They recorded an album under the Los Lobotomys name in 1989, and the band was heavily involved in the recording of Lukather's "Candyman". Los Lobotomys recorded a live album in 2004 comprising several tracks from "Candyman" and from the 1989 album.

In 1998, Lukather received an invitation to tour Japan with fellow guitarist <a href="Larry%20Carlton">Larry Carlton</a> after Japanese promoters requested that Carlton's annual tours each be different from the last. Lukather and Carlton exchanged some recorded material and decided that a collaboration would be interesting. Lukather was flattered by the invitation to tour with Carlton, citing him as his favorite guitarist. Lukather speaks highly of their stage efforts, although the two were admittedly outside their normal realm of work. He stated in an interview that "you can hear us having fun on the record—you can hear the smiles on our faces." After several shows, the duo realized that they should record their collaboration even if just for their own use. Guitarist and producer Steve Vai heard one of the subsequent recordings and expressed interest in releasing it under his <a href="Favored%20Nations">Favored Nations</a> label, also home to such artists as <a href="Eric%20Johnson">Eric Johnson</a> and <a href="Dweezil%20Zappa">Dweezil Zappa</a>. Vai and Lukather mixed and produced the recording, which is said to be a mixture of jazz, <a href="blues">blues</a>, and fusion music. The resulting album, "", won a 2001 Grammy award for <a href="Best%20Pop%20Instrumental%20Album">Best Pop Instrumental Album</a>. Album reviewers described Lukather as having a heavier style than Carlton. Lukather and Carlton later did an international tour in support of the album.

In 2005, Lukather won critical praise for his rendition of the <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> song "<a href="Little%20Wing">Little Wing</a>" at a <a href="wikt%3Agala%23Noun">gala</a> 90th birthday celebration for jazz guitarist <a href="Les%20Paul">Les Paul</a>. Returning after a five-year absence, the 2012 <a href="G3%20%28tour%29">G3 Tour</a> featured Lukather alongside Joe Satriani and Steve Vai.

In the autumn 2006, Lukather contributed his cover-version of the <a href="Michael%20Landau">Michael Landau</a>-song "I'm Buzzed" (originally from Landau's "<a href="Tales%20From%20The%20Bulge">Tales From The Bulge</a>" album) from a live recording of his side band project, <a href="El%20Grupo">El Grupo</a>, to the album project Artists for Charity – <a href="Guitarists%204%20the%20Kids">Guitarists 4 the Kids</a>, produced by Slang Productions, to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need.

In February 2012, <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a> announced that Lukather would be the guitarist in his <a href="All%20Starr%20Band">All Starr Band</a> for their summer tour. Lukather has been touring with that ensemble since that time, performing three Toto songs ("<a href="Hold%20the%20Line">Hold the Line</a>," "<a href="Rosanna%20%28song%29">Rosanna</a>," and "Africa") nightly.

Lukather periodically contributes material and expertise to instructional and educational enterprises. In 1985, he released the instructional "<a href="Star%20Licks%20Productions">Star Licks</a>" guitar video featuring many of the guitar parts from the first five Toto studio albums. It was released on DVD in 2005. The guitarist has also been participating in the Fermatta Master Class Series project, an educational cooperative organized by the <a href="Fermatta%20Music%20Academy">Fermatta Music Academy</a> in Mexico.

For the past several years, Lukather has also performed with his side project Nerve Bundle at <a href="The%20Baked%20Potato">The Baked Potato</a> in <a href="Studio%20City%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Studio City</a>, CA around Christmas time. The band also features: Toss Panos on drums, Jeff Babko on keyboards and Jorgen Carlsson on bass.

Influenced by such blues-rock guitarists as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, and such <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a> players as <a href="John%20McLaughlin%20%28musician%29">John McLaughlin</a>, and <a href="Al%20Di%20Meola">Al Di Meola</a>, Lukather is known for a "melodic and intense" playing style. He has also cited <a href="Steely%20Dan">Steely Dan</a> as a major long-time influence—one that emerges prominently in later solo work such as "All's Well That Ends Well". Journalist <a href="Jude%20Gold">Jude Gold</a> notes that his vibrato is very pronounced and his "exaggerated wide bends" are distinctive and quickly recognizable. Well-versed in <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a>, Lukather can follow chord charts and changes in a way typical of jazz musicians—this ability enhances his value as a session musician. In interviews, he has explained how he thinks of the guitar in a "chordal cluster" format, and not the typical "linear scale" format.

Lukather's approach to engineering his sound in the studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing a large number of takes or for incorporating much <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a>—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd just move on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It's always better to just surrender, and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears." Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a> are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.

Despite being known in the past for having an intricate set of <a href="effects%20unit">effects unit</a>s, Lukather now says he plays mostly free of such modifications after seeing some overdone commercial unit configurations named after him. Other than some <a href="Delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a>, he has not used many effects in recent years. He has held a long association with Bob Bradshaw of Custom Audio Electronics, who designed and manufactured key elements of Lukather's effects rack. Lukather was one of the few official endorsers of <a href="EMG%2C%20Inc.">EMG</a> pickups, having collaborated on his own Lukather signature "SL20" <a href="Pick%20up%20%28music%20technology%29">pickup</a> system, which is a single unit incorporating two single coils and an EMG 85 <a href="humbucker">humbucker</a>. The system has a single volume and tone knob, and a <a href="pickguard">pickguard</a>. In December 2012, Lukather collaborated with DiMarzio pickups on a new set of signature pickups called "Transition." He has been using these pickups in his Music-Man Luke 3 guitar.

Lukather endorses <a href="Music%20Man%20%28company%29">Music Man</a> guitars and has a signature model named "Luke" that incorporates his signature EMG pickup system. The guitar started out with only MusicMan <a href="specifications">specifications</a> (including a Floyd Rose locking vibrato, later replaced with a vintage-style fulcrum bridge), but in 1998, the manufacturer made several customizations to the model to better fit Lukather's playing style. Music Man also produces a Ball Family Reserve Steve Lukather Model that features an alder body with a <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> "tone block" inlaid under the <a href="Pickup%20%28music%20technology%29">pickups</a>, capped with a figured <a href="maple">maple</a> top and transparent finish. In 2012 a new version of the guitar called the LIII was introduced with a 3% larger but similarly contoured body, all-<a href="rosewood">rosewood</a> neck and passive pickup options (dual humbucker or single single humbucker) combined with an active preamp and 12-<a href="Decibel">dB</a> boost activated from a push/push tone pot. In 2013 Lukather changed to a roasted maple neck with a rosewood <a href="fret%20board">fret board</a>, citing the exceptional stability of roasted maple while touring as a factor in his decision. As a result, the LIII specification and production was changed to match Lukather's preference. Lukather has also been known to play <a href="Ibanez">Ibanez</a> and <a href="Valley%20Arts%20Guitar">Valley Arts</a> guitars. His relationship with Ibanez and Valley Arts yielded an endorsement for a brief time in the 1980s with the release of the Ibanez Roadstar RS1010SL and Valley Arts Custom Pro Steve Lukather Signature guitars in 1984–85. He has played <a href="Ovation%20Guitar%20Company">Ovation</a> Adamas series <a href="acoustic-electric%20guitar">acoustic–electric guitars</a>. Starting before his 2010 "<a href="All%27s%20Well%20That%20Ends%20Well%20%28Steve%20Lukather%20album%29">All's Well That Ends Well</a>" tour, Lukather began playing and endorsing <a href="Yamaha%20Corporation">Yamaha</a> Studio Response Technology acoustic–electric guitars.

Information about his current equipment can be found on Lukather's website, which is kept up-to-date.
