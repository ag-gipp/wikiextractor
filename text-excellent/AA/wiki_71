ZETA (fusion reactor)

ZETA, short for "Zero Energy Thermonuclear Assembly", was a major experiment in the early history of <a href="fusion%20power">fusion power</a> research. Based on the <a href="Z-pinch">pinch</a> <a href="Plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> confinement technique, and built at the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Research%20Establishment">Atomic Energy Research Establishment</a> in the United Kingdom, ZETA was larger and more powerful than any fusion machine in the world at that time. Its goal was to produce large numbers of fusion reactions, although it was not large enough to produce net energy.

ZETA went into operation in August 1957 and by the end of the month it was giving off bursts of about a million <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s per pulse. Measurements suggested the fuel was reaching between 1 and 5 million <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a>s, a temperature that would produce <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> reactions, explaining the quantities of neutrons being seen. Early results were leaked to the press in September 1957, and the following January an extensive review was released. Front-page articles in newspapers around the world announced it as a breakthrough towards unlimited energy, a scientific advance for Britain greater than the recently launched <a href="Sputnik%201">Sputnik</a> had been for the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

US and Soviet experiments had also given off similar neutron bursts at temperatures that were not high enough for fusion. This led <a href="Lyman%20Spitzer">Lyman Spitzer</a> to express his scepticism of the results, but his comments were dismissed by UK observers as <a href="jingoism">jingoism</a>. Further experiments on ZETA showed that the original temperature measurements were misleading; the bulk temperature was too low for fusion reactions to create the number of neutrons being seen. The claim that ZETA had produced fusion had to be publicly withdrawn, an embarrassing event that cast a chill over the entire fusion establishment. The neutrons were later explained as being the product of instabilities in the fuel. These instabilities appeared inherent to any similar design, and work on the basic pinch concept as a road to fusion power ended by 1961.

In spite of ZETA's failure to achieve fusion, the device went on to have a long experimental lifetime and produced numerous important advances in the field. In one line of development, the use of <a href="laser">laser</a>s to more accurately measure the temperature was tested on ZETA, and was later used to confirm the results of the Soviet <a href="tokamak">tokamak</a> approach. In another, while examining ZETA test runs it was noticed that the plasma self-stabilised after the power was turned off. This has led to the modern <a href="reversed%20field%20pinch">reversed field pinch</a> concept. More generally, studies of the instabilities in ZETA have led to several important theoretical advances that form the basis of modern plasma theory.

The basic understanding of <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> was developed during the 1920s as physicists explored the new science of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. <a href="George%20Gamow">George Gamow</a>'s 1928 exploration of <a href="quantum%20tunnelling">quantum tunnelling</a> demonstrated that nuclear reactions could take place at lower energies than classical theory predicted. Using this theory, in 1929 <a href="Fritz%20Houtermans">Fritz Houtermans</a> and <a href="Robert%20d%27Escourt%20Atkinson">Robert Atkinson</a> demonstrated that expected reaction rates in the core of the sun supported <a href="Arthur%20Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a>'s 1920 suggestion that the sun is <a href="Nuclear%20fusion%23Nuclear%20fusion%20in%20stars">powered by fusion</a>.

In 1934, <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, <a href="Paul%20Harteck">Paul Harteck</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> were the first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a> to shoot <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, <a href="lithium">lithium</a> or other elements. This allowed them to measure the <a href="nuclear%20cross%20section">nuclear cross section</a> of various fusion reactions, and determined that the deuterium-deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions, peaking at about 100,000 <a href="electronvolt">electronvolt</a>s (100 keV).

This energy corresponds to the average energy of particles in a gas heated to thousands of millions of kelvins. Materials heated beyond a few tens of thousands of kelvins dissociate into their <a href="electron">electron</a>s and <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a>, producing a gas-like <a href="state%20of%20matter">state of matter</a> known as <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a>. In any gas the particles have a wide range of energies, normally following the <a href="Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann%20statistics">Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics</a>. In such a mixture, a small number of particles will have much higher energy than the bulk.

This leads to an interesting possibility; even at temperatures well below 100,000 eV, some particles will randomly have enough energy to undergo fusion. Those reactions release huge amounts of energy. If that energy can be captured back into the plasma, it can heat other particles to that energy as well, making the reaction self-sustaining. In 1944, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> calculated this would occur at about 50,000,000 K.

Taking advantage of this possibility requires the fuel plasma to be held together long enough that these random reactions have time to occur. Like any hot gas, the plasma has an internal <a href="pressure">pressure</a> and thus tends to expand according to the <a href="ideal%20gas%20law">ideal gas law</a>. For a fusion reactor, the problem is keeping the plasma contained against this pressure; any known substance would melt at these temperatures.

A plasma is electrically conductive, and is subject to electric and magnetic fields. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit the magnetic field lines. A simple confinement system is a plasma-filled tube placed inside the open core of a <a href="solenoid">solenoid</a>. The plasma naturally wants to expand outwards to the walls of the tube, as well as move along it, towards the ends. The solenoid creates a magnetic field running down the centre of the tube, which the particles will orbit, preventing their motion towards the sides. Unfortunately, this arrangement does not confine the plasma along the length of the tube, and the plasma is free to flow out the ends.

The obvious solution to this problem is to bend the tube around into a <a href="torus">torus</a> (a ring or doughnut shape). Motion towards the sides remains constrained as before, and while the particles remain free to move along the lines, in this case, they will simply circulate around the long axis of the tube. But, as Fermi pointed out, when the solenoid is bent into a ring, the electrical windings would be closer together on the inside than the outside. This would lead to an uneven field across the tube, and the fuel will slowly drift out of the centre. Some additional force needs to counteract this drift, providing long-term confinement.

A potential solution to the confinement problem had been detailed in 1934 by <a href="Willard%20Harrison%20Bennett">Willard Harrison Bennett</a>. Any electrical current creates a <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>, and due to the <a href="Lorentz%20force">Lorentz force</a>, this causes an inward directed force. This was first noticed in <a href="lightning%20rod">lightning rod</a>s. Bennett showed that the same effect would cause a current to "self-focus" a plasma into a thin column. A second paper by <a href="Lewi%20Tonks">Lewi Tonks</a> in 1937 considered the issue again, introducing the name "<a href="pinch%20effect">pinch effect</a>". It was followed by a paper by Tonks and <a href="William%20Allis">William Allis</a>.

Applying a pinch current in a plasma can be used to counteract expansion and confine the plasma. A simple way to do this is to put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using <a href="electrode">electrode</a>s at either end, like a <a href="fluorescent%20lamp">fluorescent lamp</a>. This arrangement still produces no confinement along the length of the tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there are ways to reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be <a href="electromagnetic%20induction">induced</a> in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.

The toroidal pinch concept as a route to fusion was explored in the UK during the mid-1940s, especially by <a href="George%20Paget%20Thomson">George Paget Thomson</a> of <a href="Imperial%20College%20London">Imperial College London</a>. With the formation of the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Research%20Establishment">Atomic Energy Research Establishment</a> (AERE) at <a href="Harwell%2C%20Oxfordshire">Harwell, Oxfordshire</a>, in 1945, Thomson repeatedly petitioned the director, <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a>, for funds to develop an experimental machine. These requests were turned down. At the time there was no obvious military use, so the concept was left <a href="Classified%20information%23unclassified">unclassified</a>. This allowed Thomson and <a href="Moses%20Blackman">Moses Blackman</a> to file a patent on the idea in 1946, describing a device using just enough pinch current to ionise and briefly confine the plasma while being heated by a <a href="microwave">microwave</a> source that would also continually drive the current.

As a practical device there is an additional requirement, that the reaction conditions last long enough to burn a reasonable amount of the fuel. In the original Thomson and Blackman design, it was the job of the microwave injection to drive the electrons to maintain the current and produce pinches that lasted on the order of one minute, allowing the plasma to reach 500 million K. The current in the plasma also heated it; if the current was also used as the heat source, the only limit to the heating was the power of the pulse. This led to a new reactor design where the system operated in brief but very powerful pulses. Such a machine would demand a very large power supply.

In 1947, Cockcroft arranged a meeting of several Harwell physicists to study Thomson's latest concepts, including Harwell's director of theoretical physics, <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a>. Thomson's concepts were poorly received, especially by Fuchs. When this presentation also failed to gain funding, Thomson passed along his concepts to two graduate students at Imperial, Stan Cousins and Alan Ware. He added a report on a type of toroidal particle accelerator known as the "Wirbelrohr" ("whirl tube"), designed in Germany by <a href="Max%20Steenbeck">Max Steenbeck</a>. The Wirbelrohr consisted of a <a href="transformer">transformer</a> with a torus-shaped vacuum tube as its secondary coil, similar in concept to the toroidal pinch devices.

Later that year, Ware built a small machine out of old radar equipment and was able to induce powerful currents. When they did, the plasma gave off flashes of light, but he could not devise a way to measure the temperature of the plasma. Thomson continued to pressure the government to allow him to build a full-scale device, using his considerable <a href="political%20currency">political currency</a> to argue for the creation of a dedicated experimental station at the <a href="Associated%20Electrical%20Industries">Associated Electrical Industries</a> (AEI) lab that had recently been constructed at <a href="Aldermaston">Aldermaston</a>.

Ware discussed the experiments with anyone who was interested, including <a href="James%20L.%20Tuck">Jim Tuck</a> of <a href="Clarendon%20Laboratory">Clarendon Laboratory</a> at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a>. While working at <a href="Project%20Y">Los Alamos</a> during the war, Tuck and <a href="Stanislaw%20Ulam">Stanislaw Ulam</a> had built an unsuccessful <a href="colliding%20beam%20fusion">colliding beam fusion</a> system similar to Rutherford's pioneering experiment. Tuck was joined by Australian <a href="Peter%20Thonemann%20%28physicist%29">Peter Thonemann</a>, who had worked on fusion theory, and the two arranged funding through Clarendon to build a small device like the one at Imperial. But before this work started, Tuck was offered a job in the US, eventually returning to Los Alamos.

Thonemann continued working on the idea and began a rigorous programme to explore the basic physics of plasmas in a magnetic field. Starting with linear tubes and <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> gas, he found that the current tended to expand outward through the plasma until it touched the walls of the container (see <a href="skin%20effect">skin effect</a>). He countered this with the addition of small electromagnets outside the tube, which pushed back against the current and kept it centred. By 1949, he had moved on from the glass tubes to a larger copper torus, in which he was able to demonstrate a stable pinched plasma. <a href="Frederick%20Lindemann%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cherwell">Frederick Lindemann</a> and Cockcroft visited and were duly impressed.

Cockcroft asked <a href="Herbert%20Wakefield%20Banks%20Skinner">Herbert Skinner</a> to review the concepts, which he did in April 1948. He was sceptical of Thomson's ideas for creating a current in the plasma and thought Thonemann's ideas seemed more likely to work. He also pointed out that the behaviour of plasmas in a magnetic field was not well understood, and that "it is useless to do much further planning before this doubt is resolved."

Meanwhile, at Los Alamos, Tuck acquainted the US researchers with the British efforts. In early 1951, <a href="Lyman%20Spitzer">Lyman Spitzer</a> introduced his <a href="stellarator">stellarator</a> concept and was shopping the idea around the nuclear establishment looking for funding. Tuck was sceptical of Spitzer's enthusiasm and felt his development programme was "incredibly ambitious". He proposed a much less aggressive programme based on pinch. Both men presented their ideas in Washington in May 1951, which resulted in the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> giving Spitzer US$50,000. Tuck convinced <a href="Norris%20Bradbury">Norris Bradbury</a>, the director of Los Alamos, to give him US$50,000 from the discretionary budget, using it to build the <a href="Perhapsatron">Perhapsatron</a>.

In 1950 Fuchs admitted to passing UK and US atomic secrets to the USSR. As fusion devices generated high energy neutrons, which could be used to enrich nuclear fuel for bombs, the UK immediately classified all their fusion research. This meant the teams could no longer work in the open environment of the universities. The Imperial team under Ware moved to the AEI labs at Aldermaston and the Oxford team under Thonemann moved to Harwell.

By early 1952 there were numerous pinch devices in operation; Cousins and Ware had built several follow-on machines under the name Sceptre, and the Harwell team had built a series of ever-larger machines known as Mark I through Mark IV. In the US, Tuck built his Perhapsatron in January 1952. It was later learned that Fuchs had passed the UK work to the Soviets, and that they had started a fusion programme as well.

It was clear to all of these groups that something was seriously wrong in the pinch machines. As the current was applied, the plasma column inside the vacuum tube would become unstable and break up, ruining the compression. Further work identified two types of instabilities, nicknamed "kink" and "sausage". In the kink, the normally toroidal plasma would bend to the sides, eventually touching the edges of the vessel. In the sausage, the plasma would neck down at locations along the plasma column to form a pattern similar to a link of sausages.

Investigations demonstrated both were caused by the same underlying mechanism. When the pinch current was applied, any area of the gas that had a slightly higher density would create a slightly stronger magnetic field and collapse faster than the surrounding gas. This caused the localised area to have higher density, which created an even stronger pinch, and a runaway reaction would follow. The quick collapse in a single area would cause the whole column to break up.

Early studies of the phenomenon suggested one solution to the problem was to increase the compression rate. In this approach, the compression would be started and stopped so rapidly that the bulk of the plasma would not have time to move; instead, a <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a> created by this rapid compression would be responsible for compressing the majority of the plasma. This approach became known as "fast pinch". The Los Alamos team working on the Columbus linear machine designed an updated version to test this theory.

Others started looking for ways to stabilise the plasma during compression, and by 1953 two concepts had come to the fore. One solution was to wrap the vacuum tube in a sheet of thin but highly conductive metal. If the plasma column began to move, the current in the plasma would induce a magnetic field in the sheet, one that, due to <a href="Lenz%27s%20law">Lenz's law</a>, would push back against the plasma. This was most effective against large, slow movements, like the entire plasma torus drifting within the chamber.

The second solution used additional electromagnets wrapped around the vacuum tube. The magnetic fields from these magnets mixed with the pinch field created by the current in the plasma. The result was that the paths of the particles within the plasma tube were no longer purely circular around the torus, but twisted like the stripes on a <a href="barber%27s%20pole">barber's pole</a>. In the US, this concept was known as giving the plasma a "backbone", suppressing small-scale, localised instabilities. Calculations showed that this "stabilised pinch" would dramatically improve confinement times, and the older concepts "suddenly seemed obsolete".

<a href="Marshall%20Rosenbluth">Marshall Rosenbluth</a>, recently arrived at Los Alamos, began a detailed theoretical study of the pinch concept. With his wife Arianna and <a href="Richard%20Garwin">Richard Garwin</a>, he developed "motor theory", or "M-theory", published in 1954. The theory predicted that the heating effect of the electric current was greatly increased with the power of the electric field. This suggested that the fast pinch concept would be more likely to succeed, as it was easier to produce larger currents in these devices. When he incorporated the idea of stabilising magnets into the theory a second phenomenon appeared; for a particular, and narrow, set of conditions based on the physical size of the reactor, the power of the stabilising magnets and the amount of pinch, toroidal machines appeared to be naturally stable.

US researchers planned to test both fast pinch and stabilised pinch by modifying their existing small-scale machines. In the UK, Thomson once again pressed for funding for a larger machine. This time he was much more warmly received, and initial funding of £200,000 was provided in late 1954. Design work continued during 1955, and in July the project was named ZETA. The term "zero energy" was already widely used in the industry to refer to small <a href="research%20reactor">research reactor</a>s, like <a href="ZEEP">ZEEP</a>, which had a role similar to ZETA's goal of producing reactions while releasing no net energy.

The ZETA design was finalised in early 1956. <a href="Metropolitan-Vickers">Metropolitan-Vickers</a> was hired to build the machine, which included a 150 tonne <a href="pulse%20transformer">pulse transformer</a>, the largest built in Britain to that point. A serious issue arose when the required high-strength steels needed for the electrical components were in short supply, but a strike in the US electrical industry caused a sudden glut of material, resolving the problem.

ZETA was the largest and most powerful fusion device in the world at the time of its construction. Its aluminium torus had an internal bore of and a major radius of , over three times the size of any machine built to date. It was also the most powerful design, incorporating an induction magnet that was designed to induce currents up to 100,000 amperes (amps) into the plasma. Later amendments to the design increased this to 200,000 amps. It included both types of stabilisation; its aluminium walls acted as the metal shield, and a series of secondary magnets ringed the torus. Windows placed in the gaps between the toroidal magnets allowed direct inspection of the plasma.

In July 1954, the AERE was reorganised into the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Atomic%20Energy%20Authority">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a> (UKAEA). Modifications to Harwell's Hangar 7 in order to house the machine began that year. Despite its advanced design, the price tag was modest: about US$1 million. By late 1956 it was clear that ZETA was going to come online in mid-1957, beating the <a href="Model%20C%20stellarator">Model C stellarator</a> and the newest versions of the Perhapsatron and Columbus. Because these projects were secret, based on the little information available the press concluded they were versions of the same conceptual device, and that the British were far ahead in the race to produce a working machine.

From 1953 the US had increasingly concentrated on the fast pinch concept. Some of these machines had produced neutrons, and these were initially associated with fusion. There was so much excitement that several other researchers quickly entered the field as well. Among these was <a href="Stirling%20Colgate">Stirling Colgate</a>, but his experiments quickly led him to conclude that fusion was not taking place. According to <a href="Spitzer%20resistivity">Spitzer resistivity</a>, the temperature of the plasma could be determined from the current flowing through it. When Colgate performed the calculation, the temperatures in the plasma were far below the requirements for fusion.

This being the case, some other effect had to be creating the neutrons. Further work demonstrated that these were the result of instabilities in the fuel. The localised areas of high magnetic field acted as tiny particle accelerators, causing reactions that ejected neutrons. Modifications attempting to reduce these instabilities failed to improve the situation and by 1956 the fast pinch concept had largely been abandoned. The US labs began turning their attention to the stabilised pinch concept, but by this time ZETA was almost complete and the US was well behind.

In 1956, while planning a well publicised <a href="state%20visit">state visit</a> by <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Bulganin">Nikolai Bulganin</a> to the UK, the Harwell researchers received an offer from Soviet scientist <a href="Igor%20Kurchatov">Igor Kurchatov</a> to give a talk. They were surprised when he began his talk on "the possibility of producing thermonuclear reactions in a gaseous discharge". Kurchatov's speech revealed the Soviet efforts to produce fast pinch devices similar to the American designs, and their problems with instabilities in the plasmas. Kurchatov noted that they had also seen neutrons being released, and had initially believed them to be from fusion. But as they examined the numbers, it became clear the plasma was not hot enough and they concluded the neutrons were from other interactions.

Kurchatov's speech made it apparent that the three countries were all working on the same basic concepts and had all encountered the same sorts of problems. Cockcroft missed Kurchatov's visit because he had left for the US to press for declassification of the fusion work to avoid this duplication of effort. There was a widespread belief on both sides of the Atlantic that sharing their findings would greatly improve progress. Now that it was known the Soviets were at the same basic development level, and that they were interested in talking about it publicly, the US and UK began considering releasing much of their information as well. This developed into a wider effort to release all fusion research at the second <a href="Atoms%20for%20Peace">Atoms for Peace</a> conference in Geneva in September 1958.

In June 1957 the UK and US finalised their agreement to release data to each other sometime prior to the conference, which both the UK and the US planned on attending "in force". The final terms were reached on 27 November 1957, opening the projects to mutual inspection, and calling for a wide public release of all the data in January 1958.

ZETA started operation in mid-August 1957, initially with hydrogen. These runs demonstrated that ZETA was not suffering from the same stability problems that earlier pinch machines had seen and their plasmas were lasting for milliseconds, up from microseconds, a full three <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a> improvement. The length of the pulses allowed the plasma temperature to be measured using <a href="Spectrometer">spectrographic</a> means; although the light emitted was broadband, the <a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler shifting</a> of the spectral lines of slight impurities in the gas (oxygen in particular) led to calculable temperatures.

Even in early experimental runs, the team started introducing deuterium gas into the mix and began increasing the current to 200,000 amps. On the evening of 30 August the machine produced huge numbers of <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s, on the order of one million per experimental pulse, or "shot". An effort to duplicate the results and eliminate possible measurement failure followed.

Much depended on the temperature of the plasma; if the temperature was low, the neutrons would not be fusion related. Spectrographic measurements suggested plasma temperatures between 1 and 5 million K; at those temperatures the predicted rate of fusion was within a factor of two of the number of neutrons being seen. It appeared that ZETA had reached the long-sought goal of producing small numbers of fusion reactions, as it was designed to do.

US efforts had suffered a string of minor technical setbacks that delayed their experiments by about a year; both the new Perhapsatron S-3 and Columbus II did not start operating until around the same time as ZETA in spite of being much smaller experiments. Nevertheless, as these experiments came online in mid-1957, they too began generating neutrons. By September, both these machines and a new design, DCX at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, appeared so promising that Edward Gardner reported that:

The news was too good to keep bottled up. Tantalising leaks started appearing in September. In October, Thonemann, Cockcroft and William P. Thompson hinted that interesting results would be following. In November a UKAEA spokesman noted "The indications are that fusion has been achieved". Based on these hints, the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" dedicated an entire two-column article to the issue. Between then and early 1958, the British press published an average of two articles a week on ZETA. Even the US papers picked up the story; on 17 November "The New York Times" reported on the hints of success.

Although the British and US had agreed to release their data in full, at this point the overall director of the US program, <a href="Lewis%20Strauss">Lewis Strauss</a>, decided to hold back the release. Tuck argued that the field looked so promising that it would be premature to release any data before the researchers knew that fusion was definitely taking place. Strauss agreed, and announced that they would withhold their data for a period to check their results.

As the matter became better known in the press, on 26 November the publication issue was raised in <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>. Responding to a question by the opposition, the leader of the house announced the results publicly while explaining the delay in publication due to the UK–US agreement. The UK press interpreted this differently, claiming that the US was dragging its feet because it was unable to replicate the British results.

Things came to a head on 12 December when a former member of parliament, <a href="Anthony%20Nutting">Anthony Nutting</a>, wrote a "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>" article claiming:

The article resulted in a flurry of activity in the <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Macmillan administration</a>. Having originally planned to release their results at a scheduled meeting of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>, there was great concern over whether to invite the Americans and Soviets, especially as they believed the Americans would be greatly upset if the Soviets arrived, but just as upset if they were not invited and the event was all-British. The affair eventually led to the UKAEA making a public announcement that the US was not holding back the ZETA results, but this infuriated the local press, which continued to claim the US was delaying to allow them to catch up.

When the information-sharing agreement was signed in November a further benefit was realised: teams from the various labs were allowed to visit each other. The US team, including <a href="Stirling%20Colgate">Stirling Colgate</a>, Lyman Spitzer, Jim Tuck and <a href="Arthur%20Edward%20Ruark">Arthur Edward Ruark</a>, all visited ZETA and concluded there was a "major probability" the neutrons were from fusion.

On his return to the US, Spitzer calculated that something was wrong with the ZETA results. He noticed that the apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly. If the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not be taking place early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was lower, it implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.

Colgate had reached similar conclusions. In early 1958, he, <a href="Harold%20Furth">Harold Furth</a> and John Ferguson started an extensive study of the results from all known pinch machines. Instead of inferring temperature from neutron energy, they used the conductivity of the plasma itself, based on the well-understood relationships between <a href="Electrical%20conductivity%23Temperature%20dependence">temperature and conductivity</a>. They concluded that the machines were producing temperatures perhaps what the neutrons were suggesting, nowhere near hot enough to explain the number of neutrons being produced, regardless of their energy.

By this time the latest versions of the US pinch devices, Perhapsatron S-3 and Columbus S-4, were producing neutrons of their own. The fusion research world reached a high point. In January, results from pinch experiments in the US and UK both announced that neutrons were being released, and that fusion had apparently been achieved. The misgivings of Spitzer and Colgate were ignored.

The long-planned release of fusion data was announced to the public in mid-January. Considerable material from the UK's ZETA and <a href="Sceptre%20%28fusion%20reactor%29">Sceptre</a> devices was released in depth in the 25 January 1958 edition of "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>", which also included results from Los Alamos' Perhapsatron S-3, Columbus II and Columbus S-2. The UK press was livid. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" wrote that "Admiral Strauss' tactics have soured what should be an exciting announcement of scientific progress so that it has become a sordid episode of prestige politics."

The results were typical of the normally sober scientific language, and although the neutrons were noted, there were no strong claims as to their source. The day before the release, Cockcroft, the overall director at Harwell, called a <a href="press%20conference">press conference</a> to introduce the British press to the results. Some indication of the importance of the event can be seen in the presence of a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television field crew, a rare occurrence at that time. He began by introducing the fusion programme and the ZETA machine, and then noted:

The reporters at the meeting were not satisfied with this assessment and continued to press Cockcroft on the neutron issue. After being asked several times, he eventually stated that in his opinion, he was "90 percent certain" they were from fusion. This was unwise; a statement of opinion from a Nobel prize winner was taken as a statement of fact. The next day, the Sunday newspapers were covered with the news that fusion had been achieved in ZETA, often with claims about how the UK was now far in the lead in fusion research. Cockcroft further hyped the results on television following the release, stating: "To Britain this discovery is greater than the Russian Sputnik."

As planned, the US also released a large batch of results from their smaller pinch machines. Many of them were also giving off neutrons, although ZETA was stabilised for much longer periods and generating more neutrons, by a factor of about 1000. When questioned about the success in the UK, Strauss denied that the US was behind in the fusion race. When reporting on the releases, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" chose to focus on Los Alamos' Columbus II, only mentioning ZETA later in the article, and then concluded the two countries were "neck and neck." Other reports from the US generally gave equal support to both programmes. Newspapers from the rest of the world were more favourable to the UK; <a href="Voice%20of%20Russia">Radio Moscow</a> went so far to publicly congratulate the UK while failing to mention the US results at all.

As ZETA continued to generate positive results, plans were made to build a follow-on machine. The new design was announced in May; ZETA II would be a significantly larger US$14 million machine whose explicit goal would be to reach 100 million K, and generate net power. This announcement gathered praise even in the US; "The New York Times" ran a story about the new version. Machines similar to ZETA were being announced around the world; <a href="Osaka%20University">Osaka University</a> announced their pinch machine was even more successful than ZETA, the Aldermaston team announced positive results from their Sceptre machine costing only US$28,000, and a new reactor was built in <a href="Uppsala%20University">Uppsala University</a> that was presented publicly later that year. The Efremov Institute in <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a> began construction of a smaller version of ZETA, although still larger than most, known as Alpha.

Spitzer had already concluded that known theory suggested that the ZETA was nowhere near the temperatures the team was claiming, and as part of the publicity surrounding the release of the work suggested that "Some unknown mechanism would appear to be involved". Other researchers in the US, notably Furth and Colgate, were far more critical, telling anyone who would listen that the results were bunk. In the Soviet Union, <a href="Lev%20Artsimovich">Lev Artsimovich</a> rushed to have the "Nature" article translated, and after reading it, declared "Chush sobachi!" (bullshit).

Cockcroft had stated that they were receiving too few neutrons from the device to measure their spectrum or their direction. Failing to do so meant they could not eliminate the possibility that the neutrons were being released due to electrical effects in the plasma, the sorts of reactions that Kurchatov had pointed out earlier. Such measurements would have been easy to make.

In the same converted hangar that housed ZETA was the <a href="Harwell%20Synchrocyclotron">Harwell Synchrocyclotron</a> effort run by Basil Rose. This project had built a sensitive high-pressure diffusion <a href="cloud%20chamber">cloud chamber</a> as the cyclotron's main detector. Rose was convinced it would be able to directly measure the neutron energies and trajectories. In a series of experiments, he showed that the neutrons had a high directionality, at odds with a fusion origin which would be expected to be randomly directed. To further demonstrate this he had the machine run "backwards", with the electric current running in the opposite direction. This demonstrated a clear difference in the number of neutrons and their energy, which suggested they were a result of the electrical current itself, not fusion reactions inside the plasma.

This was followed by similar experiments on Perhapsatron and Columbus, demonstrating the same problems. The issue was a new form of instability, the "microinstabilities" or MHD instabilities, that were caused by wave-like signals in the plasma. These had been predicted, but whereas the kink was on the scale of the entire plasma and could be easily seen in photographs, these microinstabilities were too small and rapidly moving to easily detect, and had simply not been noticed before. But like the kink, when these instabilities developed, areas of enormous electrical potential developed, rapidly accelerating protons in the area. These sometimes collided with neutrons in the plasma or the container walls, ejecting them through <a href="spallation%23Production%20of%20neutrons%20at%20a%20spallation%20neutron%20source">neutron spallation</a>. These were the same sorts of instabilities seen in earlier machines, and precisely the problem Cockcroft had mentioned during the press releases, but in ZETA they were much more powerful and the neutrons appeared to be fusion related until further work demonstrated their nature. The promise of stabilised pinch disappeared.

Cockcroft was forced to publish a humiliating retraction on 16 May 1958, claiming "It is doing exactly the job we expected it would do and is functioning exactly the way we hoped it would." "Le Monde" raised the issue to a front-page headline in June, noting "Contrary to what was announced six months ago at Harwell – British experts confirm that thermonuclear energy has not been 'domesticated. The event cast a chill over the entire field; it was not only the British who looked foolish, every other country involved in fusion research had been quick to jump on the bandwagon.

Beginning in 1955, Cockcroft had pressed for the establishment of a new site for the construction of multiple prototype power-producing fission reactors. This was strongly opposed by <a href="Christopher%20Hinton%2C%20Baron%20Hinton%20of%20Bankside">Christopher Hinton</a>, and a furious debate broke out within the UKAEA over the issue. Cockcroft eventually won the debate, and in late 1958 the UKAEA formed <a href="Winfrith">AEE Winfrith</a> in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, where they eventually built several experimental reactor designs.

Cockcroft had also pressed for the ZETA II reactor to be housed at the new site. He argued that Winfrith would be better suited to build the large reactor, and the unclassified site would better suit the now-unclassified research. This led to what has been described as "as close to a rebellion that the individualistic scientists at Harwell could possibly mount". Thonemann made it clear he was not interested in moving to Dorset and suggested that several other high-ranking members would also quit rather than move. He then went on sabbatical to <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> for a year. The entire affair was a major strain on <a href="Basil%20Schonland">Basil Schonland</a>, who took over the Research division when Cockcroft left in October 1959 to become the Master of the newly formed <a href="Churchill%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Churchill College, Cambridge</a>.

While this was taking place, the original ZETA II proposal had been growing ever-larger, eventually specifying currents as powerful as the <a href="Joint%20European%20Torus">Joint European Torus</a> that was built years later. As it seemed this was beyond the state-of-the-art, the project was eventually cancelled in February 1959. A new proposal soon took its place, the <a href="Intermediate-Current%20Stability%20Experiment">Intermediate-Current Stability Experiment</a> (ICSE). ICSE was designed to take advantage of further stabilising effects noticed in M-theory, which suggested that very fast pinches would cause the current to flow only in the outer layer of the plasma, which should be much more stable. Over time, this machine grew to be about the same size as ZETA; ICSE had a 6 m major diameter and 1 m minor diameter, powered by a bank of capacitors storing 10 MJ at 100 kV.

Harwell was as unsuited to ICSE as it was for ZETA II, so Schonland approached the government with the idea of a new site for fusion research located close to Harwell. He was surprised to find they were happy with the idea, as this would limit employment at Harwell. Further study demonstrated that the cost of building a new site was offset by the savings in keeping the site near Harwell; at Winfrith the travel costs between the sites would be considerable. In May 1959, the UKAEA purchased <a href="RNAS%20Culham%20%28HMS%20Hornbill%29">RNAS Culham</a>, about from Harwell. ICSE construction began later that year, starting with a one-acre building to house it, known as "D-1".

Meanwhile, work continued on ZETA to better understand what was causing the new forms of instabilities. New diagnostic techniques demonstrated that the electron energies were very low, on the order of 10 eV (approximately 100,000 K) while ion temperatures were somewhat higher at 100 eV. Both of these pointed to a rapid loss of energy in the plasma, which in turn suggested the fuel was turbulent and escaping confinement to hit the walls of the chamber where it rapidly cooled. A full presentation of the results was made at the Salzburg Conference in 1961, where the Soviet delegation presented very similar results on their ZETA-clone, Alpha.

The source of this turbulence was not clearly identified at that time, but the team suggested it was due to current-driven resistive modes; if one did not use the simplifying assumption that the plasma had no macroscopic resistance, new instabilities would naturally appear. When the new head of the UKAEA, <a href="William%20Penney%2C%20Baron%20Penney">William Penney</a>, heard that the ICSE design was also based on the resistance-free assumption, he cancelled the project in August 1960. Parts for the partially-assembled reactor were scavenged by other teams.

Thonemann had returned by this point and found much to disagree with on ICSE. He demanded to be allowed to set up a new fusion group to remain at Harwell on ZETA. ZETA remained the largest toroidal machine in the world for some time, and went on to have a productive career for just over a decade, but in spite of its later successes ZETA was always known as an example of British folly.

ZETA's failure was due to limited information; using the best available measurements, ZETA was returning several signals that suggested the neutrons were due to fusion. The original temperature measures were made by examining the Doppler shifting of the spectral lines of the atoms in the plasma. The inaccuracy of the measurement and spurious results caused by electron impacts with the container led to misleading measurements based on the impurities, not the plasma itself. Over the next decade, ZETA was used continuously in an effort to develop better diagnostic tools to resolve these problems.

This work eventually developed a method that is used to this day. The introduction of <a href="laser">laser</a>s provided a new solution through a British discovery known as <a href="Thomson%20scattering">Thomson scattering</a>. Lasers have extremely accurate and stable frequency control, and the light they emit interacts strongly with free electrons. A laser shone into the plasma will be reflected off the electrons, and during this process will be Doppler shifted by the electrons' movement. The speed of the electrons is a function of their temperature, so by comparing the frequency before and after collisions, the temperature of the electrons could be measured with an extremely high degree of accuracy. By "reversing" the system, the temperature of the ions could also be directly measured.

Through the 1960s ZETA was not the only experiment to suffer from unexpected performance problems. Problems with plasma diffusion across the magnetic fields plagued both the <a href="magnetic%20mirror">magnetic mirror</a> and stellarator programs, at rates that classical theory could not address. Adding more fields did not appear to correct the problems in any of the existing designs. Work slowed dramatically as teams around the world tried to better understand the physics of the plasmas in their devices. Pfirsch and Schluter were the first to make a significant advance, suggesting that much larger and more powerful machines would be needed to correct these problems. An attitude of pessimism took root across the entire field.

In 1968 a meeting of fusion researchers took place in <a href="Novosibirsk">Novosibirsk</a>, where, to everyone's astonishment, the Soviet hosts introduced their work on their <a href="tokamak">tokamak</a> designs which had performance numbers that no other experiment was even close to matching. The latest of their designs, the T-3, was producing electron energies of 1000 <a href="electron%20volts">eV</a>, compared to about 10 eV in ZETA. This corresponded to a plasma temperature of about 10 million K. Although the Soviet team was highly respected, the results were so good that there was serious concern their indirect temperature measurements might be unreliable and they had fallen prey to a measurement problem like the one that had occurred with ZETA. Spitzer, once again, expressed his scepticism rather strongly, sparking off an acrimonious debate with Artsimovich.

The Soviets were equally concerned about this, and even though it was the height of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, Artsimovich invited UKAEA to bring their laser system to the <a href="Kurchatov%20Institute">Kurchatov Institute</a> and independently measure the performance. Artsimovich had previously called their system "brilliant." The team became known as "the Culham five", performing a series of measurements in late 1968 and early 1969. The resulting paper was published in November 1969 and convinced the fusion research field that the tokamak was indeed reaching the levels of performance the Soviets claimed. The result was a "veritable stampede" of tokamak construction around the world, and it remains the most studied device in the fusion field.

Tokamaks are toroidal pinch machines. The key difference is the relative strengths of the fields. In the stabilised pinch machines, most of the magnetic field in the plasma was generated by the current induced in it. The strength of the external stabilisation fields was much lower and only penetrated into the outer layers of the plasma mass. The tokamak reversed this; the external magnets were much more powerful and the plasma current greatly reduced in comparison. Artsimovich put it this way:

This difference is today part of a general concept known as the "<a href="Safety%20factor%20%28plasma%20physics%29">safety factor</a>", denoted q. It has to be greater than one to maintain stability during a discharge; in ZETA it was about . A ZETA-type machine could reach this q, but would require enormously powerful external magnets to match the fields from the currents. The tokamak approach resolved this by using less pinch current; this made the system stable but meant the current could no longer be used to heat the plasma. Tokamak designs require some form of external heating.

In 1965, the newly opened Culham laboratory hosted what had become a periodic meeting of international fusion researchers. Of all the work presented, only two papers on stabilised pinch were present, both on ZETA. Spitzer did not mention them during the opening comments.

Normally, the pulse of electricity sent into ZETA formed a current pulse with a shape similar to a <a href="Poisson%20distribution">Poisson distribution</a>, ramping up quickly then trailing off. One of the papers noted that the plasma stability reached a maximum just after the current began to taper off, and then lasted longer than the current pulse itself. This phenomenon was dubbed "quiescence".

Three years later, in 1968, the international meeting was being held in Novosibirsk where Soviet results with the T-3 tokamak were first released. This overshadowed a paper by Robinson and King that had examined the quiescence period and determined it was due to the original toroidal magnetic field reversing itself, creating a more stable configuration.

<a href="John%20Bryan%20Taylor">John Bryan Taylor</a> took up the issue and began a detailed theoretical study of the concept, publishing a groundbreaking 1974 article on the topic. He demonstrated that as the magnetic field that generated the pinch was relaxing, it interacted with the pre-existing stabilising fields, creating a self-stable magnetic field. The phenomenon was driven by the system's desire to preserve <a href="magnetic%20helicity">magnetic helicity</a>, which suggested a number of ways to improve the confinement time.

Although the stabilising force was lower than the force available in the pinch, it lasted considerably longer. It appeared that a reactor could be built that would approach the <a href="Lawson%20criterion">Lawson criterion</a> from a different direction, using extended confinement times rather than increased density. This was similar to the stellarator approach in concept, and although it would have lower field strength than those machines, the energy needed to maintain the confinement was much lower. Today this approach is known as the <a href="reversed%20field%20pinch">reversed field pinch</a> (RFP) and has been a field of continued study.

Taylor's study of the relaxation into the reversed state led to his development of a broader theoretical understanding of the role of magnetic helicity and minimum energy states, greatly advancing the understanding of plasma dynamics. The minimum-energy state, known as the "<a href="Taylor%20state">Taylor state</a>", is particularly important in the understanding of new fusion approaches in the <a href="compact%20toroid">compact toroid</a> class. Taylor went on to study the <a href="ballooning%20transformation">ballooning transformation</a>, a problem that was occurring in the latest high-performance toroidal machines as large-scale waveforms formed in the plasma. His work in fusion research won him the 1999 <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell%20Prize%20in%20Plasma%20Physics">James Clerk Maxwell Prize in Plasma Physics</a>.

Culham officially opened in 1965, and various teams began leaving the former sites through this period. A team kept ZETA operational until September 1968. Hangar 7, which housed ZETA and other machines, was demolished during financial year 2005/2006.

Chat Moss

Chat Moss is a large area of <a href="bog">peat bog</a> that makes up 30 per cent of the <a href="City%20of%20Salford">City of Salford</a>, in <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England. North of the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a> and <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a>, to the west of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, it occupies an area of about .

As it might be recognised today, Chat Moss is thought to be about 7,000 years old, but peat development seems to have begun there with the ending of the last <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>, about 10,000 years ago. The depth of peat ranges from . A great deal of <a href="Land%20reclamation">reclamation</a> work has been carried out, particularly during the 19th century, but a large-scale network of drainage channels is still required to keep the land from reverting to bog. In 1958 workers extracting peat discovered the severed head of what is believed to be a <a href="Romano-British">Romano-British</a> <a href="Celt">Celt</a>, possibly a sacrificial victim, in the eastern part of the bog near <a href="Worsley">Worsley</a>.

Much of Chat Moss is now prime agricultural land, although farming in the area is in decline. A area of Chat Moss, notified as <a href="Astley%20and%20Bedford%20Mosses">Astley and Bedford Mosses</a>, was designated a <a href="List%20of%20Sites%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest%20in%20Greater%20Manchester">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> in 1989. Along with nearby <a href="Risley%20Moss">Risley Moss</a> and Holcroft Moss, Astley and Bedford Mosses has also been designated as a <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> <a href="Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation">Special Area of Conservation</a>, known as Manchester Mosses.

Chat Moss threatened the completion of the <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>, until <a href="George%20Stephenson">George Stephenson</a>, with advice from East Anglian marshland specialist Robert Stannard, succeeded in constructing a railway line through it in 1829; his solution was to "float" the line on a bed of bound heather and branches topped with tar and covered with rubble stone. The <a href="M62%20motorway">M62 motorway</a>, completed in 1976, also crosses the bog, to the north of <a href="Irlam">Irlam</a>.

Chat Moss may be named after <a href="Chad%20of%20Mercia">St Chad</a>, a 7th-century bishop of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic</a> word "ced", meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> personal name and "mos", a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English "ceat" meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. "Moss" is the local name for a peat bog.

<a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> visited the area in 1724, on his way from <a href="Warrington">Warrington</a> to <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>:

Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century. <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a>, writing during the reign of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a>, described one such event:

Chat Moss presented a significant challenge to the engineers constructing the <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a> in 1826 because of the difficulty in providing a solid base for the track, in particular at a location known as Blackpool Hole. <a href="George%20Stephenson">George Stephenson</a> was the engineer in charge of the project, and his initial idea was to dump enough spoil in the bog so that it would reach the bottom. This approach turned out to be impractical however, as the liquidity of the bog allowed the spoil to flow away from where the track was to be laid. The eventual solution, to build the line on a "floating" wood and stone foundation, was hailed as a "great triumph of engineering". The first train ran through Chat Moss in 1830, and the line is still in use today.

The first attempt at <a href="Land%20reclamation">reclaiming</a> Chat Moss took place at the start of the 19th century. In 1793 <a href="William%20Roscoe">William Roscoe</a> began work on reclaiming the smaller Trafford Moss, now part of <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a>. By 1798 that work was sufficiently advanced for Roscoe to enter into a lease of part of Chat Moss from the de Trafford family, but no reclamation work was carried out until 1805.

Reclamation methods varied somewhat during the 19th century, but three basic operations featured; constructing drains at appropriate intervals; building a system of roads to allow access to the land so that materials such as <a href="clay">clay</a>, <a href="Lime%20%28mineral%29">lime</a> or <a href="marl">marl</a> could be dumped on it, to give it body; and fertilising the land by adding manure, often in the form of the euphemistically named <a href="night%20soil">night soil</a>, collected from neighbouring towns.
The reclamation of Chat Moss and Trafford Moss was innovative in that instead of constructing roads to give access for the material to be dumped onto the bog, a movable light railway was developed. Narrow gauge track – which allowed the weight of the wagons to be spread evenly across an area of the bog – was temporarily laid down and then picked up and relaid elsewhere as needed. Roscoe was declared bankrupt in 1821, but the reclamation work continued under the stewardship of others who took over his leasehold interest, amongst them William Baines, the anti-<a href="Corn%20Law">Corn Law</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> and owner of the "<a href="Leeds%20Mercury">Leeds Mercury</a>" newspaper.

Between 1831 and 1851, the population of nearby Manchester increased by more than 150 per cent, putting considerable pressure on refuse disposal. The problem was exacerbated by a gradual switch from the 1870s onwards from the older cesspit methods of sewage disposal to <a href="pail%20closet">pail closet</a>s, which required regular emptying. By the 1880s, Manchester was producing more than of refuse annually, about 75 per cent of that being night soil. In 1895, <a href="Manchester%20City%20Council">Manchester Corporation</a> purchased of Chat Moss known as Chat Moss Estate from <a href="Sir%20Humphrey%20de%20Trafford%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir Humphrey de Trafford</a>, with a view to using the moss as a refuse disposal site. The final price paid by the corporation was £137,531 7<a href="Shilling">s</a> 1<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d</a> (equivalent to £ in )
Refuse was carried on barges down the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a> as far as Boysnope Wharf, where it was loaded onto a light railway system to be taken into the moss for dumping. Farmers on Chat Moss were legally required by their tenancy agreements to accept a specified amount of refuse on their land, and were even obliged to pay for it. Farmers could themselves undertake reclamation work, with the land reclaimed being incorporated into their tenancies. An agreement dated 1905, between Manchester Corporation and Plant Cottage Farm, shows that the corporation agreed to of refuse per <a href="acre">acre</a> free of charge for the first year, with the tenant being obliged to accept of refuse per acre each year thereafter. The dumping of night soil on Chat Moss ended in 1923, but general refuse continued to be dumped on a diminishing scale until it finally ended in 1966.

Once drained, stabilised and fertilised, Chat Moss became prime agricultural land, supplying Manchester with salad and other vegetables. The drainage channels, still required today, give the area its distinctive flat landscape broken up by ditches instead of hedges or walls. Even after all of the reclamation work that has taken place, parts of the area remain remote and bleak.

A scheme was devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by lighting decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester was protected by four of these <a href="Starfish%20site">Starfish site</a>s as they were known, two of them on Chat Moss. <a href="RAF%20Balloon%20Command">RAF Balloon Command</a> was responsible for the administration and manning of the sites, which were fully operational by 23 January 1941. Each consisted of an air raid shelter for the crew along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.

In August 1958, workmen digging peat in an area of Chat Moss near <a href="Worsley">Worsley</a> discovered a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head had been in the bog for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.

The discovery of the nearby <a href="Lindow%20Man">Lindow Man</a> in 1984 generated renewed interest in <a href="bog%20body">bog bodies</a>, and in 1987 what had become known as Worsley Man was re-examined. The inspection revealed a wound behind the right ear, fractures to the top of the skull, and a cut through the vertebra where he had been decapitated. The remains of a <a href="garotte">garotte</a> were also found around his neck, all of which was suggestive of a <a href="Celts%20and%20human%20sacrifice">ritual killing</a> rather than an accidental death, perhaps related to the <a href="Celtic%20polytheism%23Head%20hunting">Celtic cult of the severed head</a>. The condition of the <a href="Pulp%20%28tooth%29">tooth pulp</a> suggested that Worsley Man was 20–30 years old at the time of his death, which <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a> of a fragment of preserved soft tissue indicated was during the late <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, some time around 120 AD, identifying him as a <a href="Romano-British">Romano-British</a> <a href="Celt">Celt</a>. Worsley Man is now in the care of the <a href="Manchester%20Museum">Manchester Museum</a>.

At (53.4629, -2.4316), Chat Moss lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of <a href="Bunter%20%28geology%29">Bunter sandstones</a> overlaid with <a href="marl">marl</a>s laid down during the <a href="Late%20Triassic">Late Triassic</a> period. Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of <a href="boulder%20clay">boulder clay</a> deposited during the last <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the <a href="River%20Mersey">Mersey</a> Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the <a href="Glaze%20Brook">River Glaze</a> in the west, and <a href="Worsley">Worsley</a> and <a href="Eccles%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Eccles</a> in the east, to the north of what was the <a href="River%20Irwell">River Irwell</a> – now the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a> – are known collectively as Chat Moss.
Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing <a href="peat">peat</a>, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about , and is about long, about across at its widest point, lying above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in <a href="City%20of%20Salford">Salford</a>, but extends into <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Wigan">Wigan</a>. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About of degraded bog remain, with of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between and .

The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are "Sphagnum cuspidatum", "S. imbricatum", and "S. acutifolia". The peat up to about from the surface is mainly humidified "S. acutifolia", with fresher "S. imbricatum" peat nearer the surface.

A area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a <a href="List%20of%20Sites%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest%20in%20Greater%20Manchester">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> in 1989. Astley & Bedford Mosses, along with <a href="Risley%20Moss">Risley Moss</a> and Holcroft Moss, is also a <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> designated <a href="Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation">Special Area of Conservation</a>, known as Manchester Mosses.

The major habitats in the moss are bog, heathland, woodland and acidic grassland, subject to varying degrees of wetness depending on the local drainage. The remaining areas of bog are dominated by common cottongrass "Eriophorum angustifolium" and
hare's-tail cottongrass "E. vaginatum". Bog mosses are more scarce, but "Sphagnum cuspidatum", "S. recurvum", "S. tenellum", "S. fimbriatum" and "S. subnitens" occur in patches. As the peat has become drier, areas have been taken over by purple moor grass "Molinia caerulea" and by downy birch "Betula pubescens". The moss also supports several bird species, and is particularly important for wintering <a href="bird%20of%20prey">raptor</a>s such as the <a href="hen%20harrier">hen harrier</a> "Circus cyaneus cyaneus", the <a href="short-eared%20owl">short-eared owl</a> "Asio flammeus" and the <a href="Merlin%20%28bird%29">merlin</a> "Falco columbarius", along with breeding species such as the <a href="Eurasian%20curlew">curlew</a> "Numenius arquata" and the <a href="long-eared%20owl">long-eared owl</a> "Asio otus". There is a large <a href="heronry">heronry</a> in Botany Bay Wood, the largest area of woodland in Greater Manchester.

The domestic and industrial waste dumped on Chat Moss resulted in very high levels of heavy metals such as lead and copper in the soil, raising concerns that crops grown there may pose a health risk. The high <a href="pH">pH</a> of the peaty soil limits the mobility of the metals however, and prevents them being taken up by crops.

Chat Moss makes up the largest area of prime farmland in Greater Manchester, but farming on the moss is in decline. In 2003, it was reported that of the 54 farms on the moss, occupying , almost half the area of the bog, only three were growing vegetables. Others had turned to arable farming, turf growing or horse livery instead of salad and vegetable crops. Chat Moss also contains the largest block of semi-natural woodland in Greater Manchester.

Most of the area is now <a href="Green%20Belt">Green Belt</a>, placing restrictions on the kinds of developments that can take place. There are areas of commercial peat extraction, but Salford City Council is seeking to return at least some back to wet mossland. Planning permission for peat extraction expired at the end of 2010. At a meeting held on 30 June 2011 Salford Council decided not to renew the permission, and on 1 August obtained a court order prohibiting any further extraction pending an appeal by the companies involved. A <a href="public%20inquiry">public inquiry</a> concluded in 2012 supported the council's decision, and commercial peat extraction on Chat Moss ceased.

In 1994 the British composer <a href="Peter%20Maxwell%20Davies">Peter Maxwell Davies</a>, who was born in <a href="County%20Borough%20of%20Salford">Salford</a>, wrote a seven-minute <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a> for school orchestra, titled "Chat Moss". Chat Moss was also the subject of a ceiling painting produced as the result of a research project jointly funded by the <a href="Arts%20and%20Humanities%20Research%20Council">Arts and Humanities Research Board</a> and <a href="Arts%20Council%20England">Arts Council England</a>. The project was a collaboration between artist Derek Hampson and geographer Gary Priestnall. Hampson chose Chat Moss as their subject because of its 19th-century historical significance as the site of the world's first passenger railway and its "anti-picturesque appearance", a "nondescript landscape of stumpy trees and expanses of grass". The artwork, painted on more than 100 ceiling tiles, was exhibited in November 2004 at the REDUX Gallery in London.

SR Leader class

The Leader was a class of experimental <a href="0-6-0%2B0-6-0">0-6-0+0-6-0</a> <a href="articulated%20locomotive">articulated steam locomotive</a>, produced in the United Kingdom to the design of the innovative engineer <a href="Oliver%20Bulleid">Oliver Bulleid</a>. The Leader was an attempt to extend the life of steam traction by eliminating many of the operational drawbacks associated with existing steam locomotives. It was intended as a replacement for the ageing fleet of <a href="LSWR%20M7%20class">M7 class</a> tank engines still in operation on the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">Southern Railway</a> (SR). Design work began in 1946 and development continued after the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, under the auspices of <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a> (BR).

The Leader project was part of Bulleid's desire to modernise the steam locomotive based on experience gained with the Southern Railway's fleet of electric stock. Bulleid considered that attitudes towards the labour-intensity of steam operation had changed during the post-war period, favouring <a href="Diesel%20locomotive">dieselisation</a> and <a href="Electric%20locomotive">electrification</a>. In an effort to demonstrate the continued potential of steam, Bulleid pushed forward the boundaries of steam-power, allowing it to compete with diesel and electric locomotives in terms of labour-saving and ease of operation.

The design incorporated many novel features, such as the use of <a href="thermic%20siphon">thermic siphon</a>s, <a href="bogies">bogies</a> and cabs at each end of the locomotive, resulting in its unique—for a steam locomotive—modern diesel-like appearance. Several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however, partly accounting for the project's cancellation in the early 1950s. Five Leader locomotives were begun, although only one was completed. The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding spiralling development costs, led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.

The basis of the Leader originated from a 1944 review of the Southern Railway's steam locomotive fleet, resulting in a Southern Railway design brief which called for a high-powered locomotive requiring little maintenance to replace the ageing fleet of M7 class tank engines. The brief also stipulated that the locomotive would be used on both passenger and freight trains, requiring high route availability. Bulleid proposed an initial design based on his <a href="SR%20Q1%20class">SR Q1 class</a> locomotive, which had proved easy to maintain in service. As the proposal progressed, Bulleid saw that certain tasks required with conventional steam locomotives could be eliminated by adopting some of the features of the contemporary Southern <a href="electric%20locomotives">electric locomotives</a>. However, one of the subsequent designs of a <a href="0-4-4-0">0-4-4-0</a> wheel arrangement had an unacceptably high axle-loading of , which increased the risk of damaging the Southern Railway's track. By developing the proposal further, Bulleid settled for a 0-6-0+0-6-0 design of bogied tank locomotive, which spread the weight more evenly over the rails and reduced the axle-loading.

A series of initial ideas were presented to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a <a href="boiler">boiler</a> or <a href="Tender%20%28rail%29">tender</a> obscuring his view. The need for a <a href="Turntable%20%28railroad%29">turntable</a> to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two <a href="0-6-0">0-6-0</a> steam <a href="bogies">bogies</a> with weight-saving <a href="sleeve%20valve">sleeve valve</a>s and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near the centre of the locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an <a href="0-6-6-0">0-6-6-0</a> <a href="tank%20engine">tank engine</a>, even though the actual notation is <a href="0-6-0%2B0-6-0">0-6-0+0-6-0</a> since both engine units pivoted as on a <a href="Garratt">Garratt</a>, <a href="Fairlie%20locomotive%23Double%20Fairlie%20locomotive">Double Fairlie</a> or <a href="Meyer%20locomotive">Meyer locomotive</a>.

The Leader prototype was constructed at <a href="Brighton%20railway%20works">Brighton railway works</a>, work beginning in 1946. An initial order for five locomotives was placed straight from the drawing board in 1946 and a further 31 were ordered in 1947, although, with nationalisation looming, this was merely a gesture. The latter order was cancelled after the Southern Railway was taken into public ownership, to allow trials to be carried out on the prototype. 

Each of the two <a href="bogies">bogies</a> had three cylinders, with the driving wheels connected by chains enclosed in an oil-bath, based upon Bulleid's <a href="Bulleid%20chain-driven%20valve%20gear">chain-driven valve gear</a> on his Pacific locomotives. The <a href="valve%20gear">valve gear</a> used the unusual <a href="sleeve%20valve">sleeve valve</a> arrangement that was also tested on the ex-<a href="LB%26amp%3BSCR%20H1%20class">LB&SCR H1 class</a> "Hartland Point" in parallel with the construction of the first Leader locomotive. The Leader was the first steam locomotive to use a form of sleeve valve since <a href="Cecil%20Paget">Cecil Paget</a>'s <a href="Midland%20Railway%20Paget%20locomotive">locomotive of 1908</a> and the concurrent testing of the principle on "Hartland Point" hints at the rushed nature of the locomotive's conception. The locomotive sat on the unusual <a href="Bulleid%20Firth%20Brown%20wheel">Bulleid Firth Brown wheel</a>s, which were lighter, yet stronger, than the spoked equivalent. 

The use of sleeve valves and oil baths to lubricate the moving parts of the engine units was inspired by contemporary <a href="internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion engine</a> practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures it was meant to eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.

The three cylinders of each bogie were cast in mono-block format, each surrounded by two annular inlet steam chests and a single large outlet steam chest. These had the added function of keeping the cylinder heated by hot steam to maintain the temperature and pressure of steam entering the cylinders. However, these castings were difficult to machine accurately. The steam-sealing arrangements needed for this system were also complex, with each of the six cylinders and valve sleeves requiring 24 sealing rings.

The boiler was the culmination of lessons learned with the Pacifics and was a prolific steam-raiser. All Leader boilers were constructed at <a href="Eastleigh">Eastleigh</a>, and proved to be the least problematic area of the entire design. The boiler pressure was set at and each was fitted with four <a href="thermic%20siphon">thermic siphon</a>s within the <a href="firebox%20%28steam%20engine%29">firebox</a>, both to increase the rate of evaporation and improve water circulation. These had been used previously to great effect on Bulleid's <a href="SR%20Merchant%20Navy%20class">Merchant Navy</a> and <a href="SR%20West%20Country%20and%20Battle%20of%20Britain%20classes">West Country and Battle of Britain class</a> designs. 

The Leader had a "dry lining" firebox. It was not surrounded on top and sides by a "jacket" of water as in normal practice, but was constructed of welded steel and used firebricks instead of water for insulation, a novel but troublesome solution. Using firebricks reduced the grate area from to and concentrated the fire in a smaller area. The firehole door was offset to the left of the boiler backhead, which created difficulties for the fireman when adding coal to the fire. The firebox was not initially equipped with a firebrick arch, although one was retro-fitted during the summer of 1950. The arch was problematic because it led to a tendency for flames to enter the cab at high outputs, a situation made worse by the narrowing of the firebox area.

The <a href="smokebox">smokebox</a> had an inherent problem in maintaining a constant <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a>. This was a result of another Bulleid labour-saving innovation, a sliding hatch controlled from the front cab, that enabled ash to be cleaned out via a chute onto the track when the locomotive was on the move. The problem lay with ash gathering around the edges of the slide, allowing air to leak into the smokebox, thereby reducing the overall efficiency of the locomotive. The fierce blast from the exhaust also meant that ash and embers were ejected into the atmosphere, creating a potential lineside fire hazard. 

For ease of maintenance, the boiler, firebox and smokebox were encased in steel sheeting, which meant that the engine's shape resembled that of a modern <a href="diesel%20locomotive">diesel locomotive</a>. That was a major departure from traditional steam locomotive design, allowing the engine to be cleaned using a carriage-washing plant. The locomotive was designed to carry 4 tons (4.06 tonnes) of coal and of water, and the coal bunker was covered by a tarpaulin to prevent water ingress into the fireman's cab. Entry into the locomotive was by way of ladders leading up to sliding doors, although, due to the bogie design, the climb into the fireman's cab necessitated clambering over the oilbath casing.

Construction of the first five Leader locomotives began at the Southern Railway's <a href="Brighton%20railway%20works">Brighton railway works</a> in July 1947. British Railways inherited the Leader project upon nationalisation in 1948, which was far enough advanced to continue constructing the prototype, as Bulleid was still Chief Mechanical Engineer of the newly formed <a href="Southern%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">Southern Region of British Railways</a>. Although work on the other four locomotives stalled, the prototype Leader emerged from Brighton as locomotive No. 36001 in June 1949. 

The other four members of the initial order made by the Southern Railway, Nos. 36002–5, were at varying stages of construction by the end of the development period. No. 36002 was almost complete, No. 36003 was without its outer casing, and Nos. 36004–5 were little more than sets of frames, although most of their major components had been constructed at Eastleigh and Brighton and were stored ready for fitting. With no prospect of further money being allocated by the Railway Executive for their completion, the unfinished locomotives were put into store at various depots around the former Southern Railway network pending a decision on their future.

No. 36001 was immediately put into service trials using empty passenger carriage stock in the south-east of England. The official trial records kept at Brighton works reported varying degrees of success and failure on the runs undertaken. However, the results of the trials as reported to <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a> headquarters at <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a> were "conspicuous by the absence of praise" for the strengths of the Leader, namely the boiler, braking system and total adhesion provided by the two bogies. Several theories have been put forward regarding this state of affairs, the most plausible being that the more conservative members of the railway workforce at Brighton and the <a href="Railway%20Executive">Railway Executive</a> felt that the Leader was too revolutionary and were keen to maintain the status quo.

Following trials that lasted over a year, No. 36001 was shown to have several flaws, including heavy coal and water consumption, mechanical unreliability, untenable working conditions for both fireman and driver, loss of steam through the cylinder rings and uneven weight distribution on the bogies. After renewing the cylinder assembly, it was tested around <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> and <a href="Eastleigh">Eastleigh</a> using an <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">LNER</a> <a href="Dynamometer%20car">Dynamometer car</a>, where good running was experienced at high costs in fuel and effort on the part of the fireman. The Leader was tested against the performance of a <a href="SR%20U%20class">U class</a> control locomotive and indicated that the brake release was too slow in service for use on tight schedules despite the brake application being noted as the best used on a Bulleid design. 

Throughout No. 36001's trials, the firebrick lining provided a constant problem by continually collapsing into the fire. The firebricks were then replaced with <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> substitutes that melted in the intense heat of the firebox, which were in turn replaced by thicker firebricks. Some of the firemen allotted to the Leader complained about cramped conditions in the centre cab of the locomotive, a situation made worse by flames entering the cab from the firebox at high outputs. It was an enclosed space that was constantly hot and the single fireman's entrance door on the side of the locomotive was left open during travel to promote ventilation. The door into the fireman's cab also attracted criticism, as it would have been blocked in the event of the locomotive overturning on that side, preventing the fireman's escape, so that members of the railway trade union <a href="Associated%20Society%20of%20Locomotive%20Engineers%20and%20Firemen">ASLEF</a> threatened to stop their crews from operating the Leader.
The offset boiler and coal bunker caused the locomotive's centre of gravity to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be undertaken to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's cab. To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank and coal chute and therefore away from the hot gases circulating inside the smokebox.

Despite its problems, the locomotive displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction from the two <a href="power%20bogie">power bogie</a>s on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of keeping up with the schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.

When the project was under the auspices of the Southern Railway, No. 36001 would have been numbered CC101. Bulleid advocated a continental style of locomotive nomenclature, based upon his experiences at the French branch of <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric">Westinghouse Electric</a> before the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. The Southern Railway number followed an adaptation of the <a href="UIC%20classification">UIC classification</a> system where "C" refers to the number of driving axles – in this case three on each bogie. Since the design has six driving axles, the numbering would have been CC101–CC105 for the initial batch, the final number being the locomotive identifier.

Operational livery was ex-works photographic grey with red and white lining. The British Railways "Cycling Lion" crest was also used though, after the works photograph, this was painted over without explanation. Numbering was the British Railways standard system, in the 36001 series. If the class had gone into full production, the locomotives would have been painted in British Railways mixed traffic/freight black livery with red, grey and cream lining. 36001 was initially painted in this livery but this preceded the official works photograph and was subsequently repainted in photographic grey livery.

Despite the high expectations attached to the Leader, it was not the motive power revolution that Bulleid intended it to be. No part of the Leader design was perpetuated on the <a href="BR%20standard%20classes">British Railways Standard class locomotives</a> by <a href="Robert%20Riddles">Robert Riddles</a>, nor did it find favour internationally, with the <a href="Garratt">Garratt</a> articulated locomotives providing a similar function for less maintenance. The whole concept was quietly dropped in 1951 after Bulleid left British Railways to become <a href="Chief%20Mechanical%20Engineer">Chief Mechanical Engineer</a> of <a href="C%C3%B3ras%20Iompair%20%C3%89ireann">Córas Iompair Éireann</a> (where he produced <a href="CI%C3%89%20No.%20CC1">CIÉ No. CC1</a>, a <a href="peat">peat</a>-burning locomotive to a similar design) and all five were scrapped. The culmination of the project was a £178,865 5s 0d (equivalent to £ as of ) bill for the taxpayer though, when the press reported the story as late as 1953, it was claimed that £500,000 (equivalent to £ as of ) was wasted on the project. <a href="R.%20G.%20Jarvis">R. G. Jarvis</a>, who was placed in charge of the project after Bulleid's departure, insisted that the locomotive required an entire re-design to solve the problems of the original concept. 

No members of the Leader class survived the 1950s and only the numberplates of No. 36001 and No. 36002 are known to exist. The numberplate for No. 36001 is in the <a href="National%20Railway%20Museum">National Railway Museum</a>; a locomotive builder's plate intended for the locomotive, but never fitted in service, was auctioned for £1050 in 2008. The Leader was a bold attempt at pushing back the boundaries of contemporary steam locomotive design and, if successful, would have prolonged the life of steam on Britain's Railways.

Nicolo Giraud

Nicolo or Nicolas Giraud ( – after 1815) was a friend and possibly a lover of the English <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> poet <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>. The two met in 1809 while Byron was staying in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. Giraud was reported to have taught him Italian, and was his travel companion in Greece. Byron paid for Giraud's education and left him £7,000 (about £ in 2019) in his will. Years after they parted company, Byron changed his will to exclude Giraud. Other than his involvement with Byron, little is known of Giraud's life.

The friendship between Byron and Giraud has become a topic of interest among scholars and biographers of Byron. Many believe that the pair's relationship was platonic, but correspondence between Byron and his friends has been used since the late 20th century to argue that the two were engaged in a love affair. The earliest claim of a sexual relationship between them comes from <a href="George%20Colman%20the%20Younger">George Colman</a>'s poem "Don Leon", in which Byron is the principal character and Giraud is portrayed as his liberator from the sexual prejudices in Britain. The poem is not biographical; it promotes Colman's own social and political views.

Nicolas Giraud was born in Greece to French parents; the name by which he is most commonly known, Nicolo, was given to him by Byron. Giraud may have been the brother-in-law of <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Lusieri">Giovanni Battista Lusieri</a>, a Roman painter and broker for <a href="Thomas%20Bruce%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Elgin">Lord Elgin</a>. Demetrius Zograffo, Byron's guide in Greece, informed Byron that the 60-year-old Lusieri was unmarried, and was courting two women, each of whom believed that Lusieri was to marry her. Lusieri certainly had a close relationship with Giraud, so it is possible that the two were related in another way, perhaps as father and son. Byron met Giraud in Athens in January 1809, and the two were companions until Byron resumed his travels in March.

During the following year, Giraud was working at a <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin">Capuchin</a> monastery when he was assigned to teach Byron Italian after the latter's return to Greece. The two spent their days studying, swimming, and taking in the landscape as Byron composed poetry. In a letter to <a href="John%20Hobhouse%2C%201st%20Baron%20Broughton">John Hobhouse</a>, dated 23 August 1810 and written at the Capuchin monastery of Mendele near Athens where he was residing, Byron states:

But my friend, as you may easily imagine, is Nicolo who by-the-by, is my Italian master, and we are already very philosophical. I am his "Padrone" and his "amico", and the Lord knows what besides. It is about two hours since, that, after informing me he was most desirous to follow him (that is me) over the world, he concluded by telling me it was proper for us not only to live, but ""morire insieme"" [die together]. The latter I hope to avoid – as much of the former as he pleases.

Byron took Giraud to visit <a href="Charles%20Lewis%20Meryon">Charles Lewis Meryon</a>, an English doctor who recounted the visit in his memoirs and noted Byron's vivid interest in the boy. Afterward, rumours were spread by Byron's servant that the consultation concerned an anal rupture. Meryon was a travelling companion with Michael Bruce and <a href="Lady%20Hester%20Stanhope">Lady Hester Stanhope</a>, one of Byron's friends. Accounts from Bruce and <a href="Howe%20Browne%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Sligo">Howe Browne</a>, both witnesses to Byron's interactions with Giraud, provided confirmation of the relationship to Byron's early biographer <a href="Thomas%20Moore">Thomas Moore</a>, although in disparaging terms. In mid-1810, Giraud acted as Byron's <a href="majordomo">majordomo</a> on their travels to the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>, and took care of Byron during his illness while at <a href="Patras">Patras</a>, eventually becoming ill himself. After recovering, although still weak, the pair continued on their travels, arriving at Athens on 13 October. By November they were joined by Lusieri, Louis François Sébastien Fauvel, who was a French consul, and a group of German academics.

Byron and Giraud parted ways in <a href="Valletta">Valletta</a>, Malta. Byron saw to Giraud's education by paying for his schooling in a monastery on the island. The two stayed in contact by letter, and after a year Giraud left the monastery, telling Byron that he was tired of the company of monks. Shortly after Giraud left Malta, Byron drew up for him in his will a bequest of £7,000 (£ in 2019), almost twice as much as he later lent for refitting the Greek Navy. The will read: "To Nicolo Giraud of Athens, subject of France, but born in Greece, the sume of seven thousand pounds sterling, to be paid from the sale of such parts of <a href="Rochdale">Rochdale</a>, Newstead or elsewhere, as may enable the said Nicolo Giraud ... to receive the above sum on his attaining the age of twenty-one years." Byron later removed Giraud from his will (as he did with John Edleston – who predeceased him – and other boyhood companions).

Giraud wrote to Byron in January 1815:

Byron had not been responding to Nicolo's letters, which Nicolo mentions in the letter: "It is now almost three years that I am at Athens; and have sent you many letters, but I have not received any answer". It is possible that Byron did not respond because he was married and, according to the 20th-century Byron biographer <a href="Phyllis%20Grosskurth">Phyllis Grosskurth</a>, "Nicolo was the last person he would have wanted to hear from."

Giraud's relationship with Byron has been a topic discussed by many of Byron's biographers. Moore, Byron's early biographer, described the relationship between Byron and Giraud as:

Early 20th-century biographer André Maurois argues that "what Byron was capable of loving in another was a certain kind of innocence and youthfulness" and that the relationship was one of Byron's "protective passions". Likewise, <a href="G.%20Wilson%20Knight">G. Wilson Knight</a>, in his 1953 biography of Byron, believes that Byron became protective over Giraud just as he did with all of the children he met during his travels. Giraud was special to Byron, and, according to Knight, "it was probably of Nicolo that he was thinking when he wrote that Greece was 'the only place I was ever contented in. In "Byron: A Biography", published in 1957, Marchand points out that Byron "wished Hobhouse there to share the nonsensical gaiety" of when Byron and Giraud were together, but changed his mind after remembering that Hobhouse's personality would not be conducive to entertainment. Their time together "was a relaxed pleasure that [Byron] was to remember more fondly than most of the adventures of his travels".

A few critics disagree with the speculation over Giraud's and Byron's relationship. The early 20th-century biographer <a href="Ethel%20Colburn%20Mayne">Ethel Mayne</a> points out both the frequency of such relationships in Byron's life and their inherent ambiguity when she says, "His stay was also marked by one of those ambiguous friendships with a youth infinitely below him in rank which have already been seen to recur in his life ... The patron was supposed to be learning Italian from [Girard]; this made a pretext for giving him, on their parting at Malta in 1811 ... a considerable sum of money". <a href="Elizabeth%20Longford">Elizabeth Longford</a>, in her 1976 biography, disagrees with the claims that there was a physical relationship between the two and argues, "Byron's especial favourite among the 'ragazzi' was Nicolo Giraud. He had first taken up with Nicolo while Hobhouse was away in <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> the year before, but there is no evidence that his feelings for Nicolo were anything but romantic and protective." Jerome Christensen followed this view in 1993 and adds, "we know little more than what Byron tells us".

Christensen points out that "although there is no evidence that Lord Byron, "padrone" and "amico", was ever so vulgar as to set an exact market value on his sexual arrangements in Greece, Nicolo Giraud, Eustathius's replacement in Byron's affections, was employed as 'dragoman and Major Domo', a position that almost certainly entailed payment in love "and" money". D. L. MacDonald's 1986 biography simply describes Giraud as "The great love of Byron's Eastern tour", and D. S. Neff's 2002 work describes the two as part of "an amorous relationship". Others, such Jay Losey and William Brewer in their analysis of 19th-century sexuality, speculate that Byron's relationship with Giraud was modeled on a Grecian form of <a href="pederasty">pederasty</a>, and homosexual studies scholar Louis Crompton believes that pederasty was a facet of Byron's life and that his letters hinted towards a sexual relationship between Byron and Giraud. As Paul Douglass, in an analysis of Byron biographical studies, points out, Crompton also claims that biographers like Marchand ignored the nature of Byron's relationship with Giraud. Douglass also mentions that Crompton's work, "Byron and Greek Love" "focuses Byron's life around a single issue, rather than attempting to create a larger view. Such studies prompt negative responses from those who feel the writer warps Byron to fit the theme, presenting a one-sided account".

Benita Eisler, in 2000, argues that Giraud was one of many of Byron's intended sexual conquests. Although, as Eisler claims, Byron was at first unable to attain "that state of total and complete satisfaction" of a sexual relationship with Giraud, he wrote to Charles Matthews declaring that he would soon conquer any of the boy's remaining inhibitions. During Byron's illness, Byron boasted to Hobhouse and <a href="Elizabeth%20Lamb%2C%20Viscountess%20Melbourne">Lady Melbourne</a> that he continued to have sex with one such incident almost causing his death. Although it is uncertain, according to Eisler, "Whether this surfeit of erotic fulfillment involved only Nicolo as partner, he does not say. He was still fond enough of the boy, but his sexual obsession, with its attendant scorekeeping, seems to have run its course." Nigel Leask, in 2004, argues that Hobhouse would have disapproved of Byron's relationship with Giraud, and Fiona MacCarthy notes in her 2002 biography that Lady Melbourne "would have understood his partner to be female". In a survey of the various biographical opinions and disagreements about Byron's relationships, including Giraud, written before 2004, Douglass points out that "despite the greater certainty about his sexual ambivalence, the exact nature of those relationships remains elusive".

George Colman, Byron's friend, anonymously wrote a poem called "Don Leon" that, according to Bernard Grebanier, "depicts Byron as having wooed Giraud with gifts when they first met, and to have busied himself with developing the boy's mind".

The narrator of "Don Leon" praises Giraud and claims that Giraud was so beautiful that he:

Throughout the poem, the narrator describes how Byron (Don Leon) spent his time with Giraud:

The poem ends with Giraud's beauty conquering any fears that Byron may have about their relationship:

G. Wilson Knight, unlike most early critics, thought the poem was worthy of response, although he says that it was from "the most indecent poet of high quality in our literature". Grebanier believes that Colman, as "a recipient of Byron's confidence during a crucial period of the poet's life, and as a man who shared Byron's hatred of pretense ... must have seen an ideal subject in presenting ruthlessly, even brutally, the basic truths about Byron's moral dilemma, as a powerful means of blasting once more that sanctimoniousness which has always been fashionable in Britain." Colman's purpose was not necessarily to discuss Giraud, but to respond to those who spread rumours about Byron and criticized Byron for his failed marriage, the reason for his exile. The poem does focus on Giraud, and, as Grebanier argues, "If, the poem says, our hero's affections were fastened upon Nicolo Giraud" then Byron's actions are acceptable because "he was but following the custom of the country. Once he had seen a beautiful Ganymede of fifteen attending the Turkish Governor, a Grecian youth, publicly known as the Governor's 'catamite.' Was it criminal to do what the Governor was doing?"

Byrne Fone, a historian of homosexuality-related issues, emphasizes how the poem and the fictional discussion of Giraud and Byron's relationship reveal insights into 19th-century British views on homosexuality. To Fone, the poem was written by one who knew Byron and reveals Byron's homosexuality. Fone also argues that the 1833 publication of the poem was prompted by the arrest of <a href="William%20John%20Bankes">William Bankes</a>, a homosexual friend of Byron, and the execution of Henry Nicholls for homosexual activity. The opening lines of the poem mention "crippled <a href="Charles%20Maurice%20de%20Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord">Talleyrand</a>", <a href="William%20Thomas%20Beckford">William Beckford</a> and <a href="William%20Courtenay%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Devon">William Courtenay</a>. Fone argues that the references to Beckford and Courtenay are used both to talk about the unfair treatment of homosexual men who had committed no real crime, and to emphasise England's hypocrisy when it comes to sex. The poem then claims that England's treatment of homosexuals forces Don Leon to travel to Greece in order to fulfill his desires and be free of intellectual control, which is fulfilled when Don Leon is able to be with Giraud. The fictional Giraud, according to Fone, allows Don Leon to break free of the <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a> of England. The poem, as he points out, tries to convince Moore to mention Byron's homosexual desires. Fone concludes, "It is not only the poem that is an effective attack on homophobic prejudice, but the example of the poet himself."

Rashtrakuta dynasty

Rashtrakuta (<a href="IAST">IAST</a>: "") was a royal <a href="dynasty">dynasty</a> ruling large parts of the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> between the sixth and 10th centuries. The earliest known Rashtrakuta <a href="Indian%20inscriptions">inscription</a> is a 7th-century <a href="copper%20plate%20grant">copper plate grant</a> detailing their rule from Manapura, a city in Central or West India. Other ruling Rashtrakuta clans from the same period mentioned in inscriptions were the kings of <a href="Achalpur">Achalapur</a> (modern Elichpur in <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>) and the rulers of <a href="Kannauj">Kannauj</a>. Several controversies exist regarding the origin of these early Rashtrakutas, their native home and their language.

The Elichpur clan was a <a href="feudatory">feudatory</a> of the <a href="Badami%20Chalukyas">Badami Chalukyas</a>, and during the rule of <a href="Dantidurga">Dantidurga</a>, it overthrew Chalukya <a href="Kirtivarman%20II">Kirtivarman II</a> and went on to build an empire with the <a href="Gulbarga">Gulbarga</a> region in modern <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> as its base. This clan came to be known as the Rashtrakutas of <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a>, rising to power in <a href="South%20India">South India</a> in 753. At the same time the <a href="Pala%20Empire">Pala dynasty</a> of <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> and the <a href="Prathihara">Prathihara dynasty</a> of <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a> were gaining force in eastern and northwestern India respectively. An Arabic text, "Silsilat al-Tawarikh" (851), called the Rashtrakutas one of the four principal empires of the world.

This period, between the eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a <a href="tripartite%20struggle">tripartite struggle</a> for the resources of the rich <a href="Indo-Gangetic%20Plain">Gangetic plains</a>, each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a> ruled a vast empire stretching from the <a href="Ganges">Ganges River</a> and <a href="Yamuna%20River">Yamuna River</a> <a href="doab">doab</a> in the north to <a href="Cape%20Comorin">Cape Comorin</a> in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and the later kings by <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>.

During their rule, <a href="Jain">Jain</a> mathematicians and scholars contributed important works in <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a>, the most famous king of this dynasty wrote "<a href="Kavirajamarga">Kavirajamarga</a>", a landmark literary work in the <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> language. Architecture reached a milestone in the <a href="Dravidian%20architecture">Dravidian</a> style, the finest example of which is seen in the <a href="Ellora%20Kailasanathar%20Temple">Kailasanath Temple</a> at <a href="Ellora%20Caves">Ellora</a> in modern <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. Other important contributions are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at <a href="Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a> in modern <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, both of which are <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Sites">UNESCO World Heritage Sites</a>.

The origin of the Rashtrakuta dynasty has been a controversial topic of Indian history. These issues pertain to the origin of the earliest ancestors of the Rashtrakutas during the time of Emperor <a href="Ashoka">Ashoka</a> in the 2nd century <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>, and the connection between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan between the 6th and 7th centuries. The relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most famous later dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a> (present day Malkhed in the <a href="Gulbarga%20district">Gulbarga district</a>, Karnataka state), who ruled between the 8th and 10th centuries has also been debated.

The sources for Rashtrakuta history include medieval <a href="Indian%20inscriptions">inscriptions</a>, ancient literature in the <a href="Pali">Pali</a> language, contemporaneous literature in Sanskrit and <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> and the notes of the Arab travellers. Theories about the dynastic lineage ("<a href="Suryavansha">Surya Vamsa</a>"—Solar line and "<a href="Chandravansha">Chandra Vamsa</a>"—Lunar line), the native region and the ancestral home have been proposed, based on information gleaned from inscriptions, royal emblems, the ancient clan names such as "Rashtrika", epithets ("Ratta", "Rashtrakuta", "Lattalura Puravaradhiswara"), the names of princes and princesses of the dynasty, and clues from relics such as coins. Scholars debate over which ethnic/linguistic groups can claim the early Rashtrakutas. Possibilities include the north western ethnic groups of India, the <a href="Kannadiga">Kannadiga</a>, <a href="Reddi">Reddi</a>, the <a href="Maratha">Maratha</a>, or the tribes from the <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab region</a>.

Scholars however concur that the rulers of the imperial dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada language</a> as important as Sanskrit. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and Sanskrit (historians <a href="Sheldon%20Pollock">Sheldon Pollock</a> and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada), and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty. Though these Rashtrakutas were <a href="Kannadiga">Kannadiga</a>s, they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well.

The heart of the Rashtrakuta empire included nearly all of <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> and parts of <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, an area which the Rashtrakutas ruled for over two centuries. The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that the feudatory King <a href="Dantidurga">Dantidurga</a>, who probably ruled from Achalapura in <a href="Berar%20Province">Berar</a> (modern Elichpur in Maharashtra), defeated the great Karnatic army (referring to the army of the <a href="Badami%20Chalukyas">Badami Chalukyas</a>) of Kirtivarman II of <a href="Badami">Badami</a> in 753 and took control of the northern regions of the Chalukya empire. He then helped his father-in-law, <a href="Pallava">Pallava</a> King Nandivarman regain <a href="Kanchi">Kanchi</a> from the Chalukyas and defeated the Gurjaras of <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a>, and the rulers of <a href="Odisha">Kalinga</a>, <a href="Kosala">Kosala</a> and <a href="Srisailam">Srisailam</a>.

Dantidurga's successor <a href="Krishna%20I">Krishna I</a> brought major portions of present-day Karnataka and <a href="Konkan">Konkan</a> under his control. During the rule of <a href="Dhruva%20Dharavarsha">Dhruva Dharavarsha</a> who took control in 780, the kingdom expanded into an empire that encompassed all of the territory between the <a href="Kaveri%20River">Kaveri River</a> and <a href="Central%20India">Central India</a>. He led successful expeditions to Kannauj, the seat of northern Indian power where he defeated the Gurjara <a href="Pratihara">Pratihara</a>s and the <a href="Pala%20Empire">Palas</a> of Bengal, gaining him fame and vast booty but not more territory. He also brought the <a href="Eastern%20Chalukyas">Eastern Chalukyas</a> and <a href="Gangas">Gangas</a> of <a href="Talakad">Talakad</a> under his control. According to Altekar and Sen, the Rashtrakutas became a pan-India power during his rule.

The ascent of Dhruva Dharavarsha's third son, <a href="Govinda%20III">Govinda III</a>, to the throne heralded an era of success like never before. There is uncertainty about the location of the early capital of the Rashtrakutas at this time. During his rule there was a three way conflict between the Rashtrakutas, the Palas and the Pratiharas for control over the Gangetic plains. Describing his victories over the Pratihara Emperor Nagabhatta II and the <a href="Pala%20Empire">Pala</a> Emperor <a href="Dharmapala%20of%20Bengal">Dharmapala</a>, the Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank from the icy waters of the Himalayan streams and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a>. His military exploits have been compared to those of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> and <a href="Arjuna">Arjuna</a> of <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>. Having conquered Kannauj, he travelled south, took firm hold over Gujarat, Kosala (<a href="Kosala">Kaushal</a>), <a href="Mysore">Gangavadi</a>, humbled the <a href="Pallavas">Pallavas</a> of Kanchi, installed a ruler of his choice in <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a> and received two statues as an act of submission from the king of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a> (one statue of the king and another of his minister). The Cholas, the <a href="Pandyas">Pandyas</a> and the Kongu Cheras of Karur all paid him tribute. As one historian puts it, the drums of the Deccan were heard from the Himalayan caves to the shores of the Malabar Coast. The Rashtrakutas empire now spread over the areas from <a href="Cape%20Comorin">Cape Comorin</a> to <a href="Kannauj">Kannauj</a> and from <a href="Banaras">Banaras</a> to <a href="Bharuch">Bharuch</a>.

The successor of Govinda III, <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a> made <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a> his capital and ruled a large empire. Manyakheta remained the Rashtrakutas' regal capital until the end of the empire. He came to the throne in 814 but it was not until 821 that he had suppressed revolts from <a href="Feudatory">feudatories</a> and ministers. Amoghavarsha I made peace with the <a href="Western%20Ganga%20dynasty">Western Ganga dynasty</a> by giving them his two daughters in marriage, and then defeated the invading <a href="Eastern%20Chalukyas">Eastern Chalukyas</a> at Vingavalli and assumed the title "Viranarayana". His rule was not as militant as that of Govinda III as he preferred to maintain friendly relations with his neighbours, the Gangas, the Eastern Chalukyas and the Pallavas with whom he also cultivated marital ties. His era was an enriching one for the arts, literature and religion. Widely seen as the most famous of the Rashtrakuta Emperors, <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a> was an accomplished scholar in Kannada and Sanskrit. His "Kavirajamarga" is considered an important landmark in Kannada poetics and "Prashnottara Ratnamalika" in Sanskrit is a writing of high merit and was later translated into the Tibetan language. Because of his religious temperament, his interest in the arts and literature and his peace-loving nature, he has been compared to the emperor <a href="Ashoka">Ashoka</a> and called "Ashoka of the South".

During the rule of <a href="Krishna%20II">Krishna II</a>, the empire faced a revolt from the Eastern Chalukyas and its size decreased to the area including most of the Western <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a> and Gujarat. Krishna II ended the independent status of the Gujarat branch and brought it under direct control from Manyakheta. <a href="Indra%20III">Indra III</a> recovered the dynasty's fortunes in central India by defeating the Paramara and then invaded the <a href="doab">doab</a> region of the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> and <a href="Yamuna%20River">Jamuna</a> rivers. He also defeated the dynasty's traditional enemies, the Pratiharas and the Palas, while maintaining his influence over <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a>. The effect of his victories in Kannauj lasted several years according to the 930 copper plate inscription of Emperor <a href="Govinda%20IV">Govinda IV</a>. After a succession of weak kings during whose reigns the empire lost control of territories in the north and east, <a href="Krishna%20III">Krishna III</a> the last great ruler consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the <a href="Narmada%20River">Narmada River</a> to <a href="Kaveri%20River">Kaveri River</a> and included the northern Tamil country (Tondaimandalam) while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon.

In 972 A.D., during the rule of <a href="Khottiga%20Amoghavarsha">Khottiga Amoghavarsha</a>, the <a href="Paramara">Paramara</a> King <a href="Siyaka">Siyaka</a> Harsha attacked the empire and plundered Manyakheta, the capital of the Rashtrakutas. This seriously undermined the reputation of the Rastrakuta Empire and consequently led to its downfall. The final decline was sudden as <a href="Tailapa%20II">Tailapa II</a>, a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from Tardavadi province in modern <a href="Bijapur%20district%2C%20Karnataka">Bijapur district</a>, declared himself independent by taking advantage of this defeat. Indra IV, the last emperor, committed <a href="Sallekhana">Sallekhana</a> (fasting unto death practised by Jain monks) at <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a>. With the fall of the Rashtrakutas, their feudatories and related clans in the Deccan and northern India declared independence. The <a href="Western%20Chalukyas">Western Chalukyas</a> annexed Manyakheta and made it their capital until 1015 and built an impressive empire in the Rashtrakuta heartland during the 11th century. The focus of dominance shifted to the <a href="Krishna%20River">Krishna River</a> – <a href="Godavari%20River">Godavari River</a> doab called <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a>. The former feudatories of the Rashtrakutas in western Deccan were brought under control of the Chalukyas, and the hitherto-suppressed Cholas of Tanjore became their arch enemies in the south.

In conclusion, the rise of Rashtrakutas of <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a> had a great impact on India, even on India's north. Sulaiman (851), <a href="Al-Masudi">Al Masudi</a> (944) and Ibn Khurdadba (912) wrote that their empire was the largest in contemporary India and Sulaiman further called it one among the four great contemporary empires of the world. According to the travelogues of the Arabs Al Masudi and Ibn Khordidbih of the 10th century, "most of the kings of Hindustan turned their faces towards the Rashtrakuta king while they were praying, and they prostrated themselves before his ambassadors. The Rashtrakuta king was known as the "King of kings" ("Rajadhiraja") who possessed the mightiest of armies and whose domains extended from Konkan to Sind." Some historians have called these times an "Age of Imperial Kannauj". Since the Rashtrakutas successfully captured Kannauj, levied tribute on its rulers and presented themselves as masters of North India, the era could also be called the "Age of Imperial Karnataka". During their political expansion into central and northern India in the 8th to the 10th centuries, the Rashtrakutas or their relatives created several kingdoms that either ruled during the reign of the parent empire or continued to rule for centuries after its fall or came to power much later. Well known among these were the Rashtrakutas of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> (757–888), the <a href="Ratta%20dynasty">Rattas</a> of <a href="Saundatti">Saundatti</a> (875–1230) in modern Karnataka, the Gahadavalas of Kannauj (1068–1223), the Rashtrakutas of <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> (known as Rajputana) and ruling from Hastikundi or Hathundi (893–996), Dahal (near <a href="Jabalpur">Jabalpur</a>), <a href="Rathore">Rathore</a>s of Mandore (near <a href="Jodhpur">Jodhpur</a>), the <a href="Rathore">Rathore</a>s of Dhanop, Rashtraudha dynasty of Mayuragiri in modern Maharashtra and Rashtrakutas of Kannauj. <a href="Rajadhiraja%20Chola">Rajadhiraja Chola</a>'s conquest of the island of Ceylon in the early 11th century CE led to the fall of four kings there. According to historian K. Pillay, one of them, King Madavarajah of the <a href="Jaffna%20kingdom">Jaffna kingdom</a>, was an usurper from the Rashtrakuta Dynasty.

Inscriptions and other literary records indicate the Rashtrakutas selected the crown prince based on heredity. The crown did not always pass on to the eldest son. Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth, as exemplified by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha. The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister ("Mahasandhivigrahi") whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely, a flag, a conch, a fan, a white umbrella, a large drum and five musical instruments called "Panchamahashabdas". Under him was the commander ("Dandanayaka"), the foreign minister ("Mahakshapataladhikrita") and a prime minister ("Mahamatya" or "Purnamathya"), all of whom were usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier. A "Mahasamantha" was a feudatory or higher ranking regal officer. All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science ("Rajneeti") and possessed military training. There were cases where women supervised significant areas as when Revakanimaddi, daughter of <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a>, administered Edathore "Vishaya".

The kingdom was divided into "Mandala" or "Rashtras" (provinces). A "Rashtra" was ruled by a Rashtrapathi who on occasion was the emperor himself. Amoghavarsha I's empire had sixteen "Rashtras". Under a "Rashtra" was a "Vishaya" (district) overseen by a Vishayapathi. Trusted ministers sometimes ruled more than a "Rashtra". For example, Bankesha, a commander of <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a> headed <a href="Banavasi">Banavasi</a>-12000, Belvola-300, Puligere-300, Kunduru-500 and Kundarge-70, the suffix designating the number of villages in that territory. Below the "Vishaya" was the "Nadu" looked after by the Nadugowda or Nadugavunda; sometimes there were two such officials, one assuming the position through heredity and another appointed centrally. The lowest division was a "Grama" or village administered by a "Gramapathi" or "Prabhu Gavunda".

The Rashtrakuta army consisted of large contingents of infantry, horsemen, and elephants. A standing army was always ready for war in a cantonment ("Sthirabhuta Kataka") in the regal capital of Manyakheta. Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected to contribute to the defense of the empire in case of war. Chieftains and all the officials also served as commanders whose postings were transferable if the need arose.

The Rashtrakutas issued coins (minted in an "Akkashale") such as "Suvarna", "Drammas" in silver and gold weighing 65 <a href="Grain%20%28measure%29">grains</a>, "Kalanju" weighing 48 grains, "Gadyanaka" weighing 96 grains, "Kasu" weighing 15 grains, "Manjati" with 2.5 grains and "Akkam" of 1.25 grain.

The Rashtrakuta economy was sustained by its natural and agricultural produce, its manufacturing revenues and moneys gained from its conquests. Cotton was the chief crop of the regions of southern Gujarat, <a href="Khandesh">Khandesh</a> and Berar. Minnagar, Gujarat, <a href="Ujjain">Ujjain</a>, <a href="Paithan">Paithan</a> and Tagara were important centres of textile industry. <a href="Muslin">Muslin</a> cloth were manufactured in Paithan and <a href="Warangal">Warangal</a>. The cotton yarn and cloth was exported from <a href="Bharuch">Bharoch</a>. White <a href="Calico%20%28textile%29">calicos</a> were manufactured in <a href="Burhanpur">Burhanpur</a> and Berar and exported to <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a> and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. The Konkan region, ruled by the feudatory Silharas, produced large quantities of <a href="betel">betel</a> leaves, coconut and rice while the lush forests of Mysore, ruled by the feudatory <a href="Gangas">Gangas</a>, produced such woods as sandal, timber, teak and ebony. Incense and perfumes were exported from the ports of <a href="Thane">Thana</a> and Saimur.

The Deccan was rich in minerals, though its soil was not as fertile as that of the Gangetic plains. The copper mines of <a href="Cudappah">Cudappah</a>, <a href="Bellary">Bellary</a>, Chanda, Buldhana, Narsingpur, <a href="Ahmadnagar">Ahmadnagar</a>, Bijapur and <a href="Dharwar">Dharwar</a> were an important source of income and played an important role in the economy. Diamonds were mined in Cudappah, Bellary, <a href="Kurnool">Kurnool</a> and <a href="Golconda">Golconda</a>; the capital Manyakheta and Devagiri were important diamond and jewellery trading centres. The leather industry and tanning flourished in Gujarat and some regions of northern Maharashtra. <a href="Mysore">Mysore</a> with its vast elephant herds was important for the ivory industry.

The Rashtrakuta empire controlled most of the western sea board of the subcontinent which facilitated its maritime trade. The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of Bharoch, one of the most prominent ports in the world at that time. The empire's chief exports were cotton yarn, cotton cloth, muslins, hides, mats, indigo, incense, perfumes, <a href="betel%20nut">betel nut</a>s, coconuts, sandal, teak, timber, sesame oil and ivory. Its major imports were pearls, gold, dates from Arabia, slaves, <a href="Italian%20cuisine">Italian</a> wines, tin, lead, <a href="topaz">topaz</a>, <a href="storax">storax</a>, sweet clover, flint glass, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, gold and silver coins, singing boys and girls (for the entertainment of the royalty) from other lands. Trading in horses was an important and profitable business, monopolised by the Arabs and some local merchants. The Rashtrakuta government levied a shipping tax of one golden "Gadyanaka" on all foreign vessels embarking to any other ports and a fee of one silver "Ctharna" ( a coin) on vessels travelling locally.

Artists and craftsman operated as corporations (guilds) rather than as individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A <a href="Saundatti">Saundatti</a> inscription refers to an assemblage of all the people of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.

The government's income came from five principal sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories. An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, such as when it faced natural calamities, or was preparing for war or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on <a href="crown%20land">crown land</a>, wasteland, specific types of trees considered valuable to the economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors. Additionally, customary presents were given to the king or royal officers on such festive occasions as marriage or the birth of a son.

The king determined the tax levels based on need and circumstances in the kingdom while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants. The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land taxes were varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%. A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region. The land tax may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war. In most of the kingdom, land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted. A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance.

Taxes were levied on artisans such as potters, sheep herders, weavers, oilmen, shopkeepers, stall owners, brewers and gardeners. Taxes on perishable items such as fish, meat, honey, medicine, fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16%. Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may have been active. The state claimed all such properties whose deceased legal owner had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim. Other miscellaneous taxes included ferry and house taxes. Only Brahmins and their temple institutions were taxed at a lower rate.

The Rashtrakuta kings supported the popular religions of the day in the traditional spirit of religious tolerance. Scholars have offered various arguments regarding which specific religion the Rashtrakutas favoured, basing their evidence on <a href="Indian%20inscriptions">inscriptions</a>, coins and contemporary literature. Some claim the Rashtrakutas were inclined towards <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> since many of the scholars who flourished in their courts and wrote in <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> and a few in <a href="Apabhramsha">Apabhramsha</a> and <a href="Prakrit">Prakrit</a> were Jains. The Rashtrakutas built well-known Jain temples at locations such as Lokapura in <a href="Bagalkot%20district">Bagalkot district</a> and their loyal feudatory, the <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Western Ganga Dynasty</a>, built Jain monuments at <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a> and <a href="Kambadahalli">Kambadahalli</a>. Scholars have suggested that Jainism was a principal religion at the very heart of the empire, modern Karnataka, accounting for more than 30% of the population and dominating the culture of the region. King Amoghavarsha I was a disciple of the Jain <a href="acharya">acharya</a> <a href="Jinasena">Jinasena</a> and wrote in his religious writing, "Prashnottara Ratnamalika", "having bowed to Varaddhamana (<a href="Mahavira">Mahavira</a>), I write Prashnottara Ratnamalika". The mathematician <a href="Mahavira%20%28mathematician%29">Mahaviracharya</a> wrote in his "Ganita Sarasangraha", "The subjects under Amoghavarsha are happy and the land yields plenty of grain. May the kingdom of King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha, follower of Jainism ever increase far and wide." Amoghavarsha may have taken up Jainism in his old age.

However, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>'s followers of the <a href="Shaivism">Shaiva</a>, <a href="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a> and <a href="Shaktism">Shakta</a> faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> or god <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>. The <a href="Sanjan%20%28Gujarat%29">Sanjan</a> inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the <a href="Mahalakshmi%20Temple%20%28Kolhapur%29">Lakshmi temple</a> at <a href="Kolhapur">Kolhapur</a> to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the "Hiranyagarbha" (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and <a href="Khambhat">Cambay</a> plates of King <a href="Govinda%20IV">Govinda IV</a> mention <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>s performing such rituals as "<a href="Rajasuya">Rajasuya</a>", "Vajapeya" and "Agnishtoma". An early <a href="copper%20plate%20grant">copper plate grant</a> of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend "Parama Maheshwara" (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as "Veeranarayana" showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had the sign of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas. The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing. Their family deity was a goddess by name "Latana" (also known as "Rashtrashyena", "Manasa" "Vindyavasini") who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom. They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was meant for followers of Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was meant for worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara (<a href="Surya">Surya</a>, the sun god).

In short, the Rashtrakuta rule was tolerant to multiple popular religions, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, Vaishnavaism and Shaivism. <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> too found support and was popular in places such as <a href="Dambal">Dambal</a> and <a href="Balligavi">Balligavi</a>, although it had declined significantly by this time. The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of <a href="Adi%20Shankara">Adi Shankara</a>'s <a href="Advaita">Advaita</a> philosophy. <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> contact with South India began as early as the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and <a href="Arab">Arab</a> lands. <a href="Jumu%27ah">Jumma</a> <a href="Masjid">Masjid</a>s existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many Muslims lived and mosques flourished on the coasts, specifically in towns such as <a href="Kayalpattanam">Kayalpattanam</a> and <a href="Nagore">Nagore</a>. Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as <a href="Mappila">Mappila</a>s ("Moplahs") and were actively involved in <a href="horse%20trading">horse trading</a> and manning shipping fleets.

Chronicles mention more <a href="caste">caste</a>s than the four commonly known castes in the Hindu social system, some as many as seven castes. One traveller's account mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of <a href="Brahmins">Brahmins</a>, <a href="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a>, <a href="Vaishya">Vaishya</a> and <a href="Sudras">Sudras</a>. The "Zakaya" or "Lahud" caste consisted of communities specialising in dance and acrobatics. People in the professions of sailing, hunting, weaving, cobblery, basket making and fishing belonged to specific castes or subcastes. The "Antyajas" caste provided many menial services to the wealthy. Brahmins enjoyed the highest status in Rashtrakuta society; only those Kshatriyas in the "Sat-Kshatriya" sub-caste (noble Kshatriyas) were higher in status.

The careers of Brahmins usually related to education, the judiciary, astrology, mathematics, poetry and philosophy or the occupation of hereditary administrative posts. Also Brahmins increasingly practiced non-Brahminical professions (agriculture, trade in betel nuts and martial posts). Capital punishment, although widespread, was not given to the royal Kshatriya sub-castes or to Brahmins found guilty of heinous crimes (as the killing of a Brahmin in medieval Hindu India was itself considered a heinous crime). As an alternate punishment to enforce the law a Brahmin's right hand and left foot was severed, leaving that person disabled.

By the 9th century, kings from all the four castes had occupied the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India. Admitting Kshatriyas to <a href="Vedic%20period">Vedic</a> schools along with Brahmins was customary, but the children of the Vaishya and <a href="Shudra">Shudra</a> castes were not allowed. Landownership by people of all castes is recorded in inscriptions Intercaste marriages in the higher castes were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys, but was relatively frequent among other castes. Intercaste functions were rare and dining together between people of various castes was avoided.

Joint families were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even father and son have been recorded in inscriptions. Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women. The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of early marriage for women. Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 years of age and the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger. This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes. <a href="Sati%20%28practice%29">Sati</a> (a custom in which a dead man's widow would <a href="Self-immolation">immolate</a> herself on her husband's funeral <a href="pyre">pyre</a>) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families. The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged. The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes.

In the general population men wore two simple pieces of cloth, a loose garment on top and a garment worn like a "<a href="dhoti">dhoti</a>" for the lower part of the body. Only kings could wear <a href="turban">turban</a>s, a practice that spread to the masses much later. Dancing was a popular entertainment and inscriptions speak of royal women being charmed by dancers, both male and female, in the king's palace. <a href="Devadasi">Devadasi</a>s (girls were "married" to a deity or temple) were often present in temples. Other recreational activities included attending animal fights of the same or different species. The <a href="Atakur%20inscription">Atakur inscription</a> (<a href="hero%20stone">hero stone</a>, "virgal") was made for the favourite hound of the feudatory Western Ganga King Butuga II that died fighting a wild boar in a hunt. There are records of game preserves for hunting by royalty. Astronomy and astrology were well developed as subjects of study, and there were many superstitious beliefs such as catching a snake alive proved a woman's chastity. Old persons suffering from incurable diseases preferred to end their lives by drowning in the sacred waters of a pilgrim site or by a ritual burning.

<a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a> became more prominent as a literary language during the Rashtrakuta rule with its script and literature showing remarkable growth, dignity and productivity. This period effectively marked the end of the classical Prakrit and Sanskrit era. Court poets and royalty created eminent works in Kannada and Sanskrit that spanned such literary forms as prose, poetry, rhetoric, the Hindu epics and the life history of Jain <a href="Tirthankara">tirthankars</a>. Bilingual writers such as <a href="Asaga">Asaga</a> gained fame, and noted scholars such as the <a href="Mah%C4%81v%C4%ABra%20%28mathematician%29">Mahaviracharya</a> wrote on pure mathematics in the court of King Amoghavarsha I.

"<a href="Kavirajamarga">Kavirajamarga</a>" (850) by King <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a> is the earliest available book on rhetoric and poetics in Kannada, though it is evident from this book that native styles of Kannada composition had already existed in previous centuries. "Kavirajamarga" is a guide to poets ("Kavishiksha") that aims to standardize these various styles. The book refers to early Kannada prose and poetry writers such as <a href="Durvinita">Durvinita</a>, perhaps the 6th-century monarch of <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Western Ganga Dynasty</a>.

The Jain writer <a href="Adikavi%20Pampa">Adikavi Pampa</a>, widely regarded as one of the most influential <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> writers, became famous for "<a href="Adipurana">Adipurana</a>" (941). Written in <a href="champu">champu</a> (mixed prose-verse style) style, it is the life history of the first Jain "tirthankara" <a href="Lord%20Rishabha">Rishabhadeva</a>. Pampa's other notable work was "<a href="Vikramarjuna%20Vijaya">Vikramarjuna Vijaya</a>" (941), the author's version of the Hindu epic, <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, with <a href="Arjuna">Arjuna</a> as the hero. Also called "Pampa Bharata", it is a eulogy of the writer's patron, King <a href="Chalukyas%20of%20Vemulavada">Chalukya</a> Arikeseri of <a href="Vemulwada%2C%20Karimnagar%20District">Vemulawada</a> (a Rashtrakuta feudatory), comparing the king's virtues favorably to those of Arjuna. Pampa demonstrates such a command of classical Kannada that scholars over the centuries have written many interpretations of his work.

Another notable Jain writer in Kannada was <a href="Sri%20Ponna">Sri Ponna</a>, patronised by King Krishna III and famed for "Shantipurana", his account of the life of Shantinatha, the 16th Jain tirthankara. He earned the title "Ubhaya Kavichakravathi" (supreme poet in two languages) for his command over both Kannada and Sanskrit. His other writings in Kannada were "Bhuvanaika-ramaabhyudaya", "Jinaksharamale" and "Gatapratyagata". Adikavi Pampa and Sri Ponna are called "gems of Kannada literature".
Prose works in <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> was prolific during this era as well. Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by <a href="Mahavira%20%28mathematician%29">Mahaviracharya</a>, a native of <a href="Gulbarga">Gulbarga</a>, who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. His greatest contribution was "Ganitasarasangraha", a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote in the court of <a href="Arikesari%20II">Arikesari II</a>, a feudatory of Rashtrakuta <a href="Krishna%20III">Krishna III</a> in <a href="Vemulwada%2C%20Karimnagar%20District">Vemulavada</a>. He was the author of "Yasastilaka champu", "Nitivakyamrita" and other writings. The main aim of the "champu" writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of "Arthashastra" from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner. Ugraditya, a Jain ascetic from Hanasoge in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called "Kalyanakaraka". He delivered a discourse in the court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from animal products and alcohol in medicine.

Trivikrama was a noted scholar in the court of King Indra III. His classics were "Nalachampu" (915), the earliest in champu style in Sanskrit, "Damayanti Katha", "Madalasachampu" and Begumra plates. Legend has it that Goddess <a href="Saraswati">Saraswati</a> helped him in his effort to compete with a rival in the king's court. <a href="Jinasena">Jinasena</a> was the spiritual preceptor and <a href="guru">guru</a> of <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a>. A theologian, his contributions are "Dhavala" and "Jayadhavala" (written with another theologian <a href="Virasena">Virasena</a>). These writings are named after their patron king who was also called Athishayadhavala. Other contributions from Jinasena were "Adipurana," later completed by his disciple Gunabhadra, "Harivamsha" and "Parshvabhyudaya".

The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga.
The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show <a href="Pandyan">Pandyan</a> influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.

The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at <a href="Ellora">Ellora</a> ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at <a href="Ellora">Ellora</a> is their creation of the monolithic <a href="Ellora%20Kailasanathar%20Temple">Kailasanath Temple</a>, a splendid achievement confirming the "Balhara" status as "one among the four principal Kings of the world". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including <a href="Ravana">Ravana</a>, <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> and <a href="Parvathi">Parvathi</a> while the ceilings have paintings.

The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is "Karnata Dravida" according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the "Shikharas" common to the "Nagara" style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at <a href="Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a> in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.While some scholars have claimed the architecture at <a href="Elephanta%20Caves">Elephanta</a> is attributable to the <a href="Kalachuri">Kalachuri</a>, others claim that it was built during the Rashtrakuta period. Some of the sculptures such as "Nataraja" and "Sadashiva" excel in beauty and craftsmanship even that of the Ellora sculptures. Famous sculptures at Elephanta include "Ardhanarishvara" and "Maheshamurthy". The latter, a three faced bust of Lord Shiva, is tall and considered one of the finest pieces of sculpture in India. It is said that, in the world of sculpture, few works of art depicting a divinity are as balanced. Other famous rock-cut temples in the Maharashtra region are the Dhumer Lena and Dashvatara cave temples in <a href="Ellora">Ellora</a> (famous for its sculptures of Vishnu and Shivaleela) and the Jogeshvari temple near <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>.
In <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> their most famous temples are the "Kashivishvanatha" temple and the Jain Narayana temple at <a href="Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a>, a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> World Heritage site. Other well-known temples are the Parameshwara temple at Konnur, Brahmadeva temple at Savadi, the Settavva, Kontigudi II, Jadaragudi and Ambigeragudi temples at <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a>, Mallikarjuna temple at Ron, Andhakeshwara temple at Huli (<a href="Hooli">Hooli</a>), Someshwara temple at <a href="Sogal">Sogal</a>, Jain temples at Lokapura, <a href="Navalinga%20Temple%20%28Kukkanur%29">Navalinga</a> temple at <a href="Kuknur">Kuknur</a>, Kumaraswamy temple at Sandur, numerous temples at Shirival in <a href="Gulbarga">Gulbarga</a>, and the "<a href="Trikuteshwara">Trikuteshwara</a>" temple at <a href="Gadag">Gadag</a> which was later expanded by <a href="Kalyani%20Chalukyas">Kalyani Chalukyas</a>. Archeological study of these temples show some have the stellar (multigonal) plan later to be used profusely by the <a href="Hoysalas">Hoysalas</a> at <a href="Belur%2C%20Karnataka">Belur</a> and <a href="Halebidu">Halebidu</a>. One of the richest traditions in Indian architecture took shape in the Deccan during this time which Adam Hardy calls "Karnata dravida" style as opposed to traditional Dravida style.

With the ending of the <a href="Gupta%20Dynasty">Gupta Dynasty</a> in northern India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of <a href="Tamilakam">Tamilakam</a>) interfaced between the increasing use of the local <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada language</a> and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the "desi" (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more "marga" (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning ("ghatikas") taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the <a href="devotional%20movements">devotional movements</a> of later centuries.

Contemporaneous literature and inscriptions show that Kannada was not only popular in the modern Karnataka region but had spread further north into present day southern Maharashtra and to the northern Deccan by the 8th century. Kavirajamarga, the work on poetics, refers to the entire region between the <a href="Kaveri%20River">Kaveri River</a> and the <a href="Godavari%20River">Godavari River</a> as "<a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> country". Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of <a href="Veda">Veda</a>, "Vyakarana" (grammar), "Jyotisha" (astronomy and astrology), "Sahitya" (literature), "Mimansa" (Exegesis), "Dharmashastra" (law), "Puranas" (ritual), and "Nyaya" (logic). An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the "<a href="Kavya">Kavya</a>" (classical) style of writing was popular. The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they, though mediocre poets, had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit. An inscription in Kannada by King <a href="Krishna%20III">Krishna III</a>, written in a poetic Kanda metre, has been found as far away as <a href="Jabalpur">Jabalpur</a> in modern <a href="Madhya%20Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a>. Kavirajamarga, a work on poetics in Kannada by <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a>, shows that the study of poetry was popular in the Deccan during this time. Trivikrama's Sanskrit writing, "Nalachampu", is perhaps the earliest in the "champu" style from the Deccan.

Hector Waller

Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller, (4 April 1900 – 1 March 1942) was a senior officer in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN). His career spanned almost thirty years, including service in both world wars. At the helm of in the <a href="Mediterranean%2C%20Middle%20East%20and%20African%20theatres%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean</a> from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and <a href="flotilla">flotilla</a> commander. He then transferred to the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a> as captain of the light cruiser , and went down with his ship against heavy odds during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sunda%20Strait">Battle of Sunda Strait</a> in early 1942.

Born in <a href="Benalla">Benalla</a>, Victoria, Waller entered the <a href="HMAS%20Creswell">Royal Australian Naval College</a> at the age of thirteen. After graduating, he served with the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in the closing stages of World War I. Between the wars, he specialised in communications and was posted as signals officer to several British and Australian warships. He gained his first seagoing command in 1937, as captain of the destroyer . In September 1939, he took charge of HMAS "Stuart" and four other obsolete destroyers that together became known as the "<a href="Scrap%20Iron%20Flotilla">Scrap Iron Flotilla</a>". In 1940, these were augmented by other ships to form the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, supporting Allied troops in <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a>.

Waller was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a>, and twice <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>, for his achievements in the Mediterranean. He assumed command of HMAS "Perth" in October 1941, taking part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Java%20Sea">Battle of the Java Sea</a> shortly before his final action in Sunda Strait. He received a third mention in despatches posthumously, and in 2011 came under formal consideration for the award of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for his performance as "Perth"'s captain. The submarine is named in his honour.

Born on 4 April 1900 in <a href="Benalla%2C%20Victoria">Benalla, Victoria</a>, Hector MacDonald Laws Waller was the son of William Frederick Waller, a grocer, and his wife Helen Waller (née Duncan). Hec Waller was named in honour of General <a href="Hector%20MacDonald">Hector MacDonald</a>, hero of the <a href="Boer%20War">Boer War</a>, and a forebear called Laws who was an <a href="admiral">admiral</a> and a contemporary of <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Viscount Nelson</a>. The youngest of ten children, of whom eight survived infancy, he attended Benalla Higher Elementary School.

Waller entered the <a href="HMAS%20Creswell">Royal Australian Naval College</a> (RANC) as a cadet midshipman on 31 December 1913, aged thirteen. He gained recognition as a <a href="rugby%20union">rugby</a> player and became cadet captain. In 1917, his final year at the college, he was raised to chief cadet captain and won the King's Medal, awarded for "gentlemanly bearing, character, good influence among his fellows and officer-like qualities". Promoted to <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a> on 1 January 1918, he was posted to Britain where, in April, he was appointed to serve in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s (RN) <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> with the <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> . The ship did not see combat while he was on board.

In February 1919, Waller was assigned to the light cruiser <a href="HMAS%20Melbourne%20%281912%29">HMAS "Melbourne"</a>, and two months later returned to Australia. He transferred to the light cruiser <a href="HMAS%20Sydney%20%281912%29">HMAS "Sydney</a> as an acting <a href="sub-lieutenant">sub-lieutenant</a> in September; his rank was made substantive the following month. In April 1920 he was again posted aboard "Melbourne". Promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20%28navy%29">lieutenant</a> in March 1921, he underwent further training in Britain before returning to join the staff of the RANC. Waller married Nancy Bowes, a <a href="Minister%20%28Christianity%29">minister</a>'s daughter, on 7 April 1923 in the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> suburb of <a href="Lewisham%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Lewisham</a>; the couple had two sons, Michael and John. In April 1924, he was posted to the light cruiser <a href="HMAS%20Adelaide%20%281918%29">HMAS "Adelaide"</a>. Later that year, he began training as a signals officer in England; his classmates included <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a>. Waller finished at the top of the advanced course and, in May 1926, took charge of the Signals and Wireless-Telegraphy School at <a href="HMAS%20Cerberus%20%28naval%20base%29">Flinders Naval Depot</a> in <a href="Western%20Port">Westernport</a>, Victoria. From 1928 to 1930, he served with the RN as a signals officer aboard the destroyer <a href="HMS%20Broke%20%281914%29">HMS "Broke"</a>. He was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a> in March 1929.

By this stage of his career, Waller had acquired a strong reputation for his communications work. In July 1930, he was posted aboard the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>'s (RAN) flagship, the heavy cruiser <a href="HMAS%20Australia%20%28D84%29">HMAS "Australia"</a>, as squadron signals officer. He continued in this role upon transferring to "Australia"s sister ship, <a href="HMAS%20Canberra%20%28D33%29">HMAS "Canberra"</a>, in May 1931. In early 1932, he was assigned to the Navy Office in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, returning to "Canberra" as squadron signals officer in August 1933. He was promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a> in June 1934 and the following month became executive officer of the RANC. Departing the college in July 1936, he returned to England and spent six months working in the British Naval Intelligence Division. A stint as executive officer of the repair ship HMS "Resource" followed. In November 1937, Waller was given his first command at sea, the RN destroyer <a href="HMS%20Brazen%20%28H80%29">HMS "Brazen"</a>. His ship handling was criticised early on, but was soon reported by his superiors as having "improved greatly". Stationed in the Mediterranean, "Brazen" monitored progress of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, a duty that included protecting <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British merchant vessels</a> and rescuing the crews of sinking ships. By June 1939, Waller had returned to Australia to become Director of Signals and Communications at the Navy Office.

At the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20in%20World%20War%20II">outbreak of World War II</a>, Waller was appointed captain of <a href="HMAS%20Stuart%20%28D-00/100%29">HMAS "Stuart"</a>, taking charge of a group of four other obsolete ex-RN destroyers—<a href="HMAS%20Vampire%20%28D68%29">HMA Ships "Vampire"</a>, <a href="HMAS%20Vendetta%20%28D69%29">"Vendetta"</a>, <a href="HMAS%20Voyager%20%28D31%29">"Voyager"</a>, and <a href="HMAS%20Waterhen%20%28D22%29">"Waterhen"</a>—that the Germans later nicknamed the "<a href="Scrap%20Iron%20Flotilla">Scrap Iron Flotilla</a>". The ships were en route to <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> for training when the British and Australian governments agreed that they should be assigned to the <a href="Mediterranean%2C%20Middle%20East%20and%20African%20theatres%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean</a> as the 19th Destroyer Division, under Waller's control. Arriving at <a href="Malta">Malta</a> in late December, Waller made a positive initial impression on senior RN commanders; this was soon borne out by his actions during the salvage of the "Trocas", a disabled tanker. In May 1940, he was appointed to command the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, which included the vessels of the "Scrap Iron Flotilla" plus four modern British destroyers, and a month later was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">captain</a>.

Following Italy's entry into the war on 10 June 1940, Waller was involved in the search for minefields off the North African coast. A keen shooter, he personally blew up floating mines using a rifle and armour-piercing bullets. On 21 June, "Stuart" shelled the Italian-held town of <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a>. The next month, his 10th Destroyer Flotilla participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Calabria">Battle of Calabria</a>. Waller's ships carried out bombardments on <a href="Fort%20Capuzzo">Fort Capuzzo</a> on 17 August and an Italian seaplane base in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Bomba">Gulf of Bomba</a> one week later. In September, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO) for "courage, enterprise, and devotion to duty on recent engagements"—in particular, his pinpointing of enemy minefields. The same month, he transferred to HMAS "Vampire" while "Stuart" went in for refit. As the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> armies began to <a href="Operation%20Compass">counterattack Italian forces</a> in December 1940, the Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean Fleet</a>, Admiral <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Sir Andrew Cunningham</a>, gave Waller command of the newly formed Inshore Squadron, comprising destroyers, minesweepers, and auxiliaries. In his role as Cunningham's Senior Officer Afloat, Waller took charge of naval support for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bardia">attack on Bardia</a>, which fell to the Allies on 5 January 1941. Shortly afterwards, he handed over command of the Inshore Squadron and transferred back aboard "Stuart".

"Stuart" and other ships of Waller's 10th Destroyer Flotilla supported the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tobruk%20%281941%29">assaults on Tobruk</a> in January 1941 and <a href="Benghazi%23World%20War%20II">Benghazi</a> the following month. In March, "Stuart" escorted Allied troop transports to Greece as part of <a href="Operation%20Lustre">Operation Lustre</a>, narrowly avoiding falling victim to <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> dive-bomber attacks. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Matapan">Battle of Cape Matapan</a> at the end of the month, Waller's ships were credited with sinking two Italian destroyers. From May to July, the 10th Destroyer Flotilla made 139 ferry runs during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Siege of Tobruk</a>, carrying supplies to the town's garrison and evacuating the wounded. Waller was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> twice during 1941: in July for his army cooperation role with the Inshore Squadron off the Libyan coast, and in November for his service during the Greek campaign. In January 1942, he was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> to his DSO for "bravery and enterprise in the Battle of Cape Matapan".

Waller earned the personal admiration of Admiral Cunningham, who described him as "one of the finest types of Australian naval officers ... greatly loved and admired by everyone". On the occasion of a visit to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> by Australian Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, Cunningham escorted him to "Stuart" and declared: "And now you are going to meet one of the greatest captains who ever sailed the seas—his name is Waller". According to author Ray Parkin, who began writing while a prisoner of war, "Andrew Cunningham and Hector Waller were cast in the same mould: men would follow them, suffer, and be glad about it. These were both men made by Fate for those ever-recurring <a href="Saint%20Crispin%27s%20Day">Saint Crispin's Day</a>s of human affairs".

Departing the Mediterranean, Waller returned to Australia in August 1941 for service in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>. On 24 October, he took command of the light cruiser <a href="HMAS%20Perth%20%28D29%29">HMAS "Perth"</a>, berthed in Sydney. "Perth" had also lately returned from action in the Mediterranean, where she had participated in the Greek, <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Cretan</a>, and <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syrian campaign</a>s, and been damaged on two occasions by German bombers. Waller was reportedly "tired" and "quite a sick man" at this time, but nonetheless prepared "Perth" for action quickly. In January 1942, the ship was assigned to <a href="American-British-Dutch-Australian%20Command">American-British-Dutch-Australian Command</a> (ABDA) to help defend the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. She set sail for the ABDA Area on 15 February, the day that Singapore surrendered.

The ABDA Striking Force that "Perth" had joined was crushed by an overwhelming <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Japanese force</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Java%20Sea">Battle of the Java Sea</a> on 27 February. Low on ammunition, Waller made the decision to withdraw, accompanied by the cruiser <a href="USS%20Houston%20%28CA-30%29">USS "Houston"</a> under the command of Captain <a href="Albert%20H.%20Rooks">Albert H. Rooks</a>. Waller's action contravened the orders of his Dutch superior, Admiral <a href="Conrad%20Emil%20Lambert%20Helfrich">Conrad Helfrich</a>, to "continue action whatever the cost, and till the bitter end", but the Australian was convinced that further engagement would mean pointless sacrifice.

On the following night, 28 February, "Perth" and "Houston" were attempting to break through the <a href="Sunda%20Strait">Sunda Strait</a> to Australia when they encountered a Japanese invasion fleet escorted by four <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and twelve <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. As senior officer, Waller was in the lead with "Perth", and gave the order to fire upon making contact with the enemy ships just after 11:00 pm. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sunda%20Strait">ensuing battle</a>, the Allied cruisers sank four Japanese transports and a minesweeper before they themselves were sunk, shortly after midnight on 1 March 1942. Having fought to the last of its ammunition, "Perth" was struck by two torpedoes, losing over 350 of its complement of 680 as it keeled over. According to witnesses, Waller was last seen standing on the bridge after he had given the order to abandon ship, "looking down at the silent turrets". He was officially listed as missing, presumed killed, and was survived by his wife and sons. Admiral Cunningham described Waller's loss as "a heavy deprivation for the young Navy of Australia", and Rear Admiral <a href="James%20Goldrick">James Goldrick</a> subsequently called him "the outstanding officer of his generation".

On 15 March 1946, Waller was awarded a posthumous mention in despatches for "gallantry and resolution" aboard HMAS "Perth". His younger son John followed him into the Navy, entering the RANC in 1947. Graduating as chief cadet captain, John Waller became a weapons electrical engineer and attained the rank of commander in 1967, before transferring to the Emergency Reserve as a senior Navy research scientist.

Hec Waller's name appears on the Roll of Honour located at Panel 6 in the Commemorative Area at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, Canberra, and on the <a href="Plymouth%20Naval%20Memorial">Plymouth Naval Memorial</a> in <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, England. He is also commemorated by Waller Crescent and Waller Place in the Canberra suburb of <a href="Campbell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Campbell</a>. The Benalla Costume and Pioneer Museum holds his medals and dress uniform. The Waller Division of the RAN Recruit School at <a href="HMAS%20Cerberus%20%28naval%20base%29">HMAS "Cerberus"</a>, Victoria, was named in his honour until his name transferred to a division at RAN College in 2013.

<a href="HMAS%20Waller%20%28SSG%2075%29">HMAS "Waller"</a>, the third of the RAN's <a href="Collins%20class%20submarine">"Collins"-class submarines</a> to enter service, was commissioned on 10 July 1999. The attendees included John Waller, Michael Waller's wife, and surviving crewmen of HMAS "Perth". On 13 March 2010, a memorial to Waller was unveiled in his home town of Benalla. In April 2011, he was one of thirteen servicemen—eleven sailors and two soldiers, including <a href="Teddy%20Sheean">Teddy Sheean</a>, <a href="Robert%20William%20Rankin">Robert Rankin</a>, and <a href="John%20Simpson%20Kirkpatrick">John Simpson Kirkpatrick</a>—named by the Australian government for consideration as possible recipients of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for extreme valour in combat, under a review by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal; no RAN member had ever been awarded the decoration. Concluding its investigations in February 2013, the tribunal recommended that no further award be made to any of the thirteen servicemen, but that the name "Waller" (among others) should continue to be used for RAN ships after the current bearer was decommissioned.

Little Moreton Hall

Little Moreton Hall, also known as Old Moreton Hall, is a <a href="moat">moat</a>ed <a href="timber%20framing">half-timbered</a> <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> southwest of <a href="Congleton">Congleton</a> in Cheshire, England. The earliest parts of the house were built for the prosperous Cheshire landowner William Moreton in about 1504–08, and the remainder was constructed in stages by successive generations of the family until about 1610. The building is highly irregular, with three asymmetrical ranges forming a small, rectangular <a href="cobblestone">cobble</a>d courtyard. A <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> guidebook describes Little Moreton Hall as being "lifted straight from a fairy story, a gingerbread house". The house's top-heavy appearance, "like a stranded Noah's Ark", is due to the Long Gallery that runs the length of the south range's upper floor.

The house remained in the possession of the Moreton family for almost 450 years, until ownership was transferred to the National Trust in 1938. Little Moreton Hall and its sandstone bridge across the moat are recorded in the <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> as a designated Grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, and the ground on which Little Moreton Hall stands is protected as a <a href="Scheduled%20Monument">Scheduled Monument</a>. The house has been fully restored and is open to the public from April to December each year.

At its greatest extent, in the mid-16th century, the Little Moreton Hall estate occupied an area of and contained a <a href="gristmill">cornmill</a>, orchards, gardens, and an iron <a href="bloomery">bloomery</a> with <a href="trip%20hammer">water-powered hammer</a>s. The gardens lay abandoned until their 20th-century re-creation. As there were no surviving records of the layout of the original <a href="knot%20garden">knot garden</a> it was replanted according to a pattern published in the 17th century.

The name Moreton probably derives from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "mor" meaning "marshland" and "tune", meaning "farm", thus literally "a farm at a marsh". The area where Little Moreton Hall stands today was named Little Moreton to distinguish it from the nearby township of Moreton-cum-Alcumlow, or Greater Moreton. The Moreton family's roots in Little Moreton can be traced to the marriage in 1216 of Lettice de Moreton to Sir Gralam de Lostock, who inherited land there; succeeding generations of the de Lostocks adopted the name of de Moreton. Gralam de Lostock's grandson, Gralam de Moreton, acquired valuable land from his marriages to Alice de Lymme and then Margery de Kingsley. Another grandson, John de Moreton, married heiress Margaret de Macclesfield in 1329, adding further to the estate. The family also purchased land cheaply after the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> epidemic of 1348. Four generations after John de Moreton, the family owned sixteen <a href="messuage">messuage</a>s, a mill and of land, comprising 560 acres of ploughland, 80 acres of pasture, 20 acres of meadow, 20 acres of wood and 20 acres of <a href="bog">moss</a>. The <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> in the mid-16th century provided further opportunities for the Moretons to add to their estate, and by the early years of <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Elizabeth I</a>'s reign, William Moreton II owned two water mills and of land valued at £24 7s 4d, including 500 acres of ploughland, 500 acres of pasture and 100 acres of <a href="turbary">turbary</a>.

Little Moreton Hall first appears in the historical record in 1271, but the present building dates from the early 16th century. The north range is the earliest part of the house. Built between 1504 and 1508 for William Moreton (died 1526), it comprises the <a href="Great%20Hall">Great Hall</a> and the northern part of the east wing. A service wing to the west, built at the same time but subsequently replaced, gave the early house an H-shaped floor plan. The east range was extended to the south in about 1508 to provide additional living quarters, as well as housing the Chapel and the Withdrawing Room. In 1546 William Moreton's son, also called William (c. 1510–63), replaced the original west wing with a new range housing service rooms on the ground floor as well as a porch, gallery, and three interconnected rooms on the first floor, one of which had access to a <a href="garderobe">garderobe</a>. In 1559 William had a new floor inserted at gallery level in the Great Hall, and added the two large bay windows looking onto the courtyard, built so close to each other that their roofs abut one another. The south wing was added in about 1560–62 by William Moreton II's son John (1541–98). It includes the Gatehouse and a third storey containing a <a href="Long%20Gallery">Long Gallery</a>, which appears to have been an afterthought added on after construction work had begun. A small kitchen and Brew-house block was added to the south wing in about 1610, the last major extension to the house.
The fortunes of the Moreton family declined during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. As supporters of the <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> cause, they found themselves isolated in a community of <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarians</a>. Little Moreton Hall was requisitioned by the Parliamentarians in 1643 and used to billet Parliamentary soldiers. The family successfully petitioned for its restitution, and survived the Civil War with their ownership of Little Moreton Hall intact, but financially they were crippled. They tried to sell the entire estate, but could only dispose of several parcels of land. William Moreton died in 1654 leaving debts of £3,000–£4,000 (equivalent to about £12–16 million as of 2010), which forced his heirs to remortgage what remained of the estate. The family's fortunes never fully recovered, and by the late 1670s they no longer lived in Little Moreton Hall, renting it out instead to a series of tenant farmers. The Dale family took over the tenancy in 1841, and were still in residence more than 100 years later. By 1847 most of the house was unoccupied, and the deconsecrated Chapel was being used as a coal cellar and storeroom. Little Moreton Hall was in a ruinous condition; its windows were boarded up and its roof was rotten.

During the 19th century Little Moreton Hall became "an object of romantic interest" among artists; <a href="Amelia%20Edwards">Amelia Edwards</a> used the house as a setting for her 1880 novel "Lord Brackenbury". Elizabeth Moreton, an Anglican nun, inherited the almost derelict house following the death of her sister Annabella in 1892. She restored and refurnished the Chapel, and may have been responsible for the insertion of steel rods to stabilise the structure of the Long Gallery. In 1912 she bequeathed the house to a cousin, <a href="Charles%20Abraham%20%28bishop%20of%20Derby%29">Charles Abraham, Bishop of Derby</a>, stipulating that it must never be sold. Abraham opened up Little Moreton Hall to visitors, charging an entrance fee of 6<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d</a> (equivalent to about £8 in 2010) collected by the Dales, who conducted guided tours of the house in return.

Abraham carried on the preservation effort begun by Elizabeth Moreton until he and his son transferred ownership to the National Trust in 1938. The Dale family continued to farm the estate until 1945, and acted as caretakers for the National Trust until 1955. The Trust has carried out extensive repair and restoration work, including re-roofing; restoration of elements of the hall's original appearance, and removal of some painted patterning added during earlier restoration work. The familiar black-and-white colour scheme is a fashion introduced by the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a>s; originally the oak beams would have been untreated and left to age naturally to a silver colour, and the rendered infill painted <a href="ochre">ochre</a>. In 1977 it was discovered that the stone slabs on the roof of the south range had become insecure, and work began on a six-phase programme of structural repairs. Replacement timbers were left in their natural state.

The 100-year construction of Little Moreton Hall coincided with the <a href="English%20Renaissance">English Renaissance</a>, but the house is resolutely medieval in design, apart from some Renaissance decoration such as the <a href="motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motifs</a> on the Gatehouse, <a href="Elizabethan%20architecture">Elizabethan</a> fireplaces, and its "extravagant" use of glass. It is <a href="timber%20framing">timber-framed</a> throughout except for three brick chimneybreasts and some brick buttressing added at a later date.

<a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a> has described Little Moreton Hall as "a feast of medieval carpentry", but the building technique is unremarkable for Cheshire houses of the period – an oak framework set on stone <a href="Foundation%20%28engineering%29">footings</a>. Diagonal oak braces that create <a href="Chevron%20%28insignia%29">chevron</a> and <a href="lozenge">lozenge</a> patterns adorn the façades. The herringbone pattern with <a href="quatrefoil">quatrefoil</a>s present at the rear, which can also be seen at <a href="Haslington%20Hall">Haslington</a> and <a href="Gawsworth%20Old%20Hall">Gawsworth Halls</a>, is a typical feature of 15th-century work, while the lozenge patterns, continuous middle rail and lack of quatrefoils in the front façade are typical of 16th-century early Elizabethan work. The south range containing the gatehouse, the last to be completed, has lighter timbers with a greater variety of patterns. The timber frame is completed by rendered infill and <a href="Flemish%20bond">Flemish bond</a> brick, or windows. The windows contain 30,000 <a href="Leadlight">leaded panes</a> known as quarries, set in patterns of squares, rectangles, lozenges, circles and triangles, complementing the decoration on the timber framing. Much of the original 16th-century glazing has survived and shows the colour variations typical of old glass. Old scratched graffiti is visible in places. The older parts of the roof frame are decorated, and the brickwork of some of the chimneys has <a href="diapering">diapering</a> in blue brick.

The house stands on an island surrounded by a 33-foot (10 m) wide moat, which was probably dug in the 13th or 14th century to enclose an earlier building on the site. There is no evidence that the moat served any defensive purpose, and as with many other moated sites it was probably intended as a status symbol. A sandstone bridge leads to a gatehouse in the three-storey south range, which has each of its two upper floors <a href="jettied">jettied</a> out over the floor beneath. As is typical of Cheshire's timber-framed buildings the overhanging jetties are hidden by coving, which has a recurring quatrefoil decoration. The Gatehouse leads to a rectangular courtyard, with the Great Hall at the northern end. The two-storey tower to the left of the Gatehouse contains garderobes, which empty directly into the moat. Architectural historian Lydia Greeves has described the interior of Little Moreton Hall as a "corridor-less warren, with one room leading into another, and four staircases linking different levels". Some of the grander rooms have fine chimneypieces and wood panelling, but others are "little more than cupboards". The original purpose of some of the rooms in the house is unknown.

The Great Hall at the centre of the north range is entered through a porch and screens passage, a feature common in houses of the period, designed to protect the occupants from draughts. As the screens are now missing, they may have been free-standing like those at <a href="Rufford%20Old%20Hall">Rufford Old Hall</a>. The porch is decorated with elaborate carvings. The Great Hall's roof is supported by <a href="timber%20roof%20trusses%23Arch-braced%20truss">arch-braced trusses</a>, which are decorated with carved motifs including dragons. The floor, now flagged, would probably originally have been rush-covered earth, with a central hearth. The gabled bay window overlooking the courtyard was added in 1559. The original service wing to the west of the Great Hall, behind the screens passage, was rebuilt in 1546, and housed a kitchen, <a href="buttery%20%28room%29">buttery</a> and pantry. A hidden shaft was discovered during a 19th-century investigation of two secret rooms above the kitchen, connecting them to a tunnel leading to the moat, the entrance to which has since been filled in. The west range now houses the gift shop and restaurant.
A doorway behind where the family would have sat at the far end of the hall leads to the Parlour, known as the Little Parlour in surviving 17th-century documents. Together with the adjoining Withdrawing Room and the Great Hall, the Parlour is structurally part of the original building. The wooden panelling is a <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> addition, behind which the original painted panelling was discovered in 1976. The decoration consists of painted imitations of marble and inlay, and Biblical scenes, some of which were painted directly onto the plaster and others on paper that was then pasted to the wall. "Crudely drawn" but nevertheless "elaborate", the paintings tell the story of <a href="Susanna%20%28Book%20of%20Daniel%29">Susanna and the Elders</a> from the <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>, a "favourite Protestant theme". The Moreton family's wolf head crest and the initials "J.M." suggest a date before John Moreton's death in 1598. Similar painted decoration is found in other Cheshire houses of the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

A private staircase between the Parlour and the Withdrawing Room leads to the first floor. The Withdrawing Room has 16th-century carved wooden panelling, and a wooden ceiling with moulded <a href="coffer">coffer</a>ing, which probably dates from 1559 when the Great Hall ceiling was added. The bay window in this room was also added in 1559, at the same time as the one in the Great Hall. The pair of windows bear the following inscription underneath their gables:

The wolf head crest also appears in the late 16th-century <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is decorated with female <a href="caryatid">caryatid</a>s and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this still remain.

William Moreton III used what is today known as the Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the adjoining Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style <a href="tempera">tempera</a> painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.

The Corn Store adjacent to the Chapel may originally have been used as accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising the floor to protect its contents from damp. Five oak-framed bins inside may have held barley for the Brew-house, which is now used as a toilet block.

The Guests' Hall and its adjoining Porch Room occupy the space above the entrance to the courtyard and the Gatehouse. They can be accessed either through a doorway from the adjacent Prayer Room or via a staircase at the south end of the courtyard leading to the Long Gallery on the floor above. The first-floor landing leads to a passageway between the Guests' Hall and the Guests' Parlour, and to the garderobe tower visible from the front of the house. A doorway near the entrance to the Guests' Parlour allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house. The Brew-house Chamber was probably built as servants' quarters, and originally accessed via a hatch in the ceiling of the Brew-house below.

In the mid-17th century the Guests' Hall was referred to as Mr Booth's Chamber, after the genealogist Jack Booth of Tremlowe, a cousin and family friend of the Moreton's and a regular occupant. Its substantial carved <a href="corbel">console</a>s, inserted not just for decorative effect but to support the weight of the Long Gallery above, have been dated to 1660. What is today known as the Prayer Room, above the Chapel, was originally the chamber of the first William Moreton's daughter Ann, whose maid occupied the adjoining room.

The floors of the rooms on this level are made from <a href="Lime-ash%20floor">lime-ash plaster</a> pressed into a bedding of straw and oak laths, which would have offered some protection against the ever-present risk of fire. All the first-floor rooms in the east range and all except the Prayer Room in the west range are closed to the public, some having been converted into accommodation for the National Trust staff who live on site. The Education Room in the east range, above what is today the restaurant, was in the mid-16th century a <a href="solar%20%28room%29">solar</a>, and is now reserved for use by school groups.

Running the entire length of the south range the Long Gallery is roofed with heavy <a href="gritstone">gritstone</a> slabs, the weight of which has caused the supporting floors below to bow and buckle. Architectural historians Peter de Figueiredo and Julian Treuherz describe it as "a gloriously long and crooked space, the wide floorboards rising up and down like waves and the walls leaning outwards at different angles." The crossbeams between the arch-braced roof trusses were probably added in the 17th century to prevent the structure from "bursting apart" under the load.
The Long Gallery has almost continuous bands of windows along its longer sides to the north and south, and a window to the west; a corresponding window at the east end of the gallery is now blocked. The end <a href="tympanum%20%28architecture%29">tympana</a> have plaster depictions of <a href="Destiny">Destiny</a> and <a href="Gad%20%28deity%29">Fortune</a>, copied from <a href="Robert%20Recorde">Robert Recorde</a>'s "Castle of Knowledge" of 1556. The inscriptions read "The wheel of fortune, whose rule is ignorance" and "The speare of destiny, whose rule is knowledge". The Long Gallery was always sparsely furnished, and would have been used for exercising when the weather was inclement and as a games room – four early 17th-century <a href="real%20tennis">tennis</a> balls have been discovered behind the wood panelling.

The Upper Porch Room leading off the Long Gallery, perhaps originally intended as a "sanctuary from the fun and games", was furnished as a bedroom by the mid-17th century. The fireplace incorporates figures of <a href="Justice">Justice</a> and <a href="Mercy">Mercy</a>, and its central panel contains the Moreton coat of arms quartered with that of the Macclesfield family, celebrating the marriage of John de Moreton to Margaret de Macclesfield in 1329.

Only three pieces of the house's original furniture have survived: a large refectory table, a large cupboard described as a "cubborde of boxes" in an inventory of 1599, possibly used for storing spices, and a "great rounde table" listed in the same inventory. The refectory table and cupboard are on display in the Great Hall, and the round table in the Parlour, where its octagonal framework suggests that it was designed to sit in the bay window. Except for those pieces, and a collection of 17th-century <a href="pewter">pewter</a> tableware in a showcase in the west wall of the Great Hall, the house is displayed with bare rooms.

By the mid-16th century the Little Moreton Hall estate was at its greatest extent, occupying an area of and including three <a href="watermill">watermill</a>s, one of which was used to grind corn. The contours of the pool used to provide power for the cornmill are still visible, although the mill was demolished in the 19th century. The Moreton family had owned an iron <a href="bloomery">bloomery</a> in the east of the estate since the late 15th century, and the other two mills were used to drive its <a href="trip%20hammer">water-powered hammer</a>s. The dam of the artificial pool that provided water for the bloomery's mills, known as Smithy Pool, has survived, although the pool has not. The bloomery was closed in the early 18th century, and the pool and moat were subsequently used for breeding <a href="carp">carp</a> and <a href="tench">tench</a>. By the mid-18th century the estate's main sources of income came from agriculture, timber production, fish farming, and property rentals.

The earliest reference to a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left a considerable amount of information on the layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, to the west of the house. He writes of a herb garden, vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.

During the 20th century the long-abandoned gardens were replanted in a style sympathetic to the <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor period</a>. The <a href="knot%20garden">knot garden</a> was planted in 1972, to a design taken from Leonard Meager's "<a href="Complete%20English%20Gardener">Complete English Gardener</a>", published in 1670. The intricate design of the knot can be seen from one of the two original viewing mounds, common in 16th-century formal gardening, one inside the moat and the other to the southwest. Other features of the grounds include a <a href="taxus">yew</a> tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been familiar to the house's Tudor occupants – apples, pears, <a href="quince">quince</a>s and <a href="medlar">medlar</a>s.

During the last major restoration work, 18 "assorted boots and shoes" were found hidden in the structure of the building, all dating from the 19th century. <a href="Concealed%20shoes">Concealed shoes</a> were placed either to ward off demons, ghosts or witches, or to encourage the fertility of the female occupants. Like many old buildings, Little Moreton Hall has stories of ghosts; a grey lady is said to haunt the Long Gallery, and a child has reportedly been heard sobbing in and around the Chapel.

Little Moreton Hall is open to the public from mid-February to December each year. The ground floor of the west range has been remodelled to include a restaurant and a tearoom whilst a new building houses the visitor reception and shop Services are held in the Chapel every Sunday from April until October.
In common with many other National Trust properties, Little Moreton Hall is available for hire as a film location; in 1996 it was one of the settings for <a href="ITV%20Granada">Granada Television</a>'s adaptation of <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>'s "<a href="Moll%20Flanders">Moll Flanders</a>", "<a href="The%20Fortunes%20and%20Misfortunes%20of%20Moll%20Flanders%20%28TV%20series%29">The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders</a>".

Henry Conwell

Henry Conwell (c. 1748 – April 22, 1842) was an Irish-born <a href="bishop%20%28Catholicism%29">Catholic bishop</a> in the United States. He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Armagh">Archbishop of Armagh</a>, the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Philadelphia">Bishop of Philadelphia</a> in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Philadelphia%29">St. Mary's Church</a> in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated <a href="William%20Hogan%20%28priest%29">William Hogan</a>, a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his <a href="coadjutor%20bishop">coadjutor bishop</a>, <a href="Francis%20Kenrick">Francis Kenrick</a>. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.

Conwell was born about 1748 in <a href="Moneymore">Moneymore</a>, <a href="County%20Londonderry">County Londonderry</a>, Ireland (present-day <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell. He studied at the <a href="Irish%20College%20in%20Paris">Irish College in Paris</a> and was <a href="Holy%20Orders">ordained</a> to the priesthood there in November 1776. Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability. Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there. He was appointed <a href="parish%20priest">parish priest</a> of <a href="Dungannon">Dungannon</a> in 1792 or 1793 and <a href="Vicar%20General">Vicar General</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Armagh">Archdiocese of Armagh</a> in 1794. After the death of Archbishop <a href="Richard%20O%27Reilly">Richard O'Reilly</a> in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.

Many of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently. Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland. The British government also objected, favoring <a href="Patrick%20Curtis">Patrick Curtis</a> instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests. The Vatican agreed, and <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VII">Pope Pius VII</a> appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the <a href="Episcopal%20see">sees</a> of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> or <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Madras%20and%20Mylapore">Madras</a>; Conwell chose Philadelphia. Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop <a href="William%20Poynter">William Poynter</a>, the <a href="Vicar%20Apostolic%20of%20the%20London%20District">Vicar Apostolic of the London District</a>, assisted by Fathers <a href="James%20Bramston%20%28bishop%29">James Bramston</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Francis%20Carpue">Joseph Francis Carpue</a>.

The see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop <a href="Michael%20Francis%20Egan">Michael Francis Egan</a> in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it. Archbishop <a href="John%20Carroll%20%28bishop%29">John Carroll</a> of Baltimore, whose <a href="Ecclesiastical%20province">province</a> included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, <a href="Louis%20de%20Barth">Louis de Barth</a>) had turned the job down. Part of the delay was logistical—Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province—but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with few Catholics. There was also a significant dispute (known as <a href="trusteeism">trusteeism</a>) over the rights of churches' <a href="Laity">lay</a> trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization. In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.

Conwell arrived in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, <a href="William%20Hogan%20%28priest%29">William Hogan</a>, approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Philadelphia%29">St. Mary's Church</a>. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at <a href="Old%20St.%20Joseph%27s%20Church">Old St. Joseph's Church</a> to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.

Later that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended. The St. Mary's trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as "despicable ex-Catholics" and "the worst sort of <a href="Jacobin">Jacobin</a>s". In the meantime, Conwell recalled a <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican friar</a>—William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed—to assist him. The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell. The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan <a href="Excommunication%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">excommunicated</a> in a public statement on May 27, 1821.

In 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese. The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery. Philadelphia mayor <a href="Robert%20Wharton%20%28Philadelphia%29">Robert Wharton</a> presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention. Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed. A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on. The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members. The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of <a href="perjury">perjury</a>. In an 1824 letter to the "<a href="National%20Gazette">National Gazette</a>," Hogan proposed the creation of an "American Catholic Church" with more independence from Rome.

By this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support. At some point soon thereafter, he left the city. In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments. In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.

The trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>, the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father <a href="Michael%20Hurley%20%2819th-century%20priest%29">Michael Hurley</a> and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall. Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place. The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop. By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the "old and confused" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland. In 1827, the Vatican's "<a href="Propaganda%20Fide">Propaganda Fide</a>" formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well. They summoned Conwell to Rome.

<a href="Ambrose%20Mar%C3%A9chal">Ambrose Maréchal</a>, who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, <a href="William%20Matthews%20%28priest%29">William Matthews</a>, as apostolic administrator. Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828. Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe. He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia. Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the <a href="Provincial%20Councils%20of%20Baltimore">First Provincial Council of Baltimore</a> was in session.

In Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese. The following year, the Vatican appointed <a href="Francis%20Kenrick">Francis Kenrick</a> as Conwell's <a href="coadjutor%20bishop">coadjutor bishop</a> with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese. Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky. He received permission to resume performing <a href="liturgy">liturgical</a> functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer. He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties. 

Conwell died on April 22, 1842, at about the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for possession of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession. After the threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim. Conwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard. In 1864 the remains were transferred to the <a href="Cathedral%20Basilica%20of%20Saints%20Peter%20and%20Paul%20%28Philadelphia%29">Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul</a>.

Hiram Wesley Evans

Hiram Wesley Evans (September 26, 1881 – September 14, 1966) was the <a href="Imperial%20Wizard">Imperial Wizard</a> of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, an American <a href="white%20supremacist">white supremacist</a> group, from 1922 to 1939. A native of <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, Evans attended <a href="Vanderbilt%20University">Vanderbilt University</a> and became a dentist. He operated a small, moderately successful practice in Texas until 1920, when he joined the Klan's <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a> chapter. He quickly rose through the ranks and was part of a group that ousted <a href="William%20Joseph%20Simmons">William Joseph Simmons</a> from the position of Imperial Wizard, the national leader, in November 1922. Evans succeeded him and sought to transform the group into a political power.

Although Evans had led the kidnapping and torture of a black man while leader of the Dallas Klan, as Imperial Wizard he publicly discouraged vigilante actions, fearing that they would hinder his attempts to gain political influence. In 1923, Evans presided over the largest Klan gathering in history, attended by over 200,000, and endorsed several successful candidates in 1924 elections. He moved the Klan's headquarters from <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> to Washington, D.C., and organized a march of 30,000 members—the largest march in the organization's history—on <a href="Pennsylvania%20Avenue%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Pennsylvania Avenue</a>. Evans' efforts notwithstanding, the Klan was buffeted by damaging publicity in the early 1920s, partially because of leadership struggles between Evans and his rivals, which hindered his political efforts. In the 1930s, the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> significantly decreased the Klan's income, prompting Evans to work for a construction company to supplement his pay. He resigned his position with the Klan in 1939, after disavowing <a href="anti-Catholicism">anti-Catholicism</a>. He was succeeded by his chief of staff, <a href="James%20A.%20Colescott">James A. Colescott</a>. The next year, Evans faced accusations of involvement in a government corruption scandal in Georgia; he was fined $15,000 after legal proceedings.

Evans sought to promote a form of <a href="Nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a>, <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> nationalism. In addition to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>, <a href="Trade%20union">unionism</a>, and <a href="communism">communism</a>, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an <a href="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semite</a>. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.

Hiram Wesley Evans was born in <a href="Ashland%2C%20Alabama">Ashland, Alabama</a>, on September 26, 1881, and moved to <a href="Hubbard%2C%20Texas">Hubbard, Texas</a>, with his family as a child. The son of Hiram Martin Evans, a judge, and his wife, Georgia Evans, the younger Evans graduated from <a href="Vanderbilt%20University">Vanderbilt University</a>. Shortly after, he became a dentist, receiving his license in 1900. He married Bam Hill in 1923; they had three children together.

Evans established a small, moderately successful dentistry practice in downtown <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a> that provided inexpensive services. Rumors later arose that his dental qualifications were "a bit shady". A <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a>, Evans attended a church belonging to the <a href="Christian%20Church%20%28Disciples%20of%20Christ%29">Disciples of Christ</a> denomination. He was also a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a>. Evans described himself as "the most average man in America". Of average height and somewhat overweight, Evans was well dressed, a skilled speaker, and very ambitious.

Conceived by its founders as a continuation of the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a>-era Klan (controversially linked to General <a href="Nathan%20Bedford%20Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>), the revived <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> had been established in Atlanta in 1915. Evans joined in 1920, leaving his dental practice so that he could dedicate all his time to the group. In 1921, Evans was elected as "exalted cyclops", a recruiting position sometimes referred to as <a href="kleagle">kleagle</a>, in the Dallas Klan No. 66. When he was elected, the Dallas Klan had recently received a "self-ruling charter" from the <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>-based leadership and was the group's largest chapter. That same year, Evans was appointed to the position of "great titan" (executive) of the "Realm of Texas" and proceeded to lead a successful membership drive for the state's Klan.

Evans initially supported violence against minorities, remembering a <a href="lynching">lynching</a> he witnessed as a child. With the Texas Klan, he sought to create "black squads" to attack minorities. He joined several Klan members in kidnapping and torturing a black bellhop, ostensibly because they suspected he was involved in <a href="Procuring%20%28prostitution%29">pandering prostitutes</a>. Atlanta-based leaders pressured Evans to curb racial violence in Dallas; around that time, the Texas Klan had received significant negative publicity after <a href="castration">castrating</a> an African-American doctor. Although Evans was not morally opposed to violence against minorities, he publicly condemned vigilante activity because he feared that it would attract government scrutiny and hinder potential Klan-backed political campaigning. This change of stance led the leader of the Houston Klan to accuse him of hypocrisy. Although Evans later took credit for a decrease in lynchings in the Southern United States during the 1920s, several Klan members claimed that he surreptitiously encouraged—and presided over—acts of violence against minorities.

In 1921, Evans was assigned to oversee the Klan's national membership drive at the behest of their publicists, <a href="Elizabeth%20Tyler%20%28KKK%20organizer%29">Elizabeth Tyler</a> and <a href="Edward%20Young%20Clarke">Edward Young Clarke</a>. In 1922, the group's leadership made Evans the "Imperial kligrapp", a role similar to national secretary, in which capacity he oversaw operations in 13 states. He received a base salary of $7,500 and traveled throughout the country, regularly meeting with local Klan leaders.

In 1922, Evans joined a group of Klan activists, including Tyler, Clarke, and <a href="D.%20C.%20Stephenson">D. C. Stephenson</a>, in a "coup" against <a href="William%20Joseph%20Simmons">William Joseph Simmons</a>, the group's leader. They deceived Simmons into agreeing to a reorganization of the Klan that removed his practical control; Simmons said that they had claimed that if he remained the Imperial Wizard of the Klan, discord would hamper the organization. Evans gained power and was formally ensconced as Imperial Wizard of the Klan at a November 1922 "Klovokation" in Atlanta, Georgia. Although a legal battle between Evans and Simmons ensued, during which time Simmons was titular "emperor", Evans retained control. He initially said that he had been unaware of a pending coup until after his selection. However, by the end of their feud, he described Simmons as the "leader of <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> Klansmen betraying the movement" and later expelled the former leader.
As leader of the Klan, Evans advanced a form of <a href="Nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a>, white supremacy that cast Protestantism as a fundamental part of American patriotism. To Evans, whiteness and Protestantism were equally valued, and sometimes conflated: he said the Klan supported the "uncontaminated growth of Anglo-Saxon civilization". He maintained that white Protestants had the exclusive right to govern the U.S. because of their descent from early colonists, whom he described as fleeing Europe for the U.S. to escape its societal bounds. He admitted that many Klan members were of rural, uneducated backgrounds but argued that power should be given to "the common people of America". In a pamphlet entitled "Ideals of the Ku Klux Klan", Evans described the Klan as follows:


Under Evans, the Klan supported a mix of right- and left-wing political positions, which were described by Thomas Pegram of <a href="Loyola%20University%20Maryland">Loyola University Maryland</a> as "too much of a patchwork to be considered an ideological system". Klan literature spoke highly of politicians such as <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, and <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>. Evans borrowed numerous concepts from the writings of <a href="Lothrop%20Stoddard">Lothrop Stoddard</a> and <a href="Madison%20Grant">Madison Grant</a>, American writers of the period who promoted <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> and <a href="scientific%20racism">scientific racism</a>, and attempted to cast his platforms as based in science. Evans attacked immigrants by arguing that they would promote ideologies such as <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a> and <a href="communism">communism</a>, were threats to national unity, and were involved with <a href="Rum-running">bootlegging</a> during <a href="Prohibition">Prohibition</a>. He considered immigrants "ignorant, superstitious, religious devotees" intent on earning money in the U.S. before retiring to their homelands. However, he supported immigration of those he deemed "Nordic".

Evans also argued against <a href="miscegenation">miscegenation</a> and Catholic and Jewish immigration, on the grounds that they were threats to genetic "good stock", a racial division which was then widely supported among white Americans. Evans opposed Catholicism because he believed that the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> sought to take control of the U.S. government; he also questioned American Catholics' loyalty to their country, writing that they were subject to their priests, and, as such, to the entire <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20hierarchy">Roman Catholic hierarchy</a> and the <a href="Pope">Pope</a>. In other writings he expressed fears that the Catholic Church, in alliance with Jews and non-white Protestant groups, was becoming increasingly active in politics and thus blurring the <a href="Separation%20of%20church%20and%20state%20in%20the%20United%20States">separation of church and state</a>.

Under Evans' leadership, the Klan became active in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> and <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, rather than focusing on the Southeastern U.S. as it had done in the past. It also grew in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, where 40,000 members, more than half its total, lived in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>. It became characterized as an organization prominent in urban areas of the Midwest, where it attracted native-born Americans competing for industrial jobs with recent immigrants. It also attracted members in Nebraska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.

Evans appointed Stephenson, his early collaborator, as kleagle and Grand Dragon of Indiana. The relationship between the two leaders quickly became acrimonious; Stephenson clashed with Evans over the distribution of membership fees and became embittered after Evans refused to help fund the purchase of a school in Indiana. Although Stephenson believed that Evans deliberately thwarted his attempt to purchase the school to limit his power, Evans unexpectedly promoted Stephenson to <a href="Grand%20Dragon">Grand Dragon</a> of the "northern realm" in July 1923. The historian Leonard Joseph Moore of <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a> contends that Evans paid particular attention to the <a href="Indiana%20Klan">Indiana Klan</a> out of financial self-interest: it was then the largest state branch.

The political scientist Arnold S. Rice writes that Evans also worked on a series of changes, advertised as reforms, to the Klan structure and sought to promote a positive public opinion of the Klan; Evans felt that his organization should be able to reach out to those who were "struggling with the moral decay and economic distress of the 20th century". He increased the Klan's surveillance of members before and after initiation, expelling those considered to be of "questionable morals". He also worked to increase Klan involvement in local policing and denounced acts of violence committed by Klan members, promoting the Klan as a symbol of lawfulness. These efforts, although successful in reducing the number of attacks, were ultimately unable to sway public opinion in the Klan's favor.

Evans became embroiled in several internal Klan conflicts that gained media exposure. In January 1921, he and a group of grand dragons expelled the publicist Clarke, who had been critical of Evans' efforts to involve the Klan in electoral politics. Evans also clashed with Henry Grady, a judge from <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> who served in the Klan from 1922 to 1927, reaching the rank of Grand Dragon. Before Evans gained control of the Klan, Grady had been considered a potential successor to Simmons. After Grady dismissed a Klan-backed law that would have banned the <a href="Knights%20of%20Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a>, a Catholic fraternal service organization, Evans revoked his membership. Grady subsequently leaked his correspondence with Evans to the media.

In August 1923, Evans participated in a Klan parade in the heavily Catholic <a href="Borough%20%28Pennsylvania%29">borough</a> of <a href="Carnegie%2C%20Pennsylvania">Carnegie, Pennsylvania</a>, which was attacked by local residents. One member of the Klan was killed; Evans declared him a martyr and hoped that the death would inspire new recruits. The incident gave a fillip to the Klan's recruitment efforts, but increased Stephenson's animosity toward Evans, on whom he blamed the incident. Stephenson's proclivity for ostentation irritated Evans. Although Stephenson left his official Klan position after a short tenure, under his leadership the Klan's northern supporters had begun to rival those in the South. He had been a skilled campaigner and demagogue, and he remained a well-known advocate of the Klan's platforms after resigning. Evans avoided publicly clashing with him, fearing that it would hurt the candidacies of Klan-backed politicians: Stephenson was closely involved in the successful gubernatorial candidacy of Indiana Klan-member <a href="Edward%20L.%20Jackson">Edward L. Jackson</a>, and the Klan members had significant electoral gains in that state in 1924, including the election of several candidates to the state legislature. After these victories, Stephenson showed further disdain for Evans.

Although membership in the Klan was limited to men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women. Evans established a women's group and sued him. Evans won the lawsuit, leading to a public war of words with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which Evans denied complicity. In 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.

Afterward, Evans moved the Klan's national headquarters to Washington, D.C., where the murder of Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity. To Evans' consternation, Stephenson also formed a women's auxiliary group. Evans and Stephenson subsequently exchanged allegations of sexual impropriety. Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, rape and murder of a young woman; he maintained that the charges were orchestrated by Evans. After a sensational trial, Stephenson was convicted of <a href="second%20degree%20murder">second degree murder</a> and given a <a href="life%20sentence">life sentence</a>; the publicity about the leader's behavior caused thousands of members to abandon the Klan.

In the early years of Evans' tenure, the Klan reached record enrollment; estimates of its peak range from 2.5 to 6 million members, although records are poor and the figure cannot be accurately determined. He also dramatically increased the organization's total assets, more than doubling them from July 1922 to July 1923. Evans changed the way that chapter leaders were paid: he insisted that they receive a fixed salary rather than commissions based on membership fees in a move that lowered their income. Although previous Imperial Wizards had lived in lavish properties, Evans initially settled in an apartment after his promotion. The sociologist <a href="Rory%20M.%20McVeigh">Rory McVeigh</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a> argues that this increase in membership was owing to the Klan's exploitation of a "favorable political context", particularly one in which native-born white-settler Americans were fearful after increased immigration caused them to compete for jobs and housing in many cities. Evans had high hopes for the Klan, saying in 1923 that he aimed to reach ten million members. That year, he spoke at the largest Klan gathering in history, a <a href="Fourth%20of%20July">Fourth of July</a> meeting in rural Indiana that was attended by over 200,000.

Evans sought to include more members from the Southwestern U.S. in leadership; previously the Klan had been led by people from the Southeast. In 1922, Evans supported the successful <a href="U.S.%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> candidacy of Texas Democrat <a href="Earle%20Bradford%20Mayfield">Earle Bradford Mayfield</a>, an event that demonstrated that Klan-supported candidates could win prominent offices. The next year, Evans returned to Texas for the state fair, where 75,000 people gathered for a "Klan day" celebration. He devoted funds to fighting <a href="Jack%20C.%20Walton">Jack C. Walton</a>, the anti-Klan governor of <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>; to the group's joy, Walton was impeached and removed from office in 1923. However, the Oklahoma legislature soon passed several anti-Klan bills.

Evans published instructions for local Klan leaders that detailed how to run meetings, recruit new members, and speak to local gatherings. He advised leaders to avoid "raving hysterically" in favor of "[a] scientific ... presentation of facts". In addition, he urged them to forbid members from bringing their Klan regalia home from meetings and to perform background checks on applicants. He instructed Klan members to shun vigilantism but to assist police and attempted, with some success, to recruit police officers into the Klan. Emphasizing the difference between his organization and the more violent 19th-century Ku Klux Klan, Evans formed Klan-themed groups for children. As the Klan attempted to portray itself as a movement led by cultured, well-educated people, its leaders spoke about education in the U.S. Evans believed that public schools could create a homogeneous society and saw education advocacy as an effective form of public relations.

In his writings on the subject, he cited the nation's illiteracy rate as evidence that American public schools were failing; he considered low teacher salaries and child labor key obstacles to reform. He supported the idea of a federal <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Education">Department of Education</a>, hoping that it would lead to improvements in public schools that would help "Americanize the foreigners" and thwart recruitment efforts of Catholic schools. Evans wrote four books in the mid to late 1920s, "The Menace of Modern Immigration" (1923), "The Klan of Tomorrow" (1924), "Alienism in the Democracy" (1927), and "The Rising Storm" (1929).

After the Klan gained respect and political influence in parts of the U.S., Evans hoped to replicate this on a national scale. Political involvement was controversial among the organization's members, and Evans issued contradictory statements on the issue, publicly disavowing it but surreptitiously attempting to sway politicians. Apart from fundamental Klan issues, different local groups often held varying political ideologies; as such, by insisting on specific political stances, Evans would have risked alienating members. Although many of his hopes were never realized, Evans saw several Klansmen elected to high offices and, in the mid-1920s, the group was frequently discussed by political commentators. In 1924, the group convinced <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> leaders to avoid criticizing them, prompting "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" to put Evans on its cover. That year, the Klan supported <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> in his successful candidacy for president of the U.S. Although Coolidge opposed many key Klan platforms, with the exception of immigration restrictions and prohibition, he was the only major-party candidate who did not condemn them. Nonetheless, Evans declared Coolidge's victory a great success for the Klan. Although Republican leaders refrained from attacking the Klan, they were hesitant to support candidates promoted by the group. Significant discussion of the Klan also took place at the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>'s convention; senator and Democratic presidential primary nominee <a href="Oscar%20Underwood">Oscar Underwood</a> decried them as "a national menace". Evans' attempts to elect Klansmen to public offices in 1924 saw limited success, although they achieved their goals in Indiana.

Although the Klan had four million members in 1924, the group's membership quickly shrank after Stephenson's widely <a href="D.%20C.%20Stephenson%23Convicted%20of%20murder">publicized trial</a>. The Indiana Klan lost more than 90% of its members by the end of the proceedings, and there were mass resignations in other states as well. Other scandals emerged, further damaging Klan enrollment. Although the Colorado Klan had seen strong growth, Evans asked the Grand Dragon, <a href="John%20Galen%20Locke">John Galen Locke</a>, to resign after local corruption scandals in 1925 involving Klan members who served as police. Evans' request was poorly received by Colorado Klan members; local enrollment subsequently plummeted. He encountered difficulties with Klan leaders in Pennsylvania in 1926, after many of them concluded that he was too autocratic. In response, he revoked the charters of several local Klan groups and removed <a href="John%20Strayer">John Strayer</a>, a state legislator, from his position of authority in the Klan. When the Pennsylvania groups continued to refer to themselves as the Ku Klux Klan, Evans sued them in federal court. Pennsylvania Klan members launched a detailed legal offensive against Evans and other Klan leaders, alleging misdeeds, including participation in kidnappings and lynchings. Evans' suit was unsuccessful and, as many newspapers reported the scandalous allegations aired in court, the Pennsylvania Klan suffered a serious decline in membership and support.

In response to the decline in Klan membership, in 1926, Evans organized a Klan parade in Washington, D.C., hoping that a large turnout would demonstrate the Klan's power. About 30,000 members attended, making it the largest parade in the group's history. Evans was disappointed, however, as he had expected double the attendance and the march did not stanch the drop in membership. That year, Evans attempted to rally U.S. senators to vote against a bill supporting a proposed world court. He was unsuccessful, however, and several Klan-backed senators followed Calvin Coolidge and supported the bill. In 1928, Evans opposed the candidacy of the New York Democratic governor <a href="Al%20Smith">Al Smith</a> for president, emphasizing the threat of Smith's Catholic faith. After the Republican <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> won the election, Evans boldly claimed responsibility for Smith's loss; but most of the solidly Democratic South had rejected Hoover and voted for Smith against the Klan's advice.

In 1929, Evans acknowledged that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate. This loss of members resulted in a Klan that was a skeleton of its former self. Historians have attributed this loss of membership to ineptness and hypocrisy on the part of Klan leadership. McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with other political groups led to the sharp loss of political power and solidarity within the group.

Although many Democratic Klan members initially supported the 1932 presidential campaign of <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, the Klan later officially turned against him because of his acceptance of endorsements from minorities and labor unions. After Roosevelt's election, Evans fiercely opposed the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a>, describing it as a "great danger" to the nation; he argued that it was a "Jewish" policy that endangered American freedom, reserving particular scorn for Treasury Secretary <a href="Henry%20Morgenthau%2C%20Jr.">Henry Morgenthau, Jr.</a>, who was Jewish. Evans' statements about Jews were sometimes contradictory: he argued that he was not an <a href="anti-Semite">anti-Semite</a> but maintained that Jews were <a href="economic%20materialism">materialistic</a> and resisted assimilation. The Klan subsequently launched an offensive against organized labor. In the 1930s, Evans fiercely condemned communism and <a href="Trade%20union">unionism</a>. Around that time, Evans began to suspect that government agencies had been infiltrated by communists. He focused his attacks on the <a href="Congress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations">Congress of Industrial Organizations</a>, claiming that they sought to "flout law and promote social disorder".

Although Evans bemoaned <a href="commercialism">commercialism</a> and attributed it to the effects of liberalism, he supported capitalism and sought to form ties between business leaders and the Klan. He condemned corporate greed, alleging that wealthy elites' desire for cheap labor led to increased immigration. In his view, corporations had changed the Eastern U.S. so that it no longer reflected "true Americanism", a concept he believed could only be understood by "legitimate Americans" such as himself. He blamed an influx of unskilled laborers for lowering wages in the U.S. Evans believed that U.S. immigration policy should restrict the immigration of unskilled workers, except for those needed on farms.

In 1934, Evans encountered public controversy after it was revealed that he intended to travel to <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> to campaign against the Democratic governor <a href="Huey%20Long">Huey Long</a>, who planned to run in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201936">1936 presidential election</a>. Long learned of Evans' plans and condemned him in a speech at the <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Legislature">Louisiana State Legislature</a>, deriding him as a "tooth-puller" and an "Imperial bastard" and warning of grave consequences should he follow through with his plans. After learning of the potential opposition, Evans cancelled his plans, although he retorted that Long – who based his campaign on <a href="Americanism%20%28ideology%29">Americanist</a> themes – was "un-American".

In the 1930s, the Klan's public support nearly vanished and their membership dropped to about 100,000 people, primarily concentrated in the South, having lost most of their members in the Midwest and West. At that time, <a href="James%20A.%20Colescott">James A. Colescott</a>, Evans' handpicked chief of staff, increasingly shouldered Evans' responsibilities. After the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> further damaged the Klan's finances, the group's leadership sold their Atlanta headquarters in 1936. Around that time, Evans announced his intention to retire.

Although anti-Catholicism had been a consistent platform of the Klan, before leaving the organization, Evans renounced his anti-Catholicism and pronounced a "new era of religious tolerance". In 1939, he said that "in no other time in history has there been more need for all people who believe in the same Father and same Son to stand together." That year, Evans also publicly expressed an interest in learning aspects of <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> to better understand the Old Testament. Chester L. Quarles, a professor of criminal justice at the <a href="University%20of%20Mississippi">University of Mississippi</a>, argues that Evans repudiated anti-Catholicism owing to his desire to fight unions and communism and his fear of having too many enemies at one time.

After Evans sold the Klan's former headquarters, it was purchased by the Catholic Church. The <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Christ%20the%20King%20%28Atlanta%29">Cathedral of Christ the King</a> was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, surprising many observers. His attendance at the service was his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular with members of the Klan, who felt that he had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June 10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.

Evans' service as Imperial Wizard proved to be a lucrative position, allowing him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta neighborhood. In the mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and he worked for a Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway Board. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor <a href="Eurith%20D.%20Rivers">Eurith D. Rivers</a>, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the political support that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to sell to the highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, the state of Georgia charged Evans and a member of the state highway board with <a href="price%20fixing">price fixing</a>. The Attorney General of Georgia, <a href="Ellis%20Arnall">Ellis Arnall</a>, directed legal proceedings against Evans that resulted in a $15,000 fine.

Meanwhile, Colescott attempted to resuscitate the waning second Klan through an "administration of action" and stricter enforcement of the Klan's stated policies; he also led extensive recruitment campaigns. Despite concerns by opponents that the Klan would regain full force after the conclusion of <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>, it was unable to improve its membership and was under pressure from the <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> for failure to pay taxes. Through a decree on April 23, 1944, Colescott formally disbanded the Klan. Locally sponsored groups continued to use the name, but lacked the united leadership of the earlier Klan.

As late as 1949, Evans served as a commentator on Klan activities, speaking as the former Imperial Wizard. He died on September 14, 1966, in Atlanta, Georgia.

David A. Horowitz, a historian at <a href="Portland%20State%20University">Portland State University</a>, credits Evans with changing the Klan "from a confederation of local vigilantes into a centralized and powerful political movement". Fellow historian William D. Jenkins of <a href="Youngstown%20State%20University">Youngstown State University</a> maintains that Evans was "personally corrupt and more interested in money or power than a cause". During Evans' tenure as Imperial Wizard, the "New York Times" characterized the Klan's leadership as "shrewd schemers". However, Rice suggests that Evans' reforms would never have been successful, as the Klan remained a white supremacist organization that "automatically made enemies of ... anyone who happened to be foreign-born, Negro, Catholic, Jewish, or opposed to bigotry and chauvinism."

An editorial in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" during Evans' tenure as Klan leader described him as "severe and logical" in his writing, while the historian <a href="Richard%20Hofstadter">Richard Hofstadter</a> described Evans' writings as not immoderate in tone. The communications specialist Nicolas Rangel Jr. of the <a href="University%20of%20Houston%E2%80%93Downtown">University of Houston–Downtown</a> suggests that this vernacular prevented some Americans from recognizing the extremist nature of Evans' views.

Evans' ideology was attacked by numerous contemporaries; these criticisms began early in his Klan career. <a href="David%20Lefkowitz%20%28rabbi%29">David Lefkowitz</a>, rabbi of <a href="Temple%20Emanu-El%20%28Dallas%2C%20Texas%29">Temple Emanu-El</a> in Dallas, assailed Evans' assertion that Jews did not assimilate, emphasizing American experiences shared by Jews and Christians, such as military service in World War I. <a href="James%20Weldon%20Johnson">James Weldon Johnson</a>, leader of the <a href="NAACP">NAACP</a>, responded to Evans' promotion of white supremacy by contending that "all races are mixed". Other well-known adversaries of Evans included the minister and theologian <a href="Reinhold%20Niebuhr">Reinhold Niebuhr</a>, who opposed the Klan in Detroit in 1925, describing them as "one of the worst specific social phenomena which the religious pride of a people has ever developed." "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" publisher <a href="George%20Dealey">George Dealey</a> and Atlanta journalist <a href="Ralph%20McGill">Ralph McGill</a> opposed him, the latter deriding him for his hypocrisy and false claims about minorities.

Several publications, however, gave positive coverage to Evans, although not necessarily his work with the Klan. In 1927, "The New York Times" congratulated Evans on his "modest and engaging exposition of 'Americanism. Although the Klan disowned Evans for reaching out to the Catholic Church, popular opinion was more positive. In 1939, the "<a href="Palm%20Beach%20Daily%20News">Palm Beach Daily News</a>" described the meeting between Evans and Cardinal <a href="Dennis%20Joseph%20Dougherty">Dennis Joseph Dougherty</a> as stirring both religious and secular circles; favorable coverage of the meeting was found in several other publications. Dougherty said that he had found Evans "intensely interested in religious subjects" outside Protestantism.

Shaw and Crompton

Shaw and Crompton is a town and <a href="Civil%20parishes%20in%20England">civil parish</a> within the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Oldham">Metropolitan Borough of Oldham</a>, in <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England. It lies on the <a href="River%20Beal">River Beal</a> at the foothills of the <a href="South%20Pennines">South Pennines</a>, north of <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, southeast of <a href="Rochdale">Rochdale</a>, and to the northeast of the city of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. It is regularly referred to as Shaw.

<a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">Historically</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, Crompton (as it was originally known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of <a href="Britons%20%28historic%29">ancient British</a> and <a href="Angles">Anglian</a> activity in the area. During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Crompton formed a small <a href="Township%20%28England%29">township</a> of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a <a href="Manorialism">manor</a> with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by <a href="hand-loom">hand-loom</a> <a href="woollen">woollen</a> weaving in the <a href="domestic%20system">domestic system</a>.

The introduction of <a href="textile%20manufacture%20during%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution">textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution</a> initiated a process of rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated <a href="mill%20town">mill town</a>. Forty-eight <a href="cotton%20mill">cotton mill</a>s—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its <a href="Spinning%20%28textiles%29">spinning</a> zenith, as a result of an <a href="Interwar%20period">interwar</a> economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more <a href="millionaire">millionaire</a>s per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989.

Shaw and Crompton, which covers , is a predominantly suburban area of mixed affluence with a population of 21,065 as of 2011. Its double name has been said to make it "distinctive, if not unique". The legacy of its industrial past can be seen in its six surviving <a href="cotton%20mill">cotton mill</a>s, all of which are home to large distribution companies, among them <a href="Shop%20Direct%20Group">Shop Direct Group</a>'s <a href="Shaw%20National%20Distribution%20Centre">Shaw National Distribution Centre</a>, a major employer in the area.

The name <a href="Shaw%20%28woodland%29">Shaw</a> is derived from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word "sceaga", meaning "wood". The name Crompton is also of Old English derivation, from the words "crom" or "crumb", meaning "bent" or "crooked" and <a href="List%20of%20generic%20forms%20in%20British%20place%20names">"ton"</a>, for "hamlet or village". A local historian stated that "this name aptly describes the appearance of the place, with its uneven surface, its numerous mounds and hills, as though it had been crumpled up to form these ridges". The <a href="University%20of%20Nottingham">University of Nottingham</a>'s Institute for Name-Studies has offered the suggestion that the name Crompton means "river-bend settlement", which may reflect Crompton's location on a <a href="meander">meander</a> of the <a href="River%20Beal">River Beal</a>.

The dual name of both Shaw and Crompton has been said to make the town "distinctive, if not unique", while preference of Shaw over Crompton and vice versa has been (and to a limited extent remains) a minor local controversy and point of confusion. Today, the single name of Shaw seems to have won preference in the locality.

Shaw was originally a <a href="Hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlet</a> and sub-district of Crompton, and appears to have originated as the commercial and <a href="ecclesiology">ecclesiastic</a> centre of Crompton because of a small chapel sited there dating back to the 16th century. Before then, Whitfield had been the largest village in Crompton. In 1872, Shaw was noted as one of three villages in Crompton. However, due to Shaw's urbanisation following the construction of a major road from <a href="Werneth%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Werneth</a> to <a href="Littleborough%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Littleborough</a>, and the establishment of a post office sub-district named and situated in Shaw, it came to dominate Crompton. Additionally, a separate ecclesiastical parish was created for the township in 1835, which was given the name Shaw because of the church's location on Shaw Moor, in Crompton. The names merged to form the present day Shaw and Crompton, which boundary markers have used since at least the 1950s.

An early type of axe known as a <a href="palstave">palstave</a> has been discovered on <a href="Crompton%20Moor">Crompton Moor</a>, providing evidence of <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Britain">Bronze Age</a> human activity. It is believed that the area was inhabited by <a href="Britons%20%28historic%29">Ancient Britons</a>, and that the <a href="Brigantes">Brigantes</a> gave the <a href="River%20Beal">River Beal</a> its name. An ancient track, perhaps of <a href="Ancient%20Roman">Roman</a> origin, crosses the modern Buckstones Road leading to <a href="Castleshaw%20Roman%20fort">Castleshaw Roman fort</a> in neighbouring <a href="Saddleworth">Saddleworth</a>.

In 616 <a href="%C3%86thelfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelfrith of Bernicia</a>, an <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> king, crossed the <a href="Pennines">Pennines</a> with an army and passed through <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> to defeat the <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">Britons</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chester">Battle of Chester</a>. A wave of <a href="Angles">Anglian</a> colonists followed this military conquest and their settlements are identified by the <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> suffix "ton" in local place names. <a href="Royton">Royton</a>, <a href="Middleton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Middleton</a>, <a href="Moston%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Moston</a>, <a href="Clayton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Clayton</a>, <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne">Ashton</a> and Crompton are localities northeast of Manchester which may have been founded during that colonisation, suggesting that Crompton as a settlement could date from the 7th century.

During <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a>, it is assumed from <a href="toponymy">toponymic evidence</a> that the <a href="township%20%28England%29">township</a> of Crompton formed around a predominantly Anglian community with a few <a href="Norsemen">Norse</a> settlers, and within the extensive <a href="Salford%20%28Hundred%29">Hundred of Salfordshire</a>. Following the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest of England</a>, Crompton was part of a vast estate given to <a href="Roger%20the%20Poitevin">Roger the Poitevin</a>. It was unmentioned in the "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>" of 1086; the first recorded use of the name Crompton for the township was discovered in legal documents relating to <a href="Cockersand%20Abbey">Cockersand Abbey</a> near <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a>, dating from the early 13th century. The document outlines that Gilbert de Notton, a <a href="Normans">Norman</a> who had acquired the land from <a href="Roger%20de%20Montbegon">Roger de Montbegon</a>, granted his estate to Cockersand Abbey. The <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Knights Hospitaller</a> and <a href="Whalley%20Abbey">Whalley Abbey</a> held small estates in the township. In 1234, about of land at Whitfield in Crompton were given to the Hospitallers, a religious order that provided care for poor, sick or injured pilgrims to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>. A medieval cross has been discovered in the ruins of a house at Whitfield.

During the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a>, Crompton was a collection of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, swamp and a single <a href="corn%20mill">corn mill</a>, occupied by a small and close community of families. The area was thinly populated and consisted of several dispersed hamlets, including Whitfield, <a href="High%20Crompton">High Crompton</a>, Cowlishaw, Birshaw and Bovebeale (above Beal). These hamlets were situated above the water-logged valley bottoms and below the exposed high moors. Owing to complicated local arrangements of land tenure, inheritance and absentee landlords, the local lordship was weak and Crompton failed to emerge as a <a href="Manorialism">manor</a> with its own <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Manor">lord</a> and court. This slowly facilitated comparative freedoms and independence for the early people of Crompton, which encouraged the influx of families from the neighbouring <a href="Rochdale%20%28ancient%20parish%29">parish of Rochdale</a>, including the <a href="Buckley%20%28surname%29">Buckleys</a>, <a href="Clegg">Clegg</a>s, Greaves and Milnes.

During the <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>, the Buckley and Crompton families were recorded as the largest landowners in Crompton, owning land and farmsteads at Whitfield and Crompton Fold respectively. The Crompton family has a well-documented history and can be traced back to the time of <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>, appearing in the Assize Roll for 1245. Crompton is indigenous to the township, and first appears as a family name in the 13th century, when the locality's principal landowner, Hugh de la Legh, changed his family name to "de Crompton" (of Crompton), to reflect the estate he possessed. The family owned a large <a href="historic%20house">historic house</a> by the name of <a href="Crompton%20Hall">Crompton Hall</a>, on the site of Crompton Fold. Crompton Hall first appears in historical records as early as 1442, owned by Thomas de Crompton and his family. The original "medieval" Crompton Hall was demolished around 1848. A second Crompton Hall, set in its own prominent forested grounds, was erected by the family—by then an influential and affluent investor in the local cotton industry—but following the death of the last remaining family members, the site was sold and, in 1950, the house was demolished to make way for an exclusive development of <a href="bungalow">bungalow</a>s.

Because of the poor soils and rugged terrain, <a href="Samuel%20Lewis%20%28publisher%29">Samuel Lewis</a> said Crompton's inhabitants were "a race of hardy and laborious men". They have also been described as having a reputation for being a "hardy, frugal and somewhat independent breed", which has been attributed to the tradition of absentee landlords and self-sustenance in earlier times. There had been a <a href="chapel%20of%20ease">chapel of ease</a> at the hamlet of Shaw since at least the early 16th century, but, due to ecclesiastical arrangements for the parish of <a href="Prestwich-cum-Oldham">Prestwich-cum-Oldham</a>, the inhabitants were obliged to contribute money towards <a href="Oldham%20Parish%20Church">Oldham Parish Church</a>, which in turn had obligation to the mother <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20the%20Virgin%2C%20Prestwich">Church of St Mary the Virgin</a> at <a href="Prestwich">Prestwich</a>. On several occasions during the 15th and 16th centuries, the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Chester">Archdeacon of Chester</a> had to intervene because Crompton's inhabitants refused to contribute towards holy bread and candles used at Prestwich. In 1826, a poll was taken regarding the re-building of Oldham Church. Not one person in Crompton voted in favour of the rebuilding and when a rate was levied to raise money for the new church at <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, the people of Crompton refused to pay.

The manufacture of textiles in Crompton can be traced back to 1474, when a lease dated from that year outlines that the occupant of Crompton Park had <a href="spinning%20wheel">spinning wheel</a>s, <a href="carding">cards</a> and <a href="loom">loom</a>s, all of which suggest that cloth was being produced in large quantities. The upland geography of the area constrained the output of crop growing, and so prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade. Wills and inventories from the 15th and 16th centuries suggest most families were involved with small scale <a href="pasture">pasture</a>, but supplemented their incomes by weaving <a href="woollen">woollen</a>s in the <a href="domestic%20system">domestic system</a> and selling cloth, <a href="linen">linen</a> and <a href="fustian">fustian</a>s to travelling <a href="chapmen">chapmen</a> for the markets in Manchester and Rochdale. Despite its remoteness by the <a href="Pennines">Pennines</a>, by the <a href="Early%20Modern%20Britain">Early Modern period</a> the domestic system in Crompton had produced relatively wealthy inhabitants. The most affluent were those involved in cloth and linen, and their wealth was comparable to that of the merchants of Manchester and <a href="Salford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Salford</a>.

Until the mid-18th century, Crompton's textile sector had been closely linked with that of <a href="Rochdale">Rochdale</a> and <a href="Saddleworth">Saddleworth</a> in the north and east; it was a woollen manufacturing district. However, as the demand for <a href="cotton">cotton</a> goods increased, Crompton mirrored developments in Oldham and Manchester in the south and southwest, importing raw cotton and making cotton cloth. To ensure that the woollen trade was kept buoyant, a law existed from 1675 to 1814 to encourage Shaw and Crompton's wool production. It required that the deceased were to be buried in woollen garments.

In the second half of the 18th century, the technology of <a href="cotton-spinning%20machinery">cotton-spinning machinery</a> improved, and the need for larger buildings to house bigger, better and more efficient equipment became apparent. The profitability of cotton spinning meant that open land that had been used for farming since antiquity, was utilised for purpose-built <a href="weavers%27%20cottage">weavers' cottage</a>s. Larger buildings were still desired, and construction of two <a href="water%20power">water power</a>ed cotton factories (two or three times the size of a cottage) can be traced to 1782. The construction of more mills followed—ten by 1789—facilitating a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the region; the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the <a href="factory%20system">factory system</a>. The introduction of the factory system led to an increase of the township's population; from 872 in 1714 to 3,500 in 1801, mostly as a result of an influx of people from <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> looking for employment in the <a href="cotton%20mill">cotton mill</a>s.

<a href="Power%20loom">Power loom</a>s introduced in the early 19th century put an end to the last remnants of the domestic system in Crompton, but not without resistance. Weavers and spinners were paid according to the amount of cloth they produced; independent <a href="hand%20loom">hand loom</a> weavers saw a drop in their income, and could not compete with the mechanised mass production that was gathering pace in the township. <a href="Luddite">Luddite</a>s rioted in the township in 1826, smashing 24 power looms at Clegg's mill at High Crompton in protest against their worsening standard of living.

Crompton's damp climate provided the ideal conditions for cotton spinning to be carried out without the cotton drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market. When suitable land in nearby <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a> (then the largest and most productive mill town in the world) had become scarce in the 1860s, there was a mill building boom in Shaw and Crompton, giving rise to the area as major <a href="mill%20town">mill town</a>. The local townscape became dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills, and its former villages and hamlets <a href="Urban%20agglomeration">agglomerated</a> as a single town around these factories. <a href="Shaw%20and%20Crompton%20railway%20station">Shaw and Crompton railway station</a> and a goods yard was opened in 1863, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring <a href="Royton">Royton</a> had begun to encroach upon the township's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Oldham, <a href="Lees%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Lees</a> and <a href="Chadderton">Chadderton</a>—the <a href="Oldham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Oldham parliamentary constituency</a>—which was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.

The demand for cheap cotton goods from this area prompted the <a href="Initial%20public%20offering">flotation</a> of cotton spinning companies; the investment was followed by the construction of 12 new cotton mills from 1870 and 1900. In the post-war economic boom of 1919–20, investors did not have the time to build new mills and so were prepared to pay vastly inflated sums for shares in existing companies. Many mills were refloated at valuations of up to £500,000 (£ as of 2019), or five times what they had cost to build before the war, resulting in the town being nicknamed "The Golden City" as the scramble for shares intensified. Because of this highly profitable share dealing, it was reported in the national press that Shaw and Crompton had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. The number of cotton mills in the township peaked at 36 in 1920.

Supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut during the <a href="Lancashire%20Cotton%20Famine">Lancashire Cotton Famine</a> of <a href="American%20Civil%20War">1861–1865</a>, leading to the formation of the Crompton <a href="Local%20Board%20of%20Health">Local Board of Health</a> in 1863, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality. The <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Great Depression</a>, and First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline in Shaw and Crompton. Although the industry endured, as imports of cheaper foreign <a href="yarn">yarn</a>s increased during the mid-20th century, Shaw and Crompton's textile sector declined gradually to a halt; said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, cotton spinning reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the final cotton was spun in Shaw and Crompton in 1989, in Lilac and Park mills. Of the <a href="List%20of%20mills%20in%20Shaw%20and%20Crompton">48 cotton mills</a> that have occupied Shaw and Crompton, only six are still standing, all of which are now used as distribution centres.

Since <a href="deindustrialisation">deindustrialisation</a>, Shaw and Crompton's population has continued to grow as a result of intensive housing expansion and redevelopment which has modernised much of its former <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> and <a href="Edwardian%20architecture">Edwardian</a> <a href="terraced%20housing">terraced housing</a> districts. The town has 9,274 residential dwellings, of which one third are Victorian or Edwardian <a href="Terraced%20house">terraces</a>, built for the cotton mill workers of former times. It is considered a popular residential area of relative prosperity, with a variety of housing types. The Buckstones and <a href="Rushcroft">Rushcroft</a> areas contain modern housing estates and are amongst the most affluent suburbs of the town. They were built as part of an agreement made in the 1950s between the then <a href="Crompton%20Urban%20District">Crompton Urban District</a> and the <a href="County%20Borough%20of%20Oldham">County Borough of Oldham</a> councils, to alleviate Oldham's chronic shortage of quality housing. The town has subsequently been described as having "good community spirit and relative prosperity, which, in turn, create popular residential areas".

Shaw and Crompton has been used as a filming location for domestic films and television programmes, including "<a href="The%20Parole%20Officer">The Parole Officer</a>", "<a href="Common%20As%20Muck">Common As Muck</a>", "<a href="Scott%20%26amp%3B%20Bailey">Scott & Bailey</a>" and "The Fred Dibnah Story", the latter of which documented <a href="Fred%20Dibnah">Fred Dibnah</a>'s demolition of the <a href="List%20of%20Shaw%20and%20Crompton%20Mills%23A%E2%80%93E">Briar and Cape</a> mill chimneys. The town entered the national media in 2010, 2011 and 2012; for the <a href="kidnapping%20of%20Sahil%20Saeed">kidnapping of Sahil Saeed</a>, the mugging and death of Nellie Geraghty (which featured on "<a href="Crimewatch">Crimewatch</a>"), and the <a href="2012%20Oldham%20explosion">explosion of a house in Buckley Street</a> respectively. <a href="Shaw%20and%20Crompton%20Metrolink%20station">Shaw and Crompton Metrolink station</a> opened as part of Greater Manchester's light-rail <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Metrolink</a> network on 16 December 2012.

Crompton was recorded in 1212 as being one of the five parts of the <a href="thegn">thegn</a>age estate of Kaskenmoor, which was held on behalf of <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a> by <a href="Roger%20de%20Montbegon">Roger de Montbegon</a> and William de Nevill. The other parts of this estate were <a href="Glodwick">Glodwick</a>, <a href="Sholver">Sholver</a>, <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, and <a href="Werneth%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Werneth</a>, names and places still familiar today. Crompton would later form a <a href="township%20%28England%29">township</a> within the ancient ecclesiastical parish of <a href="Prestwich-cum-Oldham">Prestwich-cum-Oldham</a>, in the <a href="Salford%20%28hundred%29">hundred of Salford</a>. Throughout the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, local men acted as <a href="juror">juror</a>s and <a href="constable">constable</a>s for the purposes of upholding law and order in the township.

Following the <a href="Poor%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201834">Poor Law Amendment Act 1834</a>, Crompton formed part of the Oldham <a href="Poor%20Law%20Union">Poor Law Union</a>, an inter-parish unit established to provide <a href="social%20security">social security</a>. Crompton's first <a href="local%20authority">local authority</a> was a <a href="Local%20board%20of%20health">Local board of health</a> established in 1863; Established with reference to the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201858">Local Government Act 1858</a>, Crompton Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township. Following the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201894">Local Government Act 1894</a>, the area of the Local Board became the <a href="Crompton%20Urban%20District">Crompton Urban District</a>, a local government district within the <a href="Administrative%20counties%20of%20England">administrative county</a> of Lancashire. The urban district council was based out of Shaw/Crompton Town Hall, which opened on 28 December 1894.

Under the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a>, the town's <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a> status was abolished, and the area has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Oldham">Metropolitan Borough of Oldham</a>, a local government district of the <a href="metropolitan%20county">metropolitan county</a> of <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>. A <a href="civil%20parish">civil parish</a> of Crompton was formed in April 1987 and renamed to "Shaw and Crompton" in July 1987. The civil parish has its own <a href="Parish%20councils%20in%20England">parish council</a>, giving it some limited local government autonomy from that of the wider Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, and including the status as a statutory consultee on local <a href="planning%20permission">planning applications</a>. The council comprises 14 locally elected members, councillor Ann Tindall is the parish chairman 2017-2018 and is consulted in planning applications that affect the area through the Shaw and Royton Area Committee of Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council. Shaw and Crompton <a href="Community%20Council">Community Council</a>, a separate body, meets at least four times per year and is designed to allow local people to put forward their priorities for the area in which they live, suggest improvements and have their say on how services are run on a local basis. Shaw and Crompton does not have a <a href="mayor">mayor</a>, but does have a <a href="town%20crier">town crier</a>, a purely ceremonial role. Shaw and Crompton is one of only a few parishes of England that still observes the ancient custom of <a href="Beating%20the%20bounds">Beating the bounds</a>. Originally an annual event, it now takes place every seven years.

In terms of parliamentary representation, Shaw and Crompton after the <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Reform Act 1832</a> was represented as part of the <a href="Oldham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Oldham parliamentary borough constituency</a>, of which the first Members of Parliaments (MPs) were the <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radicals</a> <a href="William%20Cobbett">William Cobbett</a> and <a href="John%20Fielden">John Fielden</a>. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> was the MP between 1900 and 1906. Churchill once stayed at <a href="Crompton%20Hall">Crompton Hall</a>, and letters written by him describe how peaceful and tranquil he thought the area to be. Constituency boundaries changed during the 20th century; from 1885 to 1918 Shaw and Crompton lay within <a href="Prestwich%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Prestwich constituency</a>, from 1918 to 1950 in <a href="Royton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Royton constituency</a>, from 1950 until 1983 in <a href="Heywood%20and%20Royton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Heywood and Royton constituency</a>, and from 1983 to 1997 in <a href="Littleborough%20and%20Saddleworth%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Littleborough and Saddleworth constituency</a>. Since 1997, Shaw and Crompton has lain within the parliamentary constituency of <a href="Oldham%20East%20and%20Saddleworth%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Oldham East and Saddleworth</a>, and is represented in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> by <a href="Debbie%20Abrahams">Debbie Abrahams</a>, a member of the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>.

At (53.5777°, -2.0928°) Shaw and Crompton lies along the eastern edge of the ancient Lancashire border; <a href="Saddleworth">Saddleworth</a> and the <a href="Pennines">Pennines</a> are close to the east. The larger towns of <a href="Rochdale">Rochdale</a> and Oldham lie to the northwest and south respectively; <a href="Royton">Royton</a> is west-southwest. There are no <a href="List%20of%20motorways%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">motorways</a> in Shaw and Crompton, though a light rail line bisects the town from north to south. The town has a <a href="post%20office">post office</a> under the <a href="OL%20postcode%20area">Oldham post town</a>. The territory of the civil parish is given as . For purposes of the <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a>, Shaw and Crompton forms part of the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Urban%20Area">Greater Manchester Urban Area</a>, with <a href="Manchester%20city%20centre">Manchester city centre</a> itself southwest of Shaw and Crompton.

Described in <a href="Samuel%20Lewis%20%28publisher%29">Samuel Lewis</a>'s "A Topographical Dictionary of England" (1848) as located in "a bleak situation", Shaw and Crompton is in the valley of the <a href="River%20Beal">River Beal</a>, which runs northward through the town towards the village of <a href="Newhey">Newhey</a>. The land to the east of the town steadily rises, reaching a height of at the summit of <a href="Crompton%20Moor">Crompton Moor</a>. To the west, the land reaches around at <a href="High%20Crompton">High Crompton</a> and at Whitfield, and from these highpoints the surface slopes away in all directions. The <a href="River%20Irk">River Irk</a> rises on Shaw and Crompton's western boundary with <a href="Royton">Royton</a>. The <a href="geology">geology</a> is represented by <a href="carboniferous">carboniferous</a> <a href="coal%20measure">coal measure</a>s. The soils of the town are broadly sterile, the poorest being in the upland <a href="moorland">moors</a>. <a href="Rainfall">Rainfall</a> rises steadily from the <a href="Cheshire%20Plain">Cheshire Plain</a> in a northeasterly direction, and totals are between to a year in Shaw and Crompton, which is well above the UK average of and compares to about a year at <a href="Ringway%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Ringway</a>.
Shaw and Crompton's <a href="built%20environment">built environment</a> is similar to the <a href="urban%20structure">urban structure</a> of most <a href="List%20of%20towns%20in%20England">towns in England</a>, consisting of residential dwellings centred on a <a href="High%20Street">High Street</a> in the <a href="town%20centre">town centre</a>, which is the local centre of commerce. There is a mixture of low-density <a href="urban%20areas">urban areas</a>, <a href="suburb">suburb</a>s, semi-rural and <a href="rural">rural</a> locations in Shaw and Crompton, but overwhelmingly the <a href="land%20use">land use</a> in the town is residential; industrial areas and <a href="terraced%20house">terraced house</a>s give way to suburbs and rural greenery as the land rises out of the town. Generally, property in the centre, west, and south of the town is older and smaller in comparison to that found in the east and north.

Shaw and Crompton is divided into two <a href="Ward%20%28politics%29">political wards</a>, named "Shaw" and "Crompton" (to the east and west respectively), and residential suburbs, including <a href="High%20Crompton">High Crompton</a>, Rushcroft, Buckstones, Clough, Jubilee, Shaw Side, Wrens Nest, Cowlishaw, Low Crompton, Nook, Goats, Wood End and <a href="Shore%20Edge">Shore Edge</a>.

According to <a href="census">census</a> data, in 2001 Shaw and Crompton had a total resident population of 21,721, with a <a href="population%20density">population density</a> of around 4,692 people per square mile (1,811 per km²), and an average age of 39. Around 3% of Shaw and Crompton's population is from a <a href="Minority%20group">black and minority ethnic</a> background (which includes a small but long established community of <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>i heritage), the rest broadly being of <a href="White%20British">white</a> background.

Of the residents in the combined electoral wards of Shaw and Crompton (which are coterminous with the town) 41.7% were married, 9.2% were <a href="Cohabitation">cohabiting</a> couples, and 9.7% were lone parent families. Forty percent of households were made up of individuals and 14% had someone living alone at <a href="pension">pension</a>able age.

The <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">ethnicity</a> of the town was given as 96% white, 0.5% <a href="Multiracial">mixed race</a>, 2.0% Asian, 0.3% black and 0.2% Chinese or other.

The place of birth of the town's residents was 96.8% United Kingdom (including 95.13% from England), 0.6% <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, 0.5% from other <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> countries, and 2.1% from elsewhere in the world. Religion was recorded as 84% Christian, 1.7% Muslim, 0.2% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, 0.1% Jewish and <0.1% Sikh. Some 6.8% were recorded as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion, and 5.6% did not state their religion.

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 45% in full-time employment, 12% in part-time employment, 7% self-employed, 2.4% unemployed, 2% students with jobs, 3% students without jobs, 13% retired, 4% looking after home or family, 7% permanently sick or disabled, and 2% economically inactive for other reasons. This was roughly in line with the national figures. Of the town's residents aged 16–74, 15% had a <a href="higher%20education">higher education</a> qualification or the equivalent, compared with 20% nationwide.

Below is a table outlining population growth of the area since 1901. Earlier records show that the area had a population of 872 in 1714.

From the 18th century onwards, Shaw and Crompton's economy was closely tied with that of Britain's <a href="textile%20manufacture%20during%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution">textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution</a>, particularly the cotton spinning sector.

Shaw and Crompton has become a base for distribution companies as a result of the town's good transport links, its supply of large, disused mill properties, and its situation between Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Lancashire, and West Yorkshire. It is home to <a href="Shop%20Direct%20Group">Shop Direct Group</a>'s <a href="Shaw%20National%20Distribution%20Centre">Shaw National Distribution Centre</a>, one of the UK's largest warehouse distribution centres. The company occupies three former cotton mills and state-of-the-art purpose-built storage and sorting facilities on a complex within the town. In 2007, the site became the retail company's only packing and distribution centre for non-bulk items. It employs nearly 1,000 staff, making it the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham's largest private employer. The <a href="N%20Brown%20Group">N Brown Group</a>, and children's toy distributors Toy Options have distribution centres in the town.

Until the 1990s, Shaw and Crompton was the home of <a href="Osram">Osram</a>, the multinational lightbulb manufacturer, which occupied Duke Mill and was a significant employer in the area. Production has since been moved away from the United Kingdom. <a href="Warburtons">Warburtons</a> had one of its 11 major bakeries in Shaw and Crompton from 1965 to January 2012. The "Pennine" bakery produced around 500,000 loaves a week and distributed them to major multiples and independent retailers throughout Greater Manchester, <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, and <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>. Located on Glebe Street, it employed around 200 staff and produced a wide range of Warburtons bread products. In August 2012 the building was bought by UDUNK who propose to redevelop the building as commercial units for up to 6 businesses.

Trent Mill Industrial Estate, on the edge of the town near <a href="Rushcroft">Rushcroft</a>, takes its name from the mill that was once there. The <a href="business%20park">business park</a> is home to several small industrial companies. It was partially destroyed by a fire that started in a plastics factory in the early hours of 28 April 2007.

On 6 August 2007, a <a href="Asda">Asda</a> supermarket opened on the site of the former Dawn Mill. A derelict row of houses on Eastway was demolished as part of this development. Two houses on Greenfield Lane were also demolished, allowing the existing <a href="ALDI">ALDI</a> store to expand—possibly to help it to compete with the new ASDA store. The original planning application was put to a public vote in 2005, and included proposals for 316 parking spaces, improved bus facilities, pedestrian routes linked to Market Street, junction improvements to nearby streets, and the relocation of a local tyre-fitting company. The supermarket cost £20 million to construct, and is the first ASDA store in the United Kingdom to use <a href="environmentally%20friendly">environmentally friendly</a> construction techniques, which <a href="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> intends to use as a blueprint for all its new ASDA supermarkets. It incorporates a <a href="Sustainable%20forestry">sustainable timber</a> frame and an <a href="Energy%20conservation">energy-saving</a> ventilation system, which together have eradicated the need for 500 tonnes of steel and 450 tonnes of carbon emissions.

The main Crompton War Memorial, located on the High Street, consists of a <a href="Granite">Scottish granite</a> plinth surmounted by a large bronze statue flanked by two Rolls of Honour containing the 346 names of those from Shaw and Crompton who fought and died in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. Panels listing the Roll of Honour from the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> were added and unveiled on 12 November 1950 by Councillor H. M. Turner. Commissioned by the Crompton War Memorial Committee, the statue was conceptualised in 1919 by <a href="Richard%20Reginald%20Goulden">Richard Reginald Goulden</a>, and unveiled on 29 April 1923 by <a href="Ian%20Standish%20Monteith%20Hamilton">General Sir Ian Hamilton</a>. The original cost for the memorial alone was £4,000, but the total cost, including site and layout, was about £6,067.

The inscription on the memorial reads:

"In memory of the men of Crompton who fought and gave their lives to free mankind from the oppression and brutal tyranny of war. 1914–1919."

The symbolic memorial depicts a group in which the central figure is a man defending the future generations, represented by young children, against foreign aggression, represented by a beast. The memorial is also a time capsule. Inside it is a lead casket containing coins, a copy of the local newspaper, three cops of spun cotton, and a length of cloth manufactured in the local area.

A second, smaller war memorial is located in Jubilee Gardens. It is dedicated to the soldiers who fought in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>. It consists of a plaque built into a stone wall that is located between two large bushes.

Its inscription reads:
"In memory of the Crompton men who lost their lives in the South African war 1899–1902"

It then lists eight men: four who were "killed in action", two who "died of wounds", and two who "died of disease".

In 1995, to mark the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War, a landmark known as the Shaw and Crompton Beacon was erected in Jubilee Gardens.

The inscription on the plaque below reads:
"The Shaw and Crompton beaconerected by the Parish Council in 1995 tocommemorate the fiftieth anniversary ofthe ending of World War Two

Spanning approximately , and reaching an elevation of , <a href="Crompton%20Moor">Crompton Moor</a> is one of the largest open spaces run by Oldham Countryside Service. It is a registered <a href="Commons">common</a> of Greater Manchester, and, since 2003, a designated <a href="Site%20of%20Biological%20Importance">Site of Biological Importance</a>.
Brushes Clough and Pingot are former <a href="coal">coal</a> and <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> quarries on Crompton Moor. During the 1970s, quarrying was halted, the land was reclaimed, and thousands of <a href="pine%20tree">pine tree</a>s were planted. The area has since been used for recreation, including hiking, orienteering, and mountain biking. <a href="Brushes%20Clough%20Reservoir">Brushes Clough Reservoir</a> was constructed in the 19th century by the <a href="County%20Borough%20of%20Oldham">Oldham County Borough Council</a>, using stone quarried from this site. The area is now managed by <a href="United%20Utilities">United Utilities</a>.

The Big Lamp was a six-sided gas-powered public street lamp standing high at the original cross-road junction of Manchester Road, Oldham Road, High Street, and Church Road. It was pulled down on 17 June 1925, when electric lighting was introduced. During the 1970s, the junction was redeveloped to accommodate the new Crompton Way bypass. A large <a href="roundabout">roundabout</a> was built, and a scaled-down replica of the original Big Lamp was erected in its centre. The new Big Lamp is electrically powered and stands about high.

<a href="Public%20transport">Public transport</a> in Shaw and Crompton is co-ordinated by <a href="Transport%20for%20Greater%20Manchester">Transport for Greater Manchester</a>. Shaw and Crompton had a railway line and station between 1863 and 2009, opened initially for haulage, but later used for passenger and commuter journeys. <a href="Shaw%20and%20Crompton%20railway%20station">Shaw and Crompton railway station</a> was used by passenger trains running between Rochdale and Manchester on the <a href="Oldham%20Loop%20Line">Oldham Loop Line</a>. After initially being rejected in the early 2000s, plans to turn the line into part of the light-rail <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Metrolink</a> system were accepted by the government on 6 July 2006. Shaw and Crompton railway station closed on 3 October 2009, so that it can be converted from use with <a href="heavy%20rail">heavy rail</a> to Metrolink. <a href="Shaw%20and%20Crompton%20Metrolink%20station">Shaw and Crompton Metrolink station</a> opened on 16 December 2012.

Historically the town was served by two electric <a href="Tram%23Electric%20%28trolley%20cars%29">tram</a> routes operated by Oldham Corporation. The first ran from Higginshaw and opened on 15 November 1904 it was almost immediately extended to Chadderton Road, <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>. The second line from <a href="Royton">Royton</a> opened on 13 April 1905. By January 1921 both lines shared a terminus at Wrens Nest and the Royton line had been extended to <a href="Hollinwood%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Hollinwood</a>. In the same year, the routes were assigned numbers; Hollinwood to Shaw route was No.8 and the route to Chadderton Road was No.9. There were plans to extend the lines to the railway station and High Crompton but these never materialised. Route 9 was closed on 11 June 1935 and route 8 was closed on 2 December 1939, both were replaced by buses.

The bus company <a href="First%20Greater%20Manchester">First Greater Manchester</a> operates services 58, 59, 181, 182, 408 and 428, which provides frequent services to Oldham and Rochdale, with buses also running to <a href="Chadderton">Chadderton</a>, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="Middleton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Middleton</a>, <a href="Royton">Royton</a> and <a href="Stalybridge">Stalybridge</a>. <a href="Rosso%20%28bus%20company%29">Rosso</a> runs the 435 between Buckstones and Rochdale. There is also two Shaw Circular routes 403 and 404 which are run by First, serving the smaller roads of Shaw and Crompton. Shaw and Crompton is located south of junction 21 of the <a href="M62%20motorway">M62 motorway</a>.

There had been private cottage schools in the area from a very early time, but Crompton's first public school was founded in 1791. In 1838, the Shaw <a href="National%20Society%20for%20Promoting%20Religious%20Education">National School</a> was built. The construction of church schools followed, including Shaw Methodist School in 1842, St Mary's, in 1847 and St James' 1851. Shaw and Crompton is now served by a variety of schools, including some with religious affiliations. All the schools in the town perform either at or above the national average for test results. <a href="Crompton%20House%20Church%20of%20England%20School">Crompton House Church of England School</a>, a secondary school for 11- to 16-year-olds, also has a <a href="sixth%20form%20college">sixth form college</a> of <a href="further%20education">further education</a> for 16- to 18-year-olds on the same site.

The township of Crompton was originally within the parish of <a href="Prestwich-cum-Oldham">Prestwich-cum-Oldham</a> in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Lichfield">Diocese of Lichfield</a>, until 1541, when, owing to the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, this diocese was divided and Crompton became part of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Chester">Diocese of Chester</a>. This in turn was divided in 1847, when the present <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Manchester">Diocese of Manchester</a> was created.

The exact date of the establishment of a place of worship in Crompton is uncertain. Although Shaw Chapel is certain to have been in existence since the early 16th century, it has been put that "Shaw Chapel is even more ancient than Oldham Old Church", as evidenced by the ancient <a href="toponymy">toponymy</a> of the area. Shaw Chapel was anciently known as St Patrick's Chapel-on-the-Moor, and during the reign of <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I of England</a>, "it was situate in the midst of the common called Shaw Moor, not a single habitation being near it". It is thought to have been constructed following an increase in wealth produced by the localisation of the woollen trade during a very bleak period, although, in 1552 it was noted that it had no endowment, and its ornaments were in poor condition. It was rebuilt in 1739 and enlarged in 1798, and rebuilt again in 1870. It is now known as the Church of Holy Trinity.

Shaw and Crompton has three <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> <a href="Parish">ecclesiastic parishes</a>: Shaw, High Crompton, and East Crompton. In addition to <a href="Church%20of%20England">the established church</a>, a variety of <a href="List%20of%20Reformed%20churches">Reformed denominations</a>, particularly <a href="English%20Dissenters">Nonconformism</a> and <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a>, have been practiced in Shaw and Crompton. <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> ministers were recorded preaching at Shaw Chapel in as early as the 1650s. The <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Religious Society of Friends</a> held <a href="conventicle">conventicle</a>s in Whitfield in 1660s and 1670s.

The following is a table of churches presently in Shaw and Crompton, as of 2018.
Most of the above churches participate in Shaw's annual <a href="Pentecost">Whit Walks</a> event, when congregations, choirs, and brass bands parade through the streets from their respective churches before taking part in one large, communal, inter-church service. The town centre is also home to a small <a href="mosque">mosque</a>.

Crompton Library is a purpose-built <a href="library">library</a> housing over 36,000 items including books, CDs, and DVDs that can be borrowed by anyone who lives in the Oldham borough. It has communal Internet facilities. The library was built in the early 1990s after the original 1907 building, which exists now as <a href="apartment">apartment</a>s on Beal Lane, became too small.

There are three main public parks in Shaw and Crompton. Dunwood Park lies alongside the Oldham and Rochdale Metrolink Line and has a children's play area, <a href="bowling%20green">bowling green</a>, and over a mile of wooded pathways along the base of a forested hillside. The land that forms Dunwood Park was presented to Crompton Urban District Council by Captain Abram Crompton <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">JP</a> on 22 June 1911, and opened as a park by him on 14 September 1912. It was redeveloped with a new park and bowling green for its 2012 centenary after winning a £1 million grant from the <a href="National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Lottery</a>. High Crompton Park is in <a href="High%20Crompton">High Crompton</a> and is home to a <a href="tennis%20court">tennis court</a>, bowling green, children's play area, and gardens.

Stark Raving Dad

"Stark Raving Dad" is the first episode of the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%203%29">third season</a> of the American animated television series "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>". It first aired on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox network</a> in the United States on September 19, 1991. In the episode, <a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer Simpson</a> is mistaken for an anarchist and sent to a mental institution, where he shares a room with a man who claims to be pop star <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart</a> promises his sister <a href="Lisa%20Simpson">Lisa</a> that he will get her the best birthday present ever.

The episode was written by <a href="Al%20Jean">Al Jean</a> and <a href="Mike%20Reiss">Mike Reiss</a>, and directed by <a href="Rich%20Moore">Rich Moore</a>. Michael Jackson guest-starred as Leon Kompowsky, but went uncredited for contractual reasons; his role was not confirmed until later. Jackson was a fan of the show and called creator <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a> one night offering to do a guest spot. Jackson pitched several story ideas for the episode and wrote the song "Happy Birthday Lisa" for the episode. The character's singing voice would be performed by a soundalike, <a href="Kipp%20Lennon">Kipp Lennon</a>, due to contractual obligations Jackson had with his record company at the time. The episode contains references to Jackson's career, with Kompowsky singing portions of the songs "<a href="Billie%20Jean">Billie Jean</a>" and "<a href="Ben%20%28song%29">Ben</a>".

"Stark Raving Dad" received generally positive reviews, particularly for its writing and Jackson's performance. A sequel in which Kompowsky would be voiced by <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a> was canceled after Prince refused the script. A 1992 rerun featured an alternate opening in response to a speech by President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, in which he said Americans needed to be "a lot more like the <a href="the%20Waltons">Waltons</a> and a lot less like the Simpsons". Following the release of the 2019 documentary "<a href="Leaving%20Neverland">Leaving Neverland</a>", which follows allegations of child sexual assault against Jackson, the episode was pulled from circulation.

<a href="Lisa%20Simpson">Lisa</a> reminds <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart</a> that he forgets her birthday every year, so Bart promises to get her a present this year. Meanwhile, <a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer</a> discovers that all of his white shirts have dyed pink because Bart put his red hat in with the laundry. Homer has no choice but to wear a pink shirt to work and as a result, his co-workers poke fun at him. <a href="Mr.%20Burns">Mr. Burns</a> suspects him of being a "free-thinking anarchist". Homer is sent home with a 20-question psychiatric quiz that he has to fill in so that <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20The%20Simpsons%20characters%23Dr.%20Marvin%20Monroe">Dr. Marvin Monroe</a> can assess his sanity. Homer is too lazy to finish the quiz on his own and lets Bart fill it in. When Dr. Monroe sees the results, he determines that Homer is insane. Homer is sent to a mental institution, and is put in a cell with a large white man who seems to believe he is <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, and who introduces himself as such. Being unfamiliar with the real Michael Jackson, Homer believes and quickly befriends him.

<a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge</a>, upon hearing what has happened, comes to the institution and is able to convince Homer's doctors that he is not insane. Homer bids farewell to Michael, who reveals that he is in the mental institution voluntarily. Homer decides to let him stay in the family home. He calls and tells Bart that he is bringing Michael to stay for a few days. Against Homer and Michael's wishes, Bart tells his friend <a href="Milhouse%20Van%20Houten">Milhouse</a> and soon all of <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a> turns up outside of the <a href="Simpson%20family">Simpson family</a>'s home to see Michael. The level of excitement is deflated when Homer introduces Michael and they realise he is an impostor. The townspeople become angry at Bart and leave. At the same time, Lisa comes out of the house and is upset with Bart because he has yet again failed to acknowledge her birthday, because of his excitement over Michael Jackson's arrival.

After overhearing Lisa write in a letter that she is <a href="disownment">disowning</a> Bart as a brother, the faux Michael convinces Bart to let him help. Together they write and perform a song for Lisa's birthday called "Happy Birthday Lisa". Lisa is thrilled and hugs her brother, saying that he has given her the best present ever. Afterwards, Michael reveals that his real name is <a href="List%20of%20one-time%20The%20Simpsons%20characters%23Season%203">Leon Kompowsky</a>, a bricklayer from <a href="Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey">Paterson, New Jersey</a>. He explains that he had been very angry for most of his life, but found some peace in talking in Jackson's voice because it made everyone around him happy. Leon bids farewell to the Simpsons and walks off down the road, singing Lisa's birthday song to himself in his normal voice.

"Stark Raving Dad" was written specifically for Michael Jackson, a fan of the show, who had called Groening one night and offered to do a guest spot. The offer was accepted and a script was written by <a href="Al%20Jean">Al Jean</a> and <a href="Mike%20Reiss">Mike Reiss</a>, based on an idea pitched by <a href="James%20L.%20Brooks">James L. Brooks</a>. Creator <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a> and co-executive producer <a href="Sam%20Simon">Sam Simon</a> also contributed significantly to the writing. In an early version of the script, Homer decided to take his alcoholic friend <a href="Barney%20Gumble">Barney Gumble</a> in for rehab, but while there Homer began acting crazily so the doctors assumed he was the one to be committed. It was later changed to Homer being hospitalized for wearing a pink shirt, an idea pitched by Brooks. Jackson pitched several story ideas, such as Bart telling everyone in town that Jackson was coming to his house. He also requested a scene in which he and Bart write a song together and asked that a joke about <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a> be changed to one about <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>.

According to Jean, Jackson would not commit to the episode until after a <a href="read-through">read-through</a> of the script. The read was held at Jackson's manager Sandy Gallin's house, and <a href="Dan%20Castellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a> (who provides the voice for Homer) was 30 minutes late. Jean recalls that "no one said a word, we just sat there waiting". Following the read, Jackson stipulated his conditions: he would go uncredited, and his singing voice would be performed by a soundalike. Leon Kompowsky's singing parts were performed by <a href="Kipp%20Lennon">Kipp Lennon</a>, because Jackson wanted to play a joke on his brothers and fool them into thinking the impersonator was him. 

Lennon recorded his lines at the same time as Jackson, who found the impersonations humorous. Jackson attended the recording session alone and did not use the special trailer set up for him. According to Jean, Jackson did record versions of the singing parts, but "Simpsons" music editor Chris Ledesma said they were not used. Kompowsky's normal speaking voice, heard at the end of the episode, was recorded by cast member <a href="Hank%20Azaria">Hank Azaria</a>. The episode originally was supposed to end with Kompowsky singing a portion of Jackson's song "<a href="Man%20in%20the%20Mirror">Man in the Mirror</a>", but it was changed to "Happy Birthday Lisa".

"Stark Raving Dad" was the final episode in the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%202%29">season two</a> production run, but aired as the premiere of season three, over a year after it was completed. Michael Jackson was credited with pseudonym John Jay Smith in the closing credits. At the time, the producers of the show were legally prevented from confirming that Jackson guest-starred, although many media sources assumed it was really him. Similarly, in season two, actor <a href="Dustin%20Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a> had guest-starred in the episode "<a href="Lisa%27s%20Substitute">Lisa's Substitute</a>" under the name "Sam Etic". After "Stark Raving Dad", the producers decided that guest stars would have to agree to be credited.

Jackson was a fan of Bart, and wanted to give Bart a number one-single. He co-wrote the song "<a href="Do%20the%20Bartman">Do the Bartman</a>", which was released as a single around the same time that the episode was produced. Jackson could not take credit for his work on the song due to contractual reasons. Jackson also wrote the song "Happy Birthday Lisa", which was later included in the album "<a href="Songs%20in%20the%20Key%20of%20Springfield">Songs in the Key of Springfield</a>". A version of the song was reportedly to be included on a bonus disc in the 2001 special edition of Jackson's 1991 album "<a href="Dangerous%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Dangerous</a>", but the bonus disc was dropped.

"Stark Raving Dad" is the first "Simpsons" episode originally produced and broadcast in <a href="Dolby%20Surround">Dolby Surround</a>. To mark the change, the producers commissioned the show's in-house music composer <a href="Alf%20Clausen">Alf Clausen</a>, who was originally hired after providing all the music for the first annual "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20%28The%20Simpsons%20episode%29">Treehouse of Horror</a>", to arrange a re-recorded version of the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20Theme">theme song</a> for the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20opening%20sequence">opening sequence</a>. This version of the theme has remained in the opening sequence since.

The January 30, 1992 rerun of the episode featured a brief alternate opening, which was written in response to a comment made by the then <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> three days earlier. The show had previously had a "feud" with the President's wife <a href="Barbara%20Bush">Barbara Bush</a> when, in the October 1, 1990 edition of "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>", she called "The Simpsons" "the dumbest thing [she] had ever seen". The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter to Bush in which they posed as Marge Simpson. Bush immediately sent a reply in which she apologized. Later, on January 27, 1992, George Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign which included the statement "we are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like <a href="the%20Waltons">the Waltons</a> and a lot less like the Simpsons."

The writers decided that they wanted to respond quickly like Barbara Bush had to them. Each episode of "The Simpsons" takes more than six months to produce, so it is difficult for the show to comment on current events. The writers therefore decided to add a brief response to the next broadcast of "The Simpsons", which was a rerun of "Stark Raving Dad" on January 30. <a href="Nancy%20Cartwright">Nancy Cartwright</a>, the voice of Bart, was quickly called in so she could record a line.

The broadcast included a new tongue-in-cheek opening. The scene, from the episode "<a href="Simpson%20and%20Delilah">Simpson and Delilah</a>", begins in the Simpsons' living room where the family is watching Bush's speech. When Bush says "to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons", Bart replies, "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to <a href="Early%201990s%20recession">the Depression</a>, too." The opening is featured on the season four <a href="List%20of%20The%20Simpsons%20home%20video%20releases">DVD box set</a>.

A year after "Stark Raving Dad" aired, the writers planned a sequel in which Kompowsky returns, this time claiming to be the pop star <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>. The script was written by freelancers and polished by <a href="Conan%20O%27Brien">Conan O'Brien</a>. According to Reiss, it saw Kompowsky encourage the Springfield residents to "loosen up, become more flamboyant and become more sexually open".

Prince agreed to voice Kompowsky and sent notes about what his character would wear, but the writers discovered that Prince was referring to a script that had been written by his chauffeur. Prince disliked their script and demanded the other one be used, but the writers refused. The script became one of the few unproduced "Simpsons" scripts.

Like all episodes of "The Simpsons", "Stark Raving Dad" features a variety of references to popular culture. As Bart fills out the 20-question psychiatry quiz, Homer watches "<a href="America%27s%20Funniest%20Home%20Videos">America's Funniest Home Videos</a>" where the three nominated clips are all violent. Many of the scenes in the mental institution are references to the film "<a href="One%20Flew%20Over%20the%20Cuckoo%27s%20Nest%20%28film%29">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a>". Several of the characters at the institution are based on those in the film, such as <a href="One%20Flew%20Over%20the%20Cuckoo%27s%20Nest%20%28novel%29%23Main%20characters">Chief</a>. Floyd from the film "<a href="Rain%20Man">Rain Man</a>" also appears at the mental home as well as <a href="Hannibal%20Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a> from the film "<a href="The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Lambs%20%28film%29">The Silence of the Lambs</a>". When Marge calls the institution, a <a href="Elevator%20music">muzak</a> version of "<a href="Crazy%20%28Willie%20Nelson%20song%29">Crazy</a>", sung by <a href="Patsy%20Cline">Patsy Cline</a>, can be heard over the phone. In the shot of the crowd that awaits Michael Jackson's arrival outside of the Simpson family's home, a man is holding a "" sign in reference to <a href="Rollen%20Stewart">Rollen Stewart</a>, who was famous for holding a similar sign at sporting events.

Many aspects of Jackson's career are referenced in the episode. Kompowsky mentions several things which made Jackson famous, including "", "<a href="Beat%20It">Beat It</a>", and "<a href="Thriller%20%28song%29">Thriller</a>". He also sings portions of the songs "<a href="Billie%20Jean">Billie Jean</a>" and "<a href="Ben%20%28song%29">Ben</a>" and performs the <a href="Moonwalk%20%28dance%29">moonwalk</a>. When Homer starts mumbling in his sleep, Kompowsky tells his stuffed animal: "Bubbles, it's going to be a long night." <a href="Bubbles%20%28chimpanzee%29">Bubbles</a> is the name of Jackson's chimpanzee. Kompowsky also says he was upset when "his" 1979 album "<a href="Off%20the%20Wall%20%28album%29">Off the Wall</a>" only received one <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nomination; the writers had read that the real Jackson was genuinely upset.

In its original airing on the Fox network, "Stark Raving Dad" acquired a 13.9 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> and 23 percent share of the audience. It was viewed in approximately 12.8 million homes, finishing the week ranked 33rd. The episode finished second in its time slot behind the season premiere of "<a href="The%20Cosby%20Show">The Cosby Show</a>", which ranked eighth for the week with a 19.7 rating and 31 percent share. "The Simpsons" was the second highest rated show on Fox the week it aired, behind "<a href="Married...%20with%20Children">Married... with Children</a>".
The episode has been generally well received, being praised by many critics for its writing. In a 2009 review for "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>", <a href="Josh%20Levin">Josh Levin</a> wrote that "The greatness of 'Stark Raving Dad' has a lot more to do with "The Simpsons" writing staff than with Jackson's voice-over talents. The show's scripters came up with a plot device far more ingenious than simply dropping the singer into Springfield." Monica Collins of the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" also enjoyed the episode. On the day it first aired, she wrote that "This episode is vintage "Simpsons", crammed with divinely vulgar visual oddities. And Michael Jackson, of course, is just so weird anyway that he fits right in." Mark Lorando of "<a href="The%20Times-Picayune">The Times-Picayune</a>" commented that "throwaway lines on "The Simpsons" are funnier than the big punchlines on most so-called comedy series; [this episode] has layers of humor, satirical touches that enrich the story lines," singling out jokes like the "America's Funniest Home Video" parody. "The laughs are literally non-stop, and Jackson's unmistakable vocal presence [...] adds a thousand watts of star power." In 2011, Television Blend's Eric Eisenberg named "Stark Raving Dad" the best episode of the entire series. He praised it for being heartful and stated that what "prevents the episode from seeming artificial or manipulative is that the writing in the episode earns the earnest moments", and further elaborates that while "strong emotions might be the hallmark of 'Stark Raving Dad,' it would be a sincere mistake to ignore how funny it is." He concluded that the episode "is perfectly constructed, is filled with both deep belly laughs and tears, and is simply the greatest episode of The Simpsons" In 1998, "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" listed it in its list of top twelve "Simpsons" episodes.

In a DVD <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a>, writer <a href="Mike%20Reiss">Mike Reiss</a> said he felt that Michael Jackson is "not a terrific actor [...] but he did fine. He was really nice, he was a great sport." In 2006, Jackson was named the fifth-best "Simpsons" guest star by <a href="IGN">IGN</a>. Tom Ganjamie of "<a href="Best%20Week%20Ever">Best Week Ever</a>" called Jackson's guest appearance the "cleverest [...] ever on "The Simpsons"". Writing for IGN, Robert Canning said in a 2009 review that "Stark Raving Dad" is a "solid, funny and touching episode" and described Jackson's performance as "heartfelt yet self-parodying". In a 2011 article, Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> his second favorite musical guest on "The Simpsons" out of a list of ten.

In 2003, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that the episode was a good start to season three, but it "gets sappy on more than a few occasions, and it lacks the acerbic bite of the series' best shows. Nonetheless, it tosses out some good laughs, and the guest appearance by Jackson—under a pseudonym—works well; Michael shows an ability to mock himself that still surprises me." In a 2004 review for Digitally Obsessed, Nate Meyers wrote that "there are many funny gags in this episode, especially in the first act when Homer gets a tour of the [mental] hospital. Some clever references are made to "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", but the second half of the episode is not especially funny. The jokes seem forced and there is too much of an effort to sentimentalize the relationship between Bart and Lisa, causing the show to lose its narrative drive." In 2007, <a href="Ben%20Rayner">Ben Rayner</a> of the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" listed "Stark Raving Dad" as one of the three worst episodes of "The Simpsons".

In a 2009 article for <a href="Weblogs%2C%20Inc.%23TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a>, Mike Moody said the episode's "sweetest moment" is at the end when Kompowsky and Bart perform the birthday song for Lisa. Likewise, writer Al Jean listed that scene as one of his five favorite moments from "The Simpsons" in 2003. The reaction to the song "Happy Birthday Lisa" was mixed. Ben Rayner called it a "crap tune", and Chris Selley of "<a href="Maclean%27s">Maclean's</a>" magazine wrote that "Stark Raving Dad" is "an unbearably sappy episode, and that birthday song for Lisa is just... bad." Dave Walker of "The Times-Picayune" listed the episode as one of Jackson's "many memorable TV moments" and called the song "unforgettable".

After <a href="Death%20of%20Michael%20Jackson">Jackson's death on June 25, 2009</a>, the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox network</a> reran the episode on July 5 in tribute. The producers had intended to air the episode on June 28, 2009, three days after Jackson's death, but could not resolve problems with syndication rights, and so the "Do the Bartman" music video was aired instead. The producers screened the episode first, and the only change made, which was unrelated to Jackson, was the blurring of a phone number.

Following the release of the 2019 documentary "<a href="Leaving%20Neverland">Leaving Neverland</a>", which follows allegations of child sexual assault against Jackson, Brooks announced that "Stark Raving Dad" would be pulled from circulation. He told "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>": "This was a treasured episode. There are a lot of great memories we have wrapped up in that one, and this certainly doesn't allow them to remain. I'm against book-burning of any kind. But this is our book, and we're allowed to take out a chapter." Jean said he believed Jackson had used the episode to groom boys for sexual abuse.

Thescelosaurus

Thescelosaurus ( ; <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> θέσκελος-/"theskelos-" meaning "godlike", "marvelous", or "wondrous" and σαυρος/"sauros" "lizard") was a <a href="genus">genus</a> of small <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that appeared at the very end of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="period%20%28geology%29">period</a> in North America. It was a member of the last dinosaurian <a href="fauna">fauna</a> before the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</a> around 66 million years ago. The preservation and completeness of many of its specimens indicate that it may have preferred to live near streams.

This <a href="bipedalism">bipedal</a> ornithopod is known from several partial skeletons and skulls that indicate it grew to between 2.5 and 4.0 meters (8.2 to 13.1 ft) in length on average. It had sturdy hind limbs, small wide hands, and a head with an elongate pointed snout. The <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">form</a> of the teeth and jaws suggest a primarily herbivorous animal. This genus of dinosaur is regarded as a specialized <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> ornithopod, traditionally described as a <a href="hypsilophodont">hypsilophodont</a>, but more recently recognized as distinct from "<a href="Hypsilophodon">Hypsilophodon</a>". Several species have been suggested for this genus. Three currently are recognized as <a href="valid%20name%20%28zoology%29">valid</a>: the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "T. neglectus", "T. garbanii" and "T. assiniboiensis".

The genus attracted media attention in 2000, when a specimen unearthed in 1993 in <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>, United States, was interpreted as including a <a href="fossil">fossil</a>ized heart. There was much discussion over whether the remains were of a heart. Many scientists now doubt the identification of the object and the implications of such an identification.

The <a href="holotype">type specimen</a> of "Thescelosaurus" (<a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">USNM</a> 7757) was discovered in 1891 by <a href="paleontology">paleontologists</a> <a href="John%20Bell%20Hatcher">John Bell Hatcher</a> and William H. Utterback, from <a href="stratum">beds</a> of the <a href="Maastrichtian">late Maastrichtian</a>-age <a href="Upper%20Cretaceous">Upper Cretaceous</a> <a href="Lance%20Formation">Lance Formation</a> of <a href="Niobrara%20County%2C%20Wyoming">Niobrara County</a> (at the time part of <a href="Converse%20County%2C%20Wyoming">Converse County</a>), <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="United%20States">USA</a>. The skeleton, however, remained in its shipping crates for years until <a href="Charles%20W.%20Gilmore">Charles W. Gilmore</a> of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">National Museum of Natural History</a> had it prepared and described it in a short paper in 1913, naming it "T. neglectus" ("neglectus": "neglected"). At the time, he thought it was related to "<a href="Camptosaurus">Camptosaurus</a>". He provided a detailed <a href="monograph">monograph</a> in 1915, describing the well-preserved skeleton. The type specimen was found largely in natural articulation and was missing only the head and neck, which were lost due to <a href="erosion">erosion</a>. The name comes from the surprise Gilmore felt at finding such a good specimen that had been unattended to for so long. He considered it to be a light, agile creature, and assigned it to the Hypsilophodontidae, a family of small <a href="bipedalism">bipedal</a> dinosaurs.

Other remains of similar animals were found throughout the late 19th century and 20th century. Another well-preserved skeleton from the slightly older <a href="Horseshoe%20Canyon%20Formation">Horseshoe Canyon Formation</a>, in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, was named "T. warreni" by <a href="William%20Parks%20%28paleontologist%29">William Parks</a> in 1926. This skeleton had notable differences from "T. neglectus", and so <a href="Charles%20Mortram%20Sternberg">Charles M. Sternberg</a> placed it in a new genus, "Parksosaurus", in 1937. Sternberg also named an additional species, "T. edmontonensis", based on another articulated skeleton, this time including a partial skull (<a href="Canadian%20Museum%20of%20Nature">NMC</a> 8537), and drew attention to the genus' heavy build and thick bones. Due to these differences from the regular light hypsilophodont build, he suggested that the genus warranted its own <a href="Scientific%20classification">subfamily</a>, Thescelosaurinae. "T. edmontonensis" has, since Peter Galton's 1974 review, generally been considered a more robust individual (possibly the <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">opposite sex</a> of the type individual) of "T. neglectus". However, Boyd and colleagues found that they could not assign it to either of their valid species of "Thescelosaurus" and regarded the specimen as of <a href="incertae%20sedis">uncertain placement</a> within the genus. The other point of contention regarding "T. edmontonensis" is its ankle, which Galton claimed was damaged and misinterpreted, but which was regarded by William J. Morris (1976) as truly different from "T. neglectus".

In his paper, Morris described a specimen (<a href="South%20Dakota%20School%20of%20Mines%20and%20Technology">SDSM</a> 7210) consisting of a partial skull with heavy ridges on the lower jaw and cheek, four partial <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e, and two <a href="phalanx%20bones">finger bones</a> as an unidentified species of "Thescelosaurus", from the late Maastrichtian-age <a href="Hell%20Creek%20Formation">Hell Creek Formation</a> of <a href="Harding%20County%2C%20South%20Dakota">Harding County</a>, <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>, USA. He drew attention to its premaxillary teeth and deeply inset toothline which he interpreted as supporting the presence of muscular cheeks. Morris also pointed out the outwardly flaring premaxilla (which would have given it a wide beak) and large palpebrals. This skull was recognized as an unnamed hypsilophodont for many years, until Galton made it the type specimen of new genus and species "Bugenasaura infernalis" ("large-cheeked lizard belonging to the lower regions", "infernalis" being a reference to the Hell Creek Formation). Morris also named a new possible species of "Thescelosaurus" for specimen <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20of%20Los%20Angeles%20County">LACM</a> 33542: ?"T. garbanii" (with a question mark because he was uncertain that it belonged to the genus). LACM 33542 comprised a large partial hindlimb ("a third larger than described specimens of "T. neglectus" and "<a href="Parksosaurus">Parksosaurus</a>" or nearly twice as large as "<a href="Hypsilophodon">Hypsilophodon</a>"") including a foot, <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a>, shin bones, and partial thigh bone, along with five cervical (neck) and eleven dorsal (back) vertebrae, from the Hell Creek Formation of <a href="Garfield%20County%2C%20Montana">Garfield County</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, USA. The specimen was discovered by amateur <a href="paleontology">paleontologist</a> <a href="Harley%20Garbani">Harley Garbani</a>, hence the name. "T. garbanii" would have been about 4.5 meters (15 feet) long, greater than average specimens of "T. neglectus". Aside from the size, Morris drew attention to the way the ankle was constructed, which he considered to be unique except in comparison with "Thescelosaurus edmontonensis", which he regarded as a separate species. Because Morris believed that the ankles of "T. garbanii" compared favorably to those of "T. edmontonensis", he tentatively assigned it to "Thescelosaurus". However, the scientific literature has favored Galton's view that "T. edmontonensis" was not different from "T. neglectus" (see above). In the same paper that he described "Bugenasaura", Galton demonstrated that the features Morris had thought connected "T. garbanii" and "T. edmontonensis" were the result of damage to the latter's ankle, so "T. garbanii" could also be considered distinct from "Thescelosaurus". To better accommodate this species, Galton suggested that it belonged to his new genus "Bugenasaura" as "B. garbanii", although he also noted that it could be belong to the similarly sized <a href="Pachycephalosauria">pachycephalosaurid</a>" <a href="Stygimoloch">Stygimoloch</a>", or be part of a third, unknown dinosaur.
Clint Boyd and colleagues published a reassessment of "Thescelosaurus", "Bugenasaura", and "Parksosaurus" in 2009, using new cranial material as a starting point. They found that "Parksosaurus" was indeed distinct from "Thescelosaurus", and that the skull of "Bugenasaura infernalis" was essentially the same as a skull found with a postcranial skeleton that matched "Thescelosaurus". Because "B infernalis" could not be differentiated from "Thescelosaurus", they regarded the genus as a synonym of "Thescelosaurus", the species as <a href="nomen%20dubium">dubious</a>, and SDSM 7210 as an example of "T." sp. They found that LACM 33542, although fragmentary, was a specimen of "Thescelosaurus", and agreed with Morris that the ankle structure was distinct, returning it to "T. garbanii". Finally, they noted that another specimen, <a href="Royal%20Saskatchewan%20Museum">RSM</a> P.1225.1, differed from "T. neglectus" in some anatomical details, and may represent a new species. Thus, "Thescelosaurus" per Boyd et al. (2009) is represented by at least two, and possibly three valid species: type species "T. neglectus", "T. garbanii", and a possible unnamed species. In December <a href="2011%20in%20paleontology">2011</a>, RSM P.1225.1 was assigned to its own species, "Thescelosaurus assiniboiensis". It was named by Caleb M. Brown, Clint A. Boyd and Anthony P. Russell and is known only from its holotype, a small, articulated and almost complete skeleton from the <a href="Frenchman%20Formation">Frenchman Formation</a> (late Maastrichtian stage) of <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>.

Overall, the skeletal anatomy of this genus is well documented, and restorations have been published in several papers, including skeletal restorations and models. The skeleton is known well enough that a detailed reconstruction of the hip and hindlimb muscles has been made. The animal's size has been estimated in the 2.5–4.0 m range for length (8.2–13.1 ft) for various specimens, and a weight of 200–300 <a href="kilogram">kilogram</a>s (450–660 <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">pounds</a>), with the large <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> of "T. garbanii" estimated at 4–4.5 meters (13.1–14.8 feet) long. As discussed more fully under "<a href="%23Discovery%2C%20history%2C%20and%20species">Discovery, history, and species</a>", it may have been <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>, with one <a href="sex">sex</a> larger than the other. <a href="juvenile%20%28organism%29">Juvenile</a> remains are known from several locations, mostly based on teeth.

"Thescelosaurus" was a heavily built bipedal animal, probably herbivorous, but potentially not. There was a prominent ridge along the length of both <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>e (the tooth-bearing "cheek" bones), and a ridge on both <a href="dentary">dentaries</a> (tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw). The ridges and position of the teeth, deeply internal to the outside surface of the skull, are interpreted as evidence for muscular cheeks. Aside from the long narrow beak, the skull also had teeth in the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>, or upper beak (a primitive trait among ornithopods). Long rod-like bones called <a href="palpebral%20%28bone%29">palpebrals</a> were present over the eyes, giving the animal heavy bony eyebrows. Its teeth were of <a href="heterodont">two types</a>: small pointed premaxillary teeth, and leaf-shaped cheek teeth. Six small teeth were present in both premaxillae, with a toothless section at the tip of the beak.

Thescelosaurs had short, broad, five-fingered hands, four-toed feet with <a href="hoof">hoof</a>-like <a href="phalanx%20bones">toe tips</a>, and a long tail braced by <a href="ossification">ossified</a> <a href="tendon">tendon</a>s from the middle to the tip, which would have reduced the flexibility of the tail. The rib cage was broad, giving it a wide back, and the limbs were robust. The animals may have been able to move on <a href="quadruped">all fours</a>, given its fairly long arms and wide hands, but this idea has not been widely discussed in the scientific literature, although it does appear in popular works. <a href="Charles%20Mortram%20Sternberg">Charles M. Sternberg</a> reconstructed it with the <a href="humerus">upper arm</a> oriented almost perpendicular to the body, another idea that has gone by the wayside. As noted by <a href="Peter%20Galton">Peter Galton</a>, the upper arm bone of most ornithischians articulated with the shoulder by an articular surface that consisted of the entire end of the bone, instead of a distinct ball and socket as in mammals. The orientation of the shoulder's articular surface also indicates a vertical and not horizontal upper arm in dinosaurs.

Large thin flat mineralized plates have been found next to the ribs' sides. Their function is unknown; they may have played a role in <a href="respiration%20%28physiology%29">respiration</a>. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates that they may have started as <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their <a href="cerapoda">cerapoda</a>n relatives.

The nature of this genus' <a href="integument">integument</a>, be it scales or something else, is currently unknown, although potential evidence exists: <a href="Charles%20W.%20Gilmore">Charles Gilmore</a> described patches of <a href="carbon">carbon</a>ized material near the shoulders as possible <a href="epidermis%20%28skin%29">epidermis</a>, with a "punctured" texture, but no regular pattern, and William J. Morris suggested that <a href="armour%20%28zoology%29">armor</a> was present, in the form of small <a href="scute">scute</a>s he interpreted as located at least along the midline of the neck of one specimen. Scutes have not been found with other articulated specimens of "Thescelosaurus", though, and Morris's scutes could be <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>n in origin.

"Thescelosaurus" has generally been allied to "<a href="Hypsilophodon">Hypsilophodon</a>" and other small ornithopods as a <a href="hypsilophodont">hypsilophodont</a>id, although recognized as being distinct among them for its robust build, unusual hindlimbs, and, more recently, its unusually long skull. <a href="Peter%20Galton">Peter Galton</a> in 1974 presented one twist to the classic arrangement, suggesting that because of its hindlimb structure and heavy build (not <a href="cursorial">cursorial</a>, or built for running, by his definition), it should be included in the <a href="Iguanodont">Iguanodont</a>idae. This has not been followed, with Morris arguing strongly against Galton's classification scheme. At any rate, Galton's Iguanodontidae was <a href="polyphyly">polyphyletic</a> and not a natural group, and so would not be recognized under modern <a href="cladistic">cladistic</a> usage.

Although Hypsilophodontidae was interpreted as a natural group in the early 1990s, this hypothesis has fallen out of favor and Hypsilophodontidae has been found to be an unnatural family composed of a variety of animals more or less closely related to Iguanodontia (<a href="paraphyly">paraphyly</a>), with various small <a href="clade">clade</a>s of closely related taxa. "Hypsilophodontidae" and "hypsilophodont" are better understood as informal terms for an <a href="evolutionary%20grade">evolutionary grade</a>, not a true clade. "Thescelosaurus" has been regarded as both very basal and very <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> among the hypsilophodonts. One issue that has potentially interfered with classifying "Thescelosaurus" is that not all of the remains assigned to "T. neglectus" necessarily belong to it. Clint Boyd and colleagues found that while the clade "Thescelosaurus" included the genus "Bugenasaura" and the species that had been assigned to that genus, there were at least two and possibly three species within "Thescelosaurus", and several specimens previously assigned to "T. neglectus" could not yet be assigned to a species within the genus. It appears to be closely related to "<a href="Parksosaurus">Parksosaurus</a>".

The dissolution of Hypsilophodontidae has been followed by the recognition of the distinct family Thescelosauridae. This area of the dinosaur family tree has historically been complicated by a lack of research, but papers by Clint Boyd and colleagues and Caleb Brown and colleagues have specifically addressed these dinosaurs. Boyd "et al." (2009) and Brown "et al." (2011) found North American "hypsilophodonts" of Cretaceous age to sort into two related clusters, one consisting of "<a href="Orodromeus">Orodromeus</a>", "<a href="Oryctodromeus">Oryctodromeus</a>", and "<a href="Zephyrosaurus">Zephyrosaurus</a>", and the other consisting of "Parksosaurus" and "Thescelosaurus". Brown "et al." (2013) recovered similar results, with the addition of the new genus "<a href="Albertadromeus">Albertadromeus</a>" to the "Orodromeus" clade and several long-snouted Asian forms (previously described under <a href="Jeholosauridae">Jeholosauridae</a>) to the "Thescelosaurus" clade. They also formally defined Thescelosauridae ("Thescelosaurus neglectus", "Orodromeus makelai", their most recent common ancestor, and all descendants) and the smaller clades Orodrominae and Thescelosaurinae. The below <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> is that of Brown "et al.".

"Thescelosaurus" would have <a href="Herbivory">browsed</a> in the first meter or so from the ground, feeding selectively, with food held in the mouth by <a href="cheek">cheek</a>s while <a href="mastication">chewing</a>. "Thescelosaurus" was probably slower than other hypsilophodonts, because of its heavier build and leg structure. Compared to them, it had unusual hindlimbs, because the <a href="femur">upper leg</a> was longer than the <a href="tibia">shin</a>, the opposite of "<a href="Hypsilophodon">Hypsilophodon</a>" and running animals in general. One specimen is known to have had a bone <a href="pathology">pathology</a>, with the <a href="metatarsus">long bones</a> of the right foot fused at their tops, hindering swift movement.

In 2000, a skeleton of this genus (specimen NCSM 15728) informally known as "Willo", now on display at the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences</a>, was described as including the remnants of a four-chambered heart and an <a href="aorta">aorta</a>. It had been originally unearthed in 1993 in northwestern South Dakota. The authors had found the internal detail through <a href="computed%20tomography">computed tomography</a> (CT) imagery. They suggested that the heart had been <a href="saponification">saponified</a> (turned to <a href="adipocere">grave wax</a>) under <a href="wikt%3Aanaerobic">airless</a> burial conditions, and then changed to <a href="goethite">goethite</a>, an <a href="iron">iron mineral</a>, by replacement of the original material. The authors interpreted the structure of the heart as indicating an elevated <a href="metabolism">metabolic rate</a> for "Thescelosaurus", not <a href="reptile">reptilian</a> <a href="Poikilotherm">cold-bloodedness</a>.

Their conclusions have been disputed; soon after the initial description, other researchers published a paper where they asserted that the heart is really a <a href="concretion">concretion</a>. As they noted, the anatomy given for the object is incorrect (for example, the "aorta" narrows coming into the "heart" and lacks <a href="artery">arteries</a> coming from it), it partially engulfs one of the ribs and has an internal structure of concentric layers in some places, and another concretion is preserved behind the right leg. The original authors defended their position; they agreed that it was a type of concretion, but one that had formed around and partially preserved the more muscular portions of the heart and aorta.
A study published in 2011 applied multiple lines of inquiry to the question of the object's identity, including more advanced CT scanning, <a href="histology">histology</a>, <a href="X-ray%20scattering%20techniques">X-ray diffraction</a>, <a href="X-ray%20photoelectron%20spectroscopy">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</a>, and <a href="scanning%20electron">scanning electron</a> microscopy. From these methods, the authors found the following: the object's internal structure does not include chambers but is made up of three unconnected areas of lower density material, and is not comparable to the structure of an <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>'s heart; the "walls" are composed of <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> minerals not known to be produced in biological systems, such as goethite, <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a> minerals, <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, and <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a>, as well as some plant fragments; <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s important to life, were lacking in their samples; and cardiac cellular structures were absent. There was one possible patch with animal cellular structures. The authors found their data supported identification as a concretion of sand from the burial environment, not the heart, with the possibility that isolated areas of tissues were preserved.

The question of how this find reflects metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot, though, regardless of the object's identity. Both modern <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns and <a href="bird">bird</a>s, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well; the structure is not necessarily tied to metabolic rate.

True "Thescelosaurus" remains are known definitely only from late <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a>-age rocks, from Alberta (<a href="Scollard%20Formation">Scollard Formation</a>) and Saskatchewan (<a href="Frenchman%20Formation">Frenchman Formation</a>), Canada, and Wyoming (<a href="Lance%20Formation">Lance Formation</a>), South Dakota (<a href="Hell%20Creek%20Formation">Hell Creek Formation</a>), Montana (Hell Creek), and <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> (<a href="Laramie%20Formation">Laramie Formation</a>), USA. With the exception of birds, it was one of the last genera of dinosaurs, its remains being found as close as 3 meters to the boundary clay containing the <a href="iridium">iridium</a> layer that closes the Cretaceous. The Laramie Formation is the oldest formation that "Thescleosaurus" is known from, and <a href="magnetostratigraphy">magnetostratigraphy</a> suggests an age of 69-68 Ma for the Laramie Formation. There are reports of teeth from older, <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a>-age rocks, particularly from the <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> of Alberta, but these specimens are not from "Thescelosaurus" and are much more likely those of "<a href="Orodromeus">Orodromeus</a>". More specimens are known than have been officially described for this genus, such as the Triebold specimen, which has been the source of several skeletal <a href="casting">casts</a> for museums.

When Galton revisited "Thescelosaurus" and "Bugenasaura" in 1999, he described the dentary tooth <a href="University%20of%20California%20Museum%20of%20Paleontology">UCMP</a> 46911 from the <a href="Upper%20Jurassic">Upper Jurassic</a> of <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a>, <a href="England">England</a> as cf. "Bugenasaura". If it is indeed a tooth from a thescelosaur-like animal, this would significantly extend the <a href="stratigraphy">stratigraphic</a> range of the group.

Conflicting reports have been made as to its preferred <a href="habitat%20%28ecology%29">habitat</a>; two papers suggest it preferred <a href="river">channels</a> to <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s, but another suggests it preferred the opposite. The possible preference for channels is based on the relative abundance of thescelosaur fossils in <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>s, representing channel environments, in comparison to <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>s, representing floodplain environments. No <a href="bone%20bed">bonebeds</a> or accumulations of multiple individuals have yet been reported. <a href="Dale%20Russell">Dale Russell</a>, in a popular work, noted that "Thescelosaurus" was the most common small herbivore in the <a href="Hell%20Creek%20Formation">Hell Creek Formation</a> of the <a href="Fort%20Peck%2C%20Montana">Fort Peck</a> area. He described the environment of the time as a flat floodplain, with a relatively dry <a href="subtropics">subtropical</a> climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from <a href="flowering%20plant">angiosperm</a> trees, to <a href="Taxodium">bald cypress</a>, to <a href="fern">fern</a>s and <a href="ginkgo">ginkgo</a>s. Although most dinosaur skeletons from this area are incomplete, possibly due to the low preservation potential of forests, "Thescelosaurus" skeletons are much more complete, suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels. Thus when a "Thescelosaurus" died, it may have been in or near a river, making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization. Russell tentatively compared it to the <a href="capybara">capybara</a>s and <a href="tapir">tapir</a>s. Other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include the <a href="Ceratopsidae">ceratopsids</a> "<a href="Triceratops">Triceratops</a>" and "<a href="Torosaurus">Torosaurus</a>", hadrosaurid "<a href="Edmontosaurus">Edmontosaurus</a>", <a href="Ankylosauridae">ankylosaurid</a> "<a href="Ankylosaurus">Ankylosaurus</a>", <a href="pachycephalosauria">pachycephalosauria</a>n "<a href="Pachycephalosaurus">Pachycephalosaurus</a>", and the <a href="Theropoda">theropods</a> "<a href="Ornithomimus">Ornithomimus</a>", "<a href="Troodon">Troodon</a>", and "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>". "Thescelosaurus" was also abundant in the Lance Formation. Toe bones from this genus are the most common finds after fossils of "Triceratops" and "Edmontosaurus", and it may have been the most common dinosaur there in life, if the Lance Formation had a preservational bias against small animals.

Black Friday (1945)

On 9 February 1945, a force of Allied <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a> aircraft suffered many losses, during an attack on the German destroyer <a href="German%20destroyer%20Z33">"Z33"</a> and its escorting vessels; the operation was called "'Black Friday'" by the Allied survivors. The German ships were sheltering in a strong defensive position in <a href="F%C3%B8rde%20Fjord">Førde Fjord</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, forcing the Allied aircraft to attack through massed <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> fire.

The Beaufighters and their escort of <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">Mustang Mk III</a> fighters from 65 Squadron RAF, were intercepted by twelve <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20190">Focke-Wulf Fw 190</a>s of "<a href="Jagdgeschwader%205">Jagdgeschwader 5</a>" (Fighter Wing 5) of the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>". The Allies damaged at least two of the German ships for the loss of seven Beaufighters shot down by <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">flak guns</a>. Two Beaufighters and a Mustang were shot down by the Fw 190s and four or five of the FWs were shot down by the Allied aircraft, including that of the German ace <a href="Rudi%20Linz">Rudi Linz</a>.

The decision to attack "Z33" and her escorts, rather than a nearby group of merchant ships, followed instructions from the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> to <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">RAF Coastal Command</a>. The losses led to merchant ships being made the priority over destroyers and small warships. Another <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a> of P-51 Mustangs was assigned to protect Allied aircraft operating near Norway from German fighters.

Due to Allied victories in France and Eastern Europe, Germany's surface shipping was largely confined to the lower <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> and Norwegian waters by late 1944. This left ports in Norway as Germany's last remaining bases to continue the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a> and conduct trade with <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. When the Baltic iced over during the winter of 1944–45, Germany was forced to transport its vital imports of Swedish <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> from the port of <a href="Narvik">Narvik</a> in northern Norway.

In response to the growing importance of German maritime transport routes through Norwegian waters, the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force's</a> Coastal Command transferred seven squadrons of anti-shipping aircraft from bases in eastern <a href="England">England</a> to northern <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> during September and October 1944. Three squadrons equipped with <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">Mosquito</a> light bombers were stationed at <a href="RAF%20Banff">RAF Banff</a> while a <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wing</a> made up of four squadrons operating Beaufighter heavy fighters was based at <a href="RAF%20Dallachy">RAF Dallachy</a>. The Dallachy Wing comprised the British <a href="No.%20144%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 144 Squadron</a>, Canadian <a href="No.%20404%20Squadron%20RCAF">No. 404 Squadron</a>, Australian <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B455%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 455 Squadron</a> and New Zealand <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B489%20Squadron%20RNZAF">No. 489 Squadron</a>. These four squadrons were veterans of many anti-shipping operations over the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>.
Attacks by the Banff Wing quickly forced German ships travelling along the Norwegian coast to sail at night and take shelter in deep fjords during the day where they were very difficult to attack. In order to locate German ships the two wings sent out aircraft on almost daily patrols along the Norwegian coastline from the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> to <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>. During this period the Allied squadrons developed a tactic of sending two 'outriders' ahead of the main body of the patrol; these aircraft were manned by experienced aircrew and penetrated into fjords in search of shipping which might not be spotted by the other aircraft. By December 1944 patrols were also routinely escorted by RAF Mustang Mk III fighters and accompanied by <a href="Vickers%20Warwick">Vickers Warwick</a> air-sea rescue aircraft. Only a single squadron of Mustangs was available, however, as these long-ranged fighters were needed to escort daylight raids by <a href="heavy%20bombers">heavy bombers</a> against Germany. German fighters began to be encountered off the Norwegian coast in December, and from the end of the month onwards it was common for Allied wing-sized operations near Norway to be attacked by groups of up to 30 fighters. In March 1945 the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> had 85 single-engined and about 45 twin-engined aircraft operating from ten or twelve airfields south of Trondheim.

During the first weeks of 1945 the Allied strike wings flew few operations due to severe weather. On 15 January, the Banff Wing was intercepted by 30 Fw 190 fighters from the III. Gruppe of <a href="Jagdgeschwader%205">Jagdgeschwader 5</a> (III./JG 5) during a raid on the town of <a href="Leirvik">Leirvik</a>. In the resulting fighting five Mosquitos and five Fw 190s were shot down. By 9 February, the Ninth and Twelfth Squadrons of JG5 were based at <a href="Herdla">Herdla</a> near <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>, about to the south of Førde Fjord. These units were equipped with Fw 190s and the Twelfth Squadron was commanded by <a href="Second%20Lieutenant">Leutnant</a> <a href="Rudi%20Linz">Rudi Linz</a>, a 28-year-old flying ace with 69 'kills' to his credit.

The German "Z33" entered service in February 1943. She served in Norwegian waters from July of that year and saw combat on several occasions. She was the last German destroyer to leave northern Norway, and sailed for Germany on 5 February 1945. It was intended that <a href="German%20destroyer%20Z31">"Z31"</a>, which had completed initial repairs at Bergen after being heavily damaged in the <a href="Action%20of%2028%20January%201945">Action of 28 January 1945</a>, would join her to make a joint passage to the Baltic. However, "Z33" ran aground in Brufjord on 7 February, damaging her port shaft and propeller and causing both engines to fail. She was subsequently taken under tow to be repaired in Trondheim. "Z33" and the two <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s that were towing her chose to shelter in Førde Fjord during the daylight hours of 9 February while en route to Trondheim.

On the morning of 9 February, two New Zealand-crewed Beaufighters from No. 489 Squadron conducted a patrol of the Norwegian coast. These aircraft first sighted a 1,500-ton merchant ship in <a href="Stong%20Fjord">Stong Fjord</a>. Continuing north, they were surprised to find a "Narvik"-class destroyer accompanied by a <a href="minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweeper</a> and two <a href="flak%20ship">flak ship</a>s in <a href="F%C3%B8rde%20Fjord">Førde Fjord</a>. The aircraft continued their patrol and spotted five large merchant ships in the Nord Gulen and two minesweepers and a flak ship near <a href="Bremanger">Bremanger</a>. Despite the pilots' surprise, the Allied command was aware that "Z33" was in the area from <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> signals intelligence.

The Dallachy Wing was on alert to attack any ships found by the reconnaissance patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against "Z33" even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and in a difficult position for aircraft to attack.
Wing Commander Jack Davenport, who had commanded No. 455 Squadron until October 1944 and was now on the staff of <a href="No.%2018%20Group%20RAF">No. 18 Group RAF</a>, planned the attack on "Z33". The plan called for two 'outriders' to precede the main force and confirm the location of the German ships. The Beaufighters would then arrive to the east of the German anchorage, turn to the west and attack the ships before escaping over the sea. Davenport sought to minimise Allied casualties, but the location of the German ships in a narrow and protected fjord meant that the operation was inherently risky. The strike leader was Wing Commander Colin Milson, the 25-year-old commanding officer of No. 455 Squadron, and a veteran of anti-shipping operations against Italian and German ships in the Mediterranean and North Seas. Milson had reservations about making what was likely to be a costly raid, particularly given that the war was clearly coming to an end, but carried out the order to attack "Z33" to the best of his ability.

After being spotted, the German ships in Førde Fjord sailed further up the fjord and prepared for an Allied attack. "Z33" and several of her escorts anchored close to the steep southern slopes of the fjord near the village of <a href="Bj%C3%B8rkedal">Bjørkedal</a>. Meanwhile, other ships moored near the northern shore after breaking up pack ice with gunfire. This anchorage was also protected by flak batteries on the shore of the fjord.

At 1:30 pm on 9 February, Milson led 31 or 32 Beaufighters into the air from Dallachy. The strike force was joined by either ten or twelve P-51 Mustang fighters from <a href="No.%2065%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 65 Squadron RAF</a> and two <a href="Vickers%20Warwick">Warwick</a> <a href="air-sea%20rescue">air-sea rescue</a> aircraft from <a href="No.%20279%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 279 Squadron RAF</a> carrying life rafts to help any aircrew forced to ditch. All four of the Dallachy Wing's squadrons contributed aircraft to the force. The No. 404 and No. 455 Squadron Beaufighters were armed with <a href="RP-3">"60lb" rockets</a> while the aircraft from No. 144 Squadron and the single No. 489 Squadron Beaufighter dispatched were armed only with their four <a href="Hispano-Suiza%20HS.404">20 mm cannon</a> and six machine guns.
After the attackers crossed the Norwegian coastline at 3:40 pm, two Beaufighters from No. 144 and No. 489 Squadrons detached themselves from the main force and pressed ahead as outriders. The two 'outriders' crossed Førde Fjord near where the German ships had been sighted that morning. At 3:50 pm they sent Milson a radio message stating that they could not see the ships. The 'outriders' then turned to the east and overflew the town of <a href="F%C3%B8rde">Førde</a> before searching the next fjord to the north; during their flight near Førde Fjord they did not spot the German warships in their new position. Meanwhile, the Ninth and Twelfth Squadrons of JG5 were scrambled from Herdla at 3:50 pm and ordered to attack the Dallachy Wing and its escorts.

Several minutes later, the main body of the raid reached the southern shore of Førde Fjord travelling north. To their surprise, the Allied planes passed directly over the German ships and came under intense attack from anti-aircraft guns, though no aircraft were hit. In response, Milson wheeled his force to the right in an attempt to attack the ships from east to west as planned. The steep walls of the fjord protected "Z33" from attack from this direction, however. As a result, Milson led the force west to near the mouth of the fjord and ordered the Beaufighters to attack in relays from west to east. This required the aircraft to fly into the face of alerted German defences and then escape over steep mountains. The narrow confines of the fjord also meant that the Beaufighters had to attack individually from a single direction and would not be able to swamp the German defences as they normally sought to do.

Milson led the first group of Beaufighters into Førde Fjord at about 4:10 pm. His aircraft escaped undamaged after attacking a flak ship and other Beaufighters followed him into the fjord. At about this time 12 Fw 190s arrived at Førde Fjord and flew through German flak to intercept the Beaufighters that were waiting their turn to attack. The British Mustangs were taken by surprise, but dived to intercept the German fighters. This led to an intense air battle, with over 50 aircraft either engaged in <a href="dogfight">dogfight</a>s or diving to attack the German ships; it was the largest aerial conflict ever fought over Norway.

The fighting continued until 4:25 pm. By that time the German ships had shot down seven Beaufighters. Fw 190As had claimed another two Beaufighters and a Mustang III. The Allied losses included six of the eleven No. 404 Squadron aircraft involved in the attack. Overall, the Germans killed 14 Allied airmen and took four <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a>. The Allies damaged "Z33" and several of the other German ships and shot down either four or five Fw 190s. Linz and another German pilot were killed. "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" fatalities included four sailors on "Z33" and three on the converted <a href="Naval%20trawler">trawler</a> "VP6808"; both of these ships were damaged during the attack. There may also have been fatalities on the other German ships.

After departing the Førde Fjord area, the surviving Beaufighters, many of which were damaged, returned to RAF Dallachy. Several had difficulty making safe landings, and two were forced to land on their bellies due to <a href="Landing%20gear">undercarriage</a> damage, but no further aircraft were lost. The air and ground crew were shocked by the scale of the losses, and the battle became known as "Black Friday". The losses suffered by the Dallachy Wing on 9 February were the highest any of Coastal Command's strike wings sustained in a single operation during the war.

The German fighters, many of which were short of fuel and ammunition, also broke off at about 4:25 pm and returned to base. On the night of 9/10 February, the German ships left Førde Fjord and continued their journey to Trondheim. A subsequent Allied attack on the ships by a different strike wing was also unsuccessful. "Z33" arrived in Trondheim on 11 February and was repaired. She subsequently departed for Germany on 26 March and safely arrived in <a href="%C5%9Awinouj%C5%9Bcie">Swinemünde</a> on 2 April. She did not see any further combat, and was decommissioned at <a href="Brunsb%C3%BCttel">Brunsbüttel</a> in late April as the Navy lacked the fuel needed to operate her.

The losses incurred during the raid on Førde Fjord led to changes in the tactics used by RAF Coastal Command's anti-shipping squadrons. Following the attack, the Admiralty agreed to a proposal by Air Chief Marshal Sir <a href="Sholto%20Douglas%2C%201st%20Baron%20Douglas%20of%20Kirtleside">Sholto Douglas</a>, the commander of Coastal Command, to assign a higher priority to attacking merchant vessels than to destroyers and small warships. A second squadron of Mustangs was also assigned to protect Coastal Command aircraft operating near Norway from early March. Milson was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> on 13 July 1945 for his leadership and personal courage during the raid on Førde Fjord, which was described in the citation as a "brilliantly executed operation".

The raid was commemorated in Norway after the war. A monument to the aircrew killed in the battle was dedicated in the town of Førde on 8 May 1985, the 40th anniversary of Norway's liberation. This monument was later moved to <a href="Bergen%20Airport%2C%20Flesland">Bergen Airport</a>. The Air Combat Museum in the town of <a href="Naustdal">Naustdal</a> also houses photos, maps, aircraft parts and other artifacts relating to the battle.
Two of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters of JG 5 that flew against the RAF Beaufighters and Mustangs survive to this day — one, an F-model airframe with factory serial number, or "Werknummer" of 931 862, that crashed as a result of the "Black Friday" aerial engagements was found and recovered as a salvageable aircraft wreck in September 1983. It currently resides in <a href="Stow%2C%20Massachusetts">Stow, Massachusetts</a>, and had been under restoration by the "White 1 Foundation" of <a href="Kissimmee%2C%20Florida">Kissimmee, Florida</a> towards a resumption of full flightworthy status, until its 2012 transfer to the <a href="Collings%20Foundation">Collings Foundation</a>'s facilities in the Bay State to complete the work towards full flightworthy status. While still in Florida, in 2005 its last pilot, the former "Luftwaffe" "<a href="Unteroffizier">Unteroffizier</a>" Heinz Orlowski visited it and sat one final time in the cockpit of his "under-restoration" Fw 190F-8, some sixty years after he last flew it and five years before his death in 2010. The other example, an Fw 190A-8 bearing the "Werknummer" 732 183 was flown by Luftwaffe 70-victory ace <a href="Rudi%20Linz">Rudi Linz</a> in the engagement. His Fw 190A-8 is displayed in the Cottbus Hangar of the <a href="Military%20Aviation%20Museum">Military Aviation Museum</a> in <a href="Pungo%2C%20Virginia">Pungo, Virginia</a>, United States as of 2014.

The locations of several of the Beaufighter planes—gravesites—were found by marine archeologist <a href="Rob%20Rondeau">Rob Rondeau</a> and diving crew 60 years later. One site was given a commemorative plaque, in the presence of one surviving Canadian airman, Herbert (Bert) Ramsden, who participated in the action, and a sister of an airman who died there.

U.S. Route 41 Business (Marquette, Michigan)

Business US Highway 41 (Bus. US 41) was a <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> that served as a <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a> off <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Michigan">US 41</a> and <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a> in <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette, Michigan</a>, along Washington and Front streets. The streets serve the <a href="central%20business%20district">downtown area</a> of Marquette and are bordered by several commercial properties and businesses. Those two streets originate with the early founding of the city in the middle of the 19th century. Jurisdiction over them was transferred to the city as part of a highway swap that resulted in the <a href="decommissioned%20highway">decommissioning</a> of the trunkline in 2005. It was also previously co-designated Bus. M-28, mirroring the Bus. US 41/Bus. M-28 designation previously used along <a href="M-28%20Business%20%28Ishpeming%E2%80%93Negaunee%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. M-28</a> in <a href="Ishpeming%2C%20Michigan">Ishpeming</a> and <a href="Negaunee%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee</a>.

The business loop designation dates back to the 1960s and was removed in 2005.

The western terminus of Bus. US 41 was the west end of Washington Street at the intersection with US 41/M-28 near the western Marquette city limits. The intersection features a stoplight to allow traffic from eastbound US 41/M-28 to cross the westbound lanes of the main highway to access Washington Street; the remaining connections are made through stop-sign-controlled access lanes. Running eastward, Washington Street is four lanes, divided by a center median for about before a center turn lane replaces the median. The street is bordered by several commercial developments. There is a stoplight for the intersection with McClellan Avenue as the business loop runs uphill toward downtown. A few blocks east past other businesses and restaurants, Washington intersects the southern end of Lincoln Avenue at another stoplight. East of this junction, the roadway narrows to one lane in each direction with a center turn lane. Washington Street turns to the southeast and heads downhill in the next block, which is bordered by some houses on the north side. The turn lane drops by Seventh Street as the street passes Harlow Park.
From the park east, the business loop entered the <a href="central%20business%20district">downtown area</a>. Each side of the street is bordered by retail shops, restaurants and other service providers. Washington Street passes the federal building containing the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">post office</a> and <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Western%20District%20of%20Michigan">federal courthouse</a> at the intersection with Third Street. At Front Street, Bus. US 41 turned south one block away from <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>; Front Street is also a commercial section of downtown. The street passes Father Marquette Park which is named for the city's namesake, <a href="Jacques%20Marquette">Jacques Marquette</a>. The roadway climbs a hill headed southbound next to the park. Bus. US 41 ended where US 41 turns south along Front Street at the east end of the Marquette Bypass.
At the time the business loop was still under state control, it was maintained by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) as a segment of the State Trunkline Highway System. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracked the volume of traffic that used Bus. US 41. These volumes were expressed using a metric called <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a>, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. In the department's last survey, conducted in 2004, there were 10,272 vehicles per day using Washington Street between Lincoln Avenue and Front Street, the lowest traffic count for the trunkline. The highest volume was 19,036 vehicles between McClellan and Lincoln Avenues, while the Front Street section received 16,309 vehicles on an average day. The former business loop has not been listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.

Marquette's founding settlers arrived in the area on May 18, 1849, to establish the community, and the original thoroughfares were platted by 1855, including Washington and Front streets. The widest street in the city at , Baraga Avenue was intended to be the Marquette's main street when the downtown area was originally laid out, but businesses centered their locations along Washington Street instead. The community was incorporated as a village in 1859, and it was later reincorporated as a city on February 21, 1871. The <a href="Marquette%20City%20Hall">original city hall</a> was built in 1895 on Washington Street, and in 1910, the city started paving its streets, replacing <a href="plank%20road">wooden planks</a> with <a href="Asphalt%20concrete">asphalt</a>.
A state highway was routed through downtown starting on May 13, 1913, when the system was created. It was first a part of <a href="M-15%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-15</a> when the highway system was signed in 1919, and then later as US 41/M-28 after the creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> in 1926. (Under the original 1925 draft plan for the U.S. Highway System, <a href="U.S.%20Route%20102">US 102</a> was the number assigned to run through Marquette.) The streets have been paved since at least the 1920s.

The Marquette Bypass opened on November 21, 1963, and the business loop was marked for the first time on the 1964 state highway map. A Bus. M-28 designation was added to the route for the 1975 state map, marking it similar to the Bus. US 41/Bus. M-28 designation that was previously assigned along <a href="M-28%20Business%20%28Ishpeming%E2%80%93Negaunee%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. M-28</a> in <a href="Ishpeming%2C%20Michigan">Ishpeming</a> and <a href="Negaunee%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee</a>. This second designation was removed by 1981.

In April 2005, the City of Marquette agreed to exchange jurisdiction over a number of roadways with MDOT. These transfers placed Bus. US 41 and the unsigned <a href="M-554%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-554</a> under city jurisdiction; at the same time, the state would take over a section of McClellan Avenue to extend <a href="M-553%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-553</a> to its current northern terminus at the Marquette Bypass. Negotiations regarding the transfer centered on MDOT deferring to city zoning ordinances along McClellan Avenue regarding driveway and snowmobile access and the city's assumption of expenses and liabilities related to the business loop. The transfers were made official on October 10, 2005, when MDOT and the city finalized the paperwork. As a result, Bus. US 41 was decommissioned when the city took control over Washington and Front streets; signage was removed on November 9, 2005, to complete the process. Some local maps continue to label Bus. US 41 through downtown Marquette, even years after the decommissioning of the designation, and some local businesses and organizations still use it in their advertising.
Marquette received $2.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) in state funding for improvements to Washington Street near downtown as a part of the transfer agreement. The city also assumed responsibility for maintaining the stoplights installed along the former highway. These improvements rebuilt Washington Street from 5th Street westward during 2007. The roadway was narrowed from four lanes to two with a center turn lane between Lincoln Avenue and 7th Street. The speed limit was reduced from along the street to deal with the traffic that turns into and out of businesses. In 2010, the intersection between Front Street and the eastern end of the Marquette Bypass was converted into a <a href="roundabout">roundabout</a> configuration, opening to traffic on August 19.

1st Provisional Marine Brigade

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was a <a href="Marine%20%28military%29">Marine</a> <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="brigade">brigade</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> (USMC) that existed periodically from 1912 to 1950. It was an <a href="ad%20hoc">ad hoc</a> unit formed for specific operations and not considered a "permanent" USMC unit.

The brigade saw five brief activations for service over a 40-year span. First created for duty in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> following the <a href="Negro%20Rebellion">Negro Rebellion</a>, the brigade was not activated again until 1941 when it was hastily constructed from the <a href="6th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">6th Marine Regiment</a> to garrison <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> after the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Iceland">occupation of that country</a> by British troops during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The brigade saw service once more in the war during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guam%20%281944%29">Battle of Guam</a> in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, conducting an <a href="amphibious%20landing">amphibious landing</a> on that island's southern sector and subduing resistance from <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> troops. It was activated once more in a brief organizational shift after the war.

The brigade was formed again in 1950 when it was hastily assembled for service in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. The brigade participated in a <a href="Battle%20of%20Masan">counterattack at Masan</a> before reinforcing <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> units during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pusan%20Perimeter">Battle of Pusan Perimeter</a>, and at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Naktong%20Bulge">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Naktong%20Bulge">Second</a> Battles of Naktong Bulge along the <a href="Naktong%20River">Naktong River</a>. The brigade was deactivated for the last time when it was merged with the <a href="US%201st%20Marine%20Division">1st Marine Division</a>.

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade varied in size and structure each time it was created. <a href="Headquarters%20and%20Service%20Company">Headquarters and Service Company</a>, the company comprising the headquarters staff and support personnel, was much smaller than the equivalent company in <a href="Marine%20Expeditionary%20Brigade">standard Marine brigades</a>. Each iteration of the brigade was assigned provisional <a href="military%20police">military police</a>, signal and other supporting <a href="company%20%28military%29">companies</a> and <a href="platoon">platoon</a>s. This was not an uncommon practice for the U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly in wartime. During World War II two other provisional Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.

Component units varied considerably as well. In its first iteration in 1912, the brigade had only 1,200 men in two provisional <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s. When re-formed for duty in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> in 1941, it was based around volunteers from the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Marine Division</a>. Volunteers from the division were moved into the <a href="6th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">6th Marine Regiment</a>'s <a href="1st%20Battalion%206th%20Marines">1st</a>, <a href="2nd%20Battalion%206th%20Marines">2nd</a> and <a href="3rd%20Battalion%206th%20Marines">3rd Battalions</a>, and the <a href="10th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">10th Marine Regiment</a>'s <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2010th%20Marines">2nd Battalion</a>. It took 4,095 men from A Company of the <a href="2nd%20Tank%20Battalion">2nd Tank Battalion</a>, A Company of the <a href="2nd%20Service%20Battalion">2nd Service Battalion</a>, and parachute and antitank platoons. For the Iceland deployment, the 5th <a href="Marine%20defense%20battalions">Marine Defense Battalion</a> was attached. In its 1944 iteration, the brigade was far larger than a standard brigade, 9,886 men, formed around the <a href="4th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">4th Marine Regiment</a> and the <a href="22nd%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">22nd Marine Regiment</a>, with provisional headquarters, military police, and signal companies and a provisional battalion of artillery. The 53rd Naval Construction Battalion was also assigned.(see: <a href="Seabees">Seabees</a>)

The brigade's <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> organization was a 4,725-man force based around the <a href="5th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th Marine Regiment</a> and supported by <a href="Marine%20Aircraft%20Group%2033">Marine Aircraft Group 33</a>, including military police, reconnaissance and intelligence companies. The attack force included the <a href="1st%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">1st Battalion</a>, <a href="2nd%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">2nd Battalion</a> and <a href="3rd%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">3rd Battalion</a> of the <a href="5th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th Marine Regiment</a> as well as supporting companies from the <a href="1st%20Combat%20Engineer%20Battalion">1st Combat Engineer Battalion</a>, <a href="1st%20Medical%20Battalion">1st Medical Battalion</a>, 1st Motor Transport Battalion, 1st Ordnance Battalion, 1st Service Battalion, 1st Shore Party Battalion, 1st Signal Battalion, <a href="1st%20Tank%20Battalion">1st Tank Battalion</a>, 1st Amphibian Tractor Company, and <a href="1st%20Marine%20Logistics%20Group">1st Combat Service Group</a>.

In each of its iterations, the brigade was not organized as a permanent formation. Typically it was created only as a temporary front-line unit while larger United States Marine units were formed. The brigade would then merge with these to form a Marine <a href="division%20%28military%29">division</a>. The 1942 brigade merged with the 2nd Marine Division, the 1944 brigade was the basis for the formation of the new <a href="6th%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">6th Marine Division</a>, and the 1950 brigade acted as an advance force for the newly reactivated <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a> before merging into that unit.

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was first created in 1912 for occupation duties in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. Earlier that year, the <a href="Negro%20Rebellion">Negro Rebellion</a> had erupted throughout Cuba among former <a href="black%20slaves">black slaves</a>. A 1st Provisional Marine Regiment of 450 men under <a href="US%20Colonel">Colonel</a> Lincoln Karmany was assembled in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, on 22 May. At the same time, a 2nd Provisional Marine Regiment of 750 men under Colonel James Mahoney assembled at <a href="Key%20West%2C%20Florida">Key West, Florida</a>. The two regiments sailed for Cuba aboard the <a href="USS%20Prairie%20%28AD-5%29">USS "Prairie"</a>, with 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment, landing at <a href="Havana">Havana</a> and the remainder of the force at <a href="Guantanamo">Guantanamo</a>. There they combined to form the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in early June under Karmany, and the United States Marines fanned out in <a href="Oriente%20Province">Oriente Province</a>, occupying 26 towns and controlling all rail traffic in the area. The Marines protected United States <a href="sugar%20plantation">sugar plantation</a>s in <a href="Siboney%2C%20Cuba">Siboney</a> and El Cobre until late July when the Cuban government was able to clamp down on the revolt. At that point, the Marines pulled back to Guantanamo, disbanded the brigade and returned home.

A second <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%23Pre-World%20War%20II">"1st Marine Brigade"</a> was created in 1935, serving in Cuba in 1940, before being expanded and redesignated as the 1st Marine Division in 1941. This brigade was originally created in 1913 as the <a href="Advanced%20Base%20Force%23Organization">1st Advance Force Brigade</a>. However, the 1st Advance Force Brigade, and its descendents, was not considered a "provisional" unit. The brigade served in Puerto Rico and Mexico in 1914, as well as in the Dominican Republic (1916), and maintained a permanent establishment in Haiti from 1915 until its deactivation in 1934. It was reactivated in 1935 as the 1st Brigade before redesignation as the 1st Marine Brigade. The 1935 vintage 1st Marine Brigade was considered a separate unit and it has no lineal relationship to the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. Additionally, yet a third <a href="1st%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Brigade%20%28United%20States%29">"1st Marine Brigade"</a> was created in 1956, later becoming the 1st Marine Amphibious Brigade in 1985 and the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade (1st MEB) in 1988. The 1st MEB is also a separate organization for purposes of lineage and shares no historical relationship with the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade.

In May 1940, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> initiated an invasion of <a href="Neutrality%20%28international%20relations%29">politically neutral</a> <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, fearing it would otherwise fall to the forces of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> which had recently <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">conquered Denmark</a>. Iceland's indigenous population was generally opposed to the British occupation, instead preferring troops of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, which was <a href="Neutrality%20Acts%20of%201930s">neutral</a> at that phase in the war. Iceland signed a defense agreement with the United States in which United States troops would be stationed on the island nation. The <a href="U.S.%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> hastily assembled the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, to move to Iceland as part of the agreement. The brigade was first activated on 14 July 1941. Its elements were taken from the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Marine Division</a>, which was training at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20San%20Diego">Marine Corps Base San Diego</a> and <a href="Camp%20Elliott">Camp Elliott</a>, both in <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a>. This brought the force up to a strength of 4,095 men. They were the first of 28,000 men occupying Iceland under <a href="US%20Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Holland%20M.%20Smith">Holland M. Smith</a> and his <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a>. While the 1st Marine Division was building its forces, though, the Provisional Brigade would hold Iceland. However, priorities soon changed and the 1st Marine Division was moved elsewhere. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was instead joined by units of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>.

Under the command of <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="John%20Marston%20%28USMC%29">John Marston</a> and Colonel <a href="Leo%20D.%20Hermle">Leo D. Hermle</a>, the brigade sailed from San Diego to Charleston aboard the <a href="attack%20transport">attack transport</a>s , , and . There, they met with additional ships which sailed with their supplies as well as the remaining elements of the brigade, the <a href="Marine%20defense%20battalions">5th Defense Battalion</a>. These elements were joined by the , , and on 27 June. They were escorted by Task Force 19, a fleet of 25 <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> warships including the <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s and as well as the <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and . The force stopped at <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, before continuing to Iceland, landing in <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a> on 7 July. There they relieved the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> <a href="49th%20%28West%20Riding%29%20Infantry%20Division">49th (West Riding) Infantry Division</a> of control of some areas of the country, while the British continued to administer the remainder.

The British commanders distributed the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade throughout camps around the Reykjavik area, to act as an emergency force which could quickly counter any German invasion. The British gave their division patch to the brigade, and it was worn for the remainder of the Marines' time in Iceland. The Marines were joined by units of the U.S. Army and <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">Army Air Corps</a> in August 1941. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade troops spent much of their time in Iceland building infrastructure and bases to fortify Iceland against potential German attack. On 22 September, the British division departed Iceland and command was assumed by the United States Army. During the winter of 1941–1942 the brigade saw no combat and spent much of its time attempting to construct fortifications and drill for combat, hampered by a lack of supplies, communications equipment, transportation, and good weather. Aside from the occasional German reconnaissance aircraft, no German forces came to Iceland.

Following the 7 December <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, the men were informed they would be redeployed from Iceland at the beginning of 1942 and would likely see combat in the <a href="Pacific%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Pacific Theatre</a>. In January 1942, the brigade began deploying back to the United States, one battalion at a time. Elements of the brigade were gradually relieved by Army units and returned to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> aboard the <a href="USS%20McCawley%20%28APA-4%29">USS "McCawley"</a> and the <a href="Borinquen%20%281931%29">US Army Transport "Borinquen"</a> until March 1942, when the entire brigade was in New York. The brigade was disbanded in New York City on 25 March 1942, and its component elements were reassigned to the 2nd Marine Division. Most of them were immediately dispatched to <a href="California">California</a> and by the end of the year most of the Marines had been transferred to units fighting in the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>.

On 18 April 1944, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was again activated, this time at <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>, and placed in <a href="military%20reserve">reserve</a> for a time, commanded by Brigadier General <a href="Lemuel%20C.%20Shepherd">Lemuel C. Shepherd</a>. In July, it was moved to the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> for a planned <a href="Battle%20of%20Guam%20%281944%29">invasion of Guam</a>, an island under the control of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>. This much larger brigade was built around the 4th and 22nd Marine Regiments with supporting units, and comprised 9,886 Marines. The brigade was assigned to <a href="III%20Amphibious%20Corps">III Amphibious Corps</a>, a force almost 67,000 strong, in anticipation of a 15 July invasion of <a href="Guam">Guam</a>'s southern beaches, in conjunction with a northern landing by the Army's 4,500-man <a href="305th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">305th Infantry Regiment</a>, <a href="77th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">77th Infantry Division</a>. The brigade commenced training at Guadalcanal in conjunction with the <a href="3rd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">3rd Marine Division</a>. Then, in early July, the two formations staged through the <a href="Eniwetok%20Atoll">Eniwetok Atoll</a> in preparation for the invasion.

On 21 July at 08:32 the 22nd Marines landed on beaches around <a href="Agat%2C%20Guam">Agat</a> while the 4th Marines landed at Bangi Point to the north. Opposing the U.S. landings were 22,000 Japanese troops stationed on the island. The most intense fighting struck the other units of III Amphibious Corps to the north, which held through heavy Japanese counterattacks. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade encountered lighter resistance on the southern beaches, but nonetheless fought a substantial Japanese force occupying <a href="Agat%20Bay">Gaan Point</a>, between the two regiments' landing zones. Japanese defenders had built fortifications into the point, including <a href="Type%2041%2075%20mm%20Mountain%20Gun">Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun</a>s which had gone undetected in U.S. reconnaissance probes, using them to pin down 20 <a href="Landing%20Vehicle%20Tracked">amphibious vehicles</a> supporting the 22nd Marines and slow their advance. The 22nd Marines subsequently spent most of the day capturing the point against stiff Japanese resistance. Their <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%2022nd%20Marines">1st Battalion</a> was eventually able to capture Agat, and the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%2022nd%20Marines">2nd Battalion</a> took <a href="Mount%20Alifan">Mount Alifan</a>, inland. In the meantime, the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%204th%20Marines">1st Battalion of the 4th Marines</a> took Bangi point with support from their <a href="3/4%20Marines">3rd Battalion</a>. They then began an advance to Mount Alifan but were delayed by fierce Japanese resistance inland. At nightfall the Japanese mounted a large, coordinated counterattack which was unsuccessful. By the end of the day, the 4th and 22nd Marines were holding positions into the island along a front. The 305th Regimental Combat Team supported the Marines for several days before rejoining the rest of the 77th Infantry Division to the north. The 1st Brigade was south of the 3rd Marine Division and 77th Infantry Division landing zones to the north at <a href="Asan%2C%20Guam">Asan</a>. On 25 July, the two forces cut off <a href="Orote%20Peninsula">Orote Peninsula</a> between the two landing zones, and the brigade turned west and cleared the peninsula until 29 July against heavier resistance, killing some 2,500 Japanese. It advanced north in a sweeping motion with the 4th Marines on the right, west flank and the 22nd Marines on the left, east flank, until reaching the forces on the northern beach landings.

By 28 July, the 3rd Marine Division and 77th Infantry Division had formed a continuous flank and were advancing north. On 6 August, the brigade joined them on the left, western flank. Here, Japanese forces staged <a href="last%20stand">last stand</a>s in their remaining fortifications, and holdouts on Mount Santa Rosa were cleared on 8 August, <a href="Ritidian%20Point">Ritidian Point</a> on August 10, and <a href="Pati%20Point">Pati Point</a> the same day. The island was declared "officially" secure at 11:31 on 10 August, after 11,000 Japanese dead had been counted. However, thousands of Japanese troops fled to the woods of Guam after the fight, and mop-up operations continued long after the island was declared secure. By <a href="V-J%20Day">V-J Day</a>, the island had cost the Japanese 18,400 killed and 1,250 captured, and the Americans 1,700 killed and 6,000 injured. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, however, only assisted in mop-up operations for a month. The 4th Marines moved along the north coast while the 22nd Marines patrolled inland to the south.

On 9 September 1944, the brigade was disbanded and its elements were moved to Guadalcanal where the new <a href="6th%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">6th Marine Division</a> was forming. That division was activated on 25 September 1944. Most of the Provisional Marine Brigade units were transferred to the command of the 6th Marine Division. The <a href="29th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">29th Marine Regiment</a> was added to form the division. The 53rd CB was the directly assigned to III Amphibious Corps.

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was briefly re-formed in the <a href="post-war">post-war</a> era on 1 June 1947, by enlarging the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%2011th%20Marines">1st Battalion, 11th Marines</a>. The force served as a contingency force for the Pacific Ocean area, based in Camp Witek, Guam. However, as post-war military spending was drastically cut, the brigade at this time was far undermanned, and considered only a "paper unit". It was again "downsized" and re-designated the 1st Provisional Artillery Battalion on 1 October 1947.

The U.S. Marine Corps, which had been drastically reduced in size after World War II, was unprepared at the outset of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> on 25 June 1950. The <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> ordered the Marine Corps to ready a 15,000-man division for duty in Korea as a part of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Command%20%28Korea%29">United Nations Command</a> being created there. The Marine Corps began rebuilding the 1st Marine Division to wartime strength, but in the meantime assembled a 4,725-man force around the <a href="5th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th Marine Regiment</a> to assist in the war effort as quickly as possible. On 7 July the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was reactivated in California. One week later it sailed from <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a> and <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego</a>. The regiment, which had originally been slated for landing in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, bypassed that country and landed at <a href="Pusan">Pusan</a> in <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> on 3 August. As it sailed to Korea, it was put under the command of Brigadier General <a href="Edward%20A.%20Craig">Edward A. Craig</a>, who met the brigade in-country. The brigade was supported by <a href="Marine%20Aircraft%20Group%2033">Marine Aircraft Group 33</a>, and became a subordinate unit of the <a href="Eighth%20United%20States%20Army">Eighth United States Army</a> under <a href="US%20Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Walton%20Walker">Walton Walker</a>, who placed it in his <a href="Military%20reserve">reserve</a>.

The brigade was immediately moved to <a href="Masan">Masan</a>, the westernmost flank of the <a href="Pusan%20Perimeter">Pusan Perimeter</a>, which the Eighth Army had set up to resist the <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>n <a href="North%20Korean%20Army">Army</a> which was attempting to overrun the UN forces. The brigade joined the <a href="25th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 25th Infantry Division</a> and the <a href="US%205th%20Regimental%20Combat%20Team">5th Regimental Combat Team</a>, under Major General <a href="William%20B.%20Kean">William B. Kean</a>. The three units together formed "Task Force Kean", a formation of about 20,000 men.

General Walker and the Eighth Army began preparing a counteroffensive, the first conducted by the UN in the war, for 6 August. It would kick off with an attack by the U.S. reserve units on the Masan area to secure <a href="Chinju">Chinju</a> from the <a href="North%20Korean%206th%20Division">North Korean 6th Division</a>, followed by a larger general push to the <a href="Kum%20River">Kum River</a> in the middle of the month. One of Walker's goals was to break up a suspected massing of North Korean troops near Taegu by forcing the diversion of some North Korean units southward. On 6 August, the Eighth Army issued the operational directive for the attack by the task force. The plan of attack was to move west from positions held near Masan, seize the Chinju Pass, and secure the line as far as the Nam River, and depended on the arrival of the entire <a href="US%202nd%20Infantry%20Division">U.S. 2nd Infantry Division</a>, as well as three more battalions of American tanks which were en route from the United States.

Task Force Kean kicked off its attack on 7 August, moving out from Masan. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade surged forward to <a href="Pansong">Pansong</a>, quickly inflicting 350 casualties on the North Koreans as it overran the North Korean 6th Division's headquarters. The other units of the Task Force, however, were slowed by North Korean resistance. Task Force Kean pressed on the <a href="Chindong-ni">Chindong-ni</a> area, resulting in a confused battle where the fragmented force had to rely on <a href="air%20strike">air strike</a>s and airdrops to keep it effective. Task Force Kean's offensive had collided with one being delivered simultaneously by the North Korean <a href="6th%20Division%20%28North%20Korea%29">6th Division</a>.

Heavy fighting continued in the area for three days. By 9 August, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju. The task force, aided by air power, initially advanced quickly though North Korean resistance was heavy. On 10 August, the Marines picked up the advance, inadvertently encountering the <a href="83rd%20Motorized%20Regiment%20%28North%20Korea%29">North Korean 83rd Motorized Regiment</a> of the 105th Armored Division, which was caught off-guard and attempted to withdraw. <a href="F4U%20Corsair">F4U Corsair</a>s from the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Aircraft%20Wing">1st Marine Aircraft Wing</a> strafed the retreating column repeatedly, inflicting 200 casualties and destroying about 100 of the regiment's equipment vehicles, but 1st Provisional Marine Brigade forces were not able to follow up the attack, as they were redeployed elsewhere on the perimeter on 12 August. Task Force Kean continued forward, supported by field artillery, capturing the area around Chondong-ni. At that time, Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to <a href="Taegu">Taegu</a> to be used elsewhere on the front, particularly at the Naktong Bulge.

At the end of the counteroffensive on 14 August, Task Force Kean had failed in its two objectives of diverting North Korean troops from the north and reaching the Chinju pass. The NK 6th Division had been reduced to 3,000 or 4,000 and had to replenish its ranks with South Korean conscripts from <a href="Andong">Andong</a>. Fighting in the region continued for the rest of the month.

Immediately north on the line, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was desperately needed to break a stalemate between the <a href="U.S.%2024th%20Infantry%20Division">U.S. 24th Infantry Division</a> and the <a href="NK%204th%20Division">NK 4th Division</a>. Beginning at midnight on the night of 5–6 August, North Koreans had begun crossing the <a href="Naktong%20River">Naktong River</a> at the Ohang ferry site, south of Pugong-ni and west of <a href="Yongsan">Yongsan</a>, carrying light weapons and supplies over their heads or on rafts. At 02:00 on the morning of 6 August, the North Koreans began engaging the 3rd Battalion, <a href="34th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 34th Infantry Regiment</a>, and moved forward after a short fight, attempting to penetrate the lines to Yongsan. The North Korean infantry forced the 3rd Battalion back, and the battalion abandoned its command post to consolidate its positions. The North Koreans surprised the Americans, who had been expecting an attack from further north, and captured a large amount of American equipment. The attack threatened to split the American lines and disrupt supply lines to the north.

Repeated American attacks resulted in a stalemate. By the morning of 7 August, North Koreans were able to press forward and capture the Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By 16:00 that day, the <a href="9th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment</a>, U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, a newly arrived unit, was sent to the region. 24th Infantry Division commander Major General <a href="John%20H.%20Church">John H. Church</a> immediately ordered it to attack the Naktong Bulge <a href="Salients%2C%20re-entrants%20and%20pockets">salient</a>. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.
The NK 4th Division had in the meantime constructed underwater bridges of sandbags, logs and rocks, finishing the first one the day before. It moved trucks and heavy artillery across the river over this bridge, as well as additional infantry and a few tanks. By the morning of 10 August close to two full North Korean regiments were across the river and occupying fortified positions. After a series of unsuccessful counterattacks, the threat to Yongsan necessitated more U.S. reinforcements. As U.S. casualties mounted, a frustrated Walker ordered the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the area. They mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni beginning at 08:00 on 17 August, unleashing all available heavy weapons: artillery, mortars, <a href="M26%20Pershing">M26 Pershing</a> tanks, and airstrikes.
At first, tenacious North Korean defense halted the Marines. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans out of their positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from U.S. tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, and they had to withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's previously successful tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise failed in the face of massive U.S. numerical superiority.

By nightfall on 18 August, the North Korean 4th Division had been annihilated; huge numbers of deserters had weakened its numbers during the fight, but by that time, Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by the U.S. forces. Scattered groups of North Korean soldiers fled back across the Naktong, pursued by American planes and artillery fire. The next day, the remains of 4th Division had withdrawn across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left a large number of artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans later pressed into service.

The battle caused heavy casualties for both sides. By the end of the fight, the NK 4th Division had only 300 or 400 men in each of its regiments. Of its original 7,000 men, the division now had a strength of only 3,500, having suffered over 1,200 <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed</a>. Several thousand members of the division deserted during the fight. Most of these men were South Korean civilians forcibly conscripted into the North Korean army. The NK 4th Division would not recover until much later in the war. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade reported 66 Marines dead, 278 wounded, and one missing. In total, American forces suffered around 1,800 casualties during the battle, with about a third of those killed.

By 1 September, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was down to 4,290 men, having suffered 500 casualties in its month of Korean service, and was preparing to move back to Pusan to evacuate to Japan. There, the brigade was to join with Marine reinforcements to re-form the 1st Marine Division, which would then be a part of <a href="US%20X%20Corps">X Corps</a> for a <a href="Battle%20of%20Inchon">counterattack at Inchon</a>. However, the North Korean <a href="Great%20Naktong%20Offensive">Great Naktong Offensive</a> delayed these plans, as the brigade was needed to repel one more North Korean crossing of the Naktong River.

At the same time, the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the <a href="NK%209th%20Division">NK 9th Division</a>, in their first offensive of the war, stood only a few miles short of Yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the American line. Division commander <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong.

On the morning of 1 September, with only the shattered remnants its E Company at hand, the U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander <a href="US%20Major%20General">Major General</a> Lawrence B. Keiser formed ad-hoc units from his support troops but they were not enough to counter the North Korean attack.

On 2 September, Walker spoke by telephone with Major General <a href="Doyle%20O.%20Hickey">Doyle O. Hickey</a>, Deputy <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff">Chief of Staff</a>, <a href="British%20Far%20East%20Command">Far East Command</a>, in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the U.S. 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army">General of the Army</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the U.S. 2nd Division and ordered a coordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.

A conference was held that afternoon at the U.S. 2nd Division command post, attended by leaders of the U.S. Eighth Army, 2nd Division, and 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. A decision was reached that the Marines would attack west at 08:00 on 3 September astride the Yongsan–Naktong River road, and U.S. Army troops would attack northwest above the Marines and attempt to re-establish contact with the <a href="23rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 23rd Infantry</a>, while the <a href="2nd%20Engineer%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Engineer Combat Battalion</a> with remnants of the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry, and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank, or south, of the Marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division.
The troops holding this line on the first hills west of Yongsan were G Company, 9th Infantry, north of the road running west through Kogan-ni to the Naktong; A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, southward across the road; and, below the engineers, F Company, 9th Infantry. Between 03:00 and 04:30 on 3 September, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade moved to forward assembly areas. The <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%205th%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 5th Marines</a>, assembled north of Yongsan, the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%205th%20Marines">1st Battalion, 5th Marines</a>, south of it. The <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2C%205th%20Marines">3rd Battalion, 5th Marines</a>, established security positions southwest of Yongsan along the approaches into the regimental sector from that direction.

Fighting began the night of 2 September, and at dawn on 3 September, U.S. troops gained the high ground which was part of the designated Marine line of departure. With help from Marine tank fire, G Company overcame heavy resistance, but this early morning battle for the line of departure delayed the planned attack. The Marine attack started at 08:55 toward North Korean-held high ground westward. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, south of the east-west road, gained its objective when North Korean soldiers broke under air attack. <a href="Air%20strikes">Air strikes</a>, artillery concentrations, and machine gun and rifle fire of the 1st Battalion now caught North Korean reinforcements in open rice paddies moving up from the second ridge and killed most of them. In the afternoon, the 1st Battalion advanced to Hill 91.

North of the road the 2nd Battalion had a harder time, encountering heavy North Korean fire when it reached the northern tip of Hill 116, west of Yongsan. The North Koreans held the hill during the day, and at night D Company of the 5th Marines was isolated there. In the fighting west of Yongsan, Marine armor knocked out four T-34 tanks, and North Korean crew members abandoned a fifth. That night the Marines dug in on a line west of Yongsan. The 2nd Battalion had lost 18 killed and 77 wounded during the day, most of them in D Company. Total Marine casualties for 3 September were 34 killed and 157 wounded. Coordinating its attack with that of the Marines, the 9th Infantry advanced abreast of them on the north.

Just before midnight, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, received orders to pass through the 2nd Battalion and continue the attack in the morning. That night torrential rains made the troops miserable. The North Koreans were unusually quiet and launched few patrols or attacks. The morning of 4 September, the weather was clear. The counterattack continued at 08:00 on 4 September, at first against little opposition. North of the road the 2nd Battalion quickly completed occupation of Hill 116, from which the North Koreans had withdrawn during the night. South of the road the 1st Battalion occupied what appeared to be a command post of the NK 9th Division. Tents were still up and equipment lay scattered about. Two abandoned T-34 tanks in excellent condition stood there. Tanks and ground troops advancing along the road found it littered with North Korean dead and destroyed and abandoned equipment. By nightfall the counterattack had gained another .

That morning, 5 September, after a 10-minute artillery preparation, the American troops moved out in their third day of counterattack. It was a day of rain. As the attack progressed, the Marines approached Obong-ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the month before. There, at midmorning, on the high ground ahead, they could see North Korean troops digging in. The Marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions in front of the North Korean-held high ground. At 14:30 approximately 300 North Korean infantry came from the village of <a href="Tugok">Tugok</a> and concealed positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 just north of the road and east of Tugok. Two T-34 tanks surprised and knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire, four others withdrew to better positions. Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with <a href="3.5-inch%20rocket%20launcher">3.5-inch rocket launcher</a>s rushed into action, took the tanks under fire, and destroyed both of them, as well as an <a href="armored%20personnel%20carrier">armored personnel carrier</a> following behind. The North Korean infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and the Marine 81 mm mortars helped repel it. September 5 was a day of heavy casualties everywhere on the Pusan Perimeter. Army units had 102 killed, 430 wounded, and 587 missing in action for a total of 1,119 casualties. Marine units had 35 killed, 91 wounded, and none missing in action, for a total of 126 battle casualties. Total American battle casualties for the day were 1,245 men.

The American counteroffensive of 3–5 September west of Yongsan resulted in one of the bloodiest and most terrifying debacles of the war for a North Korean division, according to historians. Even though remnants of the NK 9th Division, supported by the low strength NK 4th Division, still held Obong-ni Ridge, Cloverleaf Hill, and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on 6 September, the division's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack. The NK 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive.

During the previous night, at 20:00 on 4 September, Walker had ordered the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade released from operational control of the 2nd Division effective at midnight, 5 September. At 00:15, 6 September, the Marines began leaving their lines at Obong-ni Ridge heading for Pusan. They would join the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Regiment</a> and <a href="7th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">7th Marine Regiment</a> to form the new 1st Marine Division.

Walker had protested in vain against releasing the brigade, believing he needed it and all the troops then in Korea if he were to stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. The order prompted a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning two newly arrived units of the <a href="US%203rd%20Infantry%20Division">3rd Infantry Division</a>, the <a href="17th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">17th Infantry Regiment</a> and the <a href="US%2065th%20Infantry%20Regiment">65th Infantry Regiment</a> to Walker's reserves. Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective, and believed the transition endangered the Pusan Perimeter at a time when it was unclear if it could hold back the North Koreans. The brigade moved to Japan and merged with the 1st Marine Division. It was deactivated as an independent unit for the last time on 13 September 1950.

The original "1st Marine Brigade" was the <a href="Advanced%20Base%20Force">1st Advance Base Brigade</a>, established in 1913. It was redesignated as the "1st Brigade" in 1914, and in 1935 as the 1st Marine Brigade, FMF. In 1941, the 1st Marine Brigade was redesignated as the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division">1st Marine Division</a>.

A new permanent Marine brigade, designated as the 1st Marine Brigade was formed in Hawaii in 1956. In 1985, it was redesignated as the 1st Marine Amphibious Brigade (1st MAB), and in 1988 as the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Brigade">1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade</a>. As this brigade had relation to the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, it did not assume its lineage.

Though not considered a "permanent" unit, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was awarded campaign streamers for each of its missions, creating a lineage for the unit. Those streamers include:

Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe

Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe (<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a> Clemm; August 15, 1822 – January 30, 1847) was the wife of American writer <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>. The couple were <a href="cousin">first cousins</a> and publicly married when Virginia Clemm was 14 and Poe was 27. Biographers disagree as to the nature of the couple's relationship. Though their marriage was loving, some biographers suggest they viewed one another more like a brother and sister. In January 1842 she contracted <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, growing worse for five years until she died of the disease at the age of 24 in <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe%20Cottage">the family's cottage</a>, at that time outside <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

Along with other family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived together off and on for several years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. A few years after their wedding, Poe was involved in a substantial scandal involving <a href="Frances%20Sargent%20Osgood">Frances Sargent Osgood</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20F.%20Ellet">Elizabeth F. Ellet</a>. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in <a href="Westminster%20Hall%20and%20Burying%20Ground">Westminster Hall and Burying Ground</a> in Baltimore, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.

The disease and eventual death of his wife had a substantial effect on Edgar Allan Poe, who became despondent and turned to alcohol to cope. Her struggles with illness and death are believed to have affected his poetry and prose, where dying young women appear as a frequent motif, as in "<a href="Annabel%20Lee">Annabel Lee</a>", "<a href="The%20Raven">The Raven</a>", and "<a href="Ligeia">Ligeia</a>". 

Virginia Eliza Clemm was born in 1822 and named after an older sister who had died at age two only ten days earlier. Her father William Clemm, Jr. was a hardware merchant in Baltimore. He had married Maria Poe, Virginia's mother, on July 12, 1817, after the death of his first wife, Maria's first cousin Harriet. Clemm had five children from his previous marriage and went on to have three more with Maria. After his death in 1826, he left very little to the family and relatives offered no financial support because they had opposed the marriage. Maria supported the family by sewing and taking in boarders, aided with an annual $240 pension granted to her mother Elizabeth Cairnes, who was paralyzed and bedridden. Elizabeth received this pension on behalf of her late husband, "General" David Poe, a former <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a> in Maryland who had loaned money to the state.

Edgar Poe first met his cousin Virginia in August 1829, four months after his discharge from the Army. She was seven at the time. In 1832, the family – made up of Elizabeth, Maria, Virginia, and Virginia's brother Henry – was able to use Elizabeth's pension to rent a home at what was then <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe%20House%20and%20Museum">3 North Amity Street</a> in Baltimore. Poe's older brother <a href="William%20Henry%20Leonard%20Poe">William Henry Leonard Poe</a>, who had been living with the family, had recently died on August 1, 1831. Poe joined the household in 1833 and was soon smitten by a neighbor named Mary Devereaux. The young Virginia served as a messenger between the two, at one point retrieving a lock of Devereaux's hair to give to Poe. Elizabeth Cairnes Poe died on July 7, 1835, effectively ending the family's income and making their financial situation even more difficult. Henry died around this time, sometime before 1836, leaving Virginia as Maria Clemm's only surviving child.

In August 1835, Poe left the destitute family behind and moved to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> to take a job at the "<a href="Southern%20Literary%20Messenger">Southern Literary Messenger</a>". While Poe was away from Baltimore, another cousin, Neilson Poe, the husband of Virginia's half-sister Josephine Clemm, heard that Edgar was considering marrying Virginia. Neilson offered to take her in and have her educated in an attempt to prevent the girl's marriage to Edgar at such a young age, though suggesting that the option could be reconsidered later. Edgar called Neilson, the owner of a newspaper in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, his "bitterest enemy" and interpreted his cousin's actions as an attempt at breaking his connection with Virginia. On August 29, 1835, Edgar wrote an emotional letter to Maria, declaring that he was "blinded with tears while writing", and pleading that she allow Virginia to make her own decision. Encouraged by his employment at the "Southern Literary Messenger", Poe offered to provide financially for Maria, Virginia and Henry if they moved to Richmond.

Marriage plans were confirmed and Poe returned to Baltimore to file for a <a href="marriage%20license">marriage license</a> on September 22, 1835. The couple might have been quietly married as well, though accounts are unclear. Their only public ceremony was in Richmond on May 16, 1836, when they were married by a Presbyterian minister named Rev. Amasa Converse. Poe was 27 and Virginia was 13, though her age was listed as 21. This marriage bond was filed in Richmond and included an <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a> from Thomas W. Cleland confirming the bride's alleged age. The ceremony was held in the evening at the home of a Mrs. James Yarrington, the owner of the <a href="boarding%20house">boarding house</a> in which Poe, Virginia, and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm were staying. Yarrington helped Maria Clemm bake the wedding cake and prepared a wedding meal. The couple then had a short <a href="honeymoon">honeymoon</a> in <a href="Petersburg%2C%20Virginia">Petersburg, Virginia</a>.

Debate has raged regarding how unusual this pairing was based on the couple's age and blood relationship. Noted Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn argues it was not particularly unusual, nor was Poe's nicknaming his wife "Sissy" or "Sis". Another Poe biographer, <a href="Kenneth%20Silverman">Kenneth Silverman</a>, contends that though their <a href="cousin%20marriage">first-cousin marriage</a> was not unusual, her young age was. It has been suggested that Clemm and Poe had a relationship more like that between brother and sister than between husband and wife. Biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn disagreed with this view, citing a fervent love letter to argue that Poe "loved his little cousin not only with the affection of a brother, but also with the passionate devotion of a lover and prospective husband." Some scholars, including <a href="Princess%20Marie%20Bonaparte">Marie Bonaparte</a>, have read many of Poe's works as autobiographical and have concluded that Virginia died a <a href="virginity">virgin</a>. It has been speculated that she and her husband never consummated their marriage, although no evidence is given. This interpretation often assumes that Virginia is represented by the title character in the poem "<a href="Annabel%20Lee">Annabel Lee</a>": a "maiden... by the name of Annabel Lee". Poe biographer Joseph Wood Krutch suggests that Poe did not need women "in the way that normal men need them", but only as a source of inspiration and care, and that Poe was never interested in women sexually. Friends of Poe suggested that the couple did not share a bed for at least the first two years of their marriage but that, from the time she turned 16, they had a "normal" married life until the onset of her illness.

Virginia and Poe were by all accounts a happy and devoted couple. Poe's one-time employer <a href="George%20Rex%20Graham">George Rex Graham</a> wrote of their relationship: "His love for his wife was a sort of rapturous worship of the spirit of beauty." Poe once wrote to a friend, "I see no one among the living as beautiful as my little wife." She, in turn, by many contemporary accounts, nearly idolized her husband. She often sat close to him while he wrote, kept his pens in order, and folded and addressed his manuscripts. She showed her love for Poe in an <a href="acrostic">acrostic</a> poem she composed when she was 23, dated February 14, 1846:

The "tattling of many tongues" in Virginia's Valentine poem was a reference to actual incidents. In 1845, Poe had begun a flirtation with <a href="Frances%20Sargent%20Osgood">Frances Sargent Osgood</a>, a married 34-year-old poet. Virginia was aware of the friendship and might even have encouraged it. She often invited Osgood to visit them at home, believing that the older woman had a "restraining" effect on Poe, who had made a promise to "give up the use of stimulants" and was never drunk in Osgood's presence.

At the same time, another poet, <a href="Elizabeth%20F.%20Ellet">Elizabeth F. Ellet</a>, became enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood. Though, in a letter to <a href="Sarah%20Helen%20Whitman">Sarah Helen Whitman</a>, Poe called her love for him "loathsome" and wrote that he "could do nothing but repel [it] with scorn", he printed many of her poems to him in the "<a href="Broadway%20Journal">Broadway Journal</a>" while he was its editor. Ellet was known for being meddlesome and vindictive and, while visiting the Poe household in late January 1846, she saw one of Osgood's personal letters to Poe. According to Ellet, Virginia pointed out "fearful paragraphs" in Osgood's letter. Ellet contacted Osgood and suggested she should beware of her indiscretions and asked Poe to return her letters, motivated either by jealousy or by a desire to cause scandal. Osgood then sent <a href="Margaret%20Fuller">Margaret Fuller</a> and <a href="Anne%20Lynch%20Botta">Anne Lynch Botta</a> to ask Poe on her behalf to return the letters. Angered by their interference, Poe called them "Busy-bodies" and said that Ellet had better "look after her "own" letters", suggesting indiscretion on her part. He then gathered up these letters from Ellet and left them at her house.

Though these letters had already been returned to her, Ellet asked her brother "to "demand of me the letters"". Her brother, Colonel William Lummis, did not believe that Poe had already returned them and threatened to kill him. In order to defend himself, Poe requested a pistol from <a href="Thomas%20Dunn%20English">Thomas Dunn English</a>. English, Poe's friend and a minor writer who was also a trained doctor and lawyer, likewise did not believe that Poe had already returned the letters and even questioned their existence. The easiest way out of the predicament, he said, "was a retraction of unfounded charges". Angered at being called a liar, Poe pushed English into a fistfight. Poe later claimed he was triumphant in the fight, though English claimed otherwise, and Poe's face was badly cut by one of English's rings. In Poe's version, he said, "I gave E. a flogging which he will remember to the day of his death." Either way, the fight further sparked gossip over the Osgood affair.

Osgood's husband stepped in and threatened to sue Ellet unless she formally apologized for her insinuations. She retracted her statements in a letter to Osgood saying, "The letter shown me by Mrs Poe "must have been a forgery"" created by Poe himself. She put all the blame on Poe, suggesting the incident was because Poe was "intemperate and subject to acts of lunacy". Ellet spread the rumor of Poe's insanity, which was taken up by other enemies of Poe and reported in newspapers. The St. Louis "Reveille" reported: "A rumor is in circulation in New York, to the effect that Mr. Edgar A. Poe, the poet and author, has been deranged, and his friends are about to place him under the charge of <a href="Amariah%20Brigham">Dr. Brigham</a> of the <a href="Utica%20Psychiatric%20Center">Insane Retreat</a> at Utica." The scandal eventually died down only when Osgood reunited with her husband. Virginia, however, had been very affected by the whole affair. She had received anonymous letters about her husband's alleged indiscretions as early as July 1845. It is presumed that Ellet was involved with these letters, and they so disturbed Virginia that she allegedly declared on her deathbed that "Mrs. E. had been her murderer."

By this time, Virginia had developed <a href="Tuberculosis">consumption</a>, first seen sometime in the middle of January 1842. While singing and playing the piano, Virginia began to bleed from the mouth, though Poe said she merely "ruptured a blood-vessel". Her health declined and she became an invalid, which drove Poe into a deep depression, especially as she occasionally showed signs of improvement. In a letter to a friend, Poe described his resulting mental state: "Each time I felt all the agonies of her death—and at each accession of the disorder I loved her more dearly & clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitive—nervous in a very unusual degree. I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity."

Virginia's condition might have been what prompted the Poe family to move, in the hopes of finding a healthier environment for her. They moved several times within <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe%20National%20Historic%20Site">Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site</a> in <a href="Spring%20Garden%20District%2C%20Pennsylvania">Spring Garden</a>. In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing. The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street. By early 1846, family friend <a href="Elizabeth%20Oakes%20Smith">Elizabeth Oakes Smith</a> said that Virginia admitted, "I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; but I want to be as happy as possible, and make Edgar happy." She promised her husband that after her death she would be his guardian angel.

In May 1846, the family (Poe, Virginia, and her mother, Maria) moved to a small <a href="cottage">cottage</a> in <a href="Fordham%2C%20Bronx">Fordham</a>, about fourteen miles outside the city, a <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe%20Cottage">home which is still standing today</a>. In what is the only surviving letter from Poe to Virginia, dated June 12, 1846, he urged her to remain optimistic: "Keep up your heart in all hopelessness, and trust yet a little longer." Of his recent loss of the "Broadway Journal", the only magazine Poe ever owned, he said, "I should have lost my courage "but for you"—my darling little wife you are my "greatest" and "only" stimulus now to battle with this uncongenial, unsatisfactory and ungrateful life." But by November of that year, Virginia's condition was hopeless. Her symptoms included irregular appetite, flushed cheeks, unstable pulse, night sweats, high fever, sudden chills, shortness of breath, chest pains, coughing and spitting up blood.

<a href="Nathaniel%20Parker%20Willis">Nathaniel Parker Willis</a>, a friend of Poe's and an influential editor, published an announcement on December 30, 1846, requesting help for the family, though his facts were not entirely correct:
Willis, who had not corresponded with Poe for two years and had since lost his own wife, was one of his greatest supporters in this period. He sent Poe and his wife an inspirational Christmas book, "The Marriage Ring; or How to Make a Home Happy".

The announcement was similar to one made for Poe's mother, <a href="Eliza%20Poe">Eliza Poe</a>, during her last stages of tuberculosis. Other newspapers picked up on the story: "Great God!", said one, "is it possible, that the literary people of the Union, will let poor Poe perish by starvation and lean faced beggary in New York? For so we are led to believe, from frequent notices in the papers, stating that Poe and his wife are both down upon a bed of misery, death, and disease, with not a ducat in the world." The "<a href="Saturday%20Evening%20Post">Saturday Evening Post</a>" asserted that Virginia was in a hopeless condition and that Poe was bereft: "It is said that Edgar A. Poe is lying dangerously with brain fever, and that his wife is in the last stages of consumption—they are without money and without friends." Even editor <a href="Hiram%20Fuller%20%28journalist%29">Hiram Fuller</a>, whom Poe had previously sued for <a href="defamation">libel</a>, attempted in the "New York Mirror" to garner support for Poe and his wife: "We, whom he has quarrelled with, will take the lead", he wrote.

Virginia was described as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called "pure white", causing a "bad complexion that spoiled her looks". One visitor to the Poe family noted that "the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright", possibly a symptom of her illness. Another visitor in Fordham wrote, "Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look." That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human. <a href="William%20Gowans">William Gowans</a>, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of "matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any <a href="houri">houri</a>, and her face defy the genius of a <a href="Antonio%20Canova">Canova</a> to imitate". She might have been a little plump. Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even in the last years of her life.

While dying, Virginia asked her mother: "Darling... will you console and take care of my poor Eddy—you will "never never" leave him?" Her mother stayed with Poe until his own death in 1849. As Virginia was dying, the family received many visitors, including an old friend named Mary Starr. At one point Virginia put Starr's hand in Poe's and asked her to "be a friend to Eddy, and don't forsake him". Virginia was tended to by 25-year-old Marie Louise Shew. Shew, who served as a nurse, knew medical care from her father and her husband, both doctors. She provided Virginia with a <a href="comforter">comforter</a> as her only other cover was Poe's old military <a href="cloak">cloak</a>, as well as bottles of wine, which the invalid drank "smiling, even when difficult to get it down". Virginia also showed Poe a letter from Louisa Patterson, second wife of Poe's foster-father John Allan, which she had kept for years and which suggested that Patterson had purposely caused the break between Allan and Poe.

On January 29, 1847, Poe wrote to Marie Louise Shew: "My poor Virginia still lives, although failing fast and now suffering much pain."
Virginia died the following day, January 30, after five years of illness. Shew helped in organizing her funeral, even purchasing the coffin. Death notices appeared in several newspapers. On February 1, The New York "Daily Tribune" and the "Herald" carried the simple obituary: "On Saturday, the 30th ult., of pulmonary consumption, in the 25th year of her age, VIRGINIA ELIZA, wife of EDGAR A. POE." The funeral was February 2, 1847. Attendees included Nathaniel Parker Willis, <a href="Ann%20S.%20Stephens">Ann S. Stephens</a>, and publisher <a href="George%20Pope%20Morris">George Pope Morris</a>. Poe refused to look at his dead wife's face, saying he preferred to remember her living. Though now buried at <a href="Westminster%20Hall%20and%20Burying%20Ground">Westminster Hall and Burying Ground</a>, Virginia was originally buried in a <a href="Burial%20vault%20%28tomb%29">vault</a> owned by the Valentine family, from whom the Poes rented their Fordham cottage.

Only one image of Virginia is known to exist, for which the painter had to take her corpse as model. A few hours after her death, Poe realized he had no image of Virginia and so commissioned a portrait in <a href="watercolor%20painting">watercolor</a>. She is shown wearing "beautiful linen" that Shew said she had dressed her in; Shew might have been the portrait's artist, though this is uncertain. The image depicts her with a slight double chin and with hazel eyes. The image was passed down to the family of Virginia's half-sister Josephine, wife of Neilson Poe.

In 1875, the same year in which her husband's body was reburied, the cemetery in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Gill's story was reported in the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the <a href="sexton%20%28office%29">sexton</a> Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to throw them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885—the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The same man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.

Virginia's death had a significant effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it "in the "death" of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a man—it was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could "not" longer have endured without the total loss of reason".

Poe regularly visited Virginia's grave. As his friend Charles Chauncey Burr wrote, "Many times, after the death of his beloved wife, was he found at the dead hour of a winter night, sitting beside her tomb almost frozen in the snow". Shortly after Virginia's death, Poe courted several other women, including Nancy Richmond of <a href="Lowell%2C%20Massachusetts">Lowell, Massachusetts</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Helen%20Whitman">Sarah Helen Whitman</a> of <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>, and childhood sweetheart <a href="Sarah%20Elmira%20Royster">Sarah Elmira Royster</a> in Richmond. Even so, Frances Sargent Osgood, whom Poe also attempted to woo, believed "that [Virginia] was the only woman whom he ever loved".

Many of <a href="Bibliography%20of%20Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Poe's works</a> are interpreted autobiographically, with much of his work believed to reflect Virginia's long struggle with tuberculosis and her eventual death. The most discussed example is "<a href="Annabel%20Lee">Annabel Lee</a>". This poem, which depicts a dead young bride and her mourning lover, is often assumed to have been inspired by Virginia, though other women in Poe's life are potential candidates including Frances Sargent Osgood and Sarah Helen Whitman. A similar poem, "<a href="Ulalume">Ulalume</a>", is also believed to be a memorial tribute to Virginia, as is "<a href="Lenore">Lenore</a>", whose title character is described as "the most lovely dead that ever died so young!" After Poe's death, <a href="George%20Gilfillan">George Gilfillan</a> of the London-based "Critic" said Poe was responsible for his wife's death, "hurrying her to a premature grave, that he might write 'Annabel Lee' and '<a href="The%20Raven">The Raven</a>'". The aforementioned critic was either unconcerned with, or unaware of, the fact that "The Raven" was written and published two years before Virginia's death.

Virginia is also seen in Poe's prose. The <a href="short%20story">short story</a> "<a href="Eleonora%20%28short%20story%29">Eleonora</a>" (1842)—which features a narrator preparing to marry his cousin, with whom he lives alongside her mother—may also refer to Virginia's illness. When Poe wrote it, his wife had just begun to show signs of her illness. It was shortly thereafter that the couple moved to New York City by boat and Poe published "<a href="The%20Oblong%20Box%20%28short%20story%29">The Oblong Box</a>" (1844). This story, which shows a man mourning his young wife while transporting her corpse by boat, seems to suggest Poe's feelings about Virginia's impending death. As the ship sinks, the husband would rather die than be separated from his wife's corpse. The short story "<a href="Ligeia">Ligeia</a>", whose title character suffers a slow and lingering death, may also be inspired by Virginia. After his wife's death, Poe edited his first published story, "<a href="Metzengerstein">Metzengerstein</a>", to remove the narrator's line, "I would wish all I love to perish of that gentle disease", a reference to tuberculosis.

In track 9 of their 2008 debut album "<a href="Le%20Pop">Le Pop</a>", Norwegian band <a href="Katzenjammer%20%28band%29">Katzenjammer</a> performed a song entitled "Virginia Clemm". Set to the tune of a musical clock, the song's lyrics refer to Virginia's early marriage at 13 years of age ("He was a child I was a child / Sentimental and wild"), to her husband's alleged affairs ("The other woman to explain / Her letters I deplore"), to her untimely death ("For twelve short years / We lived out of health"), to the band's perceived obsessions of Poe's subsequent obsession with his wife's death ("Heir of my illness / Writer of all the stories and the words / That I'm haunting / That I'm haunting") as well as alluding, in the last verse ("And I'll leave you nevermore"), to the poem "<a href="The%20Raven">The Raven</a>".

The Kinks

The Kinks are an English <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band formed in <a href="Muswell%20Hill">Muswell Hill</a>, North London, in 1964 by brothers <a href="Ray%20Davies">Ray</a> and <a href="Dave%20Davies">Dave Davies</a>. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of <a href="British%20rhythm%20and%20blues">British rhythm and blues</a> and <a href="Merseybeat">Merseybeat</a>, and were briefly part of the <a href="British%20Invasion">British Invasion</a> of the United States until their touring ban in 1965 (as a result of constant fighting between the brothers). Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned "<a href="You%20Really%20Got%20Me">You Really Got Me</a>", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a>, British <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a>, <a href="Folk%20music">folk</a> and <a href="country%20music">country</a>. They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational writing style, and are considered one of the most influential groups of the period.

Early works included albums such as "<a href="Face%20to%20Face%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Face to Face</a>" (1966), "<a href="Something%20Else%20by%20The%20Kinks">Something Else</a>" (1967), "<a href="The%20Kinks%20Are%20the%20Village%20Green%20Preservation%20Society">The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</a>" (1968), "<a href="Arthur%20%28Or%20the%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20British%20Empire%29">Arthur</a>" (1969), "<a href="Lola%20Versus%20Powerman%20and%20the%20Moneygoround%2C%20Part%20One">Lola Versus Powerman</a>" (1970), "<a href="Muswell%20Hillbillies">Muswell Hillbillies</a>" (1971), along with their accompanying singles. After a fallow period in the mid-1970s, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with their albums "<a href="Sleepwalker%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Sleepwalker</a>" (1977), "<a href="Misfits%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Misfits</a>" (1978), "<a href="Low%20Budget%20%28album%29">Low Budget</a>" (1979), "<a href="Give%20the%20People%20What%20They%20Want%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Give the People What They Want</a>" (1981) and "<a href="State%20of%20Confusion">State of Confusion</a>" (1983). In addition, groups such as <a href="Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a>, <a href="the%20Jam">the Jam</a>, <a href="the%20Knack">the Knack</a>, <a href="the%20Pretenders">the Pretenders</a> and <a href="The%20Fall%20%28band%29">the Fall</a> covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> acts such as <a href="Blur%20%28band%29">Blur</a> and <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a> cited the band as a major influence.

Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the band's 32-year run. Longest-serving member <a href="Mick%20Avory">Mick Avory</a> (drums and percussion) was replaced by <a href="Bob%20Henrit">Bob Henrit</a>, formerly of <a href="Argent%20%28band%29">Argent</a>, in 1984. Original bass guitarist <a href="Pete%20Quaife">Pete Quaife</a> was replaced by <a href="John%20Dalton%20%28musician%29">John Dalton</a> in 1969, and Dalton was in turn replaced by <a href="Jim%20Rodford">Jim Rodford</a> in 1978. Session keyboardist <a href="Nicky%20Hopkins">Nicky Hopkins</a> accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings in the mid-to-late 1960s. In 1969 the band became an official five-piece when keyboardist John Gosling joined them, being replaced by <a href="Ian%20Gibbons%20%28musician%29">Ian Gibbons</a> in 1979, who remained in the band until they broke up in 1996; a result of the commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers. In 2018, Ray Davies and Dave Davies said they are working with Mick Avory on a new Kinks album.

The Kinks have had five Top 10 singles on the US "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, The Kinks have had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four of their albums have been <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified gold by the RIAA</a> and the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide. Among numerous honours, they received the <a href="Ivor%20Novello%20Award">Ivor Novello Award</a> for "Outstanding Service to British Music". In 1990, the original four members of The Kinks were inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005.

In a June 2018 interview, Ray Davies stated that he, along with brother Dave, and drummer Avory, had reformed The Kinks for a new studio album and to potentially perform live.

The Davies brothers were born in suburban <a href="North%20London">North London</a> on Huntingdon Road, <a href="East%20Finchley">East Finchley</a>, the youngest, and only boys, among their family's eight children. Their parents, Frederick and Annie Davies, moved the family to 6 Denmark Terrace, <a href="Fortis%20Green">Fortis Green</a>, in the neighbouring suburb of <a href="Muswell%20Hill">Muswell Hill</a>. At home they were immersed in a world of varied musical styles, from the <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> of their parents' generation to the <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and early <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> that their older sisters enjoyed. Both Ray and his brother Dave, younger by almost three years, learned to play guitar, and they played <a href="skiffle">skiffle</a> and rock and roll together.

The brothers attended William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later merged with <a href="Tollington%20School">Tollington Grammar School</a> to become <a href="Fortismere%20School">Fortismere School</a>), where they formed a band, the Ray Davies Quartet with Ray's friend and classmate Pete Quaife and Quaife's friend John Start (Although they would also be known as the Pete Quaife Quartet, if the bass player landed a gig for them instead). Their debut at a school dance was well received, which encouraged the group to play at local pubs and bars. The band went through a series of lead vocalists, including <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a>, another student at William Grimshaw, who performed with the group at least once in early 1962. He then formed his own group, Rod Stewart and the Moonrakers, which became a local rival to the Ray Davies Quartet.

In late 1962, Ray Davies left home to study at <a href="Hornsey%20College%20of%20Art">Hornsey College of Art</a>. He pursued interests in subjects such as film, sketching, theatre and music, including jazz and blues. When <a href="Blues%20Incorporated">Blues Incorporated</a> played at the college in December, he asked advice from <a href="Alexis%20Korner">Alexis Korner</a>, who recommended <a href="Giorgio%20Gomelsky">Giorgio Gomelsky</a>, the former <a href="The%20Yardbirds">Yardbirds</a> manager, who put Davies in touch with the <a href="Soho">Soho</a>-based Dave Hunt Band, a professional group of musicians who played jazz and R&B. A few days after the Ray Davies Quartet supported <a href="Cyril%20Stapleton">Cyril Stapleton</a> at the <a href="Lyceum%20Ballroom">Lyceum Ballroom</a> on New Year's Eve, Davies, while still remaining in the Quartet, joined the Dave Hunt Band which briefly included <a href="Charlie%20Watts">Charlie Watts</a> on drums. In February 1963, Davies left Dave Hunt to join the Hamilton King Band (also known as the Blues Messengers), which had <a href="Peter%20Bardens">Peter Bardens</a> as pianist. At the end of the spring term he left Hornsey College with a view to study film at the <a href="Central%20School%20of%20Art%20and%20Design">Central School of Art and Design</a>, around this time the Quartet changed their name to the Ramrods. Davies has referred to a show the fledgling Kinks played (again as the Ray Davies Quartet) at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 as their first important gig. In June, the Hamilton King Band broke up, though the Ramrods kept going, performing under several other names, including the Pete Quaife Band, and the Bo-Weevils, before (temporarily) settling on the Ravens. The fledgling group hired two managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace, and in late 1963 former pop singer <a href="Larry%20Page%20%28singer%29">Larry Page</a> became their third manager. American record producer <a href="Shel%20Talmy">Shel Talmy</a> began working with the band, and <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' promoter, Arthur Howes, was retained to schedule the Ravens' live shows. The group unsuccessfully auditioned for various record labels until early 1964, when Talmy secured them a contract with <a href="Pye%20Records">Pye Records</a>. During this period they had acquired a new drummer, Mickey Willet; however, Willet left the band shortly before they signed to Pye. The Ravens invited Mick Avory to replace him after seeing an advertisement Avory had placed in "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>". Avory had a background in jazz drumming and had played one gig with the fledgling <a href="Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a>.

Around this period, the Ravens decided on a new, permanent name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In <a href="Jon%20Savage">Jon Savage</a>'s analysis, they "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage." Manager Robert Wace related his side of the story: "I had a friend... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity... When we went to [the band members] with the name, they were... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky! Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their "kinky" fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, "The way you look, and the clothes you wear, you ought to be called the Kinks." "I've never really liked the name", Ray stated.

The band's first single was a cover of the <a href="Little%20Richard">Little Richard</a> song "<a href="Long%20Tall%20Sally">Long Tall Sally</a>". <a href="Bobby%20Graham%20%28musician%29">Bobby Graham</a>, a friend of the band, was recruited to play drums on the recording. He would continue to occasionally substitute for Avory in the studio and play on several of the Kinks' early singles, including the early hits "You Really Got Me", "All Day and All of the Night" and "Tired of Waiting for You". "Long Tall Sally" was released in February 1964, but despite the publicity efforts of the band's managers, the single was almost completely ignored. When their second single, "<a href="You%20Still%20Want%20Me">You Still Want Me</a>", failed to chart, Pye Records threatened to annul the group's contract unless their third single was successful.

"<a href="You%20Really%20Got%20Me">You Really Got Me</a>", a Ray Davies song, influenced by American blues and <a href="the%20Kingsmen">the Kingsmen</a>'s version of "<a href="Louie%20Louie">Louie Louie</a>", was recorded on 15 June 1964 at Pye studios with a slower and more produced feel than the final single. Ray Davies wanted to rerecord the song with a lean, raw sound, but Pye refused to fund another session; Davies took an adamant stand, so the producer, Shel Talmy, broke the stalemate by underwriting the session himself. The band used an independent studio, <a href="IBC%20Studios">IBC</a>, and went in on 15 July, getting it done in two takes. The single was released on August 1964, and, supported by a performance on the television show "<a href="Ready%20Steady%20Go%21">Ready Steady Go!</a>" and extensive pirate radio coverage, it entered the UK charts on 15 August, reaching number one on 19 September. Hastily imported by the American label <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a>, it also made the Top 10 in the United States. The loud, distorted guitar <a href="Riff%23Riff">riff</a> and solo on "You Really Got Me" was played by Dave Davies and achieved by a slice Dave Davies made in the speaker cone of his Elpico amplifier (referred to by the band as the "little green amp")— helped with the song's signature, gritty guitar sound. "You Really Got Me" has been described as "a blueprint song in the <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> and <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> arsenal", and as an influence on the approach of some American <a href="garage%20rock">garage rock</a> bands. After its release, the group recorded most of the tracks for their debut LP, simply titled "<a href="Kinks%20%28album%29">Kinks</a>". Consisting largely of covers and revamped traditional songs, it was released on 2 October 1964, reaching number four on the UK chart. The group's fourth single, "<a href="All%20Day%20and%20All%20of%20the%20Night">All Day and All of the Night</a>", another Ray Davies hard rock tune, was released three weeks later, reaching number two in the United Kingdom, and number seven in the United States. The next singles, <a href="Set%20Me%20Free%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">"Set Me Free</a>" and "<a href="Tired%20of%20Waiting%20for%20You">Tired of Waiting for You</a>", were also commercially successful, the latter topping the UK singles chart.

The group opened 1965 with their first tour of Australia and New Zealand, with <a href="Manfred%20Mann">Manfred Mann</a> and <a href="the%20Honeycombs">the Honeycombs</a>. An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as <a href="the%20Yardbirds">the Yardbirds</a> and <a href="Mickey%20Finn%20%28guitarist%29">Mickey Finn</a>. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, Wales, on 19 May. After finishing the first song, "You Really Got Me", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to <a href="Cardiff%20Royal%20Infirmary">Cardiff Royal Infirmary</a>, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate the police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.

Following a mid-year tour of the United States, the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Musicians">American Federation of Musicians</a> refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music at the height of the <a href="British%20Invasion">British Invasion</a>. Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping <a href="Dick%20Clark">Dick Clark</a>'s TV show "<a href="Where%20the%20Action%20Is">Where The Action Is</a>" in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, "Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments. Things like "Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks he can come over here and make a career for himself." following which a punch was thrown and the AFM banned them.

A stopover in <a href="Mumbai">Bombay, India</a>, during the band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies to write the song "<a href="See%20My%20Friends">See My Friends</a>", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of <a href="crossover%20music">crossover music</a>, and one of the first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written "See My Friends" with a <a href="Raga%20rock">raga feel</a> after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian <a href="Jonathan%20Bellman">Jonathan Bellman</a> argues that the song was "extremely influential" on Davies' musical peers: "And while much has been made of the Beatles' '<a href="Norwegian%20Wood%20%28This%20Bird%20Has%20Flown%29">Norwegian Wood</a>' because it was the first pop record to use a <a href="sitar">sitar</a>, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." <a href="Pete%20Townshend">Pete Townshend</a> of <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a> was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." In a widely quoted statement by <a href="Barry%20Fantoni">Barry Fantoni</a>, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.

Recording began promptly on the group's next project, "<a href="Kinda%20Kinks">Kinda Kinks</a>", starting the day after their return from the Asian tour. The LP—10 of whose 12 songs were originals—was completed and released within two weeks. According to Ray Davies, the band was not completely satisfied with the final cuts, but pressure from the record company meant that no time was available to correct flaws in the mix. Davies later expressed his dissatisfaction with the production, saying, "A bit more care should have been taken with it. I think [producer] <a href="Shel%20Talmy">Shel Talmy</a> went too far in trying to keep in the rough edges. Some of the double tracking on that is appalling. It had better songs on it than the first album, but it wasn't executed in the right way. It was just far too rushed."

A significant stylistic shift in the Kinks' music became evident in late 1965, with the appearance of singles like "<a href="A%20Well%20Respected%20Man">A Well Respected Man</a>" and "<a href="Dedicated%20Follower%20of%20Fashion">Dedicated Follower of Fashion</a>", as well as the band's third album, "<a href="The%20Kink%20Kontroversy">The Kink Kontroversy</a>", on which <a href="session%20musician">session musician</a> <a href="Nicky%20Hopkins">Nicky Hopkins</a> made his first appearance with the group on keyboards. These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.

The satirical single "<a href="Sunny%20Afternoon">Sunny Afternoon</a>" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' "<a href="Paperback%20Writer">Paperback Writer</a>". Before the release of "The Kink Kontroversy", Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to step back from the band for much of 1966. Bassist <a href="John%20Dalton%20%28musician%29">John Dalton</a> filled in until Quaife returned to the group at the end of the year.

"Sunny Afternoon" was a dry run for the band's next album "<a href="Face%20to%20Face%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Face to Face</a>", which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people. Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>. He played on the band's next two studio albums as well, and was involved on a number of their live <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">BBC</a> recordings before joining <a href="the%20Jeff%20Beck%20Group">the Jeff Beck Group</a> in 1968. "Face to Face" was released in October 1966 in the UK, where it was well received and peaked at number eight. It was released in the US in December and was tipped as a potential "chart winner" by "Billboard" magazine. Despite this, it managed only a meagre chart peak of 135—a sign of the band's flagging popularity in the American market.

The Kinks' next single was a social commentary piece entitled "<a href="Dead%20End%20Street%20%28song%29">Dead End Street</a>". It was released in November 1966 and became another UK Top 10 hit, although it reached only number 73 in the United States. "Melody Maker" reviewer Bob Dawbarn praised Ray Davies' ability to create a song with "some fabulous lyrics and a marvellous melody ... combined with a great production", and music scholar <a href="Johnny%20Rogan">Johnny Rogan</a> described it as "a <a href="kitchen%20sink%20realism">kitchen sink drama</a> without the drama—a static vision of working class <a href="stoicism">stoicism</a>". One of the group's first promotional music videos was produced for the song. It was filmed on <a href="Little%20Green%20Street">Little Green Street</a>, a small 18th-century lane in north London, located off Highgate Road in <a href="Kentish%20Town">Kentish Town</a>.

The Kinks' next single, "<a href="Waterloo%20Sunset">Waterloo Sunset</a>", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the <a href="Thames">Thames</a> and <a href="London%20Waterloo%20railway%20station">Waterloo station</a>. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors <a href="Terence%20Stamp">Terence Stamp</a> and <a href="Julie%20Christie">Julie Christie</a>. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, "It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country." Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for "Waterloo Sunset" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: "We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember <a href="Steve%20Marriott">Steve Marriott</a> of the <a href="Small%20Faces">Small Faces</a> came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while." The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on "Melody Maker"'s chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> called it "the most beautiful song in the English language", and <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> senior editor <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> cited it as "possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era".

The songs on the 1967 album, "<a href="Something%20Else%20By%20The%20Kinks">Something Else By The Kinks</a>", developed the musical progressions of "Face to Face", adding English <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's "<a href="Death%20of%20a%20Clown">Death of a Clown</a>". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, "<a href="Autumn%20Almanac">Autumn Almanac</a>", in early October. Backed with "<a href="Mister%20Pleasant">Mister Pleasant</a>", the single became another Top 5 success for the group. Andy Miller points out that, despite its success, the single marks a turning point in the band's career—it would be their last entry into the UK Top Ten for three years: "In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked the first hint of trouble for the Kinks. This glorious single, one of the greatest achievements of British 60s pop, was widely criticised at the time for being too similar to previous Davies efforts." Nick Jones of "Melody Maker" asked, "Is it time that Ray stopped writing about grey suburbanites going about their fairly unemotional daily business? ... Ray works to a formula, not a feeling, and it's becoming rather boring." Disc jockey Mike Ahern called the song "a load of old rubbish". Dave's second solo single, "<a href="Susannah%27s%20Still%20Alive">Susannah's Still Alive</a>", was released in the UK on 24 November. It sold a modest 59,000 copies, but failed to reach the Top 10. Miller states that "by the end of the year, the Kinks were rapidly sliding out of fashion".

Beginning early in 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead focusing on work in the studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, "<a href="Wonderboy%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">Wonderboy</a>", released in the spring of 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called "Village Green". In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was <a href="Peter%20Frampton">Peter Frampton</a>'s group <a href="The%20Herd%20%28UK%20band%29">The Herd</a>. "In general, the <a href="teenybopper">teenybopper</a>s were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." At the end of June, the Kinks released the single "<a href="Days%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">Days</a>", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. "I played it to Brian, who used to be our <a href="roadie">roadie</a>, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset. ... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone." "Days" reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.

"Village Green" eventually morphed into their next album, "<a href="The%20Kinks%20Are%20the%20Village%20Green%20Preservation%20Society">The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</a>", released in late 1968 in the UK. A collection of thematic vignettes of English town and hamlet life, it was assembled from songs written and recorded over the previous two years. It was greeted with almost unanimously positive reviews from both UK and US rock critics, yet failed to sell strongly. One factor in the album's initial commercial failure was the lack of a popular single. It did not include the moderately successful "Days"; "Starstruck" was released in North America and continental Europe, but was unsuccessful. Though a commercial disappointment, "Village Green" (the project's original name was adopted as shorthand for the long album title) was embraced by the new underground rock press when it came out in January 1969 in the United States, where the Kinks began to acquire a reputation as a cult band. In "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", a newly hired <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> called it "the best album of the year so far". The underground Boston paper "Fusion" published a review stating, "the Kinks continue, despite the odds, the bad press and their demonstrated lot, to come across. ... Their persistence is dignified, their virtues are stoic. The Kinks are forever, only for now in modern dress." The record did not escape criticism, however. In the student paper "California Tech", one writer commented that it was "schmaltz rock ... without imagination, poorly arranged and a poor copy of The Beatles". Although it sold only an estimated 100,000 copies worldwide on its initial release, it has since become the Kinks' best-selling original record. The album remains popular; in 2004, it was re-released in a 3-CD "Deluxe" edition and one of its tracks, "Picture Book", was featured in a popular <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a> television commercial, helping to boost the album's popularity considerably.

In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in "<a href="New%20Musical%20Express">New Musical Express</a>" on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album "<a href="Sleepwalker%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Sleepwalker</a>" was released.

Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, "<a href="Arthur%20%28Or%20the%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20British%20Empire%29">Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)</a>". As with the previous two albums, "Arthur" was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical <a href="Hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a>. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the <a href="Fillmore%20East">Fillmore East</a> and <a href="Whisky%20a%20Go%20Go">Whisky a Go Go</a>.

The band added keyboardist John Gosling to their line-up in early 1970; before this Nicky Hopkins, along with Ray, had done most of the session work on keyboards. In May 1970 Gosling debuted with the Kinks on "<a href="Lola%20%28song%29">Lola</a>", an account of a confused romantic encounter with a <a href="transvestism">transvestite</a>, that became both a UK and US Top 10 hit, helping return the Kinks to the public eye. The lyrics originally contained the word "<a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>", and as a result the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> refused to broadcast the song, considering it to be in violation of their policy against <a href="product%20placement">product placement</a>. Part of the song was hastily rerecorded by Ray Davies, with the offending line changed to the generic "cherry cola", although in concert the Kinks still used "Coca-Cola". Recordings of both versions of "Lola" exist. The accompanying album "<a href="Lola%20Versus%20Powerman%20and%20the%20Moneygoround%2C%20Part%20One">Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One</a>" was released in November 1970. It was a critical and commercial success, charting in the Top 40 in the US, making it their most successful album since the mid-1960s. After the success of "Lola", the band went on to release "<a href="Percy%20%28soundtrack%29">Percy</a>" in 1971, a soundtrack album to a <a href="Percy%20%281971%20film%29">film of the same name</a> about a penis transplant. The album, which consisted largely of instrumentals, did not receive positive reviews. The band's US label, Reprise, declined to release it in the US, precipitating a major dispute that contributed to the band's departure from the label. Directly after the release of the album, the band's contracts with Pye and Reprise expired.

Before the end of 1971, the Kinks signed a five-album deal with RCA Records and received a million-dollar advance, which helped fund the construction of their own recording studio, <a href="Konk%20%28recording%29">Konk</a>. Their debut for RCA, "<a href="Muswell%20Hillbillies">Muswell Hillbillies</a>", was replete with the influence of music hall and traditional American musical styles, including country and bluegrass. It is often hailed as their last great record, though it was not as successful as its predecessors. It was named after <a href="Muswell%20Hill">Muswell Hill</a>, where the Davies brothers were brought up, and contained songs focusing on working-class life and, again, the Davies' childhood. "Muswell Hillbillies", despite positive reviews and high expectations, peaked at number 48 on the "<a href="Record%20World">Record World</a>" chart and number 100 on the "Billboard" chart. It was followed in 1972 by a double album, "<a href="Everybody%27s%20in%20Show-Biz">Everybody's in Show-Biz</a>", which consisted of both studio tracks and live numbers recorded during a two-night stand at Carnegie Hall. The record featured the ballad "<a href="Celluloid%20Heroes">Celluloid Heroes</a>" and the Caribbean-themed "<a href="Supersonic%20Rocket%20Ship">Supersonic Rocket Ship</a>", their last UK Top 20 hit for more than a decade. "Celluloid Heroes" is a bittersweet rumination on dead and fading Hollywood stars (Mickey Rooney was still alive), in which the narrator declares that he wishes his life were like a movie "because celluloid heroes never feel any pain... and celluloid heroes never really die." The album was moderately successful in the United States, peaking at number 47 in "Record World" and number 70 in "Billboard". It marks the transition between the band's early 1970s rock material and the theatrical incarnation in which they immersed themselves for the next four years.

In 1973, Ray Davies dived headlong into the theatrical style, beginning with the rock opera "Preservation", a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier "Village Green Preservation Society" ethos. In conjunction with the "Preservation" project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring the group as a theatrical troupe.

Ray Davies' marital problems during this period began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at <a href="White%20City%20Stadium">White City Stadium</a> he told the audience he was "fucking sick of the whole thing", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness as well as his depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies "decided to work again ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's been a different person ever since."<ref name="Marten/Hudson 128-129">Marten, Neville; Hudson, Jeff (2001). pp. 128–129</ref>

"<a href="Preservation%20Act%201">Preservation Act 1</a>" (1973) and "<a href="Preservation%20Act%202">Preservation Act 2</a>" (1974) received generally poor reviews. The story on the albums involved an anti-hero called Mr Flash, and his rival and enemy Mr Black (played by Dave Davies during live shows), an ultra-purist and corporatist. "Preservation Act 2" was the first album recorded at Konk Studio; from this point forward, virtually every Kinks studio recording was produced by Ray Davies at Konk. The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the "Preservation" story for stage. <a href="Musicologist">Musicologist</a> Eric Weisbard: "[Ray] Davies expanded the Kinks into a road troupe of perhaps a dozen costumed actors, singers and horn players. ... Smoother and tighter than on record, "Preservation" live proved funnier as well."

Davies began another project for Granada Television, a musical called "Starmaker". After a broadcast with Ray Davies in the starring role and the Kinks as both back-up band and ancillary characters, the project eventually morphed into the concept album "<a href="Soap%20Opera%20%28album%29">The Kinks Present a Soap Opera</a>", released in May 1975, in which Ray Davies fantasised about what would happen if a rock star traded places with a "normal Norman" and took a 9–5 job. In August 1975, the Kinks recorded their final theatrical work, "<a href="Schoolboys%20in%20Disgrace">Schoolboys in Disgrace</a>", a backstory biography of "Preservation's" Mr Flash. The record was a modest success, peaking at number 45 on the "Billboard" charts.

Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with <a href="Arista%20Records">Arista Records</a> in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an <a href="arena%20rock">arena rock</a> band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. <a href="Andy%20Pyle">Andy Pyle</a> was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. "<a href="Sleepwalker%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Sleepwalker</a>", released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the "Billboard" chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, "<a href="Misfits%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Misfits</a>", Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–<a href="Pretty%20Things">Pretty Things</a> keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, "Misfits", the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit "<a href="A%20Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll%20Fantasy">A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy</a>", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single "<a href="Father%20Christmas%20%28song%29">Father Christmas</a>" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer <a href="Henry%20Spinetti">Henry Spinetti</a>'s drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song "Father Christmas" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-<a href="Argent%20%28band%29">Argent</a> bassist <a href="Jim%20Rodford">Jim Rodford</a> joined the band before the recording of "<a href="Low%20Budget%20%28album%29">Low Budget</a>", on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist <a href="Ian%20Gibbons%20%28musician%29">Ian Gibbons</a> was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow.

Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as <a href="the%20Jam">the Jam</a> ("<a href="David%20Watts%20%28song%29">David Watts</a>"), <a href="the%20Pretenders">the Pretenders</a> ("<a href="Stop%20Your%20Sobbing">Stop Your Sobbing</a>", "<a href="I%20Go%20to%20Sleep">I Go to Sleep</a>") and <a href="the%20Knack">the Knack</a> ("<a href="The%20Hard%20Way%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">The Hard Way</a>") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases. In 1978, <a href="Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a> covered "You Really Got Me" for their debut single, a Top 40 US hit, helping boost the band's commercial resurgence (Van Halen later covered "<a href="Where%20Have%20All%20the%20Good%20Times%20Gone">Where Have All the Good Times Gone</a>", another early Kinks song which had been covered by David Bowie on his 1973 album <a href="Pin%20Ups">Pin Ups</a>). The hard rock sound of "Low Budget", released in 1979, helped make it the Kinks' second <a href="gold%20album">gold album</a> and highest charting original album in the US, where it peaked at number 11. In 1980, the group's third live album, "<a href="One%20for%20the%20Road%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">One for the Road</a>", was produced, along with a video of the same title, bringing the group's concert-drawing power to a peak that would last into 1983. Dave Davies also took advantage of the group's improved commercial standing to fulfill his decade-long ambitions to release albums of his solo work. The first was the <a href="eponym">eponym</a>ous "Dave Davies" in 1980. It was also known by its catalogue number "AFL1-3603" because of its cover art, which depicted Dave Davies as a leather-jacketed piece of price-scanning barcode. He produced another, less successful, solo album in 1981, "Glamour".

The next Kinks album, "<a href="Give%20the%20People%20What%20They%20Want%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Give the People What They Want</a>", was released in late 1981 and reached number 15 in the US. The record attained gold status and featured the UK hit single "<a href="Better%20Things%20%28song%29">Better Things</a>" as well as "<a href="Destroyer%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">Destroyer</a>", a major <a href="Mainstream%20Rock">Mainstream Rock</a> hit for the group. To promote the album, the Kinks spent the end of 1981 and most of 1982 touring relentlessly, and played multiple sell-out concerts throughout Australia, Japan, England and the US. The tour culminated with a performance at the <a href="US%20Festival">US Festival</a> in San Bernardino, California, for a crowd of 205,000. In spring 1983, the song "<a href="Come%20Dancing%20%28song%29">Come Dancing</a>" became their biggest American hit since "Tired of Waiting for You", peaking at number six. It also became the group's first Top 20 hit in the UK since 1972, peaking at number 12 in the charts. The accompanying album, "<a href="State%20of%20Confusion">State of Confusion</a>", was another commercial success, reaching number 12 in the US, but, like all of the group's albums since 1967, it failed to chart in the UK. Another single released from the record, "Don't Forget to Dance", became a US top 30 hit and minor UK chart entry.

The Kinks' second wave of popularity remained at a peak with "State of Confusion", but that success began to fade, a trend that also affected their <a href="British%20rock">British rock</a> contemporaries <a href="the%20Rolling%20Stones">the Rolling Stones</a> and <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a>. During the second half of 1983, Ray Davies started work on an ambitious solo film project, "<a href="Return%20to%20Waterloo">Return to Waterloo</a>", about a London commuter who daydreams that he is a serial murderer. The film gave actor <a href="Tim%20Roth">Tim Roth</a> a significant early role. Davies' commitment to writing, directing and scoring the new work caused tension in his relationship with his brother. Another problem was the stormy end of the relationship between Ray Davies and <a href="Chrissie%20Hynde">Chrissie Hynde</a>. The old feud between Dave Davies and drummer Mick Avory also re-ignited. Davies eventually refused to work with Avory, and called for him to be replaced by <a href="Bob%20Henrit">Bob Henrit</a>, former drummer of <a href="Argent%20%28band%29">Argent</a> (of which Jim Rodford had also been a member). Avory left the band, and Henrit was brought in to take his place. Ray Davies, who was still on amiable terms with Avory, invited him to manage Konk Studios. Avory accepted, and continued to serve as a producer and occasional contributor on later Kinks albums.

Between the completion of "Return to Waterloo" and Avory's departure, the band had begun work on "<a href="Word%20of%20Mouth%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Word of Mouth</a>", their final Arista album, released in November 1984. As a result it includes Avory on three tracks, with Henrit and a <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a> on the rest. Many of the songs also appeared as solo recordings on Ray Davies' "Return to Waterloo" soundtrack album. "Word of Mouth"s lead track, "Do It Again", was released as a single in April 1985. It reached number 41 in the US, the band's last entry into the "Billboard" Hot 100. Coinciding with the album's release, the first three books on the Kinks were published: "The Kinks: The Official Biography", by <a href="Jon%20Savage">Jon Savage</a>; "The Kinks Kronikles", by rock critic <a href="John%20Mendelsohn%20%28musician%29">John Mendelsohn</a>, who had overseen the 1972 "<a href="The%20Kink%20Kronikles">The Kink Kronikles</a>" compilation album; and "The Kinks—The Sound And The Fury" ("The Kinks—A Mental Institution" in the US), by <a href="Johnny%20Rogan">Johnny Rogan</a>.

In early 1986, the group signed with <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a> in the United States and London Records in the UK. Their first album for the new labels, "<a href="Think%20Visual">Think Visual</a>", released later that year, was a moderate success, peaking at number 81 on the "Billboard" albums chart. Songs like the ballad "Lost and Found" and "Working at the Factory" concerned blue-collar life on an assembly line, while the title track was an attack on the very MTV video culture from which the band had profited earlier in the decade. The Kinks followed "Think Visual" in 1987 with another live album, "The Road", which was a mediocre commercial and critical performer. In 1989, the Kinks released "<a href="UK%20Jive">UK Jive</a>", a commercial failure, making only a momentary entry into the album charts at number 122. MCA Records ultimately dropped them, leaving the Kinks without a label deal for the first time in over a quarter of a century. Longtime keyboardist Ian Gibbons left the group and was replaced by Mark Haley.

In 1990, their first year of eligibility, the Kinks were inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>. Mick Avory and Pete Quaife were present for the award. The induction, however, did not revive the Kinks' stalled career. A compilation from the <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a> period, "<a href="Lost%20%26amp%3B%20Found%20%281986-1989%29">Lost & Found (1986-1989)</a>", was released in 1991 to fulfil contractual obligations, and marked the official end of the group's relationship with MCA. The band then signed with <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> and released the five-song EP "Did Ya" in 1991 which, despite being coupled with a new studio re-recording of the band's 1968 British hit "Days", failed to chart.

The Kinks reverted to a four-piece band for the recording of their first Columbia album, "<a href="Phobia%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Phobia</a>", in 1993. Following Mark Haley's departure after the band's sellout performance at the Royal Albert Hall, London, Gibbons rejoined the Kinks for a US tour. "Phobia" managed only one week in the US "Billboard" chart at number 166; as had by then become usual for the band, it made no impression in the UK. One single, "<a href="Only%20a%20Dream">Only a Dream</a>", narrowly failed to reach the British chart. "<a href="Scattered%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">Scattered</a>", the album's final candidate for release as a single, was announced, followed by TV and radio promotion, but the record was unavailable in stores—several months later a small number appeared on the collector market. The group was dropped by Columbia in 1994. In the same year, the band released the first version of the album "<a href="To%20the%20Bone%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">To the Bone</a>" on their own <a href="Konk%20%28recording%29">Konk</a> label in the UK. This live acoustic album was partly recorded on the highly successful UK tours of 1993 and 1994 and partly in the Konk studio, before a small, invited audience. Two years later the band released a new, improved, live double CD set in the USA, which retained the same name and contained two new studio tracks, "Animal" and "To The Bone". The CD set also featured new treatments of many old Kinks hits. The record drew respectable press but failed to chart in either the US or the UK.

The band's profile rose considerably in the mid-1990s, primarily as a result of the "<a href="Britpop">Britpop</a>" boom. Several of the most prominent bands of the decade cited the Kinks as a major influence. Despite such accolades, the group's commercial viability continued to decline. They gradually became less active, leading Ray and Dave Davies to pursue their own interests. Each released an autobiography; Ray's "X-Ray" was published in early 1995, and Dave responded with his memoir "Kink", published a year later. The Kinks gave their last public performance in mid-1996, and the group assembled for what would turn out to be their last time together at a party for Dave's 50th birthday. Kinks chronicler and historian Doug Hinman stated, "The symbolism of the event was impossible to overlook. The party was held at the site of the brothers' very first musical endeavour, the Clissold Arms pub, across the street from their childhood home on Fortis Green in North London."

The band members subsequently focused on solo projects, and Ray and Dave released their own studio albums. Talk of a Kinks reunion circulated (including an aborted studio reunion of the original band members in 1999), but neither Ray nor Dave Davies showed much interest in playing together again. Meanwhile, former members John Gosling, John Dalton and Mick Avory had regrouped in 1994 and started performing on the oldies circuit along with guitar-player/singer <a href="Dave%20Clarke%20%28musician%29">Dave Clarke</a> as <a href="the%20Kast%20Off%20Kinks">the Kast Off Kinks</a>.

Ray Davies released the solo album "Storyteller", a companion piece to "X-Ray", in 1998. Originally written two years earlier as a cabaret-style show, it celebrated his old band and his estranged brother. Seeing the programming possibilities in his music/dialogue/reminiscence format, the American music television network <a href="VH1">VH1</a> launched a series of similar projects featuring established rock artists titled "<a href="VH1%20Storytellers">VH1 Storytellers</a>". Dave Davies spoke favourably of a Kinks reunion in early 2003, and as the 40th anniversary of the group's breakthrough neared, both of the Davies brothers expressed interest in working together again. However, hopes for a reunion were dashed in June 2004 when Dave suffered a stroke while exiting an elevator, temporarily impairing his ability to speak and play guitar. Following Dave's recovery, the Kinks were inducted into the <a href="UK%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame">UK Music Hall of Fame</a> in November 2005, with all four of the original band members in attendance. The award was presented by <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a>'s guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend, a longtime Kinks fan and friend of Ray Davies. The induction helped fuel sales for the group; in August 2007, a re-entry of "<a href="The%20Ultimate%20Collection%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">The Ultimate Collection</a>", a compilation of material spanning the band's career, reached number 32 on the UK Top 100 album chart and number one on the UK Indie album chart.

In December 2007, "<a href="Record%20Collector">Record Collector</a>" published an interview with Ray Davies in which he said, "I spoke to Quaife about a month ago and he dearly wants to make another record with me. I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. It would be great to get back together just to see what musical ideas we had, and what would happen." The "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that "it would be like a bad remake of "<a href="Night%20of%20the%20Living%20Dead">Night of the Living Dead</a>"" and added, "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996."

In June 2009, Ray Davies told "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" that while a full-fledged reunion was unlikely, "I will continue to play with ex-band members like Mick Avory from time to time. With Dave, a lot of it is psychological. I'll guide him in, and coerce and nurture him, and when the time is right I suppose I'll even shout at him again." When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, "A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well." In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had "eight tracks" ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress.

Quaife, who had been receiving kidney dialysis for more than ten years, died on 23 June 2010, aged 66. Two days after the bassist's death, Dave Davies posted a statement on his message board expressing deep sorrow over the passing of his former band mate and stating that Quaife "was never really given the credit he deserved for his contribution and involvement [with The Kinks]". Ray Davies dedicated his performance of 27 June at the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> to Quaife and performed several Quaife-era Kinks songs in tribute to him. Davies told the crowd, "I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him."

In separate interviews early in 2011 both Davies brothers spoke positively about a potential reunion. Dave Davies explained, "There's nothing in the pipeline yet, but ... we'll see. It's possible." Each has said that any reunion would be dependent on the other. According to Ray Davies, the brothers were to meet in April to discuss future plans. In October that year, Dave Davies quashed rumours of a reunion, stating in an interview that although he loves his brother, "I just can't stand to be with him. About an hour with Ray's my limit, so it would be a very short reunion." In November of that year Ray Davies reported that he had recently recorded with Avory "just to sort of try to do what we call demos ... we might do it in fits and starts and bring Dave in at a later date. I'll never say never with my brother, because he's totally unpredictable." In a 2013 <a href="Skype">Skype</a> interview Dave Davies expressed interest in doing reunion shows. On 18 December 2015, Ray Davies joined Dave Davies onstage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London to perform "You Really Got Me". On 5 November 2016, Dave Davies posted on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>: "Me and Ray have not spoken about Kinks shows at all – although were trying to work together on other stuff and have worked on music together". Dave Davies subsequently confirmed that the Davies brothers had recorded 4–5 demos of new songs together for a potential concept album in 2016, but that they had both gotten too distracted by their respective solo work to complete the project. In a "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%20%28magazine%29">Rolling Stone</a>" interview, Davies stated that, "We came up with a few songs and some lyrics and had a nice interaction. So he's [Ray] got demos on his computer, and I've got them on mine in a different form. I hope we'll get together and do something with them, but who knows."

On 20 January 2018, long-time bassist Jim Rodford died at the age of 76.

In June 2018, the Davies brothers confirmed that they are working on a new Kinks studio album with Avory. Ray Davies was inspired to reform the band by the recent <a href="Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a> tour, and had accumulated a backlog of songs he wanted to record with the band.

The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born.

The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a "package" bill that included <a href="Manfred%20Mann">Manfred Mann</a> and <a href="the%20Honeycombs">the Honeycombs</a>. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as <a href="the%20Yardbirds">the Yardbirds</a> and <a href="Mickey%20Finn%20%28musician%29">Mickey Finn</a>. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, "You Really Got Me", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Musicians">American Federation of Musicians</a> refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.

In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was "sick of it all" at a gig in <a href="White%20City%20Stadium">White City Stadium</a> in 1973. A review of the concert published in "Melody Maker" stated: "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F... sick of the whole thing' ... He was 'Sick up to here with it' ... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer on through 'Waterloo Sunset. Davies proceeded to try to announce that the Kinks were breaking up as the band were leaving the stage, but this attempt was foiled by the group's publicity management, who pulled the plug on the microphone system.

The Kinks started out playing the then popular <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> and <a href="blues">blues</a> styles; then, under the influence of <a href="The%20Kingsmen">The Kingsmen</a>'s "<a href="Louie%20Louie">Louie Louie</a>" recording, developed louder rock and <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> sounds — due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as "the original <a href="Punk%20rock">punks</a>". Dave Davies was "really bored with this guitar sound – or lack of an interesting sound" so he purchased "a little green amplifier ... an Elpico" from a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill, and "twiddled around with it", including "taking the wires going to the speaker and putting a jack plug on there and plugging it straight into my <a href="Vox%20AC30">AC30</a>" (a larger amplifier), but didn't get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and "got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut round the <a href="Speaker%20cone">cone</a> [from the centre to the edge] ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing." The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into the Vox AC30, and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings—most notably on "You Really Got Me" and "All Day and All of the Night".

From 1966 onwards, The Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British bands dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and pop styles. Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. "I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote '<a href="Well%20Respected%20Man">Well Respected Man</a>'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent." The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Musicians">American Federation of Musicians</a>. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market, forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, incorporating elements of <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a>, <a href="folk%20music">folk</a>, and <a href="baroque%20music">baroque music</a> through use of <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a>, <a href="mellotron">mellotron</a>, and <a href="horn%20instrument">horns</a>, in albums such as <a href="Face%20to%20Face%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Face to Face</a>, <a href="Something%20Else%20by%20The%20Kinks">Something Else</a>, <a href="The%20Kinks%20Are%20the%20Village%20Green%20Preservation%20Society">The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</a>, and <a href="Arthur%20%28Or%20the%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20British%20Empire%29">Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)</a>, creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.

Beginning with "Everybody's In Show-biz" (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album "Preservation Act 1" and continued through "Schoolboys In Disgrace" (1976). The Kinks were less commercially successful with these conceptual works, and were dropped by RCA which had signed them in 1971. In 1977 they moved to Arista Records, who insisted on a more traditional rock format. "Sleepwalker" (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm. The band returned to hard rock for "Low Budget" (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.

The Kinks are regarded as one of the most influential rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s. Stephen Thomas Erlewine called The Kinks "one of the most influential bands of the British Invasion". They were ranked 65th on "Rolling Stone" "Magazine"'s "100 Greatest Artists of All Time" list.

Artists influenced by The Kinks include <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> groups such as the <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a>, <a href="The%20Clash">The Clash</a>, and <a href="The%20Jam">The Jam</a>, <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> acts including <a href="Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a> and <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> groups such as <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a>, <a href="Blur%20%28band%29">Blur</a> and <a href="Pulp%20%28band%29">Pulp</a>. <a href="Craig%20Nicholls">Craig Nicholls</a>, singer and guitarist of <a href="The%20Vines%20%28band%29">The Vines</a>, described the Kinks as "great songwriters, so underrated". <a href="Pete%20Townshend">Pete Townshend</a>, guitarist with the Kinks' contemporaries <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a>, credited Ray Davies with inventing "a new kind of poetry and a new kind of language for pop writing that influenced me from the very, very, very beginning." Jon Savage wrote that The Kinks were an influence on late 1960s American <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a> groups "like <a href="The%20Doors">The Doors</a>, <a href="Love%20%28band%29">Love</a> and <a href="Jefferson%20Airplane">Jefferson Airplane</a>". Music writers and other musicians have acknowledged the influence of the Kinks on the development of <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> and heavy metal. <a href="Musicology">Musicologist</a> Joe Harrington stated: "You Really Got Me', 'All Day and All of the Night' and 'I Need You' were predecessors of the whole three-chord genre... [T]he Kinks did a lot to help turn rock 'n' roll (<a href="Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis">Jerry Lee Lewis</a>) into rock." <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a> guitarist <a href="Brian%20May">Brian May</a> credited the band with planting "the seed which grew into riff-based music."

A musical, "<a href="Sunny%20Afternoon%20%28musical%29">Sunny Afternoon</a>", based on the early life of Ray Davies and the formation of the Kinks, opened at the <a href="Hampstead%20Theatre">Hampstead Theatre</a> in April 2014. The musical's name came from the band's 1966 hit single "<a href="Sunny%20Afternoon">Sunny Afternoon</a>" and features songs from the band's back catalogue.

In 2015, it was reported that <a href="Julien%20Temple">Julien Temple</a> would direct a biopic of The Kinks titled "You Really Got Me", with singer-songwriter <a href="Johnny%20Flynn%20%28musician%29">Johnny Flynn</a> and actor <a href="George%20MacKay%20%28actor%29">George MacKay</a> cast to play Ray and Dave Davies, respectively.

The Kinks were active for 32 years from 1964 to 1996, releasing 28 regular albums in the UK (24 studio, four live), and 30 in the USA (24 studio, four live, two compilation). The early 1960s US albums were slightly different from the British albums partly due to the method that publishing royalties were calculated in the two countries, partly due to difference in popularity of the <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> format (popular in the UK but not in the US, so US albums had the EP releases bundled onto them), and partly due to the US albums including the hit singles, and the UK albums not; after "<a href="The%20Kink%20Kontroversy">The Kink Kontroversy</a>" in 1965 the albums were the same. There have been somewhere between 100 and 200 compilation albums released worldwide. Their hit singles include three UK number-one singles, starting in 1964 with "<a href="You%20Really%20Got%20Me">You Really Got Me</a>"; plus 18 Top 40 singles in the 1960s alone and further Top 40 hits in the 1970s and 1980s.




The Kinks had five Top 10 singles on the US "Billboard" chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, the group had seventeen Top 20 singles along with five Top 10 albums. The <a href="RIAA">RIAA</a> has certified four of the Kinks' albums as <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">gold record</a>s. "<a href="Greatest%20Hits%21">Greatest Hits!</a>", released in 1965, was certified gold for sales of 1,000,000 on 28 November 1968—six days after the release of "The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society", which failed to chart worldwide. The group would not receive another gold record award until 1979's "Low Budget". The 1980 live album "One For The Road" was certified gold on 8 December 1980. "Give The People What They Want", released in 1981, received its certification on 25 January 1982, for sales of 500,000 copies. <a href="ASCAP">ASCAP</a>, the <a href="Performing%20rights">performing-rights</a> group, presented the Kinks with an award for "One of the Most Played Songs Of 1983" for the hit single "Come Dancing".

The group received the <a href="Ivor%20Novello%20Award">Ivor Novello Award</a> for "Outstanding Service to British Music", and in 1990 the original four members of the Kinks were inducted into the <a href="Rock%20%26amp%3B%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</a>. The Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005.

S. O. Davies

Stephen Owen Davies (before 1889 – 25 February 1972), generally known as S. O. Davies, was a <a href="Wales">Welsh</a> <a href="Coal%20mining">miner</a>, <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> official and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> politician, who served as the <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Merthyr Tydfil</a> from 1950 to 1972, and previously <a href="Merthyr%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Merthyr</a> from 1934 to 1950. In 1970, when well past 80, he was <a href="preselection">deselected</a> as parliamentary candidate by his local party association on account of his age. He fought the constituency in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201970">1970 general election</a> as an <a href="Independent%20politician%23United%20Kingdom">Independent</a> and won comfortably, a rare example in British politics of an independent candidate defeating a major party's organisation.

Most official records show Davies's birth date as November 1886, but he is widely thought to have been born at least four years earlier. After leaving school aged 12 and working for some years in local pits, Davies studied <a href="mining%20engineering">mining engineering</a> and later took an <a href="Liberal%20arts%20education">Arts</a> degree at <a href="Cardiff%20University">University College, Cardiff</a>. He returned to the coalfields in 1913, and established a reputation for militancy. In 1918 he was elected miners' agent for the <a href="Dowlais">Dowlais</a> district of the <a href="South%20Wales%20Miners%27%20Federation">South Wales Miners' Federation</a> (SWMF), and in 1924 was appointed SWMF's chief organiser, legal adviser, and vice-president. After a visit to <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> in 1922 he became a firm advocate of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, a position he maintained for the rest of his life.

After his election to parliament in 1934, Davies was a consistent advocate for the interests of Merthyr Tydfil and the <a href="Mining%20in%20Wales">Welsh mining community</a>. Largely indifferent to party discipline, he defied official Labour policy by championing such causes as <a href="disarmament">disarmament</a> and <a href="Welsh%20nationalism">Welsh nationalism</a>. His persistence in doing so brought him several suspensions from the party, and he was never offered ministerial office. An immensely popular figure locally, he was regularly returned at general elections with large majorities. In 1966, after an unstable <a href="Aberfan%20disaster">colliery spoil tip collapsed</a> on the village of Aberfan with the loss of 144 lives, Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe. He had not reported his suspicions, for fear that an inquiry would cause the closures of local pits. Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph, Davies died early in 1972 aged at least 85 and possibly 90 or more.

There is uncertainty about Davies's date of birth. Most records say November 1886, though usually with the caveat that he might have been born several years earlier. His birthplace was 39 John Street, <a href="Abercwmboi">Abercwmboi</a> (then known as Cap Coch) in the <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a> coalfields, the fourth child of Thomas Davies and his wife Esther. Thomas was a miner and trade union activist, who under the pseudonym "Y Llwynog" ("the Fox") wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper "<a href="Tarian%20y%20Gweithiwr">Tarian y Gweithiwr</a>" ("The Worker's Shield"), in which he berated pit management and safety practices. His general militancy led to his <a href="blacklisting">blacklisting</a> by pit owners, and after spells of unemployment he eventually found work as an insurance agent.

Davies attended the local Cap Coch school, leaving at the age of 12, as was usual at that time, to begin work in the <a href="Cwmpennar">Cwmpennar</a> coal mine. He remained there until the mine was exhausted in 1905, when he moved to <a href="Mountain%20Ash%2C%20Rhondda%20Cynon%20Taf">Mountain Ash</a> to work at <a href="John%20Nixon%20%28mining%20engineer%29">Nixon's Navigation Colliery</a>. His ambition and intelligence were quickly recognised by his superiors, and he was encouraged to study mining engineering, at first locally in <a href="Aberdare">Aberdare</a> and, in 1907, at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Science">Royal College of Science</a> in London. In 1908, with sponsorship from the Brecon Memorial College, he passed his <a href="matriculation">matriculation</a> and began studying for a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> (BA) degree at <a href="Cardiff%20University">University College, Cardiff</a>, with a view thereafter to entering the nonconformist ministry. However, Davies's religious beliefs were influenced by <a href="Reginald%20John%20Campbell">R. J. Campbell</a>, a noted preacher who rejected much traditional Christian teaching and asserted that <a href="socialism">socialism</a> was the practical expression of Christianity. Davies's association with such supposed heresies was unacceptable to the Brecon college, which withdrew its financial support.

Despite this loss of sponsorship, Davies completed his studies and graduated in 1913. His plans to enter the ministry were abandoned; he was an active member of the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a> (ILP), and his religious vocation had been replaced by a commitment to working-class politics. In 1913, while still a student, he stood for election to <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>'s <a href="Board%20of%20Guardians">Board of Guardians</a>, as the ILP candidate in the Grangetown ward. This first foray into electoral politics ended in a narrow defeat, by 47 votes.

After graduation, Davies returned to work in the mines, initially at <a href="Tumble%2C%20Carmarthenshire">Tumble</a> in the Gwendraeth Valley. In December 1913 he unsuccessfully sought election as miners' sub-agent for the Anthracite Miners' district of the SWMF. When the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> began in August 1914 he opposed it as capitalist militarism: "History teaches that war invariably brings in its wake a lower standard of morality, a restriction of the liberty of the masses, and a degradation of their social conditions". In 1917 Davies founded and was first chairman of the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Trades and Labour Council. He was initially selected as the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> candidate for the <a href="Llanelli%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Llanelli</a> constituency in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201918">1918 general election</a>, but stood down when the SWMF backed his rival, <a href="John%20Henry%20Williams%20%28Llanelli%20MP%29">J. H. Williams</a>.

In 1918 Davies sought the position of miners' agent for the <a href="Dowlais">Dowlais</a> district of the SWMF. Against strong competition—his main opponent was <a href="William%20Mainwaring">William Mainwaring</a>, later a long-serving Labour MP for <a href="Rhondda%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Rhondda East</a>—Davies was victorious by 100 votes. The main role of the agent was to represent miners in disputes with their employers; typically these would involve issues of pay, redundancy, working hours, and compensation for injuries. Davies's surviving day books reveal the extent to which he was concerned with cases where the mining companies denied liability for underground injuries.

In 1919 Davies married Margaret ("Madge") Eley from Cardiff; three daughters were subsequently born. The years following the First World War saw economic decline and hardship in the South Wales coalfields, conditions which deepened Davies's radical instincts, and he began to acquire a reputation for militancy. Contrary to mainstream Labour Party policy, Davies advocated workers' control rather than the nationalisation of the mining industry. In 1921 he unsuccessfully advocated affiliation of the <a href="Miners%27%20Federation%20of%20Great%20Britain">Miners' Federation of Great Britain</a> (MFGB, precursor of the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Mineworkers%20%28Great%20Britain%29">National Union of Mineworkers</a> or NUM) with the <a href="Profintern">Red International of Labour Unions</a> (RILU). The following year he was a delegate from the SWMF to the Second World Congress of the RILU in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, and acquired a warm sympathy towards the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> system. He did not, however, join the recently formed <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a>, and remained within the Labour Party.

In 1924 Davies was appointed SWMF's chief organiser and legal adviser, and was elected its vice-president. He also served as the South Wales representative on the executive committee of the MFGB from 1924 to 1934. During the May 1926 <a href="1926%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20strike">general strike</a>, the South Wales miners were among the most fervent in support of the action. When the national strike collapsed after nine days, Davies led the continued resistance from the Welsh coalfields through months of <a href="Lockout%20%28industry%29">lockout</a>, before capitulation on harsh terms in December. Dowlais was the last district to return to work. The period following 1926 was marked by much in-fighting between communist and non-communist factions in the coalfields. Davies and other non-communists found themselves accused of collaboration with "social fascism"; a leaflet issued by the communist-led <a href="National%20Minority%20Movement">National Minority Movement</a> termed him "the sham militant". Nevertheless, he continued to work for cooperation between all factions on the left. After <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a> came to power in Germany in 1933, Davies argued for unity around the Labour Party, believing that the ILP's increasingly left-wing stance, and the Communist Party's commitment to violent revolution, might create the conditions for fascism. In 1931 Davies was elected to <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil%20County%20Borough">Merthyr Tydfil Borough Council</a>.

When <a href="R.%20C.%20Wallhead">Richard Wallhead</a>, the Labour MP for <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Merthyr</a>, died on 27 April 1934, Davies was selected as the party's candidate for the <a href="Merthyr%20by-election%2C%201934">June by-election</a>, with the support of the MFGB. Wallhead had held the seat since 1922, with large majorities; in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201931">1931 general election</a> he had defeated a single opponent, a candidate from <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a>'s <a href="New%20Party%20%28UK%29">New Party</a> who had received tacit support from the Conservative Party. Davies faced opposition from the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a>, the Communist Party and the ILP. With no candidate from the ruling <a href="National%20Government%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Government</a> in the field, Davies was denied an obvious target for attack; as the "<a href="Manchester%20Guardian">Manchester Guardian</a>" stated in its pre-poll analysis, he was put on the defensive: "His is the dispiriting task of trying to lose as few votes as possible". The paper predicted a close result.

Using the slogan "Peace, Prosperity, Security, Freedom", Davies advocated the extension of <a href="State%20ownership">public ownership</a>, abolition of the <a href="Means%20test%23United%20Kingdom">means test</a>, increased unemployment benefit, better education, and international co-operation especially with Russia. He dismissed the ILP as having no function beyond the splitting of the Labour vote. With strong support from the local trade unions and helped by a well-organised campaign, Davies swept to an easy victory on 5 June. His 18,645 votes gave him a majority of 8,269 over his Liberal opponent, with his ILP and Communist challengers lagging far behind.

Davies gave his <a href="maiden%20speech">maiden speech</a> in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> on 21 June 1934. Breaking with the tradition that such speeches should be non-partisan, he delivered a fierce attack on the government's policy towards the mining industry. He had come, he said, from a coalfield that "has had very little help from the present government ... we see communities with a great industrial history dissolving and disintegrating". An uncompromising approach on any questions affecting Merthyr Tydfil, or the mining industry generally, became Davies's parliamentary hallmark. In December 1934 he rebuked the veteran <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> MP <a href="Nancy%20Astor%2C%20Viscountess%20Astor">Nancy Astor</a> when she referred to Merthyr as having "no social consciousness or initiative to do anything". Davies replied: "I object to irresponsible and brutal charges coming from people whose knowledge is derived from the enjoyment of vast wealth, especially when I am not certain that they have made their contribution towards producing that wealth".

In 1934, two years after his wife Margaret's death from cancer, Davies married Sephora Davies, a schoolteacher from <a href="Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen">Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen</a> in <a href="Carmarthenshire">Carmarthenshire</a> who shared Davies's political outlook. The couple lived at Gwynfryn Park Terrace in Merthyr Tydfil, and had two sons. In November 1936, having been returned in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 general election</a> with an increased majority, Davies ridiculed the prime minister, <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>, for his refusal to meet a delegation from the <a href="National%20Unemployed%20Workers%27%20Movement">National Unemployed Workers' Movement</a>'s 1936 <a href="Hunger%20marches">Hunger March</a>, which included a large contingent from South Wales: "A bigger man would meet these people who have tramped the roads of this country and would show that he had sympathy with them". In 1938, having modified his earlier position, Davies supported a bill introduced by the Labour opposition for the nationalisation of the coal industry. Miners worked, he said, in intolerable conditions to ensure that cheap raw material was available to industry. Reasonable wages and working conditions would never be granted by private coal-owners. The bill was defeated.

As Europe moved towards war in the late 1930s, Davies opposed the appeasement policies of the <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Chamberlain</a> government. He doubted the will of the British ruling classes to wage a determined war against fascism, and called for a workers' "Popular Front" of resistance to the dictators. After the outbreak of war in September 1939 Davies demanded from the British government "a more specific and detailed statement" of war aims, to allay "suspicions ... as to the real and possibly as yet unstated war aims of this country and of France". He criticised Labour's decision in May 1940 to join <a href="Churchill%20war%20ministry">Churchill's wartime coalition government</a>, and thereafter opposed many of the coalition's domestic policies, such as indiscriminate internment of aliens, restrictions on industrial action, and the suppression of the communist newspaper the "<a href="Morning%20Star%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Daily Worker</a>". The bitterness of Davies's personal attack on <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>, the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> who had authorised the paper's closure, shocked even the British Communist Party's general secretary, <a href="Harry%20Pollitt">Harry Pollitt</a>, who cautioned Davies that "personal abuse has been our stock-in-trade for twenty years and has got us nowhere".

Unlike the British communists, Davies did not change his position when the Soviet Union entered the war in June 1941. He continued to oppose all co-operation with the Conservatives, believing that only through socialism could a just and lasting peace be achieved. Victory in 1945, and the subsequent election of a <a href="Attlee%20ministry">Labour government</a>, did little to affect Davies's individualism. In the Labour years 1945–51 he opposed government policies on conscription, <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, the development of nuclear weapons, and intervention in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. According to his biographer <a href="Robert%20Griffiths%20%28politician%29">Robert Griffiths</a>, it was hatred of capitalist militarism, rather than a wish to support the Soviet Union, that underlay Davies's stances. His popularity in South Wales was unaffected: he was returned to parliament in each postwar election with large majorities. In 1945–46 he served as Merthyr Tydfil's mayor, remaining on the local council until 1949.

In assessing Davies's political career the historian Alun Morgan notes certain inconsistencies: while calling for unity among leftist factions, Davies frequently rebelled against agreed Labour Party policies. He championed democracy, individual liberty and the rights of small nations, yet gave the Soviet Union his unvarying and uncritical support. However, he was consistent in certain core areas, often in defiance of official Labour policy: unremitting hostility to US foreign policy, opposition to the party's post-war defence policies (specifically on issues concerning American bases in Britain, rearmament in West Germany, and development of the Polaris submarine programme), and above all commitment to the needs and interests of his Merthyr constituents. His dedication to his own agenda brought him into frequent conflict with party managers, and led to withdrawals of the <a href="Whip%20%28politics%29">party whip</a> throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Stating his position in a 1948 letter to the Labour Party general secretary <a href="Morgan%20Phillips">Morgan Phillips</a>, he wrote: "Our movement embraces millions of men and women, and not merely a few hundred MPs and a few dozen ... members of the National Executive. I am habitually inclined to give our millions my first thoughts and consideration." Davies's popularity with the voters of Merthyr Tydfil remained constant; he secured 75 per cent or more of the vote in each of the general elections of 1955, 1959, 1964 and 1966.

In December 1951 Sephora Davies was expelled from the Labour Party because of her close association with a proscribed organisation, the British Soviet Friendship Society. Davies's deep roots in the Labour movement, and his large base of local support, saved him from a similar fate. In June 1953 he was attacked by <a href="Will%20Lawther">Will Lawther</a>, the NUM president, for defying the Labour Party's position and supporting the Soviet claim that a <a href="Uprising%20of%201953%20in%20East%20Germany">workers' rising</a> in <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> had been orchestrated by "a CIA-sponsored West-German pro-fascist organisation". Lawther demanded that the local Merthyr Tydfil party deselect Davies as their parliamentary candidate, but they stood firm.

Davies found himself again at odds with his party, over the issue of Welsh self-government. He had championed this cause for many years, to the annoyance of Labour's Welsh Regional Council. In May 1954 he offered proposals for a Welsh parliament that were rejected by the Regional Council and by the South Wales Area conference of the NUM. Davies persevered, and on 4 March 1955 introduced in the House of Commons a <a href="private%20member%27s%20bill">private member's bill</a> proposing self-government for Wales on the basis of the aborted 1914 act that would have granted <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland%20Act%201914">home rule to Ireland</a>. Davies claimed to have received thousands of messages of support for his measure, from all parts of Wales, but in the House he could only muster 14 votes in favour. Undeterred, he told MPs: "There is a movement in Wales, an uprising, as it were, that will not only support the bill but will continue to insist upon it until Wales is represented in the United Kingdom as something more than a mere region."

According to Griffiths, when Soviet troops suppressed the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Hungarian uprising</a> in October 1956, Davies was troubled, but refused to join in the general censure lest this give comfort to the enemies of socialism. He was to be equally silent during and after the events of the <a href="Prague%20Spring">Prague Spring</a> of 1968—in sharp contrast to his condemnation of the "criminally dangerous and irresponsible heroics" of the United States during the <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a> of October 1962. In 1961, at the request of the Labour Party leadership, Davies was one of 25 Labour MPs and party members investigated by the British security services as a possible Communist Party member. The <a href="MI5">MI5</a> report stated that there was evidence to indicate that Davies, "if not of the Party ... is at least very close to it indeed".

Davies's Merthyr constituency included the mining village of <a href="Aberfan">Aberfan</a>, situated a few miles south of Merthyr Tydfil. On the mountainsides above the village, colliery waste had been dumped over the years to form large <a href="spoil%20tip">spoil tip</a>s. Shortly after 9:00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of these tips collapsed, sending thousands of tons of semi-liquid waste hurtling towards Aberfan. The point of impact was Pantglas Junior School, where morning lessons were beginning. The school was half buried; inside, 109 children and 5 teachers were killed. A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school, in the streets or adjoining houses. In the immediate aftermath, Davies visited and consoled the bereaved families in Aberfan, and the following day he led a party which included the <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a> on a tour of the disaster site.

On 24 October, the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a> chairman <a href="Alfred%20Robens%2C%20Baron%20Robens%20of%20Woldingham">Lord Robens</a> stated that the cause of the landslip was a previously unknown spring, which had been pouring water into the centre of the tip, creating a "water bomb". Local miners disagreed; they said that the spring's existence had been known when tipping began 20 years earlier. A tribunal was set up under <a href="Edmund%20Davies%2C%20Baron%20Edmund-Davies">Lord Justice Edmund Davies</a>, to investigate the disaster.

Giving evidence to the tribunal, S. O. Davies said he had long suspected that the Aberfan tips were unstable, but had kept quiet for fear that if tipping was stopped on the mountainside the Coal Board would close the colliery. Davies added: "But if I had been asked to do so, I would have done it". His testimony was strongly challenged by the NUM, whose counsel Brian Gibbens QC said that "[i]f Mr Davies is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection ... then he bears what must be one of the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster". However, Gibbens found it incredible that a man in Davies's unique local position of authority and influence would not have mentioned his fears to any of the formal bodies—borough council, Coal Board, union or local Labour Party: "If anyone could have exercised influence to overcome an obdurate or ignorant monolith like the Coal Board, [Davies] was well placed to do so." Gibbens submitted that Davies's testimony should be rejected, on the grounds that he "never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words". The tribunal concurred, accepting that Davies had not fully understood the gravity of his admission, and adding that had they been convinced otherwise, he could not have escaped censure. The tribunal's findings, published in July 1967, placed responsibility for the disaster firmly on the National Coal Board, specifically on the absence of any tipping policy.

In December 1966 Davies introduced a bill to the House of Commons, to provide more generous compensation to miners suffering from dust-related diseases. The bill was accepted by <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>'s <a href="Labour%20government%2C%201964%E2%80%931970">Labour government</a>, and became law in 1967. This was one of the few instances during this period in which Davies and the Labour government worked together. Following the Coal Board's refusal to meet the full cost of removing the remaining Aberfan tips, Wilson proposed that part of the required £750,000 be met by the disaster fund set up to help the people of Aberfan rebuild their community. Davies was outraged; he told Wilson: "I have never known a prime minister to behave so disgracefully in all my 34 years in the House of Commons". Subsequently, Davies opposed the 1969 decision of Merthyr Tydfil Council to award Wilson the freedom of the borough, stating that he would boycott the ceremony.

While many constituents supported Davies in his frequent attacks on government policies, the local Labour Party became increasingly concerned by his activities. By the late 1960s many of them were from a younger generation, with no experience of the shared hardships of the 1920s and 1930s, and with a less parochial mindset. They were angered by what they perceived as Davies's disloyalty to the Wilson government, elected in 1964 after thirteen years of opposition, and his penchant for following his own agenda. There was also the question of his age; in 1970 he was supposedly 83, but rumours that he was older were widespread. By March 1970 the local party discussed replacing Davies as their candidate at the next general election, citing his age rather than policy disagreements. The National Executive of the party sanctioned this action, and at a special meeting on 10 May, which Davies declined to attend, he was formally deselected.

Davies reacted to his deselection by announcing that the people of Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, would decide his future. If physically fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine, and Davies would, they predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a <a href="Snap%20election">snap general election</a>, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an <a href="Amalgamated%20Engineering%20Union">Amalgamated Engineering Union</a> (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter of Wilson.

With no party organisation and only his own financial resources, Davies's campaign was initially very low-key. His election literature was a single sheet with the message "You Know Me, I've Never Let You Down". As polling day approached, however, it was clear that he was gathering support, particularly among the young—a great irony, Alun Morgan observes, for a man sacked on the grounds of his age. In the final week before polling day on 18 June Davies's youthful supporters toured the constituency with songs, slogans and cheerleaders in what Griffiths describes as "the most colourful election bandwaggon seen in Merthyr for 40 years". The official Labour campaign stalled, as Lloyd became embroiled in a row over his role in the failure of the AEU to support an unofficial strike at the local <a href="The%20Hoover%20Company">Hoover</a> factory. On polling day, amid scenes of jubilation, Davies was returned with a majority of 7,467 over Lloyd. Davies responded to his victory by thanking the voters whom, he said, he had never thought for a moment would let him down. Two weeks later Davies and his principal campaign workers were expelled from the Labour Party for opposing its official candidate. The national leadership refused his request for an official inquiry into the actions of the Merthyr party, in the selection process and during the election itself.

Despite his expulsion, in July 1970 the Labour-controlled Merthyr council offered Davies the freedom of the borough, an honour which he politely declined; the confidence of the people recently shown him was, he said, enough. He resumed his place in parliament, on the opposition benches as Labour had unexpectedly lost the election to <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a>'s Conservatives. Despite some ill-feeling, Davies was not ostracised by his erstwhile colleagues, and was unofficially briefed by the party. He limited his Commons appearances and rarely spoke in debates, generally preferring to serve his constituents from home. On the major national issue of the 1970–74 parliament—Heath's renewed bid for Britain's membership of the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a> (EEC)—Davies voiced uncompromising opposition. In a letter to the "South Wales Echo" on 9 August 1971 he challenged the government's claim that "our security has been bound up with our European neighbours for over a thousand years", pointing out Britain's involvement in numerous European wars, "including the Hitler war when British security meant co-operation with Russia".

On 22 February 1972 Davies attended parliament to vote against the government on an EEC-related motion. He returned to Merthyr suffering from a chest infection, took to his bed on 24th, and on 25th was transferred to Merthyr General Hospital where he died later that day. His funeral was held at Soar-Ynysgau chapel, Merthyr on 29 February, followed by burial at the Maes-Yr-Arian Cemetery at nearby Mountain Ash. Griffiths records: "It was indicative of [Davies's] breadth of vision that the ceremony attracted socialists, communists, Welsh nationalists, republicans, and many of no political creed at all". In the <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil%20by-election%2C%201972">April by-election</a> to fill the vacancy caused by Davies's death the Labour candidate, <a href="Ted%20Rowlands">Ted Rowlands</a>, won the seat with a narrow majority over <a href="Plaid%20Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a>.

According to a BBC correspondent Davies "looked as if he belonged to a different age, in his parliamentary 'uniform' of <a href="Homburg%20%28hat%29">Homburg hat</a>, silk scarf, black jacket and pin-striped trousers". Two close Merthyr friends who had followed him out of the Labour Party described him as "[a] tall man who walked tall and never bowed to anyone, but treated everyone alike." His obituarist in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" referred to his deceptively mild outward demeanour, "but underneath, fires were forever smouldering".

Many of the tributes paid to Davies after his death acknowledged his commitment to Merthyr and the mining communities of the Welsh valleys, for which he was an unfailing advocate. The mayor of Merthyr remarked that he was "an individualist who followed the teaching of 'Love thy neighbour as thyself'. He was highly respected by all, even by those who didn't agree with him". His parliamentary colleague and fellow mineworker <a href="Jim%20Griffiths">Jim Griffiths</a>, who had shared with Davies the leadership of the South Wales miners after the 1926 general strike, thought that had Davies cultivated an ability for compromise, he would have achieved ministerial office. But "he always was a lone figure ... and seemed to like being in isolation." In April 2013 a heritage plaque in Davies's honour was unveiled at <a href="Penydarren%20Park">Penydarren Park</a>, Merthyr Tydfil. On 5 August 2015, as part of the De Montfort Project celebrating the 750th anniversary of <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Simon de Montfort</a>'s parliament, Davies's parliamentary work was recognised in special events at Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil.

The Revd Islwyn Jones, who conducted Davies's funeral service, said: "He had a great love for man, he believed with the Psalmist that 'The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof', and it was these words, sinking deep into his heart, which made him 'take up the cudgels for the common man' ".

During the same period he also played a lead role in "" (2012) and a voice role in the animated film "<a href="Epic%20%282013%20film%29">Epic</a>" (2013).

Throughout his career, Hutcherson has expressed an interest in <a href="Film%20director">directing</a> and <a href="Film%20producer">producing</a>. He has served as an executive producer in "<a href="Detention%20%282011%20film%29">Detention</a>" (2011), "<a href="The%20Forger%20%282012%20film%29">The Forger</a>" (2012) and "" (2015), while also playing a lead role in each film. He is also heavily involved in the <a href="gay%E2%80%93straight%20alliance">gay–straight alliance</a> chapter called "Straight But Not Narrow".

Born in <a href="Union%2C%20Kentucky">Union, Kentucky</a>, on October 12, 1992, Hutcherson is the elder son of Michelle (née Fightmaster), a former <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> employee who now assists with Josh's career, and Chris Hutcherson, an analyst for the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA). His parents, who were also born and raised in Kentucky, met in high school in <a href="Dry%20Ridge%2C%20Kentucky">Dry Ridge</a>. He has one younger brother, Connor.

Hutcherson's interest in acting developed as a child despite his parents' concerns about the profession. According to the actor himself, he had "loved the entertainment industry" from the age of four. His father said that his son was compelled to perform for people from a very young age, possessing a personality that attracted people's attention. His mother said that he "bugged us so much" into becoming an actor, but believed it was a phase he was going through and would grow out of. Aged eight, Hutcherson went through the <a href="yellow%20pages">yellow pages</a> and contacted an acting agency. In January 2002, he and his mother met acting coach Bob Luke, who travelled from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to Kentucky to meet them. Luke advised them to go to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and begin auditioning Hutcherson for <a href="Television%20pilot">TV pilots</a>. At the time, his only acting experience had been in a <a href="Kroger">Kroger</a> television commercial and a <a href="Vacation%20Bible%20School">Vacation Bible School</a> training film. For three years, Hutcherson and his mother lived in Los Angeles' Oakwood apartments, a housing community that accommodates young child actors and their families.

Most of Hutcherson's childhood was spent on film sets rather than in a classroom. He attended New Haven Elementary School in Union until he began his career at the age of nine, after which he began <a href="homeschooling">homeschooling</a>, with his mother as his teacher. He later returned to Kentucky to attend <a href="Ryle%20High%20School">Ryle High School</a> for one semester. Hutcherson played on the high school's <a href="Association%20football">soccer</a> team and has been a keen sports enthusiast since, also displaying a passion for <a href="American%20football">football</a> and <a href="tennis">tennis</a>. At the age of 13, he participated in a <a href="triathlon">triathlon</a>. He later said of his schooling experiences, "I know it's something kids have to deal with every single day but getting up at the same time every day and having to listen to teachers talk about things I could learn so much more easily on my own, I hated it."

After moving to <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> in 2002, Hutcherson appeared in various television commercials. He landed his first major acting role as Nicky Harper in the 2002 pilot episode of "House Blend", followed by minor roles in an episode of "<a href="ER%20%28TV%20series%29">ER</a>" and the pilot episode of "<a href="The%20Winner%20%28TV%20series%29">Becoming Glen</a>". The following year, he played leading role Charlie Logan in the television film "Miracle Dogs", which was released on <a href="Animal%20Planet">Animal Planet</a>. The film, Hutcherson's first, received a 79 percent approval rating on <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. Later that year, he starred opposite <a href="Peter%20Falk">Peter Falk</a> and <a href="Tim%20Daly">Tim Daly</a> in the television film, "Wilder Days", playing Falk's grandson who accompanies him on a turbulent road trip. Daly was impressed with the young Hutcherson, remarking, "He's an exceptional kid. He's a really good actor, and he's very smart and confident in himself." Hutcherson's next role was as a boy dressed as <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a> in his first feature film appearance, the well-reviewed <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a> "<a href="American%20Splendor%20%28film%29">American Splendor</a>", which won the grand jury prize at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. His character in 2004's <a href="fantasy%20film">fantasy film</a> "<a href="The%20Polar%20Express%20%28film%29">The Polar Express</a>", young Hero Boy, was created by <a href="motion-capture">motion-capture</a> of his facial expressions and body movements. The film starred <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a> in the lead role and received mixed reviews from critics. In the animated fantasy film "<a href="Howl%27s%20Moving%20Castle%20%28film%29">Howl's Moving Castle</a>", he voiced the character of Markl, working alongside two other lead characters <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a> and <a href="Billy%20Crystal">Billy Crystal</a>. All of his dialogue for the film was recorded in about eight consecutive hours.
In 2005, Hutcherson appeared in several Hollywood films while trying to establish himself in the industry. He portrayed the minor role of Bucky Weston in the comedy "<a href="Kicking%20%26amp%3B%20Screaming%20%282005%20film%29">Kicking & Screaming</a>". In 2005's "<a href="Little%20Manhattan">Little Manhattan</a>", he had a lead role alongside his younger brother, Connor. Stella Papamichael of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> approved of his performance, saying that "Hutcherson's delivery is spot-on, showing a keen instinct for self-effacing humor that would make even <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a> feel that bit more inadequate", but "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" columnist Brian Lowry felt that Hutcherson "might have looked cute on the page, but even with his Linus voice the language and tone [didn't] feel natural." He next appeared in a lead role in <a href="Jon%20Favreau">Jon Favreau</a>'s "", which he enjoyed filming owing to the number of special effects and stunts he was involved with. Hutcherson received the <a href="Young%20Artist%20Award">Young Artist Award</a> for "Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Young Actor" for the film.

Hutcherson's next appearance was in the comedy "<a href="RV%20%28film%29">RV</a>" in early 2006, playing the son of <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a>'s character Bob Munro. He professed finding it difficult to concentrate during the production because he was "constantly laughing" at co-star Williams. The film was not received favorably by critics and audiences; "Variety" said the film suffered from "blunt predictability and meager laughs". He received his second Young Artist Award nomination for his role, but lost to <a href="Logan%20Lerman">Logan Lerman</a> in "<a href="Hoot%20%28film%29">Hoot</a>".

Hutcherson's <a href="breakthrough%20role">breakthrough role</a> in his career as a child actor came in 2007 when he portrayed Jesse Aarons in the fantasy drama "<a href="Bridge%20to%20Terabithia%20%282007%20film%29">Bridge to Terabithia</a>". The film was shot on location in New Zealand for three and a half months. Hutcherson said of the filming: "That was an amazing experience. It doesn't get any prettier than that. There were beaches everywhere and all sorts of forests. We took little road trips everywhere and just had a lot of fun." He admitted to not having read the <a href="Bridge%20to%20Terabithia%20%28novel%29">novel</a> that the film is based upon before being cast. Author Ann C. Paietta describes his character of Jesse Aarons as "an introverted boy with four sisters, a financially strapped family, and a real talent for drawing" whose life is turned around when Leslie Burke (<a href="AnnaSophia%20Robb">AnnaSophia Robb</a>) arrives, with whom he creates an imaginary <a href="utopia">utopia</a>n world. Anne Hornaday of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" found his casting to be "a perfect fit" and commended how he portrayed the "sensitive, artistic, temperament" of his character, while Miriam Di Nunzio of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" noted the chemistry between Hutcherson and Robb, referring to them as a "dynamic duo". He won his second Young Artist Award for "Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Young Actor" for the film. Hutcherson's next role was in "<a href="Firehouse%20Dog">Firehouse Dog</a>" (2007), in which he played Shane Fahey, a firefighter's son who befriends a dog. He has expressed his pleasure in working and bonding with the four different dogs who played his canine co-star. The film received mixed reviews, although critics were favorable to Hutcherson. Following the film, Carrie Rickey of "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>" referred to him as the "<a href="Jodie%20Foster">Jodie Foster</a> of <a href="Millennials">Generation Y</a>", remarking that with "each successive film Hutcherson dives deeper into his reservoir of shame and hurt and hope, unnerving for one so young, but also unusually urgent for an actor of any age."

In 2008, he appeared in the independent crime drama "<a href="Winged%20Creatures%20%28film%29">Winged Creatures</a>" (released as "Fragments" on DVD) alongside <a href="Dakota%20Fanning">Dakota Fanning</a> as they portrayed two teenage friends who survive a massacre, and in "<a href="Journey%20to%20the%20Center%20of%20the%20Earth%20%282008%20theatrical%20film%29">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a>", a <a href="3D%20film">3D</a> film adaptation of <a href="Journey%20to%20the%20Center%20of%20the%20Earth">the novel of the same name</a> where he portrayed a teen who travels to Iceland with an uncle he hardly knows, played by <a href="Brendan%20Fraser">Brendan Fraser</a>. Over the next two years, he appeared as a boy named Steve "Leopard" Leonard who visits a <a href="freak%20show">freak show</a> with his friends in the <a href="vampire%20literature">vampire fiction</a> of the book "<a href="Cirque%20du%20Freak">Cirque du Freak</a>" and had a supporting role in the critically acclaimed "<a href="The%20Kids%20Are%20All%20Right%20%28film%29">The Kids Are All Right</a>", portraying the son of a <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> couple, played by <a href="Annette%20Bening">Annette Bening</a> and <a href="Julianne%20Moore">Julianne Moore</a>. According to Kaleem Aftab of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", his role in the film was a pivotal point in his career and one of vital importance to continuing his career into adulthood. Hutcherson expressed gratitude at being cast in the film, displaying satisfaction with the intimacy and creative freedom that independent films provide over studio films. The film won the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Motion%20Picture%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy</a> in 2010, and was a nominee for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a> at the <a href="83rd%20Academy%20Awards">83rd Academy Awards</a>. Gregory Ellwood of entertainment site <a href="HitFix">HitFix</a> stated: "Hutcherson's charismatic wit and natural instincts shine and it's arguably the first film where he proves he's more than just another sharp-looking teen actor."

On April 4, 2011, <a href="Lionsgate">Lionsgate</a> announced that Hutcherson had been cast as <a href="Peeta%20Mellark">Peeta Mellark</a> in <a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20%28film%20series%29">"The Hunger Games" series</a>, opposite <a href="Jennifer%20Lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> as <a href="Katniss%20Everdeen">Katniss Everdeen</a>. He was eager to land the role, feeling that he related to the character extremely well. In preparation for filming, he had to bleach his hair and gain 15 pounds. Lawrence, a close friend, has always spoken highly of him as an actor; in regards to his portrayal of Peeta Mellark she stated, "He's charming, he's sweet, he's down to earth, he's normal. He embodies all of it and brings it all to Peeta ... he's got all those great qualities and every single one of them comes across in every line he says out loud as Peeta." He became known for his <a href="practical%20joke">pranks</a> on set, leading to an accident as he was play-fighting with Lawrence who kicked him in the head, unintentionally knocking him unconscious and giving him a <a href="concussion">concussion</a>. The initial film, "<a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20%28film%29">The Hunger Games</a>", was released on March 23, 2012, and went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Hutcherson received the <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Awards">MTV Movie Award</a> for "<a href="MTV%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance">Best Male Performance</a>". He was also awarded the <a href="NewNowNext%20Awards%232012">2012</a> <a href="NewNowNext%20Awards">NewNowNext</a> award for "Next Mega Star" and the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Theatre%20Owners">National Association of Theatre Owners</a>'s <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Theatre%20Owners%23CinemaCon%20Awards%202012">2012 CinemaCon</a> award for "Breakthrough Performer of the Year". Peter Travers of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" described the actor's portrayal saying, "[Hutcherson] brings humor and a bruised heart to a boy who needs to mature fast."

Between landing the role in "The Hunger Games" and the film's release, he played a lead role and served as an <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> for two films: "<a href="Detention%20%282011%20film%29">Detention</a>" (2011) and "<a href="The%20Forger%20%282012%20film%29">The Forger</a>" (2012). In "Detention", he played the role of popular teenager Clapton Davis in a film the plot of which has been compared to 1985's "<a href="The%20Breakfast%20Club">The Breakfast Club</a>". His role in "The Forger" was as a 15-year-old orphan who finds himself in trouble until <a href="Alfred%20Molina">Alfred Molina</a>'s character comes to his aid. The film was not well received but the actors' chemistry together and their performance was. He next reprised his role as Sean Anderson in the 2012 "Journey to the Center of the Earth" sequel, "". Hutcherson has always been vocal about his desire to work on films of all sorts of genres. Regarding the switch from <a href="comedy-drama">comedy-drama</a> "The Kids Are All Right" to the "Journey" sequel, he stated: "For me, I like to do all different types of films and to go from having that awesome [indie] kind of thing that I love doing so much with great characters and a really great script to a bigger kind of studio film, to just cover the whole kind of spectrum of movies is really, really cool." Although the film was largely panned, it fared well commercially and his performance was well received, with Kofi Outlaw of Screenrant.com appreciating how he "does a good job holding the screen and portraying a somewhat layered protagonist". Later in 2012, he appeared in "<a href="Red%20Dawn%20%282012%20film%29">Red Dawn</a>", a remake of the <a href="Red%20Dawn">1984 film of the same name</a>. The film was panned by critics, achieving only a 12 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest score of any film Hutcherson has acted in.

In 2013, Hutcherson voiced the character Nod in the animated action-adventure 3D film "<a href="Epic%20%282013%20film%29">Epic</a>", loosely based on <a href="William%20Joyce%20%28writer%29">William Joyce</a>'s book, "The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs"; the film is his most commercially successful except for "The Hunger Games" series. As filming approached for "The Hunger Games" sequel, "", he enlisted celebrity trainer Bobby Strom to assist him in five hour-long workouts per week. The film brought in $420 million at the North American box office, making it his most commercially successful film. Todd Gilchrist of <a href="Indiewire">Indiewire</a> proclaimed of the actor's performance that "Hutcherson's maturing talents achieve a parallelism with the character's self-actualization, proving subtler and more self-aware with every resigned decision he makes on behalf of the people around him that he loves." Hutcherson received his second MTV Movie Award for "Best Male Performance" for his role in the sequel.

On November 23, 2013, the day following "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"s United States release, Hutcherson hosted an episode of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>". His performance received mediocre reviews, with Mike Ryan of "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" stating that he did not really bring "anything special to the table except having a nice attitude", and John Surico of "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" remarking that "while the night didn't necessarily disappoint, it also didn't dazzle".

Hutcherson again reprised his role in the two feature-length parts of the "<a href="Mockingjay">Mockingjay</a>" film adaptation. "" was released on November 21, 2014, and "" followed on November 20, 2015. His character goes through a significant personality change in the films, which provided him with an acting challenge; he said, "I'm nervous about portraying it because I've never gone crazy before in a movie." Emily Yahr of "The Washington Post" spoke positively of his acting, by saying "Peeta's crazed expression is sure to haunt our nightmares for a long time," while <a href="David%20Edelstein">David Edelstein</a> of "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" criticized his portrayal in relation to scenes with the other characters, saying "at least Josh Hutcherson's captured Peeta is mostly seen in interviews with <a href="Stanley%20Tucci">Stanley Tucci</a>'s camp talk-show host on TV screens ... so the actor can't bring his lack of urgency to scenes with [Jennifer Lawrence]."

Before filming the "Mockingjay" movies, Hutcherson filmed "", a French-Spanish thriller, which was released on January 16, 2015, in the U.S. He also served as an executive producer for the film, alongside first-time director <a href="Andrea%20Di%20Stefano">Andrea Di Stefano</a>, assisting with casting and blocking shots. Hutcherson said the opportunity "made [him] so hungry to do more like that". In November 2017, Hutcherson began starring in the science fiction comedy series "<a href="Future%20Man%20%28TV%20series%29">Future Man</a>" on the <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> service <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a>.

Hutcherson has cited actor <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> as an inspiration, admiring the way Gyllenhaal "has taken his career and the kind of jobs that he's taken". He has also named actor, director, and producer <a href="Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> as another of his inspirations.

Hutcherson currently lives in Los Angeles, <a href="California">California</a>. In May 2012, he purchased the $2.5 million former house of <a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a> in <a href="Laurel%20Canyon%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Laurel Canyon</a> in the <a href="Hollywood%20Hills">Hollywood Hills</a>, a small ranch built in 1951. He professes that his fame has not changed him as a person, stating, "I love my job more than anything in the world and I could never imagine doing anything else. So this whole thing is a very small price to pay compared to someone who has to go to an office to work."

As a known ally to the <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) community, Hutcherson advocates the <a href="gay%E2%80%93straight%20alliance">gay–straight alliance</a> campaign "Straight But Not Narrow".

Battle of Halmyros

The Battle of Halmyros, known by earlier scholars as the Battle of the Cephissus or Battle of Orchomenos, was fought on 15 March 1311, between the forces of the <a href="Frankish%20Greece">Frankish</a> <a href="Duchy%20of%20Athens">Duchy of Athens</a> and its vassals under <a href="Walter%20V%20of%20Brienne">Walter of Brienne</a> against the mercenaries of the <a href="Catalan%20Company">Catalan Company</a>, resulting in a <a href="decisive%20victory">decisive victory</a> for the Catalans.

Engaged in conflict with their original employers, the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, the Catalan Company had traversed the southern <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> and arrived in southern Greece in 1309. The new Duke of Athens, Walter of Brienne, hired them to attack the Greek ruler of neighbouring <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>. Although the Catalans conquered much of the region for him, Walter refused to pay them and prepared to forcibly expel them from their gains. The two armies met at <a href="Halmyros">Halmyros</a> in southern Thessaly (or at the <a href="Boeotic%20Cephissus">Boeotic Cephissus</a>, near <a href="Orchomenus%20%28Boeotia%29">Orchomenos</a>, according to an earlier interpretation). The Catalans were considerably outnumbered and weakened by the reluctance of their Turkish auxiliaries to fight. The Company did have the advantage of selecting the battleground, positioning themselves behind marshy terrain, which they further inundated. On the Athenian side, many of the most important lords of Frankish Greece were present and Walter, a prideful man and confident in the prowess of his heavy cavalry, proceeded to charge headlong against the Catalan line. The marsh impeded the Frankish attack and the Catalan infantry stood firm. The Turks re-joined the Company and the Frankish army was routed; Walter and almost the entire knighthood of his realm fell in the field. As a result of the battle, the Catalans took over the leaderless Duchy of Athens; they ruled that part of Greece until the 1380s.

Following the <a href="Sack%20of%20Constantinople%20%281204%29">Sack of Constantinople</a> in 1204, much of Greece came under the rule of <a href="Frankish%20Greece">Frankish</a> <a href="Crusader%20principalities">Crusader principalities</a>. The most notable of them were the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Thessalonica">Kingdom of Thessalonica</a>, the <a href="Principality%20of%20Achaea">Principality of Achaea</a>, and the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Athens">Duchy of Athens</a>, with its capital at <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>. Thessalonica proved short-lived and fell to the resurgent Greeks, but the other Frankish principalities persevered and even prospered for most of the 13th century. In his landmark 1909 history of Frankish Greece, the medievalist <a href="William%20Miller%20%28historian%29">William Miller</a> writes of the Duchy of Athens that "under the dominion of the dukes of the house of <a href="de%20la%20Roche">de la Roche</a>, trade prospered, manufactures flourished, and the splendours of the Theban court impressed foreigners accustomed to the pomps and pageants of much greater states." On 5 October 1308, the last de la Roche Duke of Athens, <a href="Guy%20II%20de%20la%20Roche">Guy II</a>, died childless. His succession was disputed, but in mid-1309, the High Court (feudal council) of Achaea chose his cousin, the <a href="Burgundy">Burgundian</a> noble <a href="Walter%20V%20of%20Brienne">Walter of Brienne</a>, as successor. 

At that time the Greek world was in turmoil owing to the actions of the <a href="Catalan%20Company">Catalan Company</a>, a group of mercenaries, veterans of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Sicilian%20Vespers">War of the Sicilian Vespers</a>, originally hired by the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> against the <a href="Anatolian%20beyliks">Turks in Asia Minor</a>. Mutual suspicion and quarrels led to war with the Byzantines; evicted from their base in <a href="Gelibolu">Gallipoli</a> in 1307, the Catalans fought and pillaged their way west through <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> and <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>, until, pressed by Byzantine troops under <a href="Chandrenos">Chandrenos</a>, they entered <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> in early 1309. The last leader of the Company, <a href="Bernat%20de%20Rocafort">Bernat de Rocafort</a>, had envisaged the restoration of the Kingdom of Thessalonica with himself at its head, and had even entered into negotiations for a marriage alliance with Guy II. Nothing came of these negotiations, as Rocafort's increasingly despotic rule led to his deposition. After that, the Company was ruled by a committee of four, assisted by a twelve-member council. The arrival of the Company's 8,000 men in Thessaly caused concern to its Greek ruler, <a href="John%20II%20Doukas%20of%20Thessaly">John II Doukas</a>. Having just exploited the death of Guy II to repudiate the overlordship of the Dukes of Athens, John turned to Byzantium and the other Greek principality, the <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Despotate of Epirus</a>, for aid. Defeated by the Greeks, the Catalans agreed to pass peacefully through Thessaly towards the Frankish principalities of southern Greece. 

Walter of Brienne had fought the Catalans in Italy during the War of the Vespers, spoke their language, and had gained their respect. Using this familiarity, he now hired the Company for six months against the Greeks, at the high price of four ounces of gold for every heavy cavalryman, two for every light cavalryman and one for every infantryman, to be paid every month, with two months' payment in advance. Turning back, the Catalans captured the town of <a href="Domokos">Domokos</a> and some thirty other fortresses, and plundered the rich plain of Thessaly, forcing the Greek states to come to terms with Walter. This brought Walter accolades and financial rewards from <a href="Pope%20Clement%20V">Pope Clement V</a>, but the Duke now declined to honour his bargain with the Catalans and provide the remaining four months' pay. Walter picked the best 200 horsemen and 300 <a href="Almogavar">Almogavar</a> infantry from the Company, paid them their arrears and gave them land so that they would remain in his service, while ordering the rest to hand over their conquests and depart. The Catalans offered to recognize him as their lord if they were allowed to keep some of the land they had taken to establish themselves but Walter rejected their proposal and prepared to expel them by force. The Duke of Athens assembled a large army, comprising his <a href="vassals">feudatories</a>—among the most prominent were <a href="Albert%20Pallavicini">Albert Pallavicini</a>, <a href="Margrave%20of%20Bodonitsa">Margrave of Bodonitsa</a>, <a href="Thomas%20III%20d%27Autremencourt">Thomas III d'Autremencourt</a>, <a href="Lord%20of%20Salona">Lord of Salona</a> and Marshal of Achaea, and the <a href="Triarchy%20of%20Negroponte">barons of Euboea</a>, <a href="Boniface%20of%20Verona">Boniface of Verona</a>, <a href="George%20I%20Ghisi">George I Ghisi</a> and <a href="John%20of%20Maisy">John of Maisy</a>—as well as reinforcements sent from the other principalities of Frankish Greece.

A number of sources report in various degree of detail on the events before and during the battle: chapter 240 of the chronicle of <a href="Ramon%20Muntaner">Ramon Muntaner</a>; the various versions of the "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20the%20Morea">Chronicle of the Morea</a>" (sections 540 and 548 of the French version, verses 7263–7300 and 8010 of the Greek version, and sections 546–555 of the Aragonese version), Book VII section 7 of the history of the Byzantine writer <a href="Nikephoros%20Gregoras">Nikephoros Gregoras</a>, and brief accounts in Book VIII of the "<a href="Nuova%20Cronica">Nuova Cronica</a>" of the <a href="Florence">Florentine</a> banker and diplomat <a href="Giovanni%20Villani">Giovanni Villani</a>, in the "Istoria di Romania" of the Venetian statesman <a href="Marino%20Sanuto%20the%20Elder">Marino Sanudo</a> and in letter of the latter that remained unpublished until 1940.

The location of the battle varies in the different sources between two locations. Muntaner reports that it took place "at a beautiful plain near <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>, where there were marshes", which has been identified with the plain of the <a href="Boeotic%20Cephissus">Boeotic Cephissus</a> and the marshes of <a href="Lake%20Copais">Lake Copais</a> (now drained). Gregoras likewise mentions that the battle took place near the Boeotic Cephissus. On the other hand, the versions of the "Chronicle of the Morea" place the battle at "Halmyros", apparently the <a href="Almyros">town of the same name</a> in southern Thessaly. The former localization had been long favoured in scholarship; in his standard history of Frankish Greece, William Miller rejected Halmyros on the basis of the topography described by Muntaner, a view that continues to be repeated in more recent works. Several proposals by modern scholars for the exact site of the battle in the Cephissus valley exist, ranging from the vicinity of <a href="Orchomenus%20%28Boeotia%29">Orchomenos</a> and the vicinity of Copais to locations further north, around the villages of <a href="Chaeronea">Chaeronea</a> and <a href="Davleia">Davleia</a>, or even <a href="Amfikleia">Amfikleia</a> and <a href="Lilaia">Lilaia</a>.

The critical examination of the primary sources by more recent scholars have reversed the situation. Muntaner was himself a member of the Company until 1307, but was posted as governor of <a href="Djerba">Djerba</a> when the battle occurred and only compiled his chronicle in 1325–1328, leading to some serious errors in his account. Gregoras, although a contemporary of the battle, wrote his history even later, in 1349–1351, relying mostly on second-hand accounts; his account of the Company's activities during the years before the battle are sketchy and inaccurate, and his account of the battle itself is very close to that of Muntaner, indicating perhaps that Gregoras drew on a Western source. On the other hand, the original French version of the "Chronicle of the Morea", on which all other versions draw, was written between 1292 and 1320, and the abridged French version surviving today was compiled shortly after by a well-informed author in the <a href="Morea">Morea</a>. The Greek and Aragonese versions, compiled later in the century, contain essentially the same information as the French version. A critical piece of evidence was the discovery and publication in 1940 of a 1327 letter by Marino Sanudo, who was a galley captain operating in the <a href="North%20Euboean%20Gulf">North Euboean Gulf</a> on the day of the battle. Sanudo clearly states that the battle took place at Halmyros ("..."fuit bellum ducis Athenarum et comitis Brennensis cum compangna predicta ad Almiro""), and his testimony is generally considered reliable. As a result, more recent historical studies commonly accept Halmyros as the site of the battle.

According to the "Chronicle of the Morea", the Catalan army comprised 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, while Gregoras claims 3,500 cavalry and 4,000 infantry for the Catalans. The Catalan cavalry were mostly of Turkish origin (Sanudo reports that they numbered 1,800), both as <a href="Turcopole">Turcopole</a>s and <a href="horse%20archers">horse archers</a>; serving under their own leaders, the Turks were divided intwo two contingents, one of Anatolian Turks under Halil, which had joined the Company in 1305, and another of under Malik, who had defected from Byzantine service shortly after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Apros">Battle of Apros</a>. The members of the latter had been baptized as Christians. The sources differ considerably on the size of Walter's army: Gregoras reports 6,400 cavalry and 8,000 infantry, and the "Chronicle of the Morea" puts it at "more than" 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, while Muntaner asserts that it comprised 700 knights and 24,000 infantry, the latter mostly Greek. Modern scholars consider these numbers to be exaggerated, but they do suggest that the Athenian army had numerical superiority over the Catalans.

Faced with a numerically superior but less experienced enemy, the Company assumed a defensive position, taking care to select a battleground that favoured them. The Catalans chose a naturally strong position, protected by a swamp which, according to Gregoras, they enhanced by digging trenches and inundating them with water diverted from the nearby river. The Catalans took up positions on dry ground behind the swamp, arranging themselves in a solid line but the sources give no further details as to their dispositions. The Athenian army assembled at Zetouni (modern <a href="Lamia%20%28city%29">Lamia</a>). On 10 March 1311, Walter of Brienne composed his testament there and led his army forth. The presence of the Frankish army at Zetouni at this time is a further testimony in favour of locating the battle at Halmyros, as Zetouni lies north of the Cephissus but southwest of Halmyros. For Muntaner's and Gregoras' accounts to be correct, the Catalans would have to be behind the Duke's army; Gregoras furthermore writes that the Catalans passed through the <a href="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a> to arrive in Boeotia, which is extremely unlikely given the presence of strong Frankish garrisons at Zetouni and <a href="Marquisate%20of%20Bodonitsa">Bodonitsa</a>. 

On the eve of battle, the 500 Catalans in the Duke's service, stricken by conscience, went to him and asked for leave to rejoin their old comrades-in-arms, saying that they would rather die than fight against them. Walter reportedly gave them permission to leave, replying that they were welcome to die with the others. The Turkish auxiliaries took up a separate position nearby, thinking the quarrel was a pretext arranged by the Company and the Duke of Athens to exterminate them. 

Walter was reputed for his bravery, bordering on recklessness, and was confident of success, as evidenced by his haughty reply to the 500 mercenaries. Walter's pride and arrogance, combined with his numerical advantage and his innate belief in the superiority of heavy noble cavalry over infantry, led him to fatally underestimate the Catalans and order a charge, even though the terrain was adverse to cavalry. Impatient for action, according to Muntaner, Walter formed a cavalry line of 200 Frankish knights "with golden spurs", followed by the infantry, and placed himself with his banner in the vanguard. The Frankish attack failed but the reason is unclear; Muntaner's description is short and provides no details, while in Gregoras, the heavy Frankish cavalry got stuck in the mud, with the Almogavars, lightly armed with swords and darts, dispatching the knights encumbered in their heavy armour. This is the commonly accepted version among scholars as well. The "Chronicle of the Morea" implies that the battle was hard-fought—which, as military historian <a href="Kelly%20DeVries">Kelly DeVries</a> notes, seems to contradict Gregoras—and that the marsh possibly merely reduced the impact of the charge, instead of bogging it down entirely. It is clear is that the Catalans defeated the charge and that the Duke and most of his men fell. As the two lines clashed, the Turkish auxiliaries realised that there was no treachery and descended from their camp upon the Athenian army, panicking and routing its remnants.

Gregoras reports that 6,400 cavalry and 8,000 infantry fell in the battle, the same number he gives for Walter's forces. According to Muntaner, 20,000 infantry were killed and only two of the seven hundred knights survived the battle, <a href="Roger%20Deslaur">Roger Deslaur</a> and Boniface of Verona. Like the number of troops involved in the battle, these losses are unverifiable and probably exaggerated, but they indicate the scale of the Athenian defeat. Both <a href="David%20Jacoby%20%28historian%29">David Jacoby</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Setton">Kenneth Setton</a> have noted that the similarities between account of the battle in Muntaner and Gregoras and the descriptions of the earlier <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Golden%20Spurs">Battle of the Golden Spurs</a> in 1302, where the Flemish infantry defeated the French knights, down to the number of 700 knights slain "all with spurs of gold", as claimed by Muntaner. Jacoby in particular considers the creation of an artificial marsh to halt the cavalry charge as a possibly invented element in both cases, for the purpose of explaining the surprising defeat of French knights through the use of a "treacherous" trap. Some senior members of the Frankish nobility are known to have survived: <a href="Nicholas%20I%20Sanudo">Nicholas Sanudo</a>, later <a href="Duke%20of%20the%20Archipelago">Duke of the Archipelago</a>, managed to escape, and a few others such as <a href="Antoine%20le%20Flamenc">Antoine le Flamenc</a>, who is known to have participated in and survived the battle, were probably captured and later ransomed. Walter's head was severed by the Catalans and many years later was taken to <a href="Lecce">Lecce</a>, in Italy, where his son <a href="Walter%20VI%2C%20Count%20of%20Brienne">Walter VI</a> buried him in the <a href="Church%20of%20Santa%20Croce">Church of Santa Croce</a>.

The battle was a decisive event in the history of Frankish Greece; almost the entire Frankish elite of Athens and its vassal states lay dead on the field, and when the Catalans moved onto the lands of the Duchy, there was scant resistance. The Greek inhabitants of <a href="Livadeia">Livadeia</a> immediately surrendered their strongly fortified town, for which they were rewarded with the rights of Frankish citizens. Thebes, the capital of the Duchy, was abandoned by many of its inhabitants, who fled to the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian</a> stronghold of <a href="Chalkis">Negroponte</a>, and was plundered by the Catalan troops. Finally, Athens was surrendered to the victors by Walter's widow, <a href="Joanna%20of%20Ch%C3%A2tillon">Joanna of Châtillon</a>. All of <a href="Attica">Attica</a> and <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a> passed peacefully into the hands of the Catalans, and only the lordship of <a href="Argos%20and%20Nauplia">Argos and Nauplia</a> in the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> remained in the hands of Brienne loyalists. The Catalans divided the territory of the Duchy among themselves. The decimation of the previous feudal aristocracy allowed the Catalans to take possession relatively easily, in many cases marrying the widows and mothers of the very men they had slain in Halmyros. The Catalans' Turkish allies, however, refused the offer to settle in the Duchy. The Turks of Halil took their share of the booty and headed for Asia Minor, only to be attacked and almost annihilated by a joint Byzantine and Genoese force as they tried to cross the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> a few months later. The Turks of Malik entered the service of the Serbian king <a href="Stefan%20Milutin">Stefan Milutin</a>, but were massacred after rebelling against him.

Lacking a leader of stature, the Catalan Company turned to their two distinguished captives; they asked Boniface of Verona, whom they knew and respected, to lead them, but after he declined, chose Roger Deslaur instead. Deslaur proved a disappointment, and the hostility of Venice and the other Frankish states compelled the Catalans to seek a powerful protector. They turned to the Aragonese <a href="King%20of%20Sicily">King of Sicily</a>, <a href="Frederick%20III%20of%20Sicily">Frederick II</a>, who appointed his son <a href="Manfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Athens">Manfred</a> as Duke of Athens. In practice, the Duchy was governed by a succession of vicars-general appointed by the Aragonese Crown, often cadet members of the Aragonese royal family. The most successful vicar-general, <a href="Alfonso%20Fadrique">Alfonso Fadrique</a>, expanded the Duchy into Thessaly, establishing the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Neopatras">Duchy of Neopatras</a> in 1319. The Catalans consolidated their rule and survived a <a href="Crusade%20of%20Walter%20of%20Brienne">Briennist attempt</a> to recover the Duchy in 1331–1332. In the 1360s, the twin duchies were plagued by internal strife, including a quasi-war with Venice, and increasingly felt the threat of the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a>, but another Briennist attempt to launch a campaign against them in 1370–1371 came to naught. It was not until 1379–1380 that Catalan rule faced its first serious setback, when the <a href="Navarrese%20Company">Navarrese Company</a> conquered Thebes and much of Boeotia. In 1386–1388, the ambitious lord of <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>, <a href="Nerio%20I%20Acciaioli">Nerio I Acciaioli</a>, captured Athens and claimed the Duchy from the Crown of Aragon. With his capture of Neopatras in 1390, the era of Catalan rule in Greece came to an end.

In military history, the battle was part of a major shift in European warfare, which began with the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302: it signalled an era where infantry successfully challenged the traditional predominance of knightly <a href="heavy%20cavalry">heavy cavalry</a>.

Bull Run River (Oregon)

The Bull Run River is a tributary of the <a href="Sandy%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Sandy River</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. Beginning at the lower end of <a href="Bull%20Run%20Lake">Bull Run Lake</a> in the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>, it flows generally west through the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit (BRWMU), a restricted area meant to protect the river and its tributaries from contamination. The river, impounded by two artificial storage reservoirs as well as the lake, is the primary source of drinking water for the city of <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>.

It is likely that <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> living along the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> as early as 10,000 years ago visited the Bull Run watershed in search of food. Within the past few thousand years they created trails over the Cascade Range and around <a href="Mount%20Hood">Mount Hood</a>, near the upper part of the Bull Run watershed. By the mid-19th century, pioneers used these trails to cross the mountains from east to west to reach the fertile <a href="Willamette%20Valley">Willamette Valley</a>. In the 1890s, the City of Portland, searching for sources of clean drinking water, chose the Bull Run River. Dam-building, road construction, and legal action to protect the watershed began shortly thereafter, and Bull Run water began to flow through a large pipe to the city in 1895.

Erosion-resistant <a href="basalt">basalt</a> underlies much of the watershed, and streams passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, <a href="turbidity">turbidity</a> increases when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22 percent of the protected zone was <a href="Logging">logged</a> during the second half of the 20th century, and <a href="erosion">erosion</a> increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the <a href="Portland%20Water%20Bureau">Portland Water Bureau</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> have closed many of the logging roads and removed <a href="culvert">culvert</a>s and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.

Mature trees, most of them more than 500 years old and more than 21 inches (53 cm) in diameter, cover about half of the watershed, and the rest of the watershed is also heavily forested. Annual precipitation ranges from 80 inches (2,000 mm) near the water supply intake to as much as 170 inches (4,300 mm) near the headwaters. More than 250 wildlife species, including the protected <a href="northern%20spotted%20owl">northern spotted owl</a>, inhabit this forest. Downstream of the BRWMU, the watershed is far less restricted. In the late 19th century, an <a href="Unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> community, <a href="Bull%20Run%2C%20Oregon">Bull Run</a>, became established near the river in conjunction with a <a href="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> project and a related railroad line. About of the lower river is open to fishing and boating, and the land at the confluence of the Bull Run and Sandy rivers has been a public park since the early 20th century.

 The Bull Run River begins at Bull Run Lake, a natural body of water modified slightly by the <a href="Portland%20Water%20Bureau">Portland Water Bureau</a>, near Hiyo Mountain in the <a href="Mount%20Hood%20Wilderness">Mount Hood Wilderness</a>. Originating in <a href="Clackamas%20County%2C%20Oregon">Clackamas County</a> north of Forest Road 18 (<a href="Lolo%20Pass%20%28Oregon%29">Lolo Pass</a> Road), its unnamed headwater tributaries enter the lake. Flowing northwest from the lake, the river immediately enters <a href="Multnomah%20County%2C%20Oregon">Multnomah County</a> and continues generally northwest for about . Along this stretch, the river flows by a <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS) <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a> at <a href="river%20mile">river mile</a> (RM) 20.9 or river kilometer (RK) 30.6, passes under Forest Road 1025 and Forest Road 10 and receives <a href="Blazed%20Alder%20Creek">Blazed Alder Creek</a> from the <a href="wikt%3Aleft%20bank">left</a> and Log Creek and Falls Creek, both from the <a href="wikt%3Aright%20bank">right</a>. Then the river turns southwest and passes another stream gauge just before entering Bull Run River Reservoir 1 at RM 15 (RK 24). Also entering the reservoir are <a href="Fir%20Creek%20%28Bull%20Run%20River%29">Fir Creek</a> from the left, <a href="North%20Fork%20Bull%20Run%20River">North Fork Bull Run River</a> from the right, then Deer, Cougar, and Bear creeks, all from the right. The Bull Run River exits the reservoir via a <a href="spillway">spillway</a> from the river mouth. Forest Road 10 runs roughly parallel to the right bank of the river from near the headwaters to Southwest Bull Run Road, near the mouth.

Entering Bull Run River Reservoir 2, the river receives Camp Creek from the left, re-enters Clackamas County, and receives <a href="South%20Fork%20Bull%20Run%20River">South Fork Bull Run River</a> from the left. The river exits the reservoir via a spillway at about RM 6 (RK 10). Below Reservoir 2, Forest Road 10 (Waterworks Road) is on the river's right bank, and Forest Road 14 is on the left. The river flows by a stream gauge at RM 4.7 (RK 7.6) and passes under Forest Road 14 before receiving the <a href="Little%20Sandy%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Little Sandy River</a> from the left at about RM 2 (RK 3). The river then turns northwest, passes under an unnamed road and then under Southeast Bull Run Road near the <a href="unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> community of <a href="Bull%20Run%2C%20Oregon">Bull Run</a>, which is on the river's right, and the defunct <a href="power%20station">powerhouse</a> of the <a href="Bull%20Run%20Hydroelectric%20Project">Bull Run Hydroelectric Project</a>, which is on the left. Southeast Camp Namanu Road runs roughly parallel to the river along its right bank from here to the mouth. Along this stretch, the river receives Laughing Water Creek from the right and enters the Sandy River at Dodge Park, about from the larger river's confluence with the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>.

 The USGS and the water bureau operate a stream gauge at RM 4.7 (RK 7.6), which is downstream from Bull Run Reservoir 2 and the water system intake. Measurements are for the river only and do not include water diverted upstream of the gauge to the city water supply or to a former power plant. The maximum flow at this station was on December 22, 1964, and the minimum flow was on October 4, 1974. The drainage area above this gauge is , about 77 percent of the whole watershed. The maximum flow occurred during the floods of December 1964 and January 1965, rated by the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> as one of Oregon's top 10 weather events of the 20th century.

Since 1966, the USGS has monitored the flow of the Bull Run River at a stream gauge from the mouth. The average flow between then and 2008 was . This is from a drainage area of , about 34 percent of the entire watershed. The maximum flow recorded during this period was on November 5, 1999. The minimum was on October 28–31, 1987.

The uppermost stream gauge on the <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a> is at RM 20.9 (RK 30.6), downstream from the outlet structure at Bull Run Lake. In operation since 1992, the gauge recorded an average flow of between then and 2009. This was from a drainage area of , about 4 percent of the total watershed. The maximum flow recorded during this period was on February 7, 1996. The minimum was on October 28, 1992.

In addition to the three main-stem gauges, the USGS operates five other stream gauges in the Bull Run watershed. Each of the following tributaries has one gauge: Fir Creek, Blazed Alder Creek, the North Fork, the South Fork, and the Little Sandy.

Near the outlet structure of Bull Run Lake, a USGS water-stage recorder at RM 21.9 (RK 46.8) has collected data on lake levels since 1992. The maximum lake content between then and 2009 was on February 9, 1996, and the minimum was on October 29, 1992. The two Bull Run reservoirs are also equipped with water-stage recorders.

 <a href="Columbia%20River%20Basalt%20Group">Columbia River basalts</a>, 10 to 20 million years old, that underlie much of the Bull Run watershed are exposed near the bottoms of steep canyons along the river and its tributaries. In the western half of the watershed, the Rhododendron formation, rich in <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s, overlies the <a href="basalt">basalt</a>, and later volcanic flows of basalt and <a href="andesite">andesite</a> overlie both older formations. Areas of thick <a href="scree">talus</a> occur in the eastern part of the watershed at elevations higher than above sea level, and north-facing slopes above show evidence of <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a>. Over many centuries, streams in the watershed have carved canyons through the Rhododendron formation to the level of the basalt. Since basalt resists erosion, water traveling over it remains relatively free of sediments. Less than 2 percent of the watershed is at high risk for landslides.

The Bull Run River's three reservoirs—Bull Run Lake, Bull Run Reservoir 1, and Bull Run Reservoir 2—are <a href="oligotrophic">oligotrophic</a> and do not sustain many life forms. Bull Run Lake is in a steep-sided <a href="cirque">cirque</a> blocked at its lower end by a series of <a href="lava">lava</a> flows topped by debris from a <a href="glacial%20moraine">glacial moraine</a>. Small streams flow into the lake from ridges above it, and water exits the lake mainly by seeping through porous rock to enter the Bull Run River about downstream. Evidence suggests that over the past several thousand years, although forest fires in the area and volcanic activity on Mount Hood or <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a> have caused temporary changes in the lake's <a href="limnological">limnological</a> condition, it "has always returned to conditions similar to those seen at present." <a href="Turbidity">Turbidity</a> is sometimes a problem in Reservoirs 1 and 2 when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of lava erode into tributaries, especially the North and South forks.

Archeological evidence suggests that <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> lived along the lower Columbia River as early as 10,000 years ago. The area near what later became <a href="The%20Dalles%2C%20Oregon">The Dalles</a>, on the Columbia east of the mouth of the Sandy River, eventually became an important trading center. The Indians established villages on <a href="floodplains">floodplains</a> and traveled seasonally to gather <a href="Huckleberry">huckleberries</a> and other food on upland meadows, to fish for salmon, and to hunt elk and deer. Although no direct evidence exists that these lower-Columbia Indians traveled up the Sandy, it is likely that they did. Traces of these people include <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s carved into the rocks of the Columbia River Gorge. Within the past few thousand years, Indians created trails across the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> around <a href="Mount%20Hood">Mount Hood</a>. In the 19th century, this trail network linked the <a href="Wascopam%20Mission">Wascopam Mission</a> near The Dalles to settlements in the <a href="Willamette%20Valley">Willamette Valley</a>. One popular trail crossed over Lolo Pass, near the headwaters of the Bull Run River, and another, which later became the <a href="Barlow%20Road">Barlow Road</a>, met the Lolo Pass trail roughly where the <a href="Zigzag%20River">Zigzag</a> and <a href="Salmon%20River%20%28Clackamas%20County%2C%20Oregon%29">Salmon</a> rivers enter the Sandy. Indians from villages along the Columbia, <a href="Clackamas%20River">Clackamas</a>, and other rivers also traveled by water to the lower Sandy River area to fish for salmon and to gather berries, nuts and roots. The <a href="Klickitat%20%28tribe%29">Klickitat</a> tribe referred to Bull Run Lake as "Gohabedikt", meaning "Loon Lake".

 Before the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a> of 1805, few Europeans or <a href="European-Americans">European-Americans</a> had visited the Sandy River basin. One of the first documented visits to the upper Sandy occurred in 1838, when Daniel Lee drove cattle from the Willamette Valley to Wascopam via the Indian trail over Lolo Pass. By 1840, <a href="settlers">pioneers</a> were using the trail to cross the Cascades, and the Barlow Road, following another old trail, opened in 1846. One of its branches ran along the Devil's Backbone, a ridge separating the Sandy and Little Sandy basins. A few of these newcomers settled along the Sandy River.
In 1886, the Portland Water Committee, predecessor of the Portland Water Bureau, began a search for a superior drinking water source. The committee, led by <a href="Henry%20Failing">Henry Failing</a>, commissioned <a href="Isaac%20W.%20Smith%20%28surveyor%29">Isaac W. Smith</a>, an engineer and surveyor, to inspect any viable water supply in the region. Smith chose the Bull Run River, and a five-month survey trip led him to conclude that a gravity-flow system could deliver clean water from Bull Run to Portland. In 1892, U.S. President <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> signed a proclamation creating a protected area, the Bull Run Reserve, in the watershed. By 1895 Portland had built a <a href="diversion%20dam">diversion dam</a> on the Bull Run River, and completed its first conduit (Conduit 1) to carry Bull Run water to the city. At about the same time as the Smith survey, a small farming community, at first named Unavilla but renamed Bull Run in 1895, grew up near the confluence of the Bull Run and Sandy rivers. Meanwhile, improvements to the Barlow Road encouraged population growth along the lower Sandy and the establishment of cities like <a href="Gresham%2C%20Oregon">Gresham</a> and <a href="Sandy%2C%20Oregon">Sandy</a>. Even so, by 1900 much of the upper Sandy basin was still remote, wild, and accessible mainly by trails.

Expanding the system's storage and delivery capacities in stages, the city built Conduit 2 from Bull Run to Portland in 1911, and in 1917 constructed a small dam at the high water outlet of Bull Run Lake. In 1921, the city replaced the headworks diversion dam with a new one, about high, and added Conduit 3. In 1929, Portland built Dam 1 (the Ben Morrow Dam), which is about high. To keep pace with population growth and increasing water demands, the city created Reservoir 2 behind Dam 2. The new dam, completed in 1962 at the site of the headworks dam, is a rockfill structure, high. By that time, the city had already replaced the aging Conduit 1 with Conduit 4.

 The lower Bull Run River changed dramatically in 1906, when the <a href="Mount%20Hood%20Railway%20and%20Power%20Company">Mount Hood Railway and Power Company</a> (MHR&P) began work on the Bull Run Hydroelectric Project. The project included a powerhouse on the Bull Run River at RM 1.5 (RK 2.4), and a diversion dam on one of its largest tributaries, the Little Sandy River, from its confluence with the Bull Run River. Water from the Little Sandy Dam diverted much of the Little Sandy's flow through a wooden <a href="flume">flume</a> about long to a reservoir called Roslyn Lake and from there to the powerhouse.

To begin the project, the MHR&P needed access to the powerhouse site. At the time, it took three hours by <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a> to reach Bull Run from an electric railway depot in <a href="Boring%2C%20Oregon">Boring</a>. Roads in the area had to be <a href="Plank%20road">planked</a> to be usable during heavy rains. Access improved in mid-1911, when the company finished construction on a railway line between the <a href="Montavilla%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Montavilla</a> neighborhood in east Portland and Bull Run. In 1912, the year the powerhouse began generating electricity, the MHR&P merged with the <a href="Portland%20Railway%2C%20Light%20and%20Power%20Company">Portland Railway, Light and Power Company</a>, (PRL&P), which later modified the line for use by electric <a href="tram">trolleys</a>.

In 1913, the PRL&P, the predecessor of the electric utility company known as <a href="Portland%20General%20Electric">Portland General Electric</a> (PGE), expanded the hydroelectric project by building Marmot Dam at RM 30 (RK 48) on the Sandy River, from which it diverted water through canals and tunnels, the longest of which was , to the Little Sandy River upstream of the Little Sandy Dam. This increased the maximum flow along the flume to Roslyn Lake from about to about . Since the combined flow entered the lower Bull Run River after leaving the powerhouse, the system altered the flows of three rivers. In 1999, close to a century after the start of the project, PGE announced that it would remove the Marmot and Little Sandy dams and related equipment and close the 22-<a href="watt">megawatt</a> powerhouse because of costs associated with maintenance and fish protection. Marmot Dam was demolished in 2007 and the Little Sandy Dam in 2008, restoring natural flows to the Sandy and Little Sandy.

In 1982, work on the Portland Hydroelectric Project, unrelated to the Bull Run Hydroelectric Project, began generating electricity at powerhouses below the dams at Reservoirs 1 and 2 on the Bull Run River. Portland sells the electricity from a 24-megawatt plant at Dam 1 and a 12-megawatt plant at Dam 2 to PGE, which operates and maintains the equipment. PGE, a corporation with home offices in Portland, has many other sources of electricity, which it sells to customers in a service area in the northern Willamette Valley.

 Extensive timber cutting in the Sandy River basin began in the mid-19th century in response to a demand for wood from the Portland metropolitan area. Logging intensified in the lower basin through the 20th century as sawmills became established in Sandy, Boring, <a href="Brightwood%2C%20Oregon">Brightwood</a> and other settlements in the region, and railroad spurs extended into the forests. In 1904, President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> signed into law the Bull Run Trespass Act to forbid activities such as camping and livestock grazing in the Bull Run Reserve. Except for activity related to the waterworks, the protected area changed little until the 1950s, when the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> began to advocate logging in the Reserve. After the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> passed the <a href="Multiple%20Use%20-%20Sustained%20Yield%20Act%20of%201960">Multiple Use – Sustained Yield Act of 1960</a> stressing timber production in the national forests, the Forest Service in the 1960s and 1970s built about of forest roads in the watershed. Before the road-building and heavy logging, "The watershed [had] remained almost inviolable for nearly 60 years, its runoff protected by a largely unbroken expanse of centuries-old trees," according to a member of the Bull Run Advisory Committee, a scientific panel commissioned by the City of Portland in 1977 to review issues related to Bull Run.

In 1973, Joseph Miller, Jr., a retired Portland physician, sued the Forest Service, claiming that its logging violated the Bull Run Trespass Act. In 1976, U.S. District Judge <a href="James%20M.%20Burns%20%28judge%29">James M. Burns</a> agreed, and logging was halted. Shortly thereafter, Congress rescinded the Bull Run Trespass Act and replaced it with the Bull Run Watershed Management Act of 1977, which created the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit (BRWMU) (replacing the Bull Run Reserve) and legalized further Bull Run logging unless it could be shown to reduce water quality. Logging and the debate about logging continued. In 1994 about 75 percent of the BRWMU was made into a reserve for protecting the <a href="northern%20spotted%20owl">northern spotted owl</a> and other species dependent on <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a>s. In February 1996, runoff from unusually heavy rains in the watershed washed so much eroded soil into the Bull Run storage reservoirs that the City had to shut down the Bull Run supply and switch during the crisis to its emergency supply from a well field along the Columbia River. Later in 1996, Congress passed the Oregon Resources Conservation Act, which prohibited logging on all Forest Service lands within the Bull Run water supply drainage and another of land that drained to the lower Bull Run River. In 2001, the Little Sandy Act extended the prohibitions to the entire BRWMU and public lands along the Little Sandy River.

Between 1958 and 1993, when the last timber-cutting took place in the BRWMU, about , roughly 22 percent of the water supply drainage, were logged. Since then, to reduce erosion from the outmoded logging infrastructure, the Forest Service and the water bureau have been decommissioning parts of the Bull Run forest road network, which had grown to . By autumn 2008, they had closed of roads, were dismantling another , and were removing 245 culverts.

 The Bull Run watershed drains , most of which is in the <a href="Mount%20Hood%20National%20Forest">Mount Hood National Forest</a> in Multnomah and Clackamas counties in northwest Oregon. The confluence of the Bull Run and <a href="Sandy%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Sandy</a> rivers at Dodge Park, about east of <a href="downtown%20Portland">downtown Portland</a>, marks the watershed's western (downstream) end, while on the east it borders <a href="Hood%20River%20County%2C%20Oregon">Hood River County</a>, and at Hiyo Mountain it is about northwest of Mount Hood in the Cascade Range. It is a sub-watershed of the Lower Columbia–Sandy Watershed. Elevations within the watershed range from at Buck Peak on the watershed's northeastern boundary to at the mouth of the Bull Run River.

As the main source of Portland's drinking water, the watershed is largely restricted to uses related to water collection, storage, and treatment, and to forest management. The city's drinking water protection area consists of the of the basin upstream of the water supply intake at RM 6.2 (RK 10). The protection area is part of a larger restricted zone, the BRWMU, which covers . It lies mostly within Multnomah and Clackamas counties but extends in places along its eastern edge into Hood River County. , the Forest Service manages 95 percent of the BRWMU on land owned by the federal government; the Portland Water Bureau manages the 4 percent that is owned by the City of Portland, and the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> manages the remaining 1 percent, which is on federal land. Small portions of the watershed that are along the lower main stem or along tributaries are partly outside the BRWMU and fall under other jurisdictions.

Watersheds bordering the Bull Run River drainage basin are those of the West Fork <a href="Hood%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Hood River</a> to the east and northeast, the Sandy River to the south and west, and the Columbia River to the north. Small Columbia River tributaries, each with a subwatershed bordering the Bull Run watershed, flow north from a ridge between the Bull Run and Columbia rivers. These include <a href="Eagle%20Creek%20%28Multnomah%20County%2C%20Oregon%29">Eagle</a>, <a href="Tanner%20Creek%20Falls">Tanner</a>, Moffett, McCord, <a href="Horsetail%20Falls%20%28Oregon%29">Horsetail</a>, <a href="Oneonta%20Gorge">Oneonta</a>, <a href="Multnomah%20Falls">Multnomah</a>, and <a href="Bridal%20Veil%20Falls%20%28Oregon%29">Bridle Veil</a> creeks, which plunge over one or more waterfalls as they enter the <a href="Columbia%20River%20Gorge">Columbia Gorge</a>.

 The climate along the Bull Run River is typical of the western Oregon Cascades foothills. Annual precipitation ranges from near the intake for the Portland water supply to as much as near the headwaters. Summers are dry, and winters, especially November through January, are wet. At low elevations, most of the precipitation arrives in the form of rain, but at higher elevations 25 to 30 percent of the moisture arrives as snow. <a href="Fog%20drip">Fog drip</a> may add significantly to total precipitation in the vicinity of Bull Run Lake. A study published in 1982 suggested that standard <a href="rain%20gauge">rain gauge</a>s placed in open areas might be underestimating the contribution of fog drip to heavily forested parts of the watershed by up to 30 percent. Accumulated snow is rare at elevations up to above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> but sometimes reaches above . Melting snow adds to streamflow in April and May, and dry soil inhibits streamflow in August. Generally, temperatures are mild. Lows in January range from just below freezing to about , while July highs are usually about .

The <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Conservation%20Service">Natural Resources Conservation Service</a> (NRCS) of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> operates snow telemetry (<a href="SNOTEL">SNOTEL</a>) stations at three places in the Bull Run watershed to help predict how much water will be available from melting snow. Snow depths and density vary with time and location. At the Blazed Alder Creek station, the highest of the three at above sea level, the <a href="Arithmetic%20mean">mean</a> <a href="snow-water%20equivalent">snow-water equivalent</a> (SWE) (the amount of water in the accumulated snow) ranged in 2009 from 0 in July–October to about in April. A station on the North Fork at an elevation of reported a minimum mean SWE of 0 in July–October 2009 and a maximum of about in April. In the same year at the South Fork station, elevation , the mean SWE varied from 0 in June–September to about in March.

 Although most of the watershed is generally closed to the public, the protected area includes forest roads, buildings, three dams and reservoirs, two hydroelectric power stations, and other infrastructure used by government employees who manage the forest and the water supply system. The system includes a concrete dam and spillway, added to the natural outlet of Bull Run Lake. The dam, completed in about 1960, was preceded in 1915 by a timber-and-rockfill structure and later by other measures to increase the lake's storage capacity and to prevent seepage. These measures raised the lake's usable storage from about to about , an increase of about 55 percent. Dam 1, which impounds Reservoir 1, is a concrete <a href="arch-gravity%20dam">arch-gravity dam</a> about high, and Dam 2, a rockfill structure about high, impounds Reservoir 2. Although the two reservoirs combined can hold up to about , their total usable storage is only about .
The raw water intake (headworks) at Bull Run is just below Dam 2. This is where water is diverted from the river for <a href="Water%20chlorination">chlorination</a> and then routed into three distribution conduits for delivery to Portland. About 23 percent of the watershed's annual runoff is diverted to the city's water supply.

The main roads within the BRWMU include Forest Road 10, which runs for much of its length along the north side of the river. It links the community of Bull Run near the mouth of the river and Forest Road 18 (Lolo Pass Road) east of Bull Run Lake. Branching off Forest Road 10 downstream of Reservoir 2, Forest Roads 12 and 14 form a loop south of the river. The loop extends as far east as Goodfellow Lakes, near the source of the Little Sandy River. Below the BRWMU, Bull Run Road, open to the public, crosses the river between the community of Bull Run and Dodge Park.

The Bull Run River Bridge, a Pennsylvania-petit <a href="truss%20bridge">truss</a> span that carries Bull Run Road, was originally the west truss of the <a href="Burnside%20Bridge">Burnside Bridge</a> over the <a href="Willamette%20River">Willamette River</a> in downtown Portland. It includes parts made of <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> as well as steel, and its truss <a href="Portal%20%28architecture%29">portals</a> incorporate nautical design elements meant for Portland, an inland seaport. Built in 1894, the bridge was moved to Bull Run in 1926, when a new Burnside Bridge replaced the old one. The Sandy River Bridge over the Sandy River at Dodge Park, just upriver from the mouth of the Bull Run River, was the east truss of the Burnside Bridge.

 Thick forests cover about 95 percent of the watershed. <a href="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a> is the dominant tree species in the basin below above sea level, where <a href="thuja%20plicata">western redcedar</a> thrives in moist areas and <a href="Tsuga%20heterophylla">western hemlock</a> also grows. Douglas-fir and <a href="Abies%20procera">noble fir</a> are the dominant species at higher elevations, and <a href="Abies%20amabilis">Pacific silver fir</a> is the <a href="climax%20species">climax species</a>. Mature trees, which cover about 54 percent of the watershed, are mostly more than 500 years old and have diameters exceeding . Trees between and in diameter cover about 34 percent of the basin, while younger, smaller trees dominate the remaining 12 percent. The forest floors support many smaller plants such as <a href="Gaultheria%20shallon">salal</a> and <a href="Polystichum">sword fern</a>. About 5 percent of the watershed consists of unvegetated water bodies or bare rock and a tiny fraction of <a href="meadow">meadow</a>.

More than 250 wildlife species, including <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a> and northern spotted owl are thought to frequent the watershed. Migratory birds such as <a href="loon">loon</a>s use the basin for feeding and nesting as they travel along the <a href="Pacific%20Flyway">Pacific Flyway</a>. Native fish species include <a href="Chinook%20salmon">chinook</a> and <a href="Coho%20salmon">coho</a> salmon, <a href="Rainbow%20trout">steelhead</a>, <a href="coastal%20cutthroat%20trout">coastal cutthroat trout</a>, <a href="Pacific%20lamprey">Pacific lamprey</a>, and rainbow trout, but since 1922 the headworks dam or its successor, Dam 2, have blocked <a href="anadromous">anadromous</a> fish passage to the upper river and its tributaries. Many <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a> and reptile species thrive near streams and ponds. <a href="Roosevelt%20elk">Roosevelt elk</a>, <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>, <a href="black-tailed%20deer">black-tailed deer</a>, <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">North American river otter</a>, <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a>, and <a href="North%20American%20beaver">North American beaver</a> are among the mammals found in the watershed.

 Adjacent to the confluence of the Bull Run and Sandy rivers, Dodge Park offers tree-shaded picnic areas, a <a href="swimming%20hole">swimming hole</a>, a sandy beach, and a boat ramp for launching rafts, <a href="kayak">kayak</a>s, and <a href="drift%20boat">drift boat</a>s on the Sandy River. The Portland Water Bureau owns and maintains the park, established in the early 20th century. Originally called Bull Run Park, it was renamed for Frank Dodge, superintendent of the water bureau from 1897 to 1914. Until supplanted by automobile highways, the electric trolley to Bull Run carried passengers to and from the park until 1930. The water bureau estimates that at least 30,000 people visited the park in 1926. , the bureau has plans to restore and improve the park as time and money allow.

Although most of the Bull Run River watershed is closed to the public, <a href="whitewater">whitewater</a> enthusiasts sometimes run the lower stretch from the Bull Run Road bridge to the Sandy River. The put-in place for the run is just below the powerhouse, and the take-out is at Dodge Park. The run features a permanent <a href="Whitewater%20slalom">slalom</a> course near the put-in, six <a href="International%20Scale%20of%20River%20Difficulty">class 3</a> rapids in the first , and a short stretch of class 2 water at the end of the run.

Fishing is limited to the lower reaches of the river. Hatchery Chinook salmon and summer and winter steelhead are sometimes caught near the confluence with the Sandy River, and <a href="catch%20and%20release">catch and release</a> fishing for wild <a href="trout">trout</a> is allowed from the mouth of the river to the edge of the Bull Run watershed reserve.

Access to the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit is generally limited to government employees and guests on official business, and security guards keep watch on its three gated entrances. However, the water bureau offers public tours in the summer and fall, and hikers may use the <a href="Pacific%20Crest%20Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a>, which runs along the eastern edge of the watershed near Mount Hood. The bureau has been averaging about 85 group tours a year.

Inscribed for the first time in Unas's pyramid, the tradition of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">funerary texts</a> carried on in the pyramids of subsequent rulers, through to the end of the Old Kingdom, and into the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> through the <a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a> which form the basis of the <a href="Book%20of%20the%20Dead">Book of the Dead</a>.

Unas built his pyramid between the complexes of <a href="Buried%20Pyramid">Sekhemket</a> and <a href="Step%20Pyramid%20of%20Djoser">Djoser</a>, in North <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a>. Anchored to the valley temple via a nearby lake, a long causeway was constructed to provide access to the pyramid site. The causeway had elaborately decorated walls covered with a roof which had a slit in one section allowing light to enter illuminating the images. A long <a href="wadi">wadi</a> was used as a pathway. The terrain was difficult to negotiate and contained old buildings and tomb superstructures. These were torn down and repurposed as underlay for the causeway. A significant stretch of Djoser's causeway was reused for embankments. Tombs that were on the path had their superstructures demolished and were paved over, preserving their decorations. Two <a href="Second%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Second Dynasty</a> tombs, presumed to belong to <a href="Hotepsekhemwy">Hotepsekhemwy</a>, <a href="Nebra%20%28Pharaoh%29">Nebra</a>, and <a href="Ninetjer">Ninetjer</a>, from seals found inside, are among those that lie under the causeway. The site was later used for numerous burials of Fifth Dynasty officials, private individuals from the <a href="Eighteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eighteenth</a> through <a href="Twentieth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twentieth</a> Dynasties, and a collection of <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late Period</a> monuments known as the "Persian tombs".

The causeway joined the temple in the harbour with the <a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a> on the east face of the pyramid. The mortuary temple was entered on its east side through a large granite doorway, seemingly constructed by Unas's successor, <a href="Teti">Teti</a>, connected to the end of the causeway. Just south of the upper causeway are two long boat pits. These may have contained two wooden boats; the solar barques of <a href="Ra">Ra</a>, the sun god. The temple was laid out in a similar manner to <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a>'s. A transverse corridor separates the outer from the inner temple. The entry chapel of the inner temple has been completely destroyed, though it once contained five statues in niches. A feature of the inner temple was a single quartzite column that was contained in the "antichambre carrée". The room is otherwise ruined. Quartzite is an atypical material to use in architectural projects, though examples of it being used sparingly in the Old Kingdom exist. The material is associated with the sun cult due to its sun-like coloration.

The underground chambers remained unexplored until 1881, when <a href="Gaston%20Maspero">Gaston Maspero</a>, who had recently discovered inscribed texts in the pyramids of <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Pepi%20I">Pepi I</a> and <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Merenre">Merenre I</a>, gained entry. Maspero found the same texts inscribed on the walls of Unas's pyramid, their first known appearance. The 283 spells in Unas's pyramid constitute the oldest, smallest and best preserved corpus of religious writing from the Old Kingdom. Their function was to guide the ruler through to eternal life and ensure his continued survival even if the funerary cult ceased to function. In Unas's case, the funerary cult may have survived the turbulent <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a> and up until the <a href="Twelfth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twelfth</a> or <a href="Thirteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Thirteenth Dynasty</a>, during the Middle Kingdom. This is a matter of dispute amongst Egyptologists, where a competing idea is that the cult was revived during the Middle Kingdom, rather than having survived until then.

The pyramid is situated in the <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> plateau, and lies on a line running from the <a href="Buried%20Pyramid">pyramid of Sekhemkhet</a> to the <a href="Headless%20Pyramid">pyramid of Menkauhor</a>. The site required the construction of an exceptionally long causeway to reach a nearby lake, indicating that the site must have held some significance to Unas.

The pyramid was briefly examined by <a href="John%20Shae%20Perring">John Shae Perring</a> and soon after by <a href="Karl%20Richard%20Lepsius">Karl Richard Lepsius</a>; the latter catalogued the pyramid on his <a href="Lepsius%20list%20of%20pyramids">pioneering list</a> as number XXXV. Entry was first gained by <a href="Gaston%20Maspero">Gaston Maspero</a>, who examined its substructure in 1881. He had recently discovered a set of texts in the <a href="Mortuary%20complex%20of%20Pepi%20I">pyramids of Pepi I</a> and <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Merenre">Merenre I</a>. Those same texts were discovered in Unas's tomb, making this their earliest known appearance. From 1899 to 1901, the architect and Egyptologist <a href="Alessandro%20Barsanti">Alessandro Barsanti</a> conducted the first systematic investigation of the pyramid site, succeeding in excavating part of the <a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a>, as well as a series of tombs from the <a href="Second%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Second Dynasty</a> and the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late Period</a>. Later excavations by <a href="Cecil%20Mallaby%20Firth">Cecil Mallaby Firth</a>, from 1929 until his death in 1931, followed by those of the architect <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Lauer">Jean-Philippe Lauer</a> from 1936 to 1939, were conducted with little success. The archaeologists <a href="Selim%20Hassan">Selim Hassan</a>, <a href="Zakaria%20Goneim">Muhammed Zakaria Goneim</a> and A. H. Hussein mainly focused on the causeway leading to the pyramid while conducting their investigations from 1937 to 1949. Hussein discovered a pair of limestone-lined boat pits at the upper end of the causeway. In the 1970s, <a href="Ahmed%20Moussa%20%28Egyptologist%29">Ahmad Moussa</a> excavated the lower half of the causeway and the valley temple. Moussa and another archaeologist, , conducted an architectural survey of the valley temple from 1971 to 1981. The pyramids of Unas, <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Teti">Teti</a>, <a href="Pepi%20I">Pepi I</a> and <a href="Merenre%20Nemtyemsaf%20I">Merenre</a> were the subjects of a major architectural and epigraphic project in Saqqara, led by <a href="Jean%20Leclant">Jean Leclant</a>. From 1999 until 2001, the <a href="Supreme%20Council%20of%20Antiquities">Supreme Council of Antiquities</a> conducted a major restoration and reconstruction project on the valley temple. The three entrances and ramps were restored, and a low limestone wall built to demarcate the temple's plan.

Unas's complex is situated between the pyramid of Sekhemkhet and the south-west corner of the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Djoser">pyramid complex of Djoser</a>. It is in symmetry with the pyramid of Userkaf situated at the north-east corner, in Saqqara. <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a> mortuary complexes consist of five essential components: (1) a valley temple; (2) a causeway; (3) a pyramid, or mortuary, temple; (4) a cult, or satellite, pyramid; and (5) the main pyramid. Unas's monument has all of these elements: the main pyramid, constructed six steps high from <a href="limestone">limestone</a> blocks; a valley temple situated in a natural harbour at the mouth of a <a href="wadi">wadi</a>; a causeway constructed using the same wadi as a path; a mortuary temple similar in layout to that of Unas's predecessor, <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a>'s, and a cult pyramid in the south of the mortuary temple. The pyramid, mortuary temple and cult pyramid were enclosed by a tall perimeter wall. The perimeter wall from the north-east to north-west corner is about long, and stretches from north to south.

Though Unas's reign lasted for around thirty to thirty-three years, his pyramid was the smallest built in the Old Kingdom. Time constraints cannot be considered a factor explaining the small size, and it is more likely that resource accessibility constrained the project. The monument's size was also inhibited due to the extensive quarrying necessary to increase the size of the pyramid. Unas chose to avoid that additional burden and instead kept his pyramid small.

The core of the pyramid was built six steps high, constructed with roughly dressed limestone blocks which decreased in size in each step. The construction material for the core would, ideally, have been locally sourced. This was then encased with fine white limestone blocks quarried from <a href="Tora%2C%20Egypt">Tura</a>. Some of the casing on the lowest steps has remained intact. The pyramid had a base length of converging towards the apex at an angle of approximately 56°, giving it a height of on completion. The pyramid had a total volume of . The pyramid was smooth-sided. The pyramid has since been ruined, as have all others of the Fifth Dynasty, a result of its poor construction and materials. The pyramids of the Fifth Dynasty were further systematically dismantled during the New Kingdom to be reused in the construction of new tombs.

Unas abandoned the practice of building pyramids for his consorts, instead <a href="Khenut">Khenut</a> and <a href="Nebet">Nebet</a> were buried in a <a href="mastaba">double mastaba</a> north-east of the main pyramid. Each queen was accorded separate rooms and an individual entrance, though the layout of the tombs is identical. Khenut owned the western half, and Nebet owned the eastern half. Their chambers were extensively decorated. The chapel for Nebet's mastaba contains four <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">recesse</a>s. One bears a <a href="cartouche">cartouche</a> of Unas's name, indicating that it may have contained a statue of the king, whereas the others contained statues of the queen. Directly north of the mastaba were the tombs for Unas's son Unasankh and daughter Iput. Another daughter, Hemetre, was buried in a tomb west of Djoser's complex.

A small chapel, called the "north chapel" or "entrance chapel", was situated adjacent to the pyramid's north face. It consisted of a single room, with an altar and a <a href="stela">stela</a> bearing the hieroglyph for "offering table". Only trace elements of the chapel remain. These chapels had a false door and a decoration scheme similar to the offering hall, which the archaeologist Dieter Arnold suggests indicates that the chapel was a "miniature offering chapel". 

The entrance into the substructure of the pyramid lay under the chapel's pavement. The substructure of the pyramid is similar to that of Unas's predecessor, Djedkare Isesi. The entry leads into a long vertically sloping corridor inclined at 22° that leads to a vestibule at its bottom. The vestibule is long and wide. From the vestibule, a long horizontal passage follows a level path to the antechamber and is guarded by three granite slab portcullises in succession. The passage ends at an antechamber, a room measuring by , located under the centre axis of the pyramid. To the east, a doorway leads to a room called the "<a href="serdab">serdab</a>" with three recesses. The "serdab" measures wide and deep. To the west lay the burial chamber, a room measuring by , containing the ruler's sarcophagus. The roof of both the antechamber and burial chamber were <a href="gable">gable</a>d, in a similar fashion to earlier pyramids of the era. 
Near the burial chamber's west wall sat Unas's coffin, made from <a href="greywacke">greywacke</a> rather than basalt as was originally presumed. The coffin was undamaged, but its contents had been robbed. A canopic chest had once been buried at the foot of the south-east corner of the coffin. Traces of the burial are fragmentary; all that remain are portions of a mummy, including its right arm, skull and shinbone, as well as the wooden handles of two knives used during the opening of the mouth ceremony. The mummy remains have been displayed in the <a href="Egyptian%20Museum">Egyptian Museum of Cairo</a>. 

The walls of the chambers were lined with Tura limestone, while those surrounding Unas's sarcophagus were sheathed in white alabaster incised and painted to represent the doors of the royal palace facade, complementing the eastern passage. Taken as symbolically functional, these allowed the king to depart the tomb in any direction. The ceiling of the burial chamber was painted blue with gold stars to resemble the night sky. The ceiling of the antechamber and corridor were similarly painted; however, whereas the stars in the antechamber and the burial chamber pointed northward, the stars in the corridor pointed towards the zenith. The remaining walls of the burial chamber, antechamber, and parts of the corridor were inscribed with a series of vertically written texts, chiseled in bas-relief and painted blue.

The inscriptions, known as the Pyramid Texts, were the central innovation of Unas's pyramid, on whose subterranean walls they were first etched. The Pyramid Texts are the oldest large corpus of religious writing known from ancient Egypt. A total of 283 such spells, out of at least 1,000 known and an indeterminate number of unknown ones, appear in Unas's pyramid. These 283 spells are the smallest and best-preserved collection of Pyramid Texts known from the Old Kingdom. Though they first appeared in Unas's pyramid, many of the texts are significantly older. The texts subsequently appeared in the pyramids of the kings and queens of the <a href="Sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth</a> to <a href="Eighth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eighth</a> Dynasties, until the end of the Old Kingdom. With the exception of a single spell, copies of Unas's texts appeared throughout the Middle Kingdom and later, including a near complete replica of the texts in the tomb of <a href="Senewosret-Ankh">Senwosretankh</a> at <a href="El-Lisht">El-Lisht</a>.

Ancient Egyptian belief held that the individual consisted of three basic parts; the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23%E1%BA%96t%20%28physical%29">body</a>, the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23k%EA%9C%A3%20%26quot%3Bdouble%26quot%3B">"ka"</a>, and the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23b%EA%9C%A3%20%28personality%29">"ba"</a>. When the person died, the "ka" would separate from the body and return to the gods from where it had come, while the "ba" remained with the body. The body of the individual, interred in the burial chamber, never physically left; but the "ba", awakened, released itself from the body and began its journey toward new life. Significant to this journey was the <a href="Akhet%20%28hieroglyph%29">Akhet</a>: the horizon, a junction between the earth, the sky, and the <a href="Duat">Duat</a>. To ancient Egyptians, the Akhet was the place from where the sun rose, and so symbolised a place of birth or resurrection. In the texts, the king is called upon to transform into an <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23%EA%9C%A3%E1%B8%AB">"akh"</a> in the Akhet. The "akh", literally "effective being", was the resurrected form of the deceased, attained through individual action and ritual performance. If the deceased failed to complete the transformation, they became "mutu", that is "the dead". The function of the texts, in congruence with all <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">funerary literature</a>, was to enable the reunion of the ruler's "ba" and "ka" leading to the transformation into an "akh", and to secure eternal life among the gods in the sky.

The writings on the west gable in Unas's burial chamber consist of spells that protect the sarcophagus and mummy within. The north and south walls of the chamber are dedicated to the offering and resurrection rituals respectively, and the east wall contains texts asserting the king's control over his sustenance in the form of a response to the offering ritual. The offering ritual texts continue onto the north and south walls of the passageway splitting the resurrection ritual which concludes on the south wall. In the rituals of the burial chamber, the king is identified both as himself and as the god <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, being addressed as "Osiris Unas". The king is also identified with other deities, occasionally several, alongside Osiris in other texts. The Egyptologist <a href="James%20Peter%20Allen">James Allen</a> identifies the last piece of ritual text on the west gable of the antechamber: Your son <a href="Horus">Horus</a> has acted for you.<br>The great ones will shake, having seen the knife in your arm as you emerge from the Duat.<br>Greetings, experienced one! <a href="Geb">Geb</a> has created you, the <a href="Ennead">Ennead</a> has given you birth.<br>Horus has become content about his father, <a href="Atum">Atum</a> has become content about his years, the eastern and western gods have become content about the great thing that has happened in his embrace—the god's birth. <br>It is Unis: Unis, see! It is Unis: Unis, look! It is Unis: hear! It is Unis: Unis, exist! It is Unis: Unis, raise yourself from your side!<br>Do my command, you who hate sleep but were made slack. Stand up, you in Nedit. Your good bread has been made in Pe; receive your control of <a href="Heliopolis%20%28ancient%20Egypt%29">Heliopolis</a>.<br>It is Horus (who speaks), having been commanded to act for his father.<br>The storm-lord, the one with spittle in his vicinity, <a href="Set%20%28deity%29">Seth</a>—he will bear you: he is the one who will bear Atum. The antechamber and corridor were inscribed primarily with personal texts. The west, north and south walls of the antechamber contain texts whose primary concern is the transition from the human realm to the next, and with the king's ascent to the sky. The east wall held a second set of protective spells, starting with the "Cannibal Hymn". In the hymn, Unas consumes the gods to absorb their power for his resurrection. The Egyptologist <a href="Toby%20Wilkinson">Toby Wilkinson</a> identifies the hymn as a mythologizing of the "butchery ritual" in which a bull is sacrificed. The "serdab" remained uninscribed. The southern section of the walls of the corridor contain texts that focus primarily on the resurrection and ascension of the deceased. The mere presence of the spells within the tomb were believed to have efficacy, thus protecting the king even if the funerary cult ceased to function.

Parts of the corpus of Pyramid Texts were passed down into the <a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a>, an expanded set of new texts written on non-royal tombs of the Middle Kingdom, some retaining Old Kingdom grammatical conventions and with many formulations of the Pyramid Texts recurring. The transition to the Coffin Texts was begun in the reign of Pepi I and completed by the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>. The Coffin Texts formed the basis for the <a href="Book%20of%20the%20Dead">Book of the Dead</a> in the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a> and Late Period. The texts would resurface in tombs and on papyri for two millennia, finally disappearing around the time that <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> was adopted.

Unas's valley temple is situated in a harbour that naturally forms at the point where the mouth of a wadi meets the lake. The same wadi was used as a path for the causeway. The temple sits between those of <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a> and <a href="Pepi%20II">Pepi II</a>. Despite a complex plan, the temple did not contain any significant innovations. It was richly decorated in a fashion similar to the causeway and mortuary temple and the surviving palm granite columns that stood at the entrance into the temple evidence their high quality craftsmanship.

The main entrance into the temple was on the east side, consisting of a portico with eight granite palm columns arranged into two rows. A narrow westward corridor led from the entry into a rectangular north–south oriented hall. A second hall was to the south. Two secondary entrances into the halls were built on the north and south sides. Each had a portico with two columns. These were approached by narrow ramps. West of the two halls was the main cult hall. It had a second chamber with three storerooms to the south and a passageway leading to the causeway to the north-west.

The causeway connecting the valley temple to the mortuary temple of Unas's pyramid complex was constructed along the path provided by a natural wadi. The Egyptologist <a href="Iorwerth%20Eiddon%20Stephen%20Edwards">Iorwerth Edwards</a> estimates the walls to be high, and thick. The passageway was about wide. It had a roof constructed from slabs thick projecting from each wall toward the centre. The causeway, at between and long, was among the longest constructed for any pyramid, comparable to the causeway of <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Giza">Khufu's pyramid</a>. The causeway is also the best preserved of any from the Old Kingdom. Construction of the causeway was complicated and required negotiating uneven terrain and older buildings which were torn down and their stones appropriated as underlay. The causeway was built with two turns, rather than in a straight line. Around worth of Djoser's causeway was used to provide embankments for Unas's causeway and to plug gaps between it and the wadi. South of the uppermost bend of the causeway were two long boat pits of white limestone, which might originally have housed <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20solar%20ships">wooden boats</a> with curved keels representing the day and night vessels of <a href="Ra">Ra</a>, the sun god. The boats lay side by side in an east–west orientation.
Tombs in the path of the causeway were built over, preserving their decorations, but not their contents, indicating that the tombs had been robbed either before or during the causeway's construction. Two large royal tombs, dating to the Second Dynasty, are among those that lie beneath the causeway. The western gallery tomb contains seals bearing the names of <a href="Hotepsekhemwy">Hotepsekhemwy</a> and <a href="Nebra%20%28Pharaoh%29">Nebra</a>, and the eastern gallery tomb contains numerous seals inscribed with the name of <a href="Nynetjer">Ninetjer</a> indicating probable ownership. The superstructures of the tombs were demolished, allowing the mortuary temple and upper end of the causeway to be built over the top of them.

The interior walls of the causeway were highly decorated with painted bas-reliefs, but records of these are fragmentary. The remnants depict a variety of scenes including the hunting of wild animals, the conducting of harvests, scenes from the markets, craftsmen working copper and gold, a fleet returning from <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a>, boats transporting columns from Aswan to the construction site, battles with enemies and nomadic tribes, the transport of prisoners, lines of people bearing offerings, and a procession of representatives from the <a href="Nome%20%28Egypt%29">nomes</a> of Egypt. A slit was left in a section of the causeway roofing, allowing light to enter illuminating the brightly painted decorations on the walls. The archaeologist Peter Clayton notes that these depictions were more akin to those found in the mastabas of nobles.

The Egyptologist <a href="Miroslav%20Verner">Miroslav Verner</a> highlights one particular scene from the causeway depicting famished desert nomads. The scene had been used as "unique proof" that the living standards of desert dwellers had declined during Unas's reign as a result of climatic changes in the middle of the third millennium B.C. The discovery of a similar relief painting on the blocks of <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Sahure">Sahure's</a> causeway casts doubt on this hypothesis. Verner contends that the nomads may have been brought in to demonstrate the hardships faced by pyramid builders bringing in higher quality stone from remote mountain areas. Grimal suggested that this scene foreshadowed the nationwide <a href="4.2%20kiloyear%20event">famine that seems to have struck Egypt</a> at the onset of the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a>. According to Allen et al., the most widely accepted explanation for the scene is that it was meant to illustrate the generosity of the sovereign in aiding famished populations.
A collection of tombs were found north of the causeway. The <a href="tomb%20of%20Akhethetep">tomb of Akhethetep</a>, a vizier, was discovered by a team led by <a href="Christiane%20Ziegler">Christiane Ziegler</a>. The other mastabas belong to the viziers Ihy, Iy–nofert, Ny-ankh-ba and Mehu. The tombs are conjectured to belong to Unas's <a href="Vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">viziers</a>, with the exception of Mehu's tomb, which is associated with Pepi I. Another tomb, belonging to Unas-ankh, son of Unas, separates the tombs of Ihy and Iy-nofert. It may be dated late into Unas's reign.

Ahmed Moussa discovered the rock-cut tombs of Nefer and Ka-hay court singers during <a href="Menkauhor%20Kaiu">Menkauhor</a>'s reign south of Unas's causeway, containing nine burials along with an extremely well preserved mummy found in a coffin in a shaft under the east wall of the chapel. The then Chief Inspector at Saqqara <a href="Mounir%20Basta">Mounir Basta</a> discovered another rock-cut tomb just south of the causeway in 1964, later excavated by Ahmed Moussa when it was uncovered that the tombs belonged to two palace officials manicurists living during the reigns of Nyuserre Ini and Menkauhor, in the Fifth Dynasty, named <a href="Khnumhotep%20and%20Niankhkhnum">Ni-ankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep</a>. A highly decorated chapel for the tomb was discovered the following year. The chapel was located inside a unique stone mastaba that was connected to the tombs through an undecorated open court.

The mortuary temple in Unas's pyramid complex has a layout comparable to his predecessor, Djedkare Isesi's, with one notable exception. A pink granite doorway separates the end of the causeway from the entrance hall. It bears the names and titles of <a href="Teti">Teti</a>, Unas's successor, indicating that he must have had the doorway constructed following Unas's death. The entrance hall had a vaulted ceiling, and a floor paved with alabaster. The walls in the room were decorated with relief paintings that depicted the making of offerings. The entrance hall terminates in an open columned courtyard, with eighteen two more columns than in Djedkare Isesi's complex pink granite palm columns supporting the roof of an ambulatory. Some of the columns were reused centuries later in buildings in Tanis, the capital of Egypt during the <a href="Twenty-first%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty First</a> and <a href="Twenty-second%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty Second</a> Dynasties. Other columns have been displayed in the British Museum, and in the Louvre. Relief decorations that were formerly in the courtyard have also been reused in later projects, as shown by the presence of reliefs of Unas in <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Amenemhet%20I">Amenemhat I's pyramid complex</a> in <a href="El-Lisht">El-Lisht</a>.
North and south of the entrance hall and columned courtyard were storerooms. These were stocked regularly with offering items for the royal <a href="funerary%20cult">funerary cult</a>, which had expanded influence in the Fifth Dynasty. Their irregular placement resulted in the northern storerooms being twice as numerous as the southern. The rooms were used for burials in the Late Period, as noted by the presence of large shaft tombs. At the far end of the courtyard was a transverse corridor creating an intersection between the columned courtyard at its east and inner temple to its west, with a cult pyramid to the south, and a larger courtyard surrounding the pyramid to the north.

The inner temple is accessed by a small staircase leading into a ruined chapel with five statue niches. The chapel and offering hall were surrounded by storerooms; as elsewhere in the temple, there were more storerooms to the north than south. The "antichambre carrée" a square antechamber separated the chapel from the offering hall. The room measures on each side, and is the smallest such chamber from the Old Kingdom. It has been largely destroyed. It was originally entered through a door on its eastern side, and contained two additional doors leading to the offering hall and storeroom. The room contained a single column made of quartzite fragments of which have been found in the south-west part of the temple quarried from the <a href="El-Gabal%20el-Ahmar">Gabel Ahmar</a> stone quarry near Heliopolis. Quartzite, being a particularly hard stone a 7 on the <a href="Mohs%20scale%20of%20mineral%20hardness">Mohs hardness scale</a> was not typically used in architectural projects. It was used sparingly as a building material at some sites Old Kingdom sites in Saqqara. The hard stone is associated with the sun cult, a natural development caused by the coloration of the material being sun-like. Remnants of a granite false door bearing an inscription concerning the <a href="souls%20of%20Nekhen%20and%20Pe">souls of the residents of Nekhen and Buto</a> marks what little of the offering hall has been preserved. A block from the door has been displayed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

The purpose of the cult pyramid remains unclear. It had a burial chamber but was not used for burials, and instead appears to have been a purely symbolic structure. It may have hosted the pharaoh's "ka", or a miniature statue of the king. It may have been used for ritual performances centering around the burial and resurrection of the "ka" spirit during the "<a href="Sed%20festival">Sed</a>" festival.

The cult pyramid in Unas's complex has identifiable remains, but has otherwise been destroyed. The preserved elements suggest that it had a base length of , a fifth of that of the main pyramid. The pyramid's covering slabs were measured to be inclined at 69°. This was typical for cult pyramids which had a 2:1 ratio-ed slope, and thus a height equal to the length of the base, i.e. . A small channel was dug in front of the pyramid entrance, perhaps to prevent run-off from entering the pyramid. The first slabs of the descending corridor are declined at 30.5°. The pit measures north-south and east-west. The burial chamber was cut deep into the rock, sits beneath the pavement and measures by .

The "great enclosure" of the main pyramid and inner temple has an identifiable anomaly. from the cult pyramid's west face the wall abruptly turns to the north before receding for toward the main pyramid. It stops from the main pyramid and turns once more back onto its original alignment. The only explanation for this is the presence of the Second Dynasty Hotepsekhemwy's large tomb which spans the width of the whole temple and crosses directly under the recess. The architects of the pyramid appear to have preferred for the enclosure wall to run over the tomb's passageway, rather than over the top of the subterranean gallery. The cult pyramid has its own secondary enclosure that runs along the north face of the pyramid and half of its west face. This secondary wall was about thick, and had a double-door thick built close to its start.

Evidence suggests that Unas's funerary cult survived through the First Intermediate Period and into the Middle Kingdom, an indication that Unas retained prestige long after his death. Two independent pieces of evidence corroborate the existence of the cult in the Middle Kingdom: 1) A stela dated to the <a href="Twelfth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twelfth Dynasty</a> bearing the name Unasemsaf and 2) A statue of a Memphite official, Sermaat, from the Twelfth or <a href="Thirteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Thirteenth Dynasty</a>, with an inscription invoking Unas's name. The Egyptologist <a href="Jarom%C3%ADr%20M%C3%A1lek">Jaromír Málek</a> contends that the evidence only suggests a theoretical revival of the cult, a result of the valley temple serving as a useful entry path into the Saqqara necropolis, but not its persistence from the Old Kingdom. Despite renewed interest in the Old Kingdom rulers at the time, their funerary complexes, including Unas's, were partially reused in the construction of <a href="Amenemhat%20I">Amenemhat I</a>'s and <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a>'s pyramid complexes at El-Lisht. One block used in Amenemhat's complex has been positively identified as originating from Unas's complex, likely taken from the causeway, on the basis of inscriptions containing his name appearing upon it. Several other blocks have their origins speculatively assigned to Unas's complex as well.

The Saqqara plateau witnessed a new era of tomb building in the New Kingdom. Starting with the reign of <a href="Thutmose%20III">Thutmose III</a> in the <a href="Eighteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eighteenth Dynasty</a> and up until possibly the <a href="Twentieth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twentieth Dynasty</a>, Saqqara was used as a site for the tombs of private individuals. The largest concentrations of tombs from the period are found in a large area south of Unas's causeway. This area came to prominent use around the time of <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>. Unas's pyramid underwent restorative work in the New Kingdom. In the <a href="Nineteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Nineteenth Dynasty</a>, <a href="Khaemweset">Khaemweset</a>, High Priest of Memphis and son of <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a>, had an inscription carved onto a block on the pyramid's south side commemorating his restoration work.

Late Period monuments, colloquially called the "Persian tombs", thought to date to the reign of <a href="Amasis%20II">Amasis II</a>, were discovered near the causeway. These include tombs built for Tjannehebu, Overseer of the Royal Navy; Psamtik, the Chief Physician; and Peteniese, Overseer of Confidential Documents. The Egyptologist <a href="John%20D.%20Ray">John D. Ray</a> explains that the site was chosen because it was readily accessible from both Memphis and the Nile Valley. Traces of Phoenician and Aramaic burials have been reported in the area directly south of Unas's causeway.

Hurricane Juan (1985)

Hurricane Juan was a large and erratic <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that looped twice near the <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> coast, causing widespread flooding. It was the tenth <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a> of the <a href="1985%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1985 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, forming in the central Gulf of Mexico in late October. Juan moved northward after its formation, and was <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical</a> in nature with its large size. On October 27, the storm became a hurricane, reaching <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of 85 mph (140 km/h). Due to the influence of an <a href="cold-core%20low">upper-level low</a>, Juan looped just off southern Louisiana before making <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Morgan%20City%2C%20Louisiana">Morgan City</a> on October 29. Weakening to tropical storm status over land, Juan turned back to the southeast over open waters, crossing the <a href="Mississippi%20River%20Delta">Mississippi River Delta</a>. After turning to the northeast, the storm made its final landfall just west of <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a>, late on October 31. Juan continued quickly to the north and was absorbed by an approaching <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a>, although its moisture contributed to a <a href="1985%20Election%20day%20floods">deadly flood event</a> in the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a>.

Juan was the last of three hurricanes to move over Louisiana during the season, after <a href="Hurricane%20Danny%20%281985%29">Danny</a> in August and <a href="Hurricane%20Elena">Elena</a> in early September. It formed rapidly over the northern Gulf of Mexico, allowing little time for thorough preparations or the evacuation of offshore oil rigs. As a result, nine people died in maritime accidents off Louisiana. Onshore, the hurricane dropped torrential rain totaling in <a href="Galliano%2C%20Louisiana">Galliano, Louisiana</a>. The combination of the rainfall and a high <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> flooded 50,000 houses and many communities in southern Louisiana, causing extensive agriculture losses. Damage in Louisiana alone approached $1 billion (1985 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). Elsewhere, flooding in Texas forced the closure of roadways, while heavy rains damaged crops and houses in southern Mississippi. The outer rainbands of Juan spawned 15 tornadoes along the <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a>, causing over $1 million in damage. Overall, Juan directly inflicted about $1.5 billion in damage, making it among the costliest <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20hurricanes">United States hurricanes</a>, and caused 12 deaths. This excludes the effects from the subsequent flooding in the Mid-Atlantic.

The interaction between a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> and a <a href="cold-core%20low">upper-level low</a> moving southeastward from Texas spawned a broad <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> over the central <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> on October 24. That day, there was a marked increase in <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a>, or thunderstorms. At the same time, the pressure gradient between the trough and a <a href="high%20pressure%20area">high pressure area</a> over the southeastern United States produced winds of near <a href="gale">gale</a> force across the northern Gulf of Mexico. Early on October 26, a tropical depression developed about 380 mi (610 km) south-southwest of <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. Within 12 hours, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Juan, based on satellite imagery and reports from the <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a>. Initially, the structure was akin to that of a <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical cyclone</a>, with light winds near the center. Juan moved erratically at first, eventually tracking more steadily to the north-northeast on October 27. After turning to the northwest late on October 27, Juan intensified into a hurricane, with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of 75 mph (120 km/h), based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters.

Under the effects of a larger upper-level low, Juan slowed on October 28 while approaching the Louisiana coastline. At 1200 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> that day, the hurricane attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). After executing a loop just offshore southern Louisiana, Juan turned back to the east, making <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> at peak intensity near <a href="Morgan%20City%2C%20Louisiana">Morgan City</a> at 1100 UTC on October 29. Subsequently, Juan turned sharply to the northwest, executing another loop over southern Louisiana near <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Louisiana">Lafayette</a>. Late on October 29, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, emerging into <a href="Vermilion%20Bay%20%28Louisiana%29">Vermilion Bay</a> early the next day with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Juan turned to the east, moving along the southern Louisiana coast and re-organizing slightly.

On October 31, the storm moved across the <a href="Mississippi%20Delta">Mississippi Delta</a> near <a href="Burrwood%2C%20Louisiana">Burrwood, Louisiana</a>, and accelerated to the northeast, influenced by an approaching upper-level trough. At 1200 UTC that day, Juan attained a secondary peak of 70 mph (110 km/h). In the subsequent six hours, the storm weakened slightly, making its final landfall just west of <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a> with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) late on October 31. After striking Florida, Juan turned to the north and weakened over land. After moving through <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, the storm became <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> over Tennessee on November 1. Although the <a href="HURDAT">Atlantic hurricane best track</a> ceased tracking the circulation at 1800 UTC that day, Juan continued generally northward through the <a href="Ohio%20Valley">Ohio Valley</a>, and the center eventually crossed into Canada. The energy from Juan helped spawn an <a href="Occluded%20front">occluded low</a> in the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley">Tennessee Valley</a>, which produced more rainfall throughout the region. An approaching cold front absorbed the remnants of Juan on November 3.

Before Juan made landfall, about 100 people evacuated from the area around <a href="Port%20Arthur%2C%20Texas">Port Arthur, Texas</a>. In Louisiana, about 6,550 people evacuated, including only 700 of the 1,900 residents on <a href="Grand%20Isle%2C%20Louisiana">Grand Isle</a>; many of those who stayed behind there were trapped after the onslaught of the storm surge. About 6,000 people evacuated in Mississippi due to the threat for flooding. Many schools were closed along the coast in Louisiana and Mississippi, and two beaches were closed both sides of the <a href="Brownsville%2C%20Texas">Brownsville, Texas</a> shipping channel. On October 28, <a href="Governor%20of%20Louisiana">governor</a> <a href="Edwin%20Edwards">Edwin Edwards</a> declared a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> for 13 <a href="List%20of%20parishes%20in%20Louisiana">Louisiana parishes</a>, while officials issued <a href="flash%20flood%20watch">flash flood watch</a>es for 42 of Louisiana's 64 parishes. Governor <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a> also declared a state of emergency for Alabama, and shelters were opened along the coast.

Due to the erratic motion and large size of Juan, <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">tropical cyclone warnings and watches</a> were issued for large portions of the northern Gulf Coast. Around the time of landfall, hurricane warnings were issued from Port Arthur, Texas to <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, with gale warnings farther to the east to <a href="Apalachicola%2C%20Florida">Apalachicola, Florida</a> and extending to the west to <a href="Port%20O%27Connor%2C%20Texas">Port O'Connor, Texas</a>. The storm's quick development left people generally unprepared. <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> forecaster <a href="Neil%20Frank">Neil Frank</a> likened Juan to "a spinning top [that] will spin around unpredictably and do whatever it wants."

While on its erratic path off the northern Gulf Coast, Juan killed 12 people, nine of whom offshore due to overturned oil rigs or boats. The hurricane directly caused about $1.5 billion in damage, making it the fourth costliest <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20hurricanes">United States hurricane</a> at the time without adjusting for inflation; it was behind only <a href="Hurricane%20Frederic">Hurricane Frederic</a> of 1979, <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">Hurricane Agnes</a> of 1972, and <a href="Hurricane%20Alicia">Hurricane Alicia</a> of 1983. The damage total included losses to the oil industry, wrecked crops, and overall flooding damage, mostly in Louisiana. According to the <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA), Juan injured 1,357 people, mostly to a minor extent. Juan struck less than two months after <a href="Hurricane%20Elena">Hurricane Elena</a> hit the northern Gulf Coast, resulting in further damage to already ravaged areas.

For about five days, Juan and its precursor produced gale-force winds along the northern Gulf of Mexico. The strongest winds in relation to Juan were on offshore oil rigs, with one rig recording peak sustained winds of 92 mph (148 km/h) and gusts to 110 mph (176 km/h). Juan also produced high waves that damaged several rigs, of which two were overturned. One of the rigs collapsed and fell onto an adjacent rig about south of <a href="Golden%20Meadow%2C%20Louisiana">Golden Meadow, Louisiana</a> amid hurricane-force winds and high seas. The collapsed rigs, built in 1956 and 1961, were designed to withstand waves that would accompany a <a href="return%20period">25 year storm</a> at the time, though Juan produced waves approaching . The combination of the waves and strong winds in advance of the storm prevented early evacuation of the oil rigs. A boat of evacuees overturned in the midst of the storm, killing one and hospitalizing two others; the remaining workers were rescued by the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a>, and overall the agency rescued at least 160 people. While conducting a search and rescue mission, a boat named "Miss Agnes" capsized about south of Grand Isle, Louisiana; two members of the crew went missing and were presumed killed, and two other occupants were rescued. A <a href="jackup%20rig">jackup rig</a> capsized near the mouth of the Mississippi River, killing three. A rescue helicopter off the coast of Louisiana caused three severe injuries when the <a href="Helicopter%20rescue%20basket">rescue basket</a> blew onto the evacuated oil rig amid strong winds.

Because it looped twice near the coastline, Hurricane Juan brought extensive rainfall from eastern Texas to the western <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a>. In Texas, the highest precipitation total was at a station southwest of <a href="Alto%2C%20Texas">Alto</a>. The highest rainfall related to Juan in the United States was , recorded in <a href="Galliano%2C%20Louisiana">Galliano, Louisiana</a>. Farther east, there were more reports of high rainfall, measured at and in <a href="Biloxi%2C%20Mississippi">Biloxi, Mississippi</a> and <a href="Fairhope%2C%20Alabama">Fairhope, Alabama</a>, respectively. In Florida, the highest rainfall was near Pensacola. As well as the heavy rainfall, Juan produced heightened tides along the Gulf Coast, peaking at 8.2 ft (2.5 m) in <a href="Bayou%20Bienvenue">Bayou Bienvenue</a> in Louisiana. Tides peaked at around 3.3 ft (1 m) in the other coastal states, although offshore winds caused below-normal tides in western Louisiana and Texas after Juan exited the area. The storm also spawned a few tornadoes, most of them weak. Two were in Mississippi, each damaging a mobile home and downing several trees, and at least three occurred in Alabama, causing isolated building and tree damage.
Hurricane Juan was one of the latest tropical cyclones in the year to affect Texas. The heavy rainfall from the storm caused flooding in the southeastern portion of the state, primarily in low-lying areas and along bayous. The flooding forced several roads to close, but there was minimal housing damage. Tides reached about above normal near <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston</a>, causing coastal flooding and closing a portion of <a href="Texas%20State%20Highway%2087">Texas State Highway 87</a>, but little beach erosion. Due to Juan's structure being closer to a subtropical cyclone than a typical hurricane, it produced strong winds well away from its center, with gusts of reported along the Texas coast. The winds were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines, causing power outages. One person drowned in a boating accident off the Texas coast.

In Mississippi, heavy rain from Juan flooded about 340 homes and businesses, mainly in the southern portion of the state. High winds and waves damaged ports in <a href="Pass%20Christian%2C%20Mississippi">Pass Christian</a> and <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20Mississippi">Long Beach</a>. Several boats were damaged along the coast, and the seafood industry suffered losses. Beach erosion damaged coastal roads, leaving debris and marsh grass behind when the storm passed. The total storm cost in the state was estimated at $776,000. In neighboring Alabama, Juan only produced wind gusts of , which caused little damage, but the storm's rainfall contributed to Mobile recording its wettest October on record. The rains caused flooding along streets and low-lying areas, but property generally escaped unscathed. The flooding did cause locally heavy crop damage; some farmers lost 50% of their <a href="soybean">soybean</a> crop, and the <a href="pecan">pecan</a> crop was damaged after earlier being affected by Hurricane Elena. Damage in the state was minor, estimated at over $65,000.

Farther east in Florida, high waves caused flooding, beach erosion, and the loss of seawalls previously damaged by Elena. The rough surf washed away a house on <a href="Captiva%20Island">Captiva Island</a>. The outskirts of Juan also spawned 15 tornadoes along the Florida Panhandle, causing $1 million in damage. The tornadoes injured six people, destroyed 19 buildings, and damaged about 40 others. One of the tornadoes struck <a href="Okaloosa%20Island">Okaloosa Island</a> and <a href="Fort%20Walton%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Fort Walton Beach</a>, killing a dog and damaging two hotels along <a href="U.S.%20Route%2098%20in%20Florida">U.S. Route 98</a>.

Due to the cyclone's slow movement over Louisiana, it dropped over of rainfall across much of the southern portion of the state. The intense rainfall increased levels along rivers in southwestern Louisiana. High waves and a <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> of flooded low-lying and coastal areas of southeastern Louisiana. The hurricane's erratic path prevented farmers from harvesting crops for three days. The combination of flooding from rainfall and storm surge covered widespread areas of crop fields, mostly affecting soybean and sugar. Other crops in the state had previously been harvested. About 200 cattle drowned in Terrebonne Parish, and thousands were stranded. Crop damage was estimated at over $304 million, including $100 million to the soybean industry, with overall damage near $1 billion across the state. As well as its impact on crops, Juan severely affected the shrimp industry by washing many shrimp offshore and killing others. The storm left about $2.9 million in damage to oil facilities in the state, including the cost of damaged pipelines. Overall, Juan flooded about 50,000 houses in Louisiana, causing $250 million in property damage.

Near <a href="Port%20Fourchon%2C%20Louisiana">Port Fourchon</a> in <a href="Lafourche%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Lafourche Parish</a>, the storm surge damaged portions of <a href="Louisiana%20Highway%201">Louisiana Highways 1</a> and <a href="Louisiana%20Highway%203090">3090</a> and flooded about 1,200 homes, some to their roofs. Two levees in the parish were washed out and one was overtopped, inundating 100 houses near <a href="Lockport%2C%20Louisiana">Lockport</a>. In <a href="Terrebonne%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Terrebonne Parish</a>, the powerful storm surge swept away parked cars, knocked a home off its foundation, and damaged a portion of a levee. In the parish, 800 homes were flooded, and 15,000 people were left homeless. The storm surge also washed out a portion of the levee protecting Grand Isle, and damaged another . The levee, built in 1984, sustained $500,000 in damages, which flooded the island with of ocean water. Most of the island lost power, and the city hall and high school, set up as shelters, utilized generators during the storm. In <a href="Jefferson%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Jefferson Parish</a>, which contains Grand Isle, the storm surge entered 2,233 homes and inundated about 3,100 cars. In <a href="Violet%2C%20Louisiana">Violet</a>, a man drowned when he fell from his boat into a flooded canal, and another fisherman drowned in <a href="Atchafalaya%20Basin">Atchafalaya Bay</a>. The surge flooded a section of <a href="Louisiana%20Highway%2023">Louisiana Route 23</a> in <a href="Plaquemines%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Plaquemines Parish</a>, entering several homes, as well as a portion of <a href="Louisiana%20Highway%2022">Route 22</a>. Between <a href="Livingston%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Livingston</a> and <a href="Ascension%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Ascension</a> parishes, about 800 homes were flooded, and another 53 homes were flooded in <a href="Tangipahoa%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Tangipahoa Parish</a>. Waters from <a href="Lake%20Pontchartrain">Lake Pontchartrain</a> swept over <a href="Airline%20Highway">Airline Highway</a> and portions of a high levee, flooding 250 nearby homes. The storm surge washed out three bridges and flooded 800 homes in <a href="St.%20Tammany%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">St. Tammany Paris</a>, while high waters killed a man in <a href="Slidell%2C%20Louisiana">Slidell</a>. One man was electrocuted and killed in <a href="Arnaudville%2C%20Louisiana">Arnaudville</a> when stepping on a downed wire.

While approaching its final landfall as a weak tropical storm, Juan created a storm surge of along the <a href="Chandeleur%20Islands">Chandeleur Islands</a> to its west, resulting in extensive beach erosion. The island chain is an important buffer to parts of mainland Louisiana against storms, but is frequently physically manipulated by intense hurricanes. Hurricanes <a href="Hurricane%20Danny%20%281985%29">Danny</a> and Elena also impacted the islands in 1985. Large portions of the Louisiana coastline lost of beach due to the storm, with several new temporary inlets created along barrier islands.

In the states inland from the Gulf Coast, Juan produced lighter rainfall than where its track moved across, but there were totals as high as in Arkansas. Rains directly from Juan extended into the southeastern United States, reaching on <a href="Grandfather%20Mountain">Grandfather Mountain</a> in North Carolina, and through the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic</a> with totals as high as in <a href="Bakerstown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bakerstown, Pennsylvania</a>. Through the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a>, Juan dropped over of rainfall in portions of Kentucky, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

The rains from Juan and the low it spawned in the Mid-Atlantic moistened grounds across the region. The hurricane's track helped bring a plume of moisture into the Mid-Atlantic, which set the stage for a major flooding event when a low pressure area stalled on November 5 west of <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Major flooding occurred in Virginia and West Virginia, causing $1.4 billion in damage and 62 deaths.

On October 29, Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards requested that the state's congressional delegation ask <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> for a disaster declaration. President Reagan responded and issued a disaster declaration on November 1, which included the parishes of Ascension, Jefferson, Lafourche, Livingston, Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, Saint Charles, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Terrebonne, as well as the <a href="Lower%20Ninth%20Ward">Lower Ninth Ward</a> of New Orleans. The <a href="Louisiana%20Department%20of%20Transportation%20and%20Development">Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development</a> estimated that highways in the state would require $3 million in repairs from damage wrought by the hurricane.

Oil companies lost two to three days of production due to being closed by the hurricane. The Louisiana <a href="United%20States%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> assisted farmers by dropping hay to stranded cattle over a two-week period.
The <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> ran out of funds while responding to the effects of Juan and the mid-Atlantic flooding, following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria, as well as <a href="1985%20Puerto%20Rico%20floods">flooding in Puerto Rico</a>; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal. The agency had provided about $8 million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana. Along the <a href="Apalachicola%20Bay">Apalachicola Bay</a>, the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry, leaving hundreds of oystermen out of work. The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ocean%20Energy%20Management%2C%20Regulation%20and%20Enforcement">Minerals Management Service</a> to recommend increased inspections on older rigs and improve evacuation plans. Hurricane Juan was one in a series of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over many years that contributed to the loss of the <a href="Wetlands%20of%20Louisiana">coastal wetlands</a>.

Capitol Loop

The Capitol Loop is a <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> running through <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing, Michigan</a>, in the United States that was commissioned on October 13, 1989. It forms a <a href="loop%20route">loop route</a> off <a href="Interstate%20496">Interstate 496</a> (I-496) through downtown near the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Capitol">Michigan State Capitol</a> complex, home of the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Legislature">state legislature</a> and several state departments. The <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) has labeled it as Capitol Loop I-496 or CL I-496 on some maps, similar to the <a href="business%20loop">Business Loop</a> Interstate nomenclature. However, unlike other business loops in Michigan, it has unique <a href="reassurance%20marker">reassurance marker</a>s—the signs that serve as regular reminders of the name and number of the highway. It is known internally at MDOT as Connector 496 for inventory purposes. The route follows a series of one-way and two-way streets through downtown Lansing, directing traffic downtown to the State Capitol and other government buildings. Unlike the other streets downtown, the seven streets comprising the Capitol Loop are under state maintenance and jurisdiction.

The loop was originally proposed in 1986 as part of a downtown revitalization effort. Almost from the beginning before the highway was commissioned in 1989, it was affected by controversial proposals. Several suggestions by community leaders to rename city streets in honor of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> were rejected. In the end, Logan Street was given a second name, Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, and the original name was eventually dropped.

Meetings beginning in 1999 dealt with rebuilding the streets as part of a downtown beautification project. The project was delayed to accommodate replacing the sewer system under the roadway at the same time as the streetscaping. The downtown business community protested the original scope of construction, and the Lansing City Council threatened to cancel the project in response to the controversy. Instead of losing the investment in the downtown area, the scope of the project was reduced in scale, and the project was completed in 2005, three months ahead of schedule. In 2010, additional controversies surfaced regarding the posting and enforcement of speed limits on city streets in Michigan, including the streets that make up the Capitol Loop. The newest controversy over speed limits is related to compliance with a 2006 state law aimed at eliminating <a href="speed%20trap">speed trap</a>s.

The Capitol Loop serves as a connection between the other state highways in Lansing and the Michigan State Capitol complex. The trunkline starts at the northern end of <a href="M-99%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-99</a> at exit 5 on I-496. It runs north on Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, where the street is divided into north- and south-bound sections, each three lanes wide, separated by the Union Missionary Baptist Church off St. Joseph Street. A block north of the church, the sections of the street are divided by a central median north of Lenawee Street.
At Allegan Street, the Capitol Loop becomes a <a href="one-way%20pair">one-way pair</a>. Eastbound traffic continues on Allegan Street, passing to the south of the <a href="Michigan%20Hall%20of%20Justice">Hall of Justice</a>, home to the <a href="Michigan%20Supreme%20Court">Michigan Supreme Court</a>. Westbound traffic is carried on Ottawa Street, one block to the north of Allegan Street. The Hall faces Butler Boulevard, which provides access from Allegan and Ottawa streets. Past Butler Boulevard, traffic passes the north side of the <a href="Library%20of%20Michigan">Library of Michigan</a> and Historical Center complex. Between Pine Street and Capitol Avenue, Allegan Street continues south of the Michigan State Capitol. Allegan Street ends at a one-way street, Grand Avenue, and eastbound Capitol Loop turns north on this three-lane street.
The two directions of traffic on the Capitol Loop are reunited at the two-way Michigan Avenue. Eastbound traffic turns east along Michigan Avenue; westbound traffic turns north off Michigan onto Grand Avenue. Michigan Avenue runs with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane, crossing the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a>. East of the river, it approaches a complex of museums on Museum Drive, including the <a href="Michigan%20Museum%20of%20Surveying">Michigan Museum of Surveying</a>, <a href="R.E.%20Olds%20Transportation%20Museum">R.E. Olds Transportation Museum</a> (named for <a href="Oldsmobile">Oldsmobile</a> founder, <a href="R.E.%20Olds">R.E. Olds</a>) and the <a href="Impression%20Five%20Science%20Museum">Impression Five Science Museum</a> south of Riverwalk Park.

The Capitol Loop meets the one-way pairing of Cedar and Larch streets on Michigan Avenue near <a href="Cooley%20Law%20School%20Stadium">Cooley Law School Stadium</a>, home of the <a href="Lansing%20Lugnuts">Lansing Lugnuts</a> minor league baseball team. Cedar and Larch carry <a href="Interstate%2096%20Business%20%28Lansing%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop Interstate 96</a> (BL I-96). The two highway designations merge and <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">run concurrently</a> along the pair of streets. Eastbound Capitol Loop and eastbound BL I-96 follow Cedar Street southerly; westbound Capitol Loop and westbound BL I-96 are routed northerly on Larch Street. Cedar Street runs southeasterly along the Grand River angling toward Larch Street. The two streets merge where they meet I-496. This interchange at exit 7 along I-496 marks the eastern end of the Capitol Loop, but BL I-96 continues south of I-496 on Cedar Street. No part of the Capitol Loop is included on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a system of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.

In 2009, MDOT conducted one of its annual surveys to measure the traffic levels on Michigan trunklines. These surveys calculate the <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a> (AADT), which is a computation of the average traffic levels for a segment of roadway on any given day of the year. Along the Capitol Loop, the highest traffic counts were measured on Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. A daily average of 25,513 vehicles used that section of the route. This figure included an AADT of 619 commercial vehicles. Traffic volume drops along Allegan and Ottawa streets, where 2,687 and 1,499 vehicles used those streets, respectively. The second highest traffic counts were on the section concurrent with BL I-96 on Cedar and Larch streets. There, 17,682 vehicles and 547 trucks used the streets.

MDOT proposed the Capitol Loop in 1986. The highway designation was part of a partnership between the State of Michigan and the City of Lansing to revitalize the downtown area. The designation of this highway provided drivers with a signed route to various attractions in the downtown Lansing area. MDOT started implementing plans for the Capitol Loop in May 1986 with improvements to Michigan Avenue. This project included an initial $80,000 investment (equivalent to $ in ) to streetscaping between the State Capitol and the Grand River. The City of Lansing transferred jurisdiction over the streets involved to MDOT on October 13, 1989, allowing the state to commission the trunkline.

The route serves the Capitol Park, which was created by an act of the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> in 1984 with the boundaries of Ottawa, Allegan and Logan streets. The fourth side is the vacated section of Sycamore Street between Ottawa and Allegan. The current Library of Michigan building was opened in 1989. The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Capitol">State Capitol</a>, previously listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on January 25, 1971, was renovated as part of this revitalization effort. The extensive, three-year renovation of the Capitol was completed in 1992, the same year in which it was designated as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>. The Hall of Justice was opened in October 2002, giving the Michigan Supreme Court a permanent home for the first time since the court had vacated the Capitol in 1970.

Various proposals to honor <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> in Lansing were floated around 1986. The Pastor's Conference of Lansing put forward renaming Logan Street in honor of the civil rights leader, but residents were not supportive of this idea at the time. Another proposal in October 1988 would have renamed Allegan Street because it was shorter and would affect fewer residents. Allegan Street also passes through the city's black community. Residents objected because the city's east–west streets were all named for the counties in the state when the city was platted in 1847. The last failed proposal would have renamed the entire Capitol Loop in King's honor. This idea failed because the route's unique markers had already been designed, made and were about to be installed.

The conference proposed renaming Logan Street again in 1989. This time residents objected over the $32,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to replace the signs. Logan Street was already named for Gen. <a href="John%20A.%20Logan">John A. Logan</a>, who served as a colonel with a Michigan regiment and later as a general in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. A compromise by the mayor was adopted by the city council on April 24, 1989, to allow both names to be used on the street. This dual-naming arrangement was dropped by the city council on March 28, 1994, removing the "Logan Street" name from the street after two years of debate.

Officials from the City of Lansing and MDOT announced a two-year, $22 million project (in 2003, equivalent to $ in ) to reconstruct the Capitol Loop on May 22, 2003. The project would have closed downtown streets in 2004 and 2005 after preparatory work in late 2003. MDOT was seeking to rebuild the streets to improve the downtown area around the State Capitol, adding decorative sidewalks, lighting and planting new trees. The city planned to upgrade the sewer system at the same time as part of a 30-year project to separate the storm and sanitary sewers. MDOT stated that the project would completely close streets along the loop, with the exception of one lane of traffic in each direction along Michigan Avenue. The project was called the "most ambitious since the Interstate 496 construction project in 2001" by the "<a href="Lansing%20State%20Journal">Lansing State Journal</a>".
In the weeks leading up to the November 3, 2003, Lansing City Council meeting, businesses that would be affected by the project raised objections to the scope of the project. One business owner circulated a petition signed by 23 businesses asking the city to delay part of the overall project. The project was nicknamed in the press "Lansing's 'Big Dig'" because the sewer and utility work required excavations in the streets downtown. Some initial opposition was based on a false assumption that the project would close the entire length of the streets at once, instead of in stages. MDOT's original beautification project was delayed five years, and the city's mandated sewer separation project was fast-tracked. This combined project, planned for 2004–05, was planned to prevent digging up the same streets twice within 10–15 years. Most of the business owners expressed concerns that at the end of the project their businesses might not survive to enjoy the benefits of the downtown beautification. The mayor attempted to get the city council to postpone a vote to stop the issuance of bonds for the city's portion of the overall project. City council members criticized MDOT's "[inflexibility] about changing the plans to accommodate businesses." MDOT replied that the contract bids were already out and that it was too late to change the scope of the project.

The city council tabled the project, postponing a final decision on approving it until the businesses' concerns could be addressed. City officials stated a need to redesign the project to accommodate the business community downtown. The project was originally planned in 1999 with votes and hearings by the city council starting in 2001. The city did not kill the project outright which would have risked the city losing the investment in the downtown infrastructure. Instead, the final decision was delayed for two weeks. Had the project been killed outright, MDOT could have reallocated the funding to any project elsewhere in the state. After the decision to delay the project, Mayor Tony Benavides appointed a task force to work with the businesses to address their concerns. Even the local papers pushed all parties concerned to solve the issues and salvage the project. The city announced a revised plan on November 19, 2003, to move parts of the sewer project to a separate timeline so that they would take 16 years to complete. The original 2004–05 project was scaled down to encompass the sewer and water main work with the beautification project on Ottawa, Allegan, Pine and Walnut streets with additional work possible on Capitol Avenue. The revised plan drew praise from members of the business community. The revised project, now budgeted at $12 million (in 2003, equivalent to $ in ) involved work on 14 fewer blocks of the downtown area. The project was approved on December 13, 2004. The bids on the contract work were opened on January 21, 2004, with the bid awarded to E.T. MacKenzie Company of <a href="Grand%20Ledge%2C%20Michigan">Grand Ledge</a>.

Work on the scaled-down Capitol Loop reconstruction project started on April 5, 2004. Area businesses prepared in advance of the project for disruptions. The Michigan Supreme Court distributed color-coded brochures to alert employees of changes as a result of the project. The <a href="Central%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Lansing%2C%20Michigan%29">Central Methodist Church</a> at the corner of Capitol Avenue and Ottawa Street lost access to its parking lot, but the city reserved on-street parking for parishioners. The initial stage of the project closed Ottawa Avenue in stages and converted adjacent one-way streets to two-way traffic to accommodate state employees working next to the construction zone. Several sidewalks were closed on one side of affected streets, while the opposite sidewalks remained open. The revised project earned praise in newspaper editorials after construction started. This praise was tempered with caution to motorists and the officials in charge of the project. The former were advised to remember that the scaled-down project was redesigned to accommodate them; the latter were reminded to get the job done as soon as practical.

Business reported that the project did not affect them as much as they had feared before the project. Minor inconveniences were reported, with some commuters recounting only minor delays in trips downtown. The noise was cited as the worst side effect of the project by several residents in media reports. The work on Allegan Street that was originally planned for 2005 was scheduled by MDOT for the 2004 construction season. The project wrapped up for the year in November. Construction resumed on the remaining sections of the project on March 14, 2005. This phase included the remaining work on Allegan and Walnut streets. By May, the affected streets were reduced to gravel and completed streets had been reopened. Additional work scheduled for 2005 included streetscaping improvements to Cedar and Larch streets.

The project wrapped up three months ahead of the original October completion date. The project cost MDOT $15.4 million (in 2005, equivalent to $ in ) with an additional $5.6 million paid by the City of Lansing for the sewer work (in 2003, equivalent to $ in ). Lansing's share of the costs included the reconstruction costs for Walnut and Pine streets, since those streets are not part of the state trunkline system. The completion of the project was marked with a ribbon-cutting ceremony to open the streets to traffic on June 30, 2005.

A 2006 Michigan law was enacted to reform how cities in the state set <a href="speed%20limit">speed limit</a>s. Under this law, the streets that comprise the Capitol Loop were mismarked according to the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Police">Michigan State Police</a> (MSP). The law was designed to eliminate <a href="speed%20trap">speed trap</a>s in the state by basing the determination of speed limits on scientific criteria. Unless a roadway is in a downtown business district or subdivision, the limit is based on the number of access points, either cross streets or driveways, along the roadway. Exceptions to these classifications can be made based on a technical study by traffic engineers. Lansing city officials stated in March 2009 that by adopting the Uniform Vehicle Code instead of the state's Motor Vehicle Code, Lansing is immune from the change in law and can enforce the limits.

The Lansing city attorney was dismissing speeding tickets issued on the Capitol Loop in June 2010. The loop was not signed with speed-limit signs, making the tickets unenforceable. The city cannot install the signs on its own because of the state trunkline status of the streets that make up the Capitol Loop; the MSP and MDOT are in charge of setting and signing the speed limits on state trunklines in Michigan. City Attorney Brig Smith stated that until the state agencies complete the speed study and erect the signs, he cannot enforce any tickets for speeding on the Capitol Loop. MSP and MDOT officials stated that the study is complete and the new signs are on order. The limits were raised from on the eastern half of the loop and on the western half as a result of the MDOT and MSP speed studies. State Representative Rick Jones from Grand Ledge has been pushing for scientifically set speed limits in the state to limit speed traps, and he has proposed new legislation to force cities to comply with the 2006 law, ending any loopholes used by cities to set lower limits. As Jones explained to reporters, the current situation is one where "... streets are artificially posted too low for the purpose of writing tickets."

Banksia coccinea

Banksia coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet banksia, waratah banksia or Albany banksia, is an erect shrub or small tree in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. The <a href="Noongar">Noongar</a> peoples know the tree as Waddib. Its distribution in the wild is along the <a href="Southwest%20Australia">south west</a> coast of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, from <a href="Denmark%2C%20Western%20Australia">Denmark</a> to the <a href="Stokes%20National%20Park">Stokes National Park</a>, and north to the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a>, growing on white or grey sand in <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>, heath or open woodland. Reaching up to in height, it is a single-stemmed plant that has oblong leaves, which are long and wide. The prominent red and white flower <a href="spike%20%28botany%29">spikes</a> appear mainly in the spring. As they age they develop small <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> that store seeds until opened by fire. Though widely occurring, it is highly sensitive to <a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">dieback</a> and large populations of plants have succumbed to the disease.

Collected and described by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in the early 19th century, "Banksia coccinea" appears to be most closely related to "<a href="Banksia%20speciosa">Banksia speciosa</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20baxteri">B. baxteri</a>". "Banksia coccinea" plants are killed by <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s, and a variety of insects. Widely considered one of the most attractive "Banksia" species, "B. coccinea" is a popular garden plant and one of the most important "Banksia" species for the <a href="cut%20flower">cut flower</a> industry; it is grown commercially in several countries including Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Israel. In cultivation, "B. coccinea" grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil, but it cannot survive in areas with humid or wet summers.

The scarlet banksia grows as an erect <a href="shrub">shrub</a> or small <a href="tree">tree</a>, generally around tall, with little lateral spread. However, it can reach in height, particularly in the vicinity of Albany. The trunk is generally single at the base before branching, and covered with smooth grey bark that is thick and lacking in <a href="lenticel">lenticel</a>s. Peaking in the summer months, the pinkish-brown new growth is densely hairy. The oblong, cordate or obcordate leaves are long and wide, with long <a href="petiole%20%28botany%29">petiole</a>s. <a href="wikt%3ATruncate">Truncate</a> at the apex, they have <a href="wikt%3Adentate">dentate</a> margins with small (1–3 mm long) teeth apart, separated by shallow u- or v-shaped sinuses. The upper surface is covered in fine fur when young and becomes smooth with age, while the undersurface is covered with white fur, particularly along the midrib.

The process of flowering takes 9–12 months; the stems begin developing microscopically in spring, with no visible evidence of flower spike development for around five months before the buds actually appear. Flower spikes are in bloom from May to December or January, peaking between July and October. The distinctive <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s arise from the ends of one-year-old branchlets. Squat and roughly cylindrical, they are high and wide. A field study on the southern <a href="sandplain">sandplain</a>s revealed an average count of around 286 individual flowers on each spike. The white flower is covered in grey or pale brown fur, and there is little variation in colour. The <a href="Gynoecium%23pistils">style</a> is generally scarlet, but can be dark red, orange or pink. The <a href="perianth">perianth</a> is long, while the style is long and strongly <a href="wikt%3Arecurved">recurved</a> or looped until they are released at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>. Anthesis is acropetal, that is, the flowers open from the base up the spike to the apex. 
The flowers of all banksias arise in a spiral pattern around the flower spike axis; however in "Banksia coccinea" they develop into distinctive vertical columns, which are strongly accentuated by large gaps in between. Paired in columns, the red styles contrast with the grey-white perianth making a striking flower spike.

The <a href="infructescence">infructescence</a> is small, with up to 20 small <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> concentrated at the lower end of the spike. Each follicle is long, high, and 2–3 mm (c. 0.1 in) wide and usually opens with fire. The long seed is composed of the cuneate (wedge-shaped) seed body proper, measuring long and wide, and a papery <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">wing</a>. One side, termed the outer surface, is grey-black and wrinkled and the other—the inner surface—protrudes and is black and glistening. The seeds are separated by a dark brown <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. It measures long and wide. The dull green <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s of seedlings are long and wide, described by <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> as "cuneate to <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a>". Each cotyledon has a <a href="auricle%20%28botany%29">auricle</a> at its base. The thick, smooth <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a> is high and 1.5 mm thick. The seedling leaves are crowded above the cotyledons and linear to spathulate in shape, with recurved and deeply serrated margins with v-shaped sinuses, almost dividing the leaves into triangular lobes. The first pair are long, with the next 2–4 leaves up to long. Successive leaves are more obovate in shape and up to long and wide. The seedling stems are covered in white hair.

The first known specimens of "Banksia coccinea" were collected in December 1801, during the visit to <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> of <a href="HMS%20Investigator%20%281798%29">HMS "Investigator"</a> under the command of <a href="Matthew%20Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a>. On board were <a href="botanist">botanist</a> <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a>, <a href="botanical%20artist">botanical artist</a> <a href="Ferdinand%20Bauer">Ferdinand Bauer</a>, and gardener <a href="Peter%20Good">Peter Good</a>. All three men gathered plant specimens, but those collected by Bauer and Good were incorporated into Brown's herbarium without attribution, so it is not possible to identify the actual collector of this species. The surviving specimen of "B. coccinea", held by the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in London, is annotated in Brown's hand "King George IIIds Sound Princess Royal Harbour especially near the observatory". The observatory was apparently located in what is now the <a href="central%20business%20district">central business district</a> of <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a>. No further information on the collection is available, as the species is mentioned in neither Brown's nor Good's diary.

Good also made a separate seed collection, which included "B. coccinea", and the species was drawn by Bauer. Like nearly all of Bauer's field drawings of Proteaceae, the original field sketch of "B. coccinea" was destroyed in a <a href="Hofburg%20fire">Hofburg fire</a> in 1945. However a <a href="watercolour">watercolour</a> painting by Bauer, based on his field sketches, still survives at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, and a hand-coloured <a href="copper%20engraving">copper engraving</a> from that painting was published as Plate 3 of Bauer's 1813 "<a href="Illustrationes%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae">Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae</a>". German botanist <a href="Adalbert%20Schnizlein">Adalbert Schnizlein</a> described "B. purpurea" in 1843, now regarded as a <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of "B. coccinea". Common names include scarlet banksia, waratah banksia and Albany banksia.

Brown published the species in his 1810 "On the Proteaceae of Jussieu", its species name derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "coccineus", meaning "scarlet", and referring to the pistils. He recorded 31 species of "Banksia" in his 1810 work "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>", and, in his <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">taxonomic arrangement</a>, placed the taxon in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Banksia%20verae">Banksia verae</a>", the "true banksias", because the inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike. By the time <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> published <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 arrangement</a> of the genus, there were 58 described "Banksia" species. Meissner divided Brown's "Banksia verae", which had been renamed "Eubanksia" by <a href="Stephan%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847, into four <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> based on leaf properties. He placed "B. coccinea" in the series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Quercinae">"Quercinae"</a>.

<a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published a thorough revision of "Banksia" in his landmark publication "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>" in 1870. In <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Bentham's arrangement</a>, the number of recognised "Banksia" species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a> based on leaf, <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a> and pollen-presenter characters. "Banksia coccinea" was placed in section "Orthostylis".

In 1891, German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged the generic name "Banksia" <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">L.f.</a>, on the grounds that the name "Banksia" had previously been published in 1775 as "Banksia" <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">J.R.Forst</a> & <a href="Georg%20Forster">G.Forst</a>, referring to the genus now known as "<a href="Pimelea">Pimelea</a>". Kuntze proposed "Sirmuellera" as an alternative, republishing "B. coccinea" as "Sirmuellera coccinea". The challenge failed, and "Banksia" L.f. was formally <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a>.

<a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> published a new <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">taxonomic arrangement</a> of "Banksia" in his classic 1981 monograph <a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">"The genus "Banksia" L.f. (Proteaceae)"</a>. Endlicher's "Eubanksia" became <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subgenus "Banksia"</a>, and was divided into three sections. George placed "Banksia coccinea" in its own series—"Banksia" series "Coccineae"—within the section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." section "Banksia"</a> on account of a unique combination of characters, namely the vertical arrangement of flowers on the spike, combined with the branched open habit, broad leaves and very small follicles. Members of the series "Quercinae" and five species within the series "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Spicigerae">Spicigerae</a>" share the vertically aligned flowers, but do not wholly exhibit the other characters.

<a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published a new arrangement for the genus in 1996; their <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> <a href="Cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis yielded a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> significantly different from George's arrangement. They were uncertain of "B. coccinea"'s placement as it had highly <a href="autapomorphy">autapomorphic</a> characteristics which made analysis of its relationships difficult. Hence, in <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">their arrangement</a> it was located within series "Banksia" but not allocated to a subseries ("<a href="incertae%20sedis">incertae sedis</a>"). It was reclassified in its own section "Coccinea" in 1996 by Tina Maguire and colleagues; pollen compatibility tests indicated its pollen was most compatible with "Banksia ericifolia", "B. micrantha" and "B. sphaerocarpa", all of section "Oncostylis". However, they did not place it in that section as all members of "Oncostylis" have hooked styles at anthesis. This was upheld by George in his monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series. "B. coccinea"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement within "Banksia" according to "Flora of Australia" is as follows:

In 2002, a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> study by <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> again showed "Banksia coccinea" to be the next closest relative of a group comprising "Banksia speciosa" and "B. baxteri" and only distantly related to other members of the series "Banksia". This was reinforced in a 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results.

Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for "Banksia" in 2005. They inferred a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding "Banksia" to be <a href="paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> with respect to "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subgenus "Spathulatae"</a> for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> "B." subg. "Banksia". They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA <a href="sampling%20%28statistics%29">sampling</a> of "Dryandra" was complete. In the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. coccinea" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

No subspecies are recognised, although DNA analysis showed that a population at Redmond was genetically distinctive, while those at <a href="Gull%20Rock%20National%20Park">Gull Rock</a>, <a href="Two%20Peoples%20Bay%20Nature%20Reserve">Two Peoples Bay</a> and Cheyne Beach were unusually diverse.

"B. coccinea" occurs close to the south coast of Western Australia, from the Hay River northeast of <a href="Denmark%2C%20Western%20Australia">Denmark</a> <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a> in the west, east to <a href="Stokes%20National%20Park">Stokes National Park</a> southeast of <a href="Munglinup">Munglinup</a> and inland to the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a> and the northern border of <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Fitzgerald River National Park</a>. Around 47% of plants are protected in conservation areas, while 13% are located on road verges. It prefers deep white or grey sand, among tall shrubland, heath, mallee-heath, associated with such species as "<a href="Banksia%20baxteri">Banksia baxteri</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20speciosa">B. speciosa</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20attenuata">B. attenuata</a>" and "<a href="Lambertia%20inermis">Lambertia inermis</a>", or low open woodland in the Stirling Range and near Albany, where it is found with "<a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">Eucalyptus marginata</a>", "Banksia attenuata" and "<a href="Banksia%20ilicifolia">B. ilicifolia</a>". Most of its range has a gently undulating topography, but it also occurs on a steep rocky slope at <a href="Ellen%20Peak">Ellen Peak</a> in the Stirling Ranges. The annual rainfall is .

A field study conducted around <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a> found the <a href="honey%20possum">honey possum</a> ("Tarsipes rostratus") sometimes visit "Banksia coccinea", as do the <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae"), <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a> ("P. nigra"), and <a href="western%20spinebill">western spinebill</a> ("Acanthorhynchus superciliosus"). "Banksia coccinea" flowers are visited by <a href="colletidae">colletid</a> bees "<a href="Hylaeus%20alcyoneus">Hylaeus alcyoneus</a>" and "<a href="Hylaeus%20sanguinipictus">H. sanguinipictus</a>". The <a href="short-billed%20black%20cockatoo">short-billed black cockatoo</a> breaks off old cones with follicles to eat the seed, often doing so before the seed is ripe.

"B. coccinea" is killed by fire and regenerates afterwards from seed released from burnt follicles. It has is some degree of <a href="serotiny">serotiny</a>, that is, it has an <a href="Canopy%20seed%20bank">aerial seed bank</a> in its <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> in the form of the follicles of the old flower spikes. However, numbers of seed are less than other co-occurring species of banksia on the southern plains and peak several years after a fire. Unusually for banksias, "B. coccinea" can release seed with resulting seedlings growing in the absence of a bushfire trigger. Plants flower and fruit three years after germination and are shorter-lived than other banksias, appearing in poor health or dying before 20 years of age. They hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years.

Manipulating growing conditions on plants in cultivation showed that longer daylight (16 hours vs 8 hours) led to development of more flower spikes, indicating that flower initiation was related to day length.

Extremely sensitive to dieback caused by "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", "Banksia coccinea" is an <a href="indicator%20species">indicator species</a> for the presence of the disease. There is no known means of eradicating dieback. Much of the Stirling Range National Park is infested, though Fitzgerald River National Park has been largely spared. Applying <a href="phosphite">phosphite</a> to infested areas has been shown to reduce the mortality rates to around 50%. "B. coccinea" has shown some symptoms of toxicity to application of phosphite, with some patchy necrosis of leaves, but the plant's uptake of the compound is somewhat lower compared with uptake by other shrub species. Unusually, the symptoms do not appear to be proportional to exposure levels.

Dying stands of "B. coccinea" were observed in 1989, and the fungus "<a href="Cryptodiaporthe%20melanocraspedia">Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia</a>" isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial <a href="canker">canker</a>, manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would die from the top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the outer bark, orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of "<a href="Zythiostroma">Zythiostroma</a>", however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant. This immune response, coupled with the fact that it had not been observed in the wild, led them to believe it was not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as "<a href="Luteocirrhus%20shearii">Luteocirrhus shearii</a>".

"B. coccinea" is a host for the gall midge "<a href="Dasineura%20banksiae">Dasineura banksiae</a>", a species of <a href="diptera">fly</a> that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7 mm in diameter and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.

Widely considered one of the most attractive "Banksia" species, "B. coccinea" is a popular garden plant and one of the most important "Banksia" species for the cut flower industry; it is grown commercially in Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, New Zealand, Israel, and trialled in France, Spain and South America. Its striking terminal inflorescences and furry new growth are its main horticultural attributes. However, it is highly sensitive to dieback and succumbs readily when exposed. It is difficult to keep alive in areas of heavy soils or summer rainfall or humidity, such as the Australian east coast. Furthermore, flowering may be sparse or not occur when cultivated in warmer climates such as Perth. Pruning promotes branching, which leads to more flower spikes being produced.

Propagation is by seed, though these can be difficult to extract from the follicles. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings are slow to strike. Attempts to graft "B. coccinea" have met with little success.

In a breeding program conducted by <a href="Margaret%20Sedgley">Margaret Sedgley</a> of the Department of Horticulture, Viticulture and Oenology, <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide%23Waite">Waite Agricultural Research Institute</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, two forms of "Banksia coccinea" were bred, registered under <a href="plant%20breeders%27%20rights">plant breeders' rights</a> (PBR), and commercially propagated, mainly for the cut flower industry. "Banksia" <a href="Banksia%20%27Waite%20Flame%27">'Waite Flame'</a> is an early flowering somewhat orange-hued form, and "B." <a href="Banksia%20%27Waite%20Crimson%27">'Waite Crimson'</a> is a red-flowering form that peaks mid-season.

Battle of Auberoche

The Battle of Auberoche was fought on 21 October 1345 during the <a href="Gascon%20campaign%20of%201345">Gascon campaign of 1345</a> between an <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Anglo</a>-<a href="Gascony">Gascon</a> force of 1,200 men under <a href="Henry%20of%20Grosmont%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Henry, Earl of Derby</a>, and a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">French</a> army of 7,000 commanded by <a href="Louis%20I%20de%20Poitiers%2C%20Count%20of%20Valentinois">Louis of Poitiers</a>. It was fought at the village of <a href="Auberoche">Auberoche</a> near <a href="P%C3%A9rigueux">Périgueux</a> in northern <a href="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a>. At the time, Gascony was a territory of the English Crown and the Anglo-Gascon army included a large proportion of native Gascons. The battle resulted in a heavy defeat for the French, who suffered very high casualties, with their leaders killed or captured.

The battle took place during the early stages of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. Along with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bergerac">Battle of Bergerac</a> earlier in the year, it marked a change in the military balance of power in the region as the French position subsequently collapsed. It was one of a series of victories which would lead to Henry of Derby being called "one of the best warriors in the world" by a contemporary chronicler.

Since the <a href="Norman%20Conquest">Norman Conquest</a> of 1066, English monarchs had held <a href="Style%20of%20the%20British%20sovereign">titles and lands</a> within France, the possession of which made them <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s of the kings of France. Over the centuries, English holdings in France had varied in size, but by 1337 only <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a> in south western France and <a href="Ponthieu">Ponthieu</a> in northern France were left. The independent-minded Gascons had their own customs and claimed to have a separate language. A large proportion of the enormous quantity of red wine that they produced was shipped to England in a profitable trade. The Gascons preferred their relationship with a distant English king who left them alone to one with a French king who would interfere in their affairs.

During the first half of the 14th century, well over 1,000 ships departed Gascony for England each year. Among their cargo were more than of wine. The duty levied by the English Crown on wine from <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, the capital of Gascony, was more than all other customs duties combined and by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux had a population of over 50,000, greater than London's, and Bordeaux was possibly richer. However, by this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, largely from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this.

The status of the English king's French <a href="fief">fief</a>s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose. Towards the end of 1336, following a series of disagreements between <a href="Philip%20VI%20of%20France">Philip VI of France</a> () and <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III of England</a> (), Philip decided that war was the only way to drive the English out for good. On 24 May 1337, Philip's Great Council in Paris agreed that the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine">Duchy of Aquitaine</a>, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>, which was to last one hundred and sixteen years.

Although Gascony was the cause of the war, Edward was able to spare few resources for its defence, and previously when an English army had campaigned on the continent it had operated in northern France. In most campaigning seasons the Gascons had to rely on their own resources and had been hard pressed by the French. In 1339 the French besieged Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, even breaking into the city with a large force before they were repulsed. Typically the Gascons could field 3,000–6,000 men, the large majority infantry, although up to two-thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons.

There was no formal border between English and French territory. Significant landholders owned a patchwork of widely separated estates, perhaps owing <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to a different overlord for each, or holding some rights from the French Crown as the monarch and others from the English Crown as their liege lord. Each small estate was likely to have a <a href="fortified%20tower">fortified tower</a> or <a href="keep">keep</a>, with larger estates having castles. <a href="Fortifications">Fortifications</a> were also constructed at transport <a href="choke%20point">choke point</a>s, to collect tolls and to restrict military passage, and fortified towns grew up alongside all bridges and most fords over the many rivers in the region.

Military forces could support themselves by foraging so long as they moved on at relatively frequent intervals. If they wished to remain in one place for any length of time, as was necessary to besiege a castle, then access to water transport was essential for supplies of food and fodder, and desirable for such items as siege equipment. Warfare was usually a struggle for possession of castles and other fortified points, and for the mutable loyalty of the local nobility; the region had been in a state of flux for centuries and many local lords served whichever monarch was considered the stronger, regardless of national ties.

By 1345, after eight years of war, English-controlled territory mostly consisted of a coastal strip from Bordeaux to <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>, with isolated strongholds further inland. The French had strong fortifications throughout what had once been English-controlled Gascony. Several directly threatened Bordeaux: <a href="Libourne">Libourne</a>, to the east, allowed French armies to assemble a day's march from Bordeaux; the strongly fortified town of <a href="Blaye">Blaye</a> was situated on the north bank of the <a href="Gironde">Gironde</a> only downstream of Bordeaux and in a position to interdict its vital seaborne communications; the fortress of <a href="Langon%2C%20Gironde">Langon</a>, south of Bordeaux, blocked upstream communication along the <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a>, and facilitated the supply of any French force advancing on Bordeaux.

Edward determined early in 1345 to attack France on three fronts. The <a href="William%20de%20Bohun%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northampton">Earl of Northampton</a> would lead a small force to <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, a slightly larger force would proceed to Gascony under the command of <a href="Henry%20of%20Grosmont%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Henry, Earl of Derby</a> and the main force would accompany Edward to France or Flanders. The previous <a href="Seneschal%20of%20Gascony">Seneschal of Gascony</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20de%20la%20Beche">Nicholas de la Beche</a>, was replaced by the more senior <a href="Ralph%20de%20Stafford%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Stafford">Ralph, Earl of Stafford</a>, who sailed for Gascony in February with an advance force. Derby was appointed the King's Lieutenant in Gascony on 13 March 1345 and received a contract to raise a force of 2,000 men in England, and further troops in Gascony itself. The highly detailed contract of <a href="indenture">indenture</a> had a term of six months from the opening of the campaign in Gascony, with an option for Edward III to extend it for a further six months on the same terms. Derby was given a high degree of autonomy; for example, his strategic instructions were: "si guerre soit, et a faire le bien q'il poet" (... if there is war, do the best you can...).

In early 1345 the French decided to stand on the defensive in the south west. Their intelligence correctly predicted English offensives in the three theatres, but they did not have the money to raise a significant army in each. They anticipated, correctly, that the English planned to make their main effort in northern France. Thus they directed what resources they had there, planning to assemble their main army at Arras on 22 July. South western France was encouraged to rely on its own resources, but as the <a href="Truce%20of%20Malestroit">Truce of Malestroit</a>, signed in early 1343, was still in effect, the local lords were reluctant to spend money, and little was done.

Derby's force embarked at Southampton at the end of May. Due to bad weather, his fleet of 151 ships was forced to shelter in Falmouth for several weeks en route, finally departing on 23 July. The Gascons, primed by Stafford to expect Derby's arrival in late May and sensing the French weakness, took the field without him. The Gascons captured the large, weakly garrisoned castles of <a href="Lamothe-Montravel">Montravel</a> and Monbreton on the <a href="Dordogne%20%28river%29">Dordogne</a> in early June; both were taken by surprise and their seizure broke the tenuous Truce of Malestroit. Stafford made a short advance north to besiege Blaye with his advance party and perhaps 1,000 <a href="men-at-arms">men-at-arms</a> and 3,000 infantry of the Gascon lords. Having established the siege he left the Gascons to prosecute it and proceeded to Langon, south of Bordeaux, and set up a second siege. The Anglo-Gascon forces at both sieges could be readily supplied by ship. The French issued an urgent call to arms.

Meanwhile, small independent parties of Gascons raided across the region. Local French groups joined them, and several minor nobles threw in their lot with the Anglo-Gascons. They had several significant successes, but their main effect was to tie down most of the weak French garrisons in the region and to cause them to call for reinforcements. The few mobile French troops in the region immobilised themselves with sieges: of <a href="Casseneuil">Casseneuil</a> in the Agenais; Monchamp near Condom; and Montcuq, a strong but strategically insignificant castle south of <a href="Bergerac%2C%20Dordogne">Bergerac</a>. Large areas were effectively undefended.

Edward III's main army sailed on 29 June. They anchored off Sluys (<a href="Sluis">Sluis</a>) in <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a> until 22 July, while Edward attended to diplomatic affairs. When they sailed, probably intending to land in Normandy, they were scattered by a storm and found their way to various English ports over the following week. After more than five weeks on board ship, the men and horses had to be disembarked. There was a further week's delay while the King and <a href="Curia%20regis">his council</a> debated what to do, by which time it proved impossible to take any action with the main English army before winter. Aware of this, Philip VI despatched reinforcements to Brittany and Gascony. <a href="Peter%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bourbon">Peter, Duke of Bourbon</a> was appointed French commander in Gascony on 8 August and based himself at <a href="Agen">Agen</a>.

On 9 August 1345, Derby arrived in Bordeaux with 500 men-at-arms, 500 mounted archers and 1,000 English and Welsh foot archers. After two weeks recruiting and organising, Derby marched his force to Langon, rendezvoused with Stafford and took command of the combined force. Stafford had to this point pursued a cautious strategy of small-scale sieges. Derby's intention was quite different; rather than continue a cautious war of sieges he was determined to strike directly at the French main force before it was fully assembled.

The French, hearing of Derby's arrival, concentrated their forces at the strategically important town of Bergerac, where there was an important bridge over the Dordogne River. After a council of war, Derby decided to strike at the French there. The capture of the town, which had good river supply links to Bordeaux, would provide the Anglo-Gascon army with a base from which to carry the war to the French. It would also force the lifting of the siege of the nearby allied castle of <a href="Montcuq">Montcuq</a> and sever communications between French forces north and south of the Dordogne. The English believed that if the French field army could be beaten or distracted the town could be easily taken.

Derby moved rapidly and took the French army by surprise, defeating them in a running battle. French casualties were heavy, with many killed and a large number captured, including their commander. The surviving French from their field army rallied around <a href="John%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Armagnac">John, Count of Armagnac</a>, and retreated north to <a href="P%C3%A9rigueux">Périgueux</a>. Within days of the battle, Bergerac fell to an Anglo-Gascon assault and was subsequently <a href="looting">sacked</a>. After consolidating and reorganising for two weeks Derby left a large garrison in the town and moved north to the Anglo-Gascon stronghold of Mussidan in the <a href="Isle%20%28river%29">Isle</a> valley with 6,000–8,000 men. He then pushed west to Périgueux, the provincial capital, taking several strongpoints on the way.

The city's defences were antiquated and derelict, but the size of the French force defending it prohibited an assault. Derby <a href="blockade">blockade</a>d Périgueux and captured strongholds blocking the main routes into the city. <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John, Duke of Normandy</a>, the son and heir of Philip VI, gathered an army reportedly numbering over 20,000 and manoeuvred in the area. In early October a very large detachment relieved the city and drove off Derby's force, which withdrew towards Bordeaux. Further reinforced, the French started besieging the English-held strongpoints.

The main French force of 7,000, commanded by Louis of Poitiers, besieged the castle of Auberoche, east of Périgueux. Auberoche perches on a rocky promontory completely commanding the River <a href="Auv%C3%A9z%C3%A8re">Auvézère</a> and the valley road at a point where the valley narrows almost to a gorge. The small Anglo-Gascon garrison was commanded by <a href="Frank%20van%20Hallen">Frank van Hallen</a>. The French encampment was divided in two, with the majority of the soldiers camped close to the river between the castle and village, while a smaller force was situated to prevent any relief attempts from the north.

The chronicler <a href="Froissart">Froissart</a> tells a tale, most likely apocryphal, that a soldier attempting to reach English lines with a letter requesting help was captured and returned to the castle via a <a href="trebuchet">trebuchet</a>. A messenger did get through French lines and reached Derby, who was already returning to the area with a scratch force of 1,200 English and Gascon soldiers: 400 men-at-arms and 800 mounted archers.

Knowing he was outnumbered, Derby waited near Périgueux for several days for the arrival of a force under the <a href="Lawrence%20Hastings%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Earl of Pembroke</a>. Unknown to Derby, another French army of some 9,000 to 10,000 men under the Duke of Normandy was only away. On the evening of 20 October Derby decided that waiting any longer would invite an attack from the larger French army and made a night march, crossing the shallow river twice, so that by morning he was situated on a low wooded hill about a mile (1.6 km) from the main French camp in the valley by the river. Derby personally reconnoitred the French position. Still hoping for the last-minute arrival of Pembroke, Derby called a council of his officers. It was decided that rather than wait and possibly lose the advantage of surprise, the army would attack immediately and attempt to overrun the French camp before an effective defence could be devised.

Derby planned a three-pronged assault. The attack was launched as the French were having their evening meal, and complete surprise was achieved. His <a href="English%20longbow">longbowmen</a> shot from the treeline to the west into the French position. The French, packed tightly into the narrow meadow, not expecting an attack and unarmoured, are reported to have taken heavy casualties from this. <a href="Adam%20Murimuth">Adam Murimuth</a>, a contemporary chronicler, estimates French casualties at this stage at around 1,000.

While the French were confused and distracted by this attack from the west, Derby made a cavalry charge with his 400 men-at-arms from the south. They had some across flat ground to cover to reach the French. French soldiers struggled into their armour and their commanders rallied their still superior forces. A small number of Anglo-Gascon infantry had followed a path in the woods to emerge in the French rear and attacked from the north-west. The fighting continued in the area of the camp for some time.

Hallen realised that the French troops guarding his exit from the castle were either distracted or had been drawn off to join the fighting; he sallied with all the mounted men he could muster and took the French in the rear. At this further unexpected attack the French defence collapsed and they routed, pursued by the English cavalry. Those French still holding their position in the small camp to the north fled without fighting.

French casualties are uncertain, but were heavy. Murimuth states that French fatalities caused by the archers alone were 700 men-at-arms and over 1,000 infantry. Total casualties are variously described by modern historians as "appalling", "extremely high", "staggering", and "heavy". Many French nobles were taken prisoner; lesser men were, as was customary, put to the sword. The French commander, <a href="Louis%20I%20de%20Poitiers%2C%20Count%20of%20Valentinois">Louis of Poitiers</a>, died of his wounds. Surviving prisoners included the second-in-command, <a href="Bertrand%20I%20of%20L%27Isle-Jourdain">Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain</a>, two counts, seven viscounts, three barons, the <a href="seneschals">seneschals</a> of Clermont and Toulouse, a nephew of the <a href="Clement%20VI">Pope</a> and so many knights that they were not counted.

The French left behind them a large quantity of loot and supplies. This was in addition to the ransoms extracted from the French captives for their release, which was due to the individuals who had captured them, shared with their <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">liege</a> lords. The ransoms alone made a fortune for many of the soldiers in Derby's army, as well as Derby himself, who was said to have made at least £50,000 (£ as of 2019) from the day's captives, approximately equal to Edward III's annual income. Over the following year Philip VI paid large amounts from the royal treasury as contributions towards the captives' ransoms.

The Duke of Normandy lost heart on hearing of the defeat. Despite outnumbering the Anglo-Gascon force eight to one he retreated to <a href="Angoul%C3%AAme">Angoulême</a> and disbanded his army. The French also abandoned all of their ongoing sieges of other Anglo-Gascon garrisons. Derby was left almost completely unopposed for six months, during which he seized more towns, including <a href="Monts%C3%A9gur">Montségur</a>, <a href="La%20R%C3%A9ole">La Réole</a> and <a href="Aiguillon%2C%20Lot-et-Garonne">Aiguillon</a> and greatly increased English territory and influence in south-west France.

Local morale, and more importantly prestige in the border region, had decidedly swung England's way following <a href="Gascon%20campaign%20of%201345">this conflict</a>, providing an influx of taxes and recruits for the English armies. Local lords of note declared for the English, bringing significant retinues with them. The four-month campaign has been described as "the first successful land campaign of... the Hundred Years' War", which had commenced more than eight years earlier. With this success, the English had established a regional dominance which would last over thirty years.

Modern historians have praised the generalship demonstrated by Derby in this campaign: "superb and innovative tactician"; "ris[ing] to the level of genius"; "brilliant in the extreme"; "stunning"; "brilliant". A chronicler writing fifty years after the event described him as "one of the best warriors in the world" in "Chroniques de quatres premier Valois". Derby went on to lead another <a href="Lancaster%27s%20chevauch%C3%A9e%20of%201346">successful campaign</a> in 1346.

Typhoon Rusa

Typhoon Rusa was the most powerful <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a> to strike <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> in 43 years. It was the 21st JTWC tropical depression, the 15th named storm, and the 10th typhoon of the <a href="2002%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season">2002 Pacific typhoon season</a>. It developed on August 22 from the <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, well to the southeast of Japan. For several days, Rusa moved to the northwest, eventually intensifying into a powerful typhoon. On August 26, the storm moved across the <a href="Amami%20Islands">Amami Islands</a> of Japan, where Rusa left 20,000 people without power and caused two fatalities. Across Japan, the typhoon dropped torrential rainfall peaking at in <a href="Tokushima%20Prefecture">Tokushima Prefecture</a>.

After weakening slightly, Rusa made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on <a href="Goheung">Goheung</a>, South Korea with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph ). It was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm air and instability from a nearby <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a>. Rusa weakened while moving through the country, dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at in <a href="Gangneung">Gangneung</a>. A 24-hour total of in the city broke the record for the highest daily precipitation in the country; however, the heaviest rainfall was localized. Over 17,000 houses were damaged, and large areas of crop fields were flooded. In South Korea, Rusa killed at least 233 people, making it the deadliest typhoon there in over 43 years, and caused $4.2 billion in damage. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall in neighboring North Korea, leaving 26,000 people homeless and killing three. Rusa also destroyed large areas of crops in the country already affected by ongoing famine conditions. The typhoon later became <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> over eastern Russia on September 1, dissipating three days later.

The <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> spawned a tropical depression on August 22 north of <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> and southwest of <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>. It moved to the west-northwest, a movement it would maintain for much of its duration. Early on August 23, it intensified into Tropical Storm Rusa, about east of <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. At 1800 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on August 25, the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) upgraded Rusa to a typhoon while the system was northeast of the <a href="Northern%20Marianas%20Islands">Northern Marianas Islands</a>. The next day, the agency estimated that the typhoon attained peak <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">winds</a> of 150 km/h (90 mph ). Around the same time, the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) estimated peak winds of 215 km/h (135 mph ).

While at peak intensity, Rusa struck the Japanese island of <a href="Amami%20%C5%8Cshima">Amami Ōshima</a>. After maintaining the peak winds for about 12 hours, Rusa weakened slightly as it continued to the west-northwest, but on August 28 the JMA again reported the typhoon attained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph ). Despite forecasts that it would weaken, Rusa maintained its intensity while passing south of Japan, due to minimal <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> and warm <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s of up to . The typhoon again weakened slightly on August 29 while passing between the <a href="Amami%20Islands">Amami Islands</a> and Japan. Thereafter, Rusa turned to the north toward the <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a>. Warm, moist air blew across the peninsula ahead of the storm, which prevented significant weakening, and an approaching <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a> contributed to <a href="atmospheric%20instability">atmospheric instability</a>. At around 0800 UTC on August 31, Rusa made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on <a href="Goheung">Goheung</a>, <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>, with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph ). According to the JTWC, Rusa was the most powerful typhoon to hit the country since 1959. The typhoon rapidly weakened while crossing the country, deteriorating into a tropical depression early on September 1. Around that time, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the system. The depression turned to the northeast, and after moving through the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a>, Rusa became <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> over <a href="Primorsky%20Krai">Primorsky Krai</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Far%20East">Russian Far East</a> late on September 1. The extratropical remnants continued northeast and dissipated on September 4 over the <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a>.

Although damage was heaviest in South Korea, Typhoon Rusa first affected Japan. The threat from the storm prompted the <a href="Okinawa%20Prefecture">Okinawa</a> government to cancel a disaster drill for the island. On the island, high seas from Rusa left two <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States marines</a> missing; a later news report included the two missing as storm-related fatalities. In the Anami Islands, Rusa destroyed six houses, forcing 38 people to evacuate. The storm left 20,000 people without power and cancelled several flights. Winds reached in <a href="Nomozaki%2C%20Nagasaki">Nomozaki, Nagasaki</a>. Rains fell for seven days in the country, peaking at in <a href="Tokushima%20Prefecture">Tokushima Prefecture</a>. The heaviest of the precipitation fell in <a href="Nara%20Prefecture">Nara Prefecture</a>, where a station reported in one hour. At least 275 houses were flooded, and 137 houses were damaged. During its passage, Rusa injured 12 people, 4 seriously. The typhoon also produced light rain and high seas along the coast of Taiwan.

Before Rusa affected South Korea, the <a href="Korea%20Meteorological%20Administration">Korea Meteorological Administration</a> (KMA) issued high sea warnings on August 29. Airports were closed in the southern portion of the country, and dams let out water to prevent excessive flooding. Typhoon Rusa affected much of South Korea with heavy rainfall and high winds. <a href="Jeju%20Province">Jeju Island</a> off the country's southern coast reported of rainfall, producing flash flooding that flooded cars. On the island, high winds downed trees and left 60,000 people without power. All lower and middle schools on the island were closed, and residents were stranded after officials halted ferry and airline service. On the South Korean mainland, winds reached as high as . High amounts of rainfall were reported on <a href="Jeju%20Province">Jeju Province</a> and along the country's southern coast, although the heaviest rainfall was only reported in a small region. In <a href="Gangneung">Gangneung</a>, located in the eastern portion of the country, severe thunderstorms developed due to high instability resulting from humid air from the east interacting with the <a href="Taebaek%20Mountains">Taebaek Mountains</a>, producing high amounts of precipitation. The city reported the highest rainfall total in the country with , of which was observed in one day. The total represented 62% of Gangneung's average yearly rainfall, and became the highest daily rainfall in the country's history, exceeding the previous record set in 1981 by . In the South Korea interior, rainfall rates were considered a <a href="return%20period">1 in 200 year event</a>.
Damage in South Korea was estimated at $4.2 billion (₩5.15 trillion <a href="South%20Korean%20won">KRW</a>). Damage was heaviest in Gangneung, where about 36,000 homes and 622 military buildings were flooded. At the airbase in Gangneung, floods submerged 16 jet fighters. Along the coast, high winds damaged 640 boats and about 200,000 marine buildings, and 265 industrial buildings were also damaged. The heavy rainfall left mudslides in the country, one of which covered ten cars in Gangneung. Flooding and the landslides disrupted the country's infrastructure; the storm destroyed 274 bridges and damaged roads and rails at 164 locations. Rusa killed 300,000 livestock and flooded 85,000 hectares (210,000 acres) of crop fields, representing 6% of the country's agricultural lands, mostly affecting fruit and vegetables. The storm caused the <a href="Vana%20H%20Cup%20KBC%20Augusta">Vana H Cup KBC Augusta</a> golf tournament to end early, and a stadium to be used for the <a href="2002%20Asian%20Games">2002 Asian Games</a> was damaged. Across the country, 88,625 people were forced to evacuate due to the typhoon, and 17,046 houses were damaged. High winds left 1.25 million people after blowing down 24,000 power lines. There were 213 deaths in the country, and another 33 were missing and presumed dead; This made Rusa the deadliest typhoon in the country in more than 43 years.

In neighboring North Korea, Rusa produced winds of and heavy rainfall reaching in mountainous areas of <a href="Kangwon%20Province%20%28North%20Korea%29">Kangwon Province</a>; rainfall totaled in the county of <a href="Kosong">Kosong</a>. The rains caused flash flooding and increased <a href="surface%20runoff">surface runoff</a>. This occurred about a month after similarly heavy rains caused severe damage in the country. The rains from Rusa damaged and flooded thousands of houses and many public buildings, and destroyed 86,000 tonnes of crop fields; the latter was most significant due to the country's <a href="North%20Korean%20famine">ongoing famine conditions</a>. Damage was heaviest in <a href="Kangwon%20Province%20%28North%20Korea%29">Kangwon Province</a>, and the typhoon affected <a href="Administrative%20divisions%20of%20North%20Korea">four provinces and one administrative city</a>. More than 26,000 people were left homeless in the country, although advance warning allowed for evacuations. Rusa disrupted transportation by destroying 25 km (16 mi) of roads and 24 bridges; however, most of the damage was isolated to a small region. There were three deaths in North Korea.

The typhoon also affected the Russian Far East. On <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a> island, Rusa's remnants dropped heavy rainfall, the equivalence of two months average precipitation. The rains flooded 350 houses, but there were no deaths in the region.

Following the storm, damaged buildings polluted rivers in South Korea with chemicals and heavy metals. The country utilized 30,000 soldiers to assist in cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President <a href="Kim%20Dae-jung">Kim Dae-jung</a> authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies were sent to the affected citizens. By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to other residents in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49 million in donations (₩58 billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680 meals to 16,919 families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies. Residents in the country raised about $60 million (₩72.1 billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation. The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm. On September 13, the South Korean government declared 203 cities and counties as disaster zones, which entitled 8,714 families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans. The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002. The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300 million deficit for non-life insurance companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon. Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980. In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who lost their homes. However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's <a href="Habitat%20for%20Humanity">Habitat for Humanity</a> built 69 houses for storm victims in 2003, although that was only for a small portion of the overall number of people affected. About a year after Rusa hit, <a href="Typhoon%20Maemi">Typhoon Maemi</a> also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74 billion in damage and 117 deaths. The damage total was less than from Rusa but was more significant to industrial areas.

In North Korea, the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Societies">Red Cross</a> provided relief supplies to residents affected by flooding. The agency's international disaster relief fund provided FR75,000 (2002 <a href="Swiss%20franc">CHF</a> ($50,000 USD).. Soldiers were used to assist in <a href="search%20and%20rescue">search and rescue</a> missions and to repair damaged infrastructure. Due to storm damage, the Red Cross in North Korea distributed over 2.1 million water purification tablets and over 11,000 water containers. The agency also provided 32,753 blankets and 4,931 kitchen units. After the storm, people left homeless by the storm sought shelter with neighbors or in shelters. A South Korean dairy company donated 42,000 cans of baby formula to North Korea.

The name Rusa was retired after its usage in 2002, and was replaced with Nuri in 2004.

Attack on Sydney Harbour

In late May and early June 1942, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20submarines">submarines belonging to the Imperial Japanese Navy</a> made a series of attacks on the cities of <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a> in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, Australia. On the night of 31 May – 1 June, three <a href="Ko-hyoteki%20class%20submarine">"Ko-hyoteki"-class</a> <a href="midget%20submarine">midget submarine</a>s, each with a two-member crew, entered <a href="Sydney%20Harbour">Sydney Harbour</a>, avoided the partially constructed <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20anti-submarine%20boom%20net">Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net</a>, and attempted to sink Allied warships. Two of the midget submarines were detected and attacked before they could successfully engage any Allied vessels, and the crews <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> their submarines and killed themselves. These submarines were later recovered by the Allies. The third submarine attempted to torpedo the heavy cruiser , but instead sank the converted ferry , killing 21 sailors. This midget submarine's fate was unknown until 2006, when amateur scuba divers discovered the wreck off <a href="Northern%20Beaches%20%28Sydney%29">Sydney's northern beaches</a>.

Immediately following the raid, the five Japanese fleet submarines that carried the midget submarines to Australia embarked on a campaign to disrupt merchant shipping in eastern Australian waters. Over the next month, the submarines attacked at least seven merchant vessels, sinking three ships and killing 50 sailors. During this period, between midnight and 02:30 on 8 June, two of the submarines bombarded the ports of Sydney and Newcastle.

The midget submarine attacks and subsequent bombardments are among the best-known examples of <a href="Axis%20naval%20activity%20in%20Australian%20waters">Axis naval activity in Australian waters</a> during World War II, and are the only occasion in history when either city has come under attack. The physical effects were slight: the Japanese had intended to destroy several major warships, but sank only an unarmed depot ship and failed to damage any significant targets during the bombardments. The main impact was psychological; creating popular fear of an impending <a href="Proposed%20Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">Japanese invasion</a> and forcing the Australian military to upgrade defences, including the commencement of <a href="Convoy%23Naval%20convoys">convoy</a> operations to protect merchant shipping.

The <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> originally intended to use six submarines in the attack on Sydney Harbour: <a href="B1%20type%20submarine">B1-type</a> submarines , , , and , and <a href="Type%20C%20submarine">C1-type</a> submarines and . The six submarines made up the Eastern Attack Group of the <a href="8th%20Submarine%20Squadron%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">8th Submarine Squadron</a>, under the command of Captain <a href="Hankyu%20Sasaki">Hankyu Sasaki</a>.

On 8 June 1942, "I-21" and "I-29"—each carrying a <a href="Yokosuka%20E14Y">Yokosuka E14Y</a>1 "Glen" <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a> for aerial reconnaissance—scouted various <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>n harbours to select the ones most vulnerable to attack by midget submarines. "I-21" scouted <a href="Noum%C3%A9a">Nouméa in New Caledonia</a>, <a href="Suva">Suva in Fiji</a>, then <a href="Auckland">Auckland in New Zealand</a>, while "I-29" went to Sydney, Australia.

On 11 May, "I-22", "I-24", "I-27", and "I-28" were ordered to proceed to the Japanese naval base at <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk Lagoon</a>, in the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a>, to each receive a <a href="Ko-hyoteki%20class%20submarine">"Ko-hyoteki"-class midget submarine</a>. "I-28" failed to reach Truk; she was torpedoed on the surface by the US submarine on 17 May. The three remaining submarines left Truk around 20 May for a point south of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. "I-24" was forced to return a day later when an explosion in her midget submarine's battery compartment killed the midget's navigator and injured the commander. The midget submarine intended for "I-28" replaced the damaged midget.

The naval officer-in-charge of Sydney Harbour at the time of the attack was <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Gerard%20Muirhead-Gould">Gerard Muirhead-Gould</a> of the Royal Navy. On the night of the attack, three major vessels were present in Sydney Harbour; the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s and , and the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> . Other warships in the harbour included: destroyer tender , auxiliary minelayer , corvettes , , and , armed merchant cruisers and , and Dutch submarine <a href="HMAS%20K9">"K-IX"</a>. A converted ferry—HMAS "Kuttabul"—was alongside at <a href="Garden%20Island%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Garden Island</a> where she served as a temporary barracks for sailors transferring between ships. The <a href="MS%20Oranje">hospital ship "Oranje"</a> had also been in the harbour, but departed an hour before the attack.

At the time of the attack, the static <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20defences">Sydney Harbour defences</a> consisted of eight <a href="anti-submarine%20indicator%20loop">anti-submarine indicator loop</a>s — six outside the harbour, one between <a href="North%20Heads">North Head</a> and <a href="South%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">South Head</a>, and one between South Head and <a href="Sydney%20Heads%23Middle%20Head">Middle Head</a>, as well as the partially constructed <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20anti-submarine%20boom%20net">Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net</a> between George's Head on Middle Head and Green Point on Inner South Head. The central section of the net was complete and support piles were in place to the west, but wide gaps remained on either side. Material shortages prevented the completion of the boom net prior to the attack. On the day of the attack, the six outer indicator loops were inactive; two were not functioning and there were not enough trained personnel to man both the inner and outer loop monitoring stations. The North Head – South Head indicator loop had been giving faulty signals since early 1940, and as civilian traffic regularly passed over the loop, readings were often ignored.

Harbour defence craft included the anti-submarine vessels and "Bingera"; the auxiliary minesweepers HMAS "Goonambee" and ; pleasure <a href="Launch%20%28boat%29">launches</a> converted to channel patrol boats (and armed with <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a>s), namely , "Lolita", "Steady Hour", , "Marlean", and ; and four unarmed auxiliary patrol boats.

The Japanese Navy used five "Ko-hyoteki"-class midget submarines in an unsuccessful operation against US battleships during the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. The navy hoped that upgrades to the submarines, intensified crew training, and the selection of a less well defended target would lead to better results and an increased chance of the crews of the midgets to return alive from their mission. Therefore, on 16 December 1941, the navy initiated plans for a second midget submarine operation.

The plans called for two simultaneous attacks against Allied naval vessels in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian</a> and South Pacific oceans. These attacks were intended as diversions ahead of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">attack on Midway Island</a> in the North Pacific, with the Japanese hoping to convince the Allies that they intended to attack to the south or west of their conquests. Eleven submarines of the 8th Submarine Squadron were to carry out the two attacks, the five submarines of the Western Attack Group in the Indian Ocean, and the six submarines of the Eastern Attack Group in the Pacific Ocean. The submarine groups were to select a suitable port of attack, based on their own reconnaissance.

The Western Attack Group selected the port of <a href="Antsiranana">Diégo-Suarez</a> in <a href="French%20Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. This attack—which occurred at nightfall on 30 May and resulted in the damaging of the battleship and the sinking of the tanker "British Loyalty"—came 22 days after the British captured the port from <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy France</a> at the beginning of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Madagascar">Battle of Madagascar</a>.

The four potential targets for the Eastern Attack Group were Nouméa, Suva, Auckland, and Sydney. Identified by reconnaissance flights conducted by Warrant Flying Officer Nobuo Fujita of the Imperial Japanese Navy flying from "I-25"; commencing 17 February over Sydney Harbour, and the eastern Australian harbours of Melbourne and Hobart (1 March), followed by the New Zealand harbours of Wellington (8 March) and Auckland (13 March). "I-21" and "I-29" were sent to select the final target, with "I-29" sailing to Sydney. On the evening of 16 May, "I-29" fired on the Russian merchant vessel "Wellen", from <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle, New South Wales</a>. Although "Wellen" escaped with minimal damage, shipping between Sydney and Newcastle was halted for 24 hours while aircraft and all available anti-submarine ships from Sydney, including Dutch light cruiser <a href="HNLMS%20Tromp%20%281937%29">HNLMS "Tromp"</a>, Australian destroyer and US destroyer , searched unsuccessfully for the submarine. Muirhead-Gould concluded that the submarine had operated alone and had left the area immediately after the attack.

"I-29"s floatplane made a reconnaissance flight over Sydney on 23 May. A secret radar unit set up in <a href="Iron%20Cove%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Iron Cove</a> detected the flight, but authorities dismissed its report as a glitch, as there were no Allied aircraft operating over Sydney. The aircraft was damaged or destroyed on landing, although its two crew survived. They reported the presence of several <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s, including two battleships or large cruisers, five other large warships, several minor war vessels and patrol boats, and prolific merchant shipping. The report, which the Allied <a href="FRUMEL">FRUMEL</a> <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> network partially intercepted, resulted in the Japanese Navy selecting Sydney as the target. The three midget-carrying submarines rendezvoused with "I-29" and "I-21" approximately north-east of <a href="Sydney%20Heads">Sydney Heads</a>, with all five submarines in position by 29 May.

Before dawn on 29 May, "I-21"s floatplane, piloted by Ito Susumu, performed a final reconnaissance flight over Sydney Harbour, with the mission of mapping the locations of the major vessels and of the anti-submarine net. Multiple observers spotted the floatplane but assumed it was a US Navy <a href="Curtiss%20SOC%20Seagull">Curtiss Seagull</a>. No alarm was raised until 05:07, when it was realised that the only ship in the area carrying Seagulls was the U.S. cruiser "Chicago", and all four of her aircraft were on board. <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">Richmond Air Force Base</a> launched <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">RAAF</a> <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">Wirraway</a> fighters, which failed to locate "I-21" or the floatplane. Therefore, the reconnaissance flight did not result in the authorities in Sydney taking any special defence measures. The floatplane was seriously damaged on landing and had to be scuttled, but both aircrew survived.

The Japanese planned to launch the midgets one after the other between 17:20 and 17:40, from points outside Sydney Harbour. The first midget was to pass through the Heads just after 18:30, but heavy seas delayed her by over an hour. The other two midgets followed at twenty-minute intervals and were similarly delayed.

The choice of targets was left up to the midget commanders, with advice that they should primarily target aircraft carriers or battleships, with cruisers as secondary targets. The midgets were to operate to the east of the Harbour Bridge, although if no suitable targets were to be found in this area they were to move under the Bridge and attack a battleship and large cruiser believed to be in the inner harbour. When the second reconnaissance flyover revealed that the expected British battleship——was nowhere to be found, USS "Chicago" became the priority target.

After completing their mission, the midgets were to depart Sydney Harbour and head south for to the recovery point off Port Hacking. Four of the mother submarines would be waiting in an east–west line long, with the fifth waiting further south.

Midget submarine "M-14"—launched from "I-27"–was the first to enter Sydney Harbour. The Middle Head – South Head loop detected it at 20:01, but dismissed the reading due to heavy civilian traffic. At 20:15, a Maritime Services Board watchman spotted the midget after it passed through the western gap, collided with the Pile Light, then reversed and trapped its stern in the net. The submarine's bow broke the surface; the watchman rowed toward it to determine what it was and then rowed to the nearby patrol boat HMAS "Yarroma" to report his finding. Despite efforts by "Yarroma" to pass on this information, Sydney Naval Headquarters did not receive the report until 21:52. HMAS "Yarroma" and "Lolita" were dispatched to investigate. Upon confirming that the object in the net was a "baby submarine", "Lolita" dropped two <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a>s while "Yarroma"s commander requested permission from Sydney Naval Headquarters to open fire. The depth charges failed to detonate, as the water was too shallow for the hydrostatic fuse setting. At 22:35, while "Yarroma" was waiting for permission to fire, and "Lolita" was setting up to deploy a third depth charge, the two crewmen on "M-14" activated one of the submarine's scuttling charges, killing themselves and destroying the submarine's forward section.

Muirhead-Gould gave the general alarm, along with orders for ships to take anti-submarine measures, at 22:27; the alarm was repeated at 22:36 with advice for ships to take precautions against attack, as an enemy submarine might be in the harbour. At the time of the first alarm, Sydney Harbour was closed to external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue, as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged.

Midget submarine "M-24" was the second to enter the harbour. <a href="Falie">HMAS "Falie"</a> grazed "M-24"s hull and reported the contact to command. The report was not followed up. "M-24" crossed the indicator loop undetected at 21:48, and at approximately 22:00 followed a Manly ferry through the anti-submarine net. At 22:52, "M-24" was spotted by a "Chicago" searchlight operator less than to the moored cruiser's starboard, and on a course roughly parallel to the ship's facing. "Chicago" opened fire with a gun and a quadruple machinegun mount, but inflicted minimal damage as the weapons could not <a href="wikt%3Adepress">depress</a> far enough. Some of the shells <a href="Stone%20skipping">skipped off the water</a> and hit <a href="Fort%20Denison">Fort Denison</a>'s <a href="Martello%20tower">Martello tower</a>, while fragments were later found in the suburbs of <a href="Cremorne%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cremorne</a> and <a href="Mosman%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mosman</a>. The senior officer present aboard "Chicago" ordered the crew to begin preparing for departure, and for USS "Perkins" to begin an anti-submarine screening patrol around the cruiser, orders that were revoked by the sceptical Captain Howard Bode when he arrived on board at around 23:30.

Midget submarine "M-21"—from "I-22"—probably entered the harbour at the same time that USS "Chicago" opened fire on "M-24". The unarmed auxiliary patrol boat HMAS "Lauriana" spotted "M-21" and illuminated the submarine's conning tower, while sending an alert signal to the Port War Signal Station at South Head, and the nearby anti-submarine vessel HMAS "Yandra". "Yandra" attempted to ram the submarine, lost contact, regained contact at 23:03, and dropped six depth charges. At the time of the attack, it was assumed that the depth charges had destroyed or disabled the midget, but "M-21" survived. Historians believe that the midget took refuge on the harbour floor and waited until the Allied vessels had moved away before it resumed the attack.

At 23:14, Muirhead-Gould ordered all ships to observe <a href="blackout%20%28wartime%29">blackout</a> conditions. Just after 23:30, he set off on a barge towards the boom net, to make a personal inspection. The Admiral reached "Lolita" at about midnight and indicated to her crew that he did not take the reports of enemy submarines seriously, reportedly saying: "What are you all playing at, running up and down the harbour dropping depth charges and talking about enemy subs in the harbour? There's not one to be seen." The crew reiterated that a submarine had been seen, but Muirhead-Gould remained unconvinced and before he left, added sarcastically: "If you see another sub, see if the captain has a black beard. I'd like to meet him."
Despite the blackout order, the Garden Island floodlights remained on until 00:25. About five minutes later, "M-24" fired the first of its two torpedoes; it delayed firing the second torpedo for several minutes as the midget submarines would lose longitudinal stability immediately after firing a torpedo. Historians are divided as to the exact paths of the torpedoes relative to "Chicago", although all agree that the US cruiser was the intended target. Both torpedoes missed "Chicago", while one torpedo may have also passed close to "Perkins"' starboard bow. One of the torpedoes continued underneath the Dutch submarine <a href="HMAS%20K9">"K-IX"</a> and HMAS "Kuttabul", then hit the breakwater "Kuttabul" was tied up against. The explosion broke "Kuttabul" in two and sank her, and damaged "K-IX". The attack killed 19 <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> and two <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> sailors, and wounded another 10. The explosion shook residences in the area and damaged Garden Island's lights and telecommunications. The other torpedo ran aground on the eastern shore of Garden Island without exploding. "M-24" then dived and moved to leave the harbour.
A crossing over the indicator loop that was recorded at 01:58 was initially believed to be another midget submarine entering the harbour, although later analysis showed that the reading indicated an outbound vessel and was therefore most likely represented "M-24"s exit. "M-24" did not return to its mother submarine, and <a href="%23M-24">its fate</a> remained unknown until 2006.

Ships were ordered to make for the open ocean. "Chicago" left her anchorage at 02:14, leaving a sailor behind on the <a href="Mooring%20%28watercraft%29">mooring</a> buoy in her haste to depart. "Bombay", "Whyalla", "Canberra", and "Perkins" began their preparations to depart.

Just before 03:00, as "Chicago" was leaving the harbour, the lookouts spotted a submarine periscope passing alongside the cruiser. At 03:01, the indicator loop registered an inbound signal; "M-21" was re-entering Sydney Harbour after recovering from the attack four hours previously. fired on "M-21" in <a href="Neutral%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Neutral Bay</a> at 03:50, and at 05:00, three auxiliary patrol boats—HMAS "Steady Hour", "Sea Mist", and "Yarroma"—spotted the submarine's conning tower in Taylors Bay. The patrol boats had set their depth charge fuses to , and when "Sea Mist" passed over where the submarine had just submerged and dropped a depth charge, she had only five seconds to clear the area. The blast damaged "M-21", which inverted and rose to the surface before sinking again. "Sea Mist" dropped a second depth charge, which damaged one of her two engines in the process and prevented her from making further attacks. "Steady Hour" and "Yarroma" continued the attack, dropping seventeen depth charges on believed visual sightings and instrument contacts of the midget over the next three and a half hours. At some point during the night, the crew of "M-21" killed themselves.

At 04:40, HMAS "Canberra" recorded that the Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This may have been one of many false alarms throughout the night. However, "M-21" had attempted to fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS "Yandra"s ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS "Chicago", making it possible that "M-21" attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard "Canberra" may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.

As per the operation plan, the five mother submarines waited off <a href="Port%20Hacking">Port Hacking</a> on the nights of 1 and 2 June for the midget submarines to return. FRUMEL picked up wireless traffic between the five submarines, leading the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">RAAF</a> to task three <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s and two <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>s with finding the source of the communications. They were unsuccessful. On 3 June, Sasaki abandoned hope of recovering the midget submarines, and the submarines dispersed on their secondary missions.

Four of the submarines began operations against Allied merchant shipping. "I-21" patrolled north of Sydney, while "I-24" patrolled south of Sydney. "I-27" began searching off <a href="Gabo%20Island">Gabo Island</a> for ships departing Melbourne, and "I-29" travelled to Brisbane. "I-22" left the group to conduct reconnaissance operations, first at Wellington and Auckland in New Zealand, and then at Suva in Fiji.

Between 1 and 25 June, when the four submarines arrived at <a href="Kwajalein">Kwajalein</a> Atoll in the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> to re-supply before proceeding to Japanese shipyards for maintenance, the four submarines attacked at least seven Allied merchant vessels. Three of these were sunk: "<a href="SS%20Iron%20Chieftain%20%281937%29">Iron Chieftain</a>" by "I-24" on 3 June, "Iron Crown" by "I-27" on 4 June, and "Guatemala" by "I-21" on 12 June. The first two attacks resulted in 12 and 37 fatalities respectively, though the third attack killed no one. The attacks forced the authorities to institute changes in merchant traffic; travel north of Melbourne was restricted until a system of escorted convoys was established.

"I-21" was the only submarine to return to Australian waters, where she sank three ships and damaged two others during January and February 1943. During her two deployments, "I-21" sank of Allied shipping, which made her the most successful Japanese submarine to <a href="Axis%20naval%20activity%20in%20Australian%20waters">operate in Australian waters</a>.

On the morning of 8 June, "I-24" and "I-21" briefly bombarded Sydney and <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a>. Just after midnight, "I-24" surfaced south-south-east of <a href="Macquarie%20Lighthouse">Macquarie Lighthouse</a>. The submarine's commander ordered the gun crew to target the <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a>. They fired 10 shells over a four-minute period; nine landed in the <a href="Eastern%20Suburbs%20%28Sydney%29">Eastern Suburbs</a> and one landed in water. "I-24" then <a href="crash%20dive">crash dive</a>d to prevent successful retaliation by coastal artillery batteries. Only one shell detonated, and the only injuries inflicted were cuts and fractures from falling bricks or broken glass when the unexploded shells hit buildings. A <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> pilot, 1st Lieutenant George Cantello, based at <a href="Bankstown%20Airport">Bankstown Airport</a> disobeyed orders and took off to try and locate the source of the shelling, but was killed when engine failure caused his <a href="Bell%20P-39%20Airacobra">Airacobra</a> to crash in a paddock at <a href="Hammondville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Hammondville</a>. In 1988, following efforts by residents and the US Consulate in Sydney, the <a href="Liverpool%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">City of Liverpool</a> established a memorial park, the Lt. Cantello Reserve, with a monument in his honour.

At 02:15, "I-21" <a href="Shelling%20of%20Newcastle">shelled Newcastle</a>, from north-east of <a href="Stockton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Stockton Beach</a>. She fired 34 shells over a 16-minute period, including eight <a href="star%20shell">star shell</a>s. The target of the attack was the <a href="BHP%20Billiton">BHP</a> steelworks in the city. However, the shells landed over a large area, causing minimal damage and no fatalities: the only shell to detonate damaged a house on Parnell Place, while an unexploded shell hit a <a href="Trams%20in%20Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">tram terminus</a>. <a href="Fort%20Scratchley">Fort Scratchley</a> returned fire, the only time an Australian land fortification has fired on an enemy warship during wartime, but the submarine escaped unscathed.

The attack on Sydney Harbour ended in failure on both sides, and revealed flaws in both the Allied defences and the Japanese tactics. During the primary attack, the Japanese lost all three midget submarines in exchange for the sinking of a single barracks ship. The subsequent operations were no more successful as the five large Japanese submarines sank only three merchant ships and caused minimal property damage during the two bombardments. The performance of the Allied defenders was equally poor. However, one historian states that the lack of damage in Sydney Harbour was due to "a combination of good luck and aggressive counter-attack".

The main impact of the midget submarine attack and subsequent operations was psychological; dispelling any belief that Sydney was immune to Japanese attack and highlighting Australia's proximity to the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>. There was no official inquiry into the attacks, despite demand from some sections of the media, as there was concern that an inquiry would lead to <a href="defeatism">defeatism</a> and reduce faith in <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a>'s government, particularly after the damaging inquiry into Australian defences that had followed the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin%20%28February%201942%29">Japanese aerial attack on Darwin</a> three months earlier.

The Allies failed to respond adequately to several warnings of Japanese activity off the east coast of Australia prior to the attack; they simply ignored the warnings or explained them away. They attributed the unsuccessful attack on the freighter "Wellen" on 16 May to a single submarine, and assumed it had departed Australian waters immediately after the attack. The first reconnaissance flight went unnoticed, and although <a href="FRUMEL">FRUMEL</a> intercepted the report and distributed it to Allied commanders on 30 May, Muirhead-Gould apparently did not react. <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> naval authorities detected radio chatter between the Japanese submarines on 26 and 29 May, and although they could not decrypt the transmissions, <a href="Direction%20finding">radio direction finding</a> indicated that a submarine or submarines were approaching Sydney. The Allies considered dispatching an anti-submarine patrol in response to the 29 May fix, but were unable to do so as all anti-submarine craft were already committed to protecting a northbound troop convoy. The only response to the second reconnaissance flight on 29 May was the launching of search planes. No other defence measures were put into place. Although the midget attack on <a href="Antsiranana">Diego Suarez</a> in Madagascar occurred on the morning of 31 May (Sydney time), the Allies sent no alert to other command regions, as they believed that <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> forces had launched the attack.
Historians have questioned the competence of the senior Allied officers. Muirhead-Gould had been hosting a dinner party on the night of the attack, and one of the main guests was the senior United States Navy officer in Sydney Harbour, Captain <a href="Howard%20Bode">Howard Bode</a> of USS "Chicago". Both officers were sceptical that any attack was taking place. Muirhead-Gould arrived aboard HMAS "Lolita" at approximately midnight, an action he described as attempting to learn about the situation. But members of "Lolita"'s crew later recounted that when Muirhead-Gould came aboard he immediately chastised the patrol boat's skipper and crew, and quickly dismissed their report. Junior officers on "Chicago" provided similar descriptions of Bode's return on board, and members of both crews later claimed that Muirhead-Gould and Bode were intoxicated. It was only after the destruction of HMAS "Kuttabul" that both officers began to take the attack seriously.

During the attack, there were several delays between events and responses to them. Over two hours passed between the observation of "M-14" in the boom net and Muirhead-Gould's first order for ships to commence anti-submarine actions. It took another two hours to mobilise the auxiliary patrol boats, which did not leave their anchorage for a further hour. Part of these delays was due to a lack of effective communications. None of the auxiliary patrol craft in the harbour had radio communications, so all instructions and reports came from signal lights via the Port War Signal Station or Garden Island, or by physical communication via <a href="Launch%20%28boat%29">launches</a>. In Muirhead-Gould's preliminary report on the attack, he stated that the Port War Signal Station was not designed for the volume of communications traffic the attack caused. Telephone communications with Garden Island were unreliable during the early part of the attack, and then the first torpedo explosion disabled them completely.

The need to keep information secret may also have contributed to the delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would not have been informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated in the early hours of the attack.

The main flaw in the Japanese plans was the use of midget submarines for the primary attack. Midget submarines were originally intended to operate during fleet actions: they would be released from modified <a href="Seaplane%20tender">seaplane carriers</a> to run amok through the enemy fleet. This concept went out of favour as changing Japanese naval thinking and experience led to recognition that naval warfare would centre around <a href="Aircraft%20carrier">carrier</a>-supported aerial combat. As a result, the midget program's focus changed to the infiltration of enemy harbours, where they would attack vessels at anchor. This concept failed completely during the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, where the midgets had no effect, and tying up 11 large submarines for six weeks in support of further midget submarine attacks on Sydney and Diego Suarez proved a waste of resources.

Moreover, the failures at Sydney Harbour and Diego Suarez demonstrated that the improvements to the midget submarines made after Pearl Harbor had not increased the overall impact of the midget program. The modifications had various effects. The ability to man and deploy the midgets while the mother ships were submerged prevented the Army coastal radars from detecting the mother submarines. However, the midgets were still difficult to control, unstable, and prone to surfacing or diving uncontrollably. These manoeuvrability issues contributed to "M-14"s entanglement in the anti-submarine net, and the repeated detection of "M-21" and "M-24".

Beyond the use of the unreliable midgets, historians have identified areas in the plan of attack where the Japanese could have done significantly more damage. If the Japanese midget submarines had conducted a simultaneous, co-ordinated attack, they would have overwhelmed the defences. A chance for more damage came following the destruction of "Kuttabul", when several naval vessels headed to sea, including USS "Chicago", USS "Perkins", Dutch submarine "K-IX", HMAS "Whyalla", and HMIS "Bombay". The five mother submarines were already en route to the <a href="Port%20Hacking">Port Hacking</a> recovery position, and although Sasaki's plan at Pearl Harbor had been to leave some submarines at the harbour mouth to pick off fleeing vessels, he did not repeat this tactic.

Several factors beyond the control of any of the combatants contributed to the survival of USS "Chicago". At the time of "M-24"s attack on "Chicago", the latter had spent some time preparing to depart from Sydney Harbour, and although still moored and stationary, was producing large volumes of white smoke as the boilers warmed up. This smoke, streaming aft under the influence of the wind, and contrasting against the dark, low-lying cloud, may have given the impression that "Chicago" was moving, causing "M-24" to <a href="Deflection%20%28military%29">lead the target</a> when firing its torpedoes, and consequently sending its torpedoes across the bow. Another factor that may have influenced "Chicago"s survival was the extinguishing of Garden Island's floodlights minutes before "M-24" fired its first torpedo, impeding targeting.

The bombardments failed to cause significant physical damage, but had a major psychological impact on the residents of Sydney and Newcastle. Due to the inaccuracy of the submarines' range-finding equipment, coupled with the unstable firing platform of a submarine at sea, specific targeting was impossible. The intention of the submarine bombardment was to frighten the population of the target area.

The failure of the majority of the shells to detonate may have had various causes. As the submarines fired <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armour-piercing</a> shells, intended for use against steel ship hulls, the relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger the impact fuses. Sea water may have degraded the shells, which the Japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks. The age of the shells may also have been a factor; some of the shells recovered from the Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture: surplus munitions from World War I.

In Sydney, fear of an impending Japanese invasion caused people to move west; housing prices in the <a href="Eastern%20Suburbs%20%28Sydney%29">Eastern Suburbs</a> dropped, while those beyond the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29">Blue Mountains</a> rose significantly. The attack also led to a significant increase in the membership of volunteer defence organisations, and strengthening of defences in Sydney Harbour and Port Newcastle.

The papers did not publish news of the submarine attack until 2 June, as most of the attack occurred after the newspapers went to press on the morning of 1 June. Instead, on the morning after the attack, the front pages carried news of <a href="Bombing%20of%20Cologne%20in%20World%20War%20II">Operation Millennium</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s first 1,000-bomber raid, although several newspapers included a small interior article mentioning the <a href="%23Final%20reconnaissance">final reconnaissance flyover</a>. The Federal Censor ordered total censorship of the events, issuing an official statement on the afternoon of 1 June which reported that the Allies had destroyed three submarines in Sydney Harbour, and described the loss of "Kuttabul" and the 21 deaths as the loss of "one small harbour vessel of no military value". "<a href="Smith%27s%20Weekly">Smith's Weekly</a>" finally released the real story on 6 June, and follow-up material in the 13 June issue caused more political damage, prompting the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> to attempt to charge the newspaper with releasing defence information.
It was several days before the 21 dead sailors aboard "Kuttabul" could all be recovered. On 3 June, Muirhead-Gould and over 200 Navy personnel attended a burial ceremony for these sailors. On 1 January 1943, the Navy base at Garden Island was commissioned as in commemoration of the ferry and the lives lost.

The Australians recovered the bodies of the four Japanese crew of the two midget submarines sunk in Sydney Harbour and had them cremated at <a href="Rookwood%20Cemetery">Rookwood Cemetery</a>. For the cremation, the Allies draped the Japanese flag over each coffin and rendered full naval honours. Muirhead-Gould was criticised for this, but defended his actions as respecting the courage of the four submariners, regardless of their origin. Australian politicians also hoped that the Japanese Government would notice the respect paid to the sailors and improve the conditions Australian prisoners-of-war were experiencing in Japanese internment camps. Japanese authorities noted the funeral service, but this did not lead to any major improvement in conditions for Australian POWs. Following the use of the midget submariners' funeral by the Japanese for propaganda purposes, the Australian High Command forbade similar funerals for enemy personnel in the future.

An exchange of Japanese and Allied diplomatic personnel stranded in the opposing nations occurred in August 1942, which allowed <a href="Tatsuo%20Kawai%20%28diplomat%29">Tatsuo Kawai</a>, the Japanese ambassador to Australia, to return home with the ashes of the four Japanese submariners. When the exchange ship "<a href="Kamakura%20Maru">Kamakura Maru</a>" arrived in <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, several thousand people were present to honour the four men.
The two main targets of the attack, USS "Chicago" and HMAS "Canberra", were both lost within the next year: "Canberra" sinking on 9 August 1942 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Savo%20Island">Battle of Savo Island</a>, and "Chicago" on 30 January 1943 following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rennell%20Island">Battle of Rennell Island</a>. None of the Japanese submarines involved in the attack survived the war. and sank "I-21" on 5 February 1944 off the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a>. An American torpedo boat sank "I-22" on 25 December 1942 off <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. An American patrol craft sank "I-24" on 10 June 1943 near the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>. and sank "I-27" on 12 February 1943 off the <a href="Maldives">Maldives</a>. Lastly, sank "I-29" on 26 July 1944 in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>.

The Allies located and recovered "M-21" on 3 June and "M-14" on 8 June. Although both were damaged during the attack, it was possible to assemble a complete submarine from the two vessels. The centre section of the rebuilt submarine was mounted on a trailer and taken on a tour throughout southern New South Wales, Victoria, and western South Australia. The purpose of the tour was twofold; it allowed Australians to see a Japanese midget submarine up close, and was used to raise A£28,000 for the Naval Relief Fund and other charities. The submarine arrived at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> in Canberra on 28 April 1943, flying the <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a> and a <a href="Decommissioning%20pennant">paying-off pennant</a>. The submarine was originally displayed outside the museum in three separate pieces, but was moved inside in the 1980s due to heavy vandalism; on one occasion in 1966, a group of university students painted it bright yellow in response to <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' song "<a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%28song%29">Yellow Submarine</a>." The composite submarine was restored and remains on display inside the Memorial as part of a permanent exhibition on the attack, next to the recovered wheelhouse of HMAS "Kuttabul".' The conning tower from "M-21" is on display at the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy%20Heritage%20Centre">Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre</a> on Garden Island. Leftover material from "M-21" was melted down and made into souvenirs following the construction of the combined vessel.

Over the 64 years following the disappearance of "M-24" after the attacks, more than 50 people approached the Royal Australian Navy claiming to have found the submarine. All of these claims were found to be false. One early theory about the midget's fate was that it was damaged or destroyed, along with "M-21", in or around Taylors Bay, which would account for reports from "Steady Hour" and "Yarroma" of multiple submarines during their three-hour attack against "M-21". A second theory was that the midget attempted to return to the mother submarines but exhausted its battery power before reaching the Port Hacking recovery point and would therefore be outside and to the south of Sydney Heads. The third theory was that the midget's crew decided to avoid endangering the five larger submarines during the recovery process, and either ran straight out to sea or headed north.

A group of seven amateur scuba divers solved the mystery in November 2006, when they found a small submarine sitting upright on the seabed, below sea level and approximately from <a href="Bungan%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bungan Head</a>, off <a href="Northern%20Beaches%20%28Sydney%29">Sydney's Northern Beaches</a>. Commander Shane Moore, the officer responsible for the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>'s heritage collection, confirmed that the wreck was "M-24" after viewing footage from multiple dives, along with measurements the group had taken. The wreck had several bullet holes in it, most likely from "Chicago"s quadruple machine-gun mount. The location of the wreck was kept secret by both the divers and the navy, with Defence Minister <a href="Brendan%20Nelson">Brendan Nelson</a> promising to have the wreck protected as a <a href="war%20grave">war grave</a>. The wreck was <a href="gazette">gazette</a>d on 1 December 2006 as a heritage site. A exclusion zone was established around the wreck site, and any vessel entering the zone is liable to a fine under New South Wales law of up to A$1.1 million, with additional fines and confiscation of equipment under Commonwealth law. Shore- and buoy-mounted surveillance cameras and a sonar listening device further protect the site.

On 7 February 2007, during <a href="Japan%20Maritime%20Self-Defense%20Force">JMSDF</a> Admiral <a href="Eiji%20Yoshikawa%20%28admiral%29">Eiji Yoshikawa</a>'s visit to Australia, Yoshikawa and RAN Vice Admiral <a href="Russ%20Shalders">Russ Shalders</a> presided over a ceremony held aboard to honour "M-24"s crew. Relatives of the midget submarines' crews, one of the survivors from "Kuttabul", and dignitaries and military personnel from Australia and Japan attended another ceremony on 6 August 2007 at HMAS "Kuttabul". then carried relatives of "M-24"s crew to the wreck site, where they poured <a href="sake">sake</a> into the sea before being presented with sand taken from the seabed around the submarine.

In May 2012, the NSW state government announced that, with the approval of the Japanese government and the submariners' families, divers would be allowed to observe the "M-24" wreck for a short period of time. Divers would enter a ballot for places on controlled dives run on several days. If successful, opening the site would become an annual event to commemorate the attack.

Typhoon Chataan

Typhoon Chataan, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Gloria, was the deadliest natural disaster in the history of <a href="Chuuk%20State">Chuuk</a>, a state in the <a href="Federated%20States%20of%20Micronesia">Federated States of Micronesia</a> (FSM). The <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a> formed on June 28, 2002, near the FSM, and for several days it meandered while producing heavy rainfall across the region. On Chuuk, the highest 24-hour precipitation total was 506 mm (19.9 in), which was greater than the average monthly total. The rain produced floods up to deep, causing landslides across the island that killed 47 people. There was also one death on nearby <a href="Pohnpei">Pohnpei</a>, and damage in the FSM totaled over $100 million.

After affecting the FSM, Chataan began a northwest track as an intensifying typhoon. Its <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> passed just north of <a href="Guam">Guam</a> on July 4, though the eyewall moved across the island and dropped heavy rainfall. Totals were highest in southern Guam, peaking at 536 mm (21.1 in). Flooding and landslides from the storm severely damaged or destroyed 1,994 houses. Damage on the island totaled $60.5 million, and there were 23 injuries. The typhoon also affected <a href="Rota%20%28island%29">Rota</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Marianas%20Islands">Northern Marianas Islands</a> with gusty winds and light rainfall. Typhoon Chataan attained its peak intensity of 175 km/h (110 mph) on July 8. It weakened while turning to the north, and after diminishing to a tropical storm Chataan struck eastern Japan on July 10. High rainfall, peaking at , flooded 10,270 houses. Damage in Japan totaled about $500 million.

The name Chataan means "rainy day" in the <a href="Chamorro%20language">Chamorro language</a>, which is spoken on Guam. The <a href="Philippine%20Atmospheric%2C%20Geophysical%20and%20Astronomical%20Services%20Administration">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> (PAGASA) named the storm Gloria while the typhoon was in the vicinity of the country.

On June 27, 2002, the <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> spawned a tropical disturbance southwest of <a href="Pohnpei">Pohnpei</a>. The system rapidly organized that day, and at 2000 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) issued a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20formation%20alert">tropical cyclone formation alert</a>. Early on June 28, the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) classified the system as a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> near the <a href="Nomoi%20Islands">Mortlock Islands</a> in the <a href="Federated%20States%20of%20Micronesia">Federated States of Micronesia</a>; around the same time, the JTWC also initiated storm advisories. Early on June 29, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm 08W, and shortly thereafter the JMA named the system Tropical Storm Chataan. After moving northwestward, the storm turned to the east, resuming a northwest track on June 30 due to a <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a> to the north. The track was erratic because the storm had not yet separated from the monsoon trough. By June 30, Chataan had steadily strengthened to severe tropical storm status, with 10-minute <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of 95 km/h (60 mph).

Only July 1, the system's circulation became broad, with most of the <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a> located west of the center. The next day, Chataan briefly weakened to an intensity of 85 km/h (50 mph), although it began strengthening steadily on July 3, when its center passed very near <a href="Weno">Weno</a> in Chuck State in the FSM. At 1800 UTC that night, the JTWC upgraded Chataan to a typhoon, and about 24 hours later the JMA followed suit while the storm was approaching <a href="Guam">Guam</a> from the southeast. At about 2130 UTC on July 4, the <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> of Chataan moved across northern Guam in about two hours, although the center of the eye passed north of the island.
After affecting Guam, Chataan continued toward the northwest and gradually intensified. At 0000 UTC on July 8, the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 175 km/h (110 mph ) while located near the Japanese island of <a href="Okinotorishima">Okinotorishima</a>. The JTWC assessed that Chataan had reached its peak intensity of 240 km/h (150 mph ) about six hours earlier; on that basis, the agency classified the system as a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales">super typhoon</a>. On July 8, Chataan turned toward the north around the subtropical ridge while maintaining its peak winds for about 18 hours. On July 9 the typhoon turned to the northeast, and late that day it weakened to a severe tropical storm. At around 1530 UTC on July 10, Chataan made <a href="landfall">landfall</a> on the <a href="B%C5%8Ds%C5%8D%20Peninsula">Bōsō Peninsula</a> in <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a> with winds of about 100 km/h (65 mph ). The storm briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall on eastern <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> at 1200 UTC on July 11; this marked the first occasion of a July landfall on the island in 28 years. A few hours later, Chataan became an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a>, where the remnants stalled before dissipating on July 13 near <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a>.

While Chataan was in its formative stages and still tied to the monsoon trough, it produced a large area of heavy rainfall and strong winds that affected Pohnpei and Chuuk in the FSM. The storm passed very near Chuuk with wind gusts of 82 km/h (51 mph). In the day before Chataan affected the island, it dropped torrential rainfall due to its elongated structure and slow movement. Persistent winds from the larger monsoon trough generated high surf and tides of 0.3 m (1 ft) above normal across the region. The most significant effects were from the rainfall, peaking at 954 mm (37.5 in) at the Chuuk Weather Service Office over 13 days. The highest 24-hour total was 506 mm (19.9 in) on Weno Island, of which 361 mm (14.2 in) fell in 12 hours; this was greater than the average monthly rainfall total for the station.

High winds downed power lines on Chuuk, while surf destroyed seawalls and buildings along the coast. The rains causes severe flooding across the island that reached in some locations, triggering at least 30 mudslides that killed 47 people. This represented the deadliest natural disaster in the island's recorded history. The landslides reached a depth of 4.6 m (15 ft), which destroyed several homes made of tin and concrete. Many people were buried by the landslides or washed into the ocean. Saltwater flooding contaminated the groundwater and destroyed much of the island's crops. Chataan damaged roads and bridges, and high winds downed power lines, which cut communications between islands. Across Chuuk, the storm destroyed about 1,000 homes and left about 1,000 people homeless. About 100 people were injured.

In nearby Pohnpei state, Chataan produced 72 km/h (45 mph) winds in <a href="Nukuoro">Nukuoro</a>. The winds destroyed a house and a weather station. Rainfall on the atoll reached 457 mm (18.0 in). High winds, surf, and rain also affected Sapwuafik. Rough seas killed a person on Pohnpei. Crop damage in the country totaled $3 million, and overall property damage was estimated at $100 million, mostly on Chuuk.

Before Chataan affected Guam, officials canceled <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. Independence Day</a> festivities, and residents purchased storm supplies. Although the center of the eye did not strike Guam, the eyewall affected the entire island with strong winds and heavy rainfall. The highest sustained winds were estimated at 120 km/h (75 mph), with gusts to 167 km/h (104 mph) at <a href="Andersen%20Air%20Force%20Base">Andersen Air Force Base</a>. Gusts were slightly higher at <a href="Apra%20Harbor">Apra Harbor</a>, peaking at 170 km/h (106 mph), and gusts may have reached as high as 200 km/h (125 mph). Similar to its effects on Chuuk, Chataan dropped heavy rainfall on Guam, peaking at 536 mm (21.1 in) on Mount Almagosa; the same station reported 311 mm (12.2 in) in about three hours. The <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">Weather Forecast Office</a> on the island reported 265 mm (10.4 in) in a 24-hour period. The rains were less than 250 mm (10 in) in northern Guam, and were highest in the mountainous southern region where the eye crossed. While moving across the island, Chataan produced a significant <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> that peaked at about 3.6 m (12 ft) in <a href="Umatac%2C%20Guam">Umatac</a>.

High winds caused damage across Guam, mostly to roofs and to poorly built or wooden structures. A total of 1,996 houses were severely damaged or destroyed. Better constructed homes fared well during the storm, and there was little window damage. The winds also downed power lines, leaving an island-wide power outage. <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20High%20School%20%28Guam%29">John F. Kennedy High School</a> sustained damage to its football field and library. The most significant effects were from the heavy rainfall, resulting in landslides in some areas and causing rivers to flow at above-normal rates; 14 stations reported either record flow rates or peak crests, including an island-wide peak crest of 8.55 m (28.06 ft) at the mouth of the <a href="Tolaeyuus%20River">Tolaeyuus River</a>. Two water gauges were destroyed during the storm. Swollen rivers damaged roads, washed away trees, and caused erosion. The storm flooding contaminated <a href="Fena%20Lake">Fena Lake</a>, which provides water to the military base, for a few days. In addition, 34 of the island's 110 water wells failed due to the storm. Flooding also destroyed a building and damaged the runway at <a href="Antonio%20B.%20Won%20Pat%20International%20Airport">Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport</a>, and damaged a bridge near <a href="Inarajan%2C%20Guam">Inarajan</a>. A few palm trees fell due to the soil being loosened, either from heavy rains or high waves. Some of the downed trees struck cars, but the winds were not strong enough to overturn any vehicles. In the higher elevations of Guam, some areas experienced heavy crop damage due to strong winds; however, crop damage in general was less than expected, estimated at around $500,000. In <a href="Apra%20Harbor">Apra Harbor</a>, high seas washed ashore or sank five boats, and a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">Navy</a> barge spilled 397,000 litres (105,000 gallons) of oil. Overall, Chataan caused about $60 million in property damage on Guam, and there were 23 injuries, none of them serious.

North of Guam, Chataan affected <a href="Rota%20%28island%29">Rota</a> with 74 km/h (46 mph) sustained winds and gusts to 120 km/h (75 mph) at the island's <a href="Rota%20International%20Airport">airport</a>. Rainfall was much less than elsewhere in the typhoon's path, and a 24-hour total of 38.6 mm (1.52 in) was reported at Rota's airport. The storm inflicted heavy damage to crops and fisheries, and 60% of farmers reported a total loss. Chataan also damaged roads on the island, many due to fallen trees. Nine huts were destroyed, and damage was estimated at $2.7 million.

Energy from the typhoon enhanced monsoonal moisture over the Philippines, in conjunction with <a href="2002%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season%23Severe%20Tropical%20Storm%20Nakri%20%28Hambalos%29">Tropical Storm Nakri</a>. The two storms contributed to heavy rainfall that triggered floods and landslides, which closed roads and highways. High waves killed three people after a boat overturned. The storm destroyed 566 houses and damaged another 2,363. A total of 31,813 people evacuated to 184 government-opened shelters. Officials canceled classes during the system; several schools were used as temporary shelters. Damage totaled over $1.5 million (₱64 million <a href="Philippine%20peso">pesos</a>), and the floods killed 58 people.

The last location Chataan affected was Japan. The typhoon forced the cancellation of 316 flights and 150 train trips. The expressway between <a href="Shizuoka%20City">Shizuoka</a> and Tokyo was closed. At least 396 schools were closed in the country, and a baseball game between the <a href="Yokohama%20DeNA%20BayStars">Yokohama DeNA BayStars</a> and the <a href="Yakult%20Swallows">Yakult Swallows</a> was canceled due to the inclement weather. <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a> temporarily closed most of its factories in the country. Heavy rainfall, peaking at in <a href="Gifu%20Prefecture">Gifu Prefecture</a>, fell across Japan. The rains flooded 10,270 houses in the country, resulting in evacuation orders for about 145,000 people. The floods damaged roads in 338 locations, and at least 10 bridges were destroyed. About 15,000 evacuees were in <a href="Ogaki">Ogaki</a> after a river exceeded its banks. High rainfall caused hundreds of landslides, two of which resulted in a death. Floods killed at least three people. Winds from the typhoon peaked at 97 km/h (60 mph) at <a href="Hachij%C5%8D-jima">Hachijō-jima</a>. High winds in <a href="Sakai%2C%20Osaka">Sakai, Osaka</a> damaged 20 houses. In Tokyo, the storm produced light winds and rains, despite passing within 102 km (63 mi). Chataan destroyed 21 homes and damaged 239 others to some degree. During its passage, the typhoon destroyed of crops. The typhoon killed six people, left one person missing, and injured 30 others. Overall damage in Japan totaled about $500 million (¥59 billion 2002 <a href="Japanese%20yen">JPY</a>). During the storm, <a href="Yahoo%21%20Japan">Yahoo! Japan</a> received a record 359 million views, mostly due to people checking the website's weather section.

After Chataan affected Chuuk state, the island's residents were in need of food, clothes and medicine. Only a few crops were not destroyed by the storm; much of the <a href="breadfruit">breadfruit</a> was stripped from the trees, and fruit not destroyed by the storm were damaged by parasites. In the days after the storm, the local <a href="International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement">Red Cross</a> deployed about 100 volunteers to search for victims buried by landslides. However, rescue operations were hampered by persistent flooding after the storm. Initially the death toll was unknown, and it was feared that hundreds of people had been killed. Six people who were seriously injured on Chuuk were flown to <a href="The%20Queen%27s%20Medical%20Center">The Queen's Medical Center</a> in Hawaii for treatment; they were initially scheduled to fly to <a href="Guam%20Memorial%20Hospital">Guam Memorial Hospital</a>, but the facility was full. About 2,000 residents affected by the storm evacuated to government-run shelters. The Red Cross shipped various relief supplies, including raincoats and water, to the affected areas. By July 4, power systems were restored and the airport reopened. Although there was enough food in the immediate aftermath, the destruction of crops and cattle posed a long-term food shortage.

On July 3 while Chataan was passing the region, the governor of Chuuk declared a state of emergency, requesting international assistance. On July 9, the government of Japan sent $87,000 (¥10 million) worth of supplies to Micronesia, including 1,000 blankets and 10 electric generators. Two days later, United States President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> declared the island as a disaster area. This was six days after FSM President <a href="Leo%20Falcam">Leo Falcam</a> sent the disaster declaration to the US president, although Falcam had improperly filed the paperwork. Because the FSM is in a <a href="Compact%20of%20Free%20Association">Compact of Free Association</a> and not a <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a>, the <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) could not provide immediate assistance. During the delay, a group of doctors from Guam flew to Chuuk to provide medical assistance. On July 11, the government of Israel sent $5,000 worth of medicine to the FSM. The next day, the <a href="Caritas%20%28charity%29">Caritas</a> charity in Australia sent $20,000 worth of water and food. Residents from elsewhere in the FSM sent clothes and food. The Australian government sent $10,000 to replenish emergency supplies, and the International Red Cross released about $20,000 for immediate relief. The government of China sent $30,000 worth of aid. On July 30, FEMA announced that residents and business owners in Chuuk could apply for individual assistance, including money for housing, repairing damage, and low-interest loans. The declaration would not apply to outer islands in Chuuk, which did not sustain significant damage; this is because FEMA only had funds to restore areas to how they were before the storm. Ultimately, FEMA provided of water, 1,300 blankets, 45,360 km (100,000 lbs) of rice, 11,328 <a href="Meal%2C%20Ready-to-Eat">meals ready to eat</a>, and various other supplies. In total, the agency allocated $10.6 million, mostly in the form of individual assistance that provided money for purchasing lost supplies. FEMA ultimately sent just under $5 million to Chuuk after Chataan, as well as subsequent typhoons <a href="Typhoon%20Pongsona">Pongsona</a> and <a href="2003%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season%23Typhoon%20Lupit%20%28Yoyoy%29">Lupit</a>; however, about $445,000 of the funding was believed to have been misspent due to discrepancies discovered in an audit in 2006.

In the days after the storm, thousands of people on Guam evacuated to the 15 government shelters set up in schools across the island; the total reached 3,947 people on July 10. The governor of Guam declared a state of emergency after the storm, and on July 6 President Bush declared the island a major disaster area; this allocated federal funding to assist in removing debris and other emergency services. A week later, the declaration was extended to include individual assistance for anyone who experienced damage from the storm. The Fena Lake reservoir experienced excess silt deposit after excessive rainfall from Chataan, which prevented water distribution from the facility; on July 19 – fifteen days after the typhoon's landfall – water production resumed. Before the facility reopened, the Guam Waterworks Authority distributed water to the island at differing times of the day to ration the limited supply. However, by a month after the storm, residents were still required to boil water as a precaution. About five days after Chataan struck Guam, <a href="2002%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season%23Typhoon%20Halong%20%28Inday%29">Typhoon Halong</a> affected the island and caused further power outages. Some areas on the island remained without power for over a week, due to electric workers restoring the main transmission lines before fixing individual lines. By July 19, 23% of those who lost power still were without electricity, mostly in outlying areas. By that date, trash collection was restored, and government-opened shelters were closed. Later in July, flooding washed debris from Chataan and clogged two rivers. The oil spill in Apra Harbor was cleaned at three of seven affected locations by August 19. In the months after the storm, tourism decreased further after a decline that began after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. Ultimately, FEMA provided $73 million in assistance to the territory, including $10 million in housing checks to 5,947 people and $6.5 million worth of food stamps for 79,814 people. The agency provided $10 million for debris removal and rebuilding public buildings. In December 2002, Typhoon Pongsona struck Guam and caused additional flooding and damage. On August 7, President George W. Bush also declared Rota to be a <a href="disaster%20area">disaster area</a>, which provided funding for debris removal.

Because of the storm's death toll and damage, the name "Chataan" became retired and was replaced with <a href="Typhoon%20Matmo%20%28disambiguation%29">"Matmo"</a> in 2004. Countries in the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> can request <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">tropical cyclone names</a> to be retired if a storm caused unusually heavy damage. With PAGASA, they retired the name "Gloria" and was replaced with <a href="Typhoon%20Rammasun">"Glenda"</a> in 2006; the agency sought to be apolitical after <a href="Gloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> won a <a href="Hello%20Garci%20scandal">disputed</a> presidential election in 2004.

Rufous-crowned sparrow

The rufous-crowned sparrow ("Aimophila ruficeps") is a small <a href="American%20sparrow">American sparrow</a>. This <a href="passerine">passerine</a> is primarily found across the <a href="Southwestern%20United%20States">Southwestern United States</a> and much of the interior of Mexico, south to the <a href="Trans-Mexican%20Volcanic%20Belt">transverse mountain range</a>, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. Twelve <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are generally recognized, though up to eighteen have been suggested. This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. The crown is <a href="rufous">rufous</a>, and the face and <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black <a href="Cheek">malar</a> streak.

These sparrows feed primarily on seeds in the winter and insects in the spring and summer. The birds are often territorial, with males guarding <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">their territory</a> through song and displays. Flight is awkward for this species, which prefers to hop along the ground for locomotion. They are monogamous and breed during spring. Two to five eggs are laid in the bird's nest, which is cup-shaped and well hidden. Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small <a href="bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a>, while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles. They have been known to live for up to three years, two months. Although the species has been classified as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>, or unthreatened with extinction, some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct.

This bird belongs to the family <a href="Passerellidae">Passerellidae</a>, which consists of the American sparrows. The American sparrows are seed-eating New World birds with conical bills, brown or gray plumage, and distinctive head patterns. Birds in the genus "<a href="Aimophila">Aimophila</a>" tend to be medium-sized at in length, live in arid <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a>, have long bills and tails in proportion to their body size as well as short, rounded wings, and build cup-shaped nests.

The rufous-crowned sparrow was described in 1852 by American ornithologist <a href="John%20Cassin">John Cassin</a> as "<a href="Ammodramus">Ammodramus</a> ruficeps". It has also been described as belonging to the genus "Peucaea", which contains several sparrows in the genus "Aimophila" that share characteristics, such as a larger bill and a patch of yellow under the bend of the wing, that other members of the genus do not. However, splitting the "Peucaea" sparrows into a separate genus is not generally recognized. A 2008 <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis of the genus "Aimophila" divided it into four genera, with the rufous-crowned sparrow and its two closest relatives, the <a href="Oaxaca%20sparrow">Oaxaca sparrow</a> and <a href="rusty%20sparrow">rusty sparrow</a>, being maintained as the genus "Aimophila". In addition, this study suggested that the rufous-crowned sparrow may be more closely related to the brown <a href="towhee">towhee</a>s of the genus "Pipilo" than the other members of the historical genus "Aimophila".

The derivation of the current genus name, "Aimophila", is from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "aimos"/ἀιμος, meaning "thicket", and "-philos"/-φιλος, meaning "loving". The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> is a literal derivation of the common name, derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "rufus", meaning "reddish" or "tawny", and "-ceps", from "caput", meaning "head". The bird is also occasionally referred to colloquially as the rock sparrow because of its preference for rocky slopes.

Twelve subspecies are generally recognized, although sometimes up to eighteen are named.

The other six subspecies that are occasionally recognized are "A. r. extima" and "A. r. pallidissima", which were described by A. R. Phillips in 1966, "A. r. phillipsi", which was described by J.P. Hubbard and Crossin in 1974, and "A. r. duponti", "A. r. laybournae", and "A. r. suttoni", which were described by J.P. Hubbard in 1975.

The rufous-crowned sparrow is a smallish sparrow at in length, with males tending to be larger than females. It ranges from in weight and averages about . It has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. Its <a href="wing">wing</a>s are short, rounded, and brown and lack wingbars, or a line of feathers of a contrasting color in the middle of the bird's wing. The sparrow's tail is long, brown, and rounded. The face and <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> (the area above the eye) are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black streak on each cheek. The <a href="Crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a> ranges from rufous to chestnut, a feature which gives it its common name, and some subspecies have a gray streak running through the center of the crown. The bill is yellow and cone-shaped. The sparrow's throat is white with a dark stripe. Its legs and feet are pink-gray. Both sexes are similar in appearance, but the juvenile rufous-crowned sparrow has a brown crown and numerous streaks on its breast and flanks during the spring and autumn.

The song is a short, fast, bubbling series of "chip" notes that can accelerate near the end, and the calls include a nasal "chur" and a thin "tsi". When threatened or separated from its mate, the sparrow makes a "dear-dear-dear" call.

This bird is found in the southwestern United States and Mexico from sea level up to , though it tends to be found between . It lives in <a href="California">California</a>, southern <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, southern <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, and central <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> south along <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a> and in western Mexico to southern <a href="Puebla">Puebla</a> and <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>. In the <a href="midwestern%20United%20States">midwestern United States</a>, the sparrow is found as far east as a small part of western <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, and also in a small region of northeastern <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, its most northeastern habitat. The range of this species is discontinuous and is made up of many small, isolated populations. The rufous-crowned sparrow is a <a href="bird%20migration">non-migratory</a> species, though the mountain subspecies are known to descend to lower elevations during severe winters. Male sparrows maintain and defend their <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territories</a> throughout the year.

This sparrow is found in open oak woodlands and dry uplands with grassy vegetation and bushes. It is often found near rocky outcroppings. The species is also known from coastal scrublands and <a href="chaparral">chaparral</a> areas. The rufous-crowned sparrow thrives in open areas cleared by burning.

The average territory size of rufous-crowned sparrows in the <a href="chaparral">chaparral</a> of California ranges from to . The density of territories varies by <a href="habitat">habitat</a>, including 2.5 to 5.8 territories per of three- to five-year-old burned chaparral to 3.9 to 6.9 territories for the same amount of coastal scrubland. One pair tends to be supported by a territory, although birds without a mate have been seen sharing a territory with a mated pair.

This sparrow is awkward in flight and primarily uses running and hopping to move. The rufous-crowned sparrow will at times forage in pairs during the breeding season, and in family-sized flocks in late summer and early autumn. During the winter they can occasionally be found in loose <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species foraging flock</a>s.

Predators of adult sparrows include house cats and small raptors like <a href="Cooper%27s%20hawk">Cooper's</a> and <a href="sharp-shinned%20hawk">sharp-shinned hawk</a>s, <a href="American%20kestrel">American kestrel</a>s, and <a href="white-tailed%20kite">white-tailed kite</a>s. The nests may be raided by a range of species including mammals and reptiles such as snakes, though nest predation has not yet been directly observed, and nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of <a href="distraction%20display">displays</a> to distract potential predators; the "rodent run", the "broken wing", and the "tumbling off the bush". Birds adopt a "rodent run" display to distract predators. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out, and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. In the "broken wing" display, the sparrow imitates having a broken wing by dropping one to the ground and hopping away from the nest with one wing dragging, leading the predator away until the bird ceases the act and escapes the predator. The adult rufous-crowned sparrow distracts a nest predator by falling from the top of a bush to attract the predator to itself in the "tumbling off the bush" display.

The longest lifespan recorded for a rufous-crowned sparrow is three years, two months. Two species of <a href="tick">tick</a>, "<a href="Amblyomma%20americanum">Amblyomma americanum</a>" and "<a href="Ixodes%20pacificus">Ixodes pacificus</a>", are known to parasitize the sparrow.

This sparrow feeds primarily on small grass and <a href="forb">forb</a> seeds, fresh grass stems, and tender plant shoots during autumn and winter. During these seasons, insects such as <a href="ant">ant</a>s, <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, <a href="ground%20beetle">ground beetle</a>s, and <a href="scale%20insect">scale insect</a>s as well as <a href="spider">spider</a>s make up a small part of its diet. In the spring and summer, the bird's diet includes a greater quantity and variety of insects.

The rufous-crowned sparrow forages slowly on or near the ground by walking or hopping under shrubs or dense grasses. Though it occasionally forages in weedy areas, it is almost never observed foraging in the open. It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low shrubs. During the breeding season, it gleans its food from grasses and low shrubs. However, normally the species obtains its food by either pecking or less frequently scratching at leaf litter. This bird tends to forage in a small family group and in a limited area.

It is unknown whether this species obtains all of the water it needs from its food or if it must also drink; however, it has been observed both drinking and bathing in pools of water after rain storms.

The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland. Males attract a mate by singing from regular positions at the edge of their territories throughout the <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a>. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head straight out. Males guard their territories year-round.

While it is not known when precisely the breeding season starts, the earliest that a sparrow has been observed carrying nesting material was on March 2 in southern California. The female bird builds a bulky, thick-walled open-cup nest typically on the ground, though occasionally in a low bush up to above it, from dried grasses and rootlets, sometimes with strips of bark, small twigs, and weed stems. Nests are well hidden, as they are built near bushes or tall grasses or overhanging rock with concealing vegetation. Once a sparrow chooses a nesting site, it tends to return to the site for many years. It lays between two and five eggs at a time and typically only raises one brood a year, though some birds in California have been observed raising two or even three broods a year. In case of a nesting failure, replacement clutches may be laid. The eggs are an unmarked, pale bluish-white. Broods of the rufous-crowned sparrow have very occasionally been observed to be <a href="Brood%20parasite">parasitized</a> by the <a href="brown-headed%20cowbird">brown-headed cowbird</a>.

<a href="Avian%20incubation">Incubation</a> of the eggs lasts 11 to 13 days and is performed solely by the female. The hatchlings are naked and quills do not begin to show until the third day. Only females brood the nestlings, though both parents may bring whole insects to their young. When a young rufous-crowned sparrow leaves the nest after eight or nine days, it is still incapable of flight, though it can run through the underbrush; during this time it is still fed by the parents. Juveniles tend to leave their parent's territory and move into adjacent habitat in autumn or early winter. Reproductive success varies strongly with annual rainfall and is highest in wet <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o-Southern%20Oscillation">El Niño</a> years, since cool rainy weather reduces the activity of snakes, the main predator of the sparrow's nests.

The rufous-crowned sparrow is treated as a species of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>, or not threatened with extinction, by <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> due to its large geographical range of about , estimated population of 2.4 million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed and those that do produce fewer offspring. Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number. The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: "A. r. sanctorum" of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct, and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s. Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region. Additionally, the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide <a href="warfarin">warfarin</a>, though more research is needed to determine the effects of pesticides on the rufous-crowned sparrow.

Typhoon Omar

Typhoon Omar of 1992, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Lusing, was the strongest and costliest <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a> to strike <a href="Guam">Guam</a> since <a href="Typhoon%20Pamela%20%281976%29">Typhoon Pamela</a> in 1976. The <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a> formed on August 23 from the <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> across the western <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Moving westward, Omar slowly intensified into a <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a>, although another tropical cyclone nearby initially impeded further strengthening. After the two storms became more distant, Omar quickly strengthened into a powerful typhoon. On August 28, it made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on Guam with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). The typhoon reached its peak intensity the next day, with estimated 1‑minute winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), making it a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Western%20Pacific">"super typhoon"</a> according to the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC). Omar weakened significantly before striking eastern <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> on September 4, proceeding into eastern China the next day and dissipating on September 9.

On Guam, Omar caused one death and $457 million (1992 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>) in damage. Strong gusts up to 248 km/h (154 mph) left nearly the entire island without power for several days. The outages disrupted the water system and prevented the island-based JTWC from issuing advisories for 11 days. Omar damaged or destroyed 2,158 houses, leaving 3,000 people homeless. In response to the destruction, the island's building codes were updated to withstand winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), and insurance companies discontinued new policies for structures not made of concrete. While passing well north of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, the typhoon killed 11 people and wrought ₱903 million ($35.4 million) worth of damage to 538 houses. Omar then brushed the southern islands of Japan with strong gusts and light rainfall, causing ¥476 million <a href="Japanese%20Yen">JPY</a> ($3.8 million USD) in crop losses. In <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, scattered flooding caused three deaths and $65 million in damage, mostly to agriculture.

Typhoon Omar originated from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on August 20 over the open <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, which exhibited persistent <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a>, or thunderstorms. During this early phase, two <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>s dissipated and another became <a href="extratropical%20cyclone%23extratropical%20transition">extratropical</a> across the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20basins%23Northwestern%20Pacific%20Ocean">western Pacific basin</a>; this caused the <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a>, which spawned most of the storms in the basin, to realign in a more climatologically appropriate manner. According to the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA), Omar developed into a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> at 1800 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on August 23. The <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) assessed a slower pace of strengthening, issuing a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20formation%20alert">tropical cyclone formation alert</a> at 2100 UTC before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 15W on August 24.

As the depression traveled generally westward, the JTWC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Omar on August 25, and the JMA followed suit on the next day. Omar began to slow as it tracked westward. <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">Outflow</a> from nearby <a href="1992%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season%23Severe%20Tropical%20Storm%20Polly%20.28Isang.29">Tropical Storm Polly</a> to the west produced a stream of strong <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> over Omar, slowing intensification. The JTWC noted that the shear could decouple Omar's wind circulation from its convection, possibly weakening the storm. However, as Omar and Polly moved farther apart, a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">high-pressure ridge</a> developed between the storms. This caused Omar to drift northward and then west-northwestward into a region with decreased shear, which allowed it to resume strengthening. Early on August 27, the JTWC upgraded the system to a typhoon, and an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> began to appear around 23:00 UTC that day. Omar entered a phase of <a href="Rapid%20deepening">rapid intensification</a> on August 28, at which point the JMA also classified it as a typhoon. The typhoon made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on <a href="Guam">Guam</a> soon after, with 1‑minute <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained winds</a> of about 195 km/h (120 mph). The eye, 37 km (23 mi) in diameter, slowly crossed the northern portion of the small island over a period of 2.5 hours.

At 1800 UTC on August 29, Omar reached its peak intensity with 10‑minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a minimum <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of 920 <a href="bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 27.17 <a href="inches%20of%20mercury">inHg</a>) as estimated by the JMA; this intensity was maintained for 24 hours before a steady weakening trend began. The JTWC estimated higher 1‑minute winds of around 240 km/h (150 mph), making Omar a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Western%20Pacific">super typhoon</a>. Two days later, the typhoon came close enough to the Philippines to warrant monitoring from <a href="PAGASA">PAGASA</a>, who named the storm "Lusing". By 1500 UTC on September 3, the JMA downgraded Omar to a tropical storm, although the JTWC maintained its typhoon intensity through the next day. Heading generally westward, the storm made landfall on the east coast of <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> near <a href="Hualien%20City">Hualien City</a> on September 4. After traversing the island in seven hours, Omar exited the coast of <a href="Yunlin%20County">Yunlin County</a> and emerged into the <a href="Taiwan%20Strait">Taiwan Strait</a>. The storm crossed the body of water and moved ashore in eastern China near <a href="Xiamen">Xiamen</a>, <a href="Fujian">Fujian</a>, on September 5. Inland, Omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west-southwest. It proceeded across southern China while heavily weakening, and completely dissipated over northern <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> on September 9.
Ahead of the storm on August 25, the United States <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> set the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Tropical%20Cyclone%20Condition%20of%20Readiness">Condition of Readiness</a> (COR) at stage 3 on Guam, indicating destructive winds were possible within 48 hours. A day later, the COR was raised to stage 2; all but two <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> ships were <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d from the harbor to prevent damage, and the remainder rode out the storm southwest of Guam. On August 28, COR 1 was declared, the highest level. In response, all <a href="fixed-wing%20aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a> and helicopters on the island were moved into hangars or transported to Japan or the Philippines. All schools were closed for the duration of Omar's passage over Guam. Flight operations were suspended for at least two days, stranding 5,000 passengers on the island. About 3,100 people rode out the storm in emergency shelters.

Omar was the strongest and most damaging typhoon to hit Guam since <a href="Typhoon%20Pamela%20%281976%29">Typhoon Pamela</a> in <a href="1976%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season">1976</a>. The typhoon was felt on all parts of Guam; tropical-storm-force winds affected the island for 16 hours, and wind gusts were estimated to have reached 248 km/h (154 mph) in areas beneath the western eyewall. However, the high winds caused the <a href="anemometer">anemometer</a> at <a href="Hag%C3%A5t%C3%B1a%2C%20Guam">Hagåtña</a> to fail during the eye's passage, and the radar at <a href="Andersen%20Air%20Force%20Base">Andersen Air Force Base</a> was lost, preventing accurate wind speed assessments. The lowest barometric pressure was at <a href="Apra%20Harbor">Apra Harbor</a>. Omar's slow movement resulted in prolonged heavy rainfall, peaking at at the Guam National Weather Service Office in Tiyan and reaching 417 mm (16.41 in) at Andersen AFB.

Damage on Guam was heaviest from the central region to the northern coast, in particular to tourist areas and military bases. The <a href="Naval%20Computer%20and%20Telecommunications%20Area%20Master%20Station%20Pacific">Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station</a> was shut down due to power outages and water damage to the generators. Two US Navy ships, the USS Niagara Falls (AFS-3) and the <a href="USS%20White%20Plains%20%28AFS-4%29">USS White Plains (AFS-4)</a>—both naval supply ships—went aground due to rough seas and strong winds, and the <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> at Apra Harbor was washed ashore. Omar destroyed dozens of businesses on the island. High winds knocked a crane into an apartment building and downed 400 wooden and 20 concrete power poles across <a href="Tumon">Tumon</a>, leaving 70% of the island without power. Throughout Guam, Omar disrupted transportation and communication systems, and led to the failure of water pumping systems. Landslides covered roads, and low-lying areas were flooded. About 2,000 homes were destroyed and another 2,200 were damaged to varying degrees, displacing nearly 3,000 people. Destruction was heaviest to wooden structures; buildings made of concrete fared relatively well during the storm. Island-wide, damage totaled $457 million, split nearly evenly between the military bases and civilian damage. One person died on Guam, and more than 200 people required emergency treatment—including about 80 injured by flying debris.

While over the open Pacific Ocean, Omar passed well northeast of the Philippines just days after Tropical Storm Polly caused flooding and deaths in the country. The nation's chief weather specialist noted that Omar was "more powerful than Polly and [able to] induce <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> rains over a wide area." Omar ultimately affected northern <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a>, primarily the <a href="Cordillera%20Administrative%20Region">Cordillera Administrative Region</a>, <a href="Ilocos%20Region">Ilocos Region</a>, and the <a href="Cagayan%20Valley">Cagayan Valley</a>. Across the country, the storm killed 11 people. The typhoon destroyed 393 houses and damaged another 145, leaving 1,965 people homeless. Damage was estimated at ₱903 million ($35.4 million), much of it to agriculture.

After its destructive landfall in Guam, Omar struck <a href="Wuqi%20District">Wuqi District</a> in Taiwan with maximum winds of 78 km/h (49 mph). The worst effects in the country were from widespread rain; the strongest rainfall rates remained concentrated in southern regions, peaking at in <a href="Kaohsiung">Kaohsiung</a>. The storm flooded five <a href="County%20%28Taiwan%29">counties</a> and left 766,000 people without power. High waves washed ashore four ships in Kaohsiung, and farmland and fisheries there, as well as in <a href="Yunlin%20County">Yunlin</a>, <a href="Chiayi%20City">Chiayi City</a>, and <a href="Pingtung%20County">Pingtung County</a>, suffered heavy damage. Throughout Taiwan, Omar resulted in three deaths (two of which drownings), twelve injuries, and more than $65 million (USD) in damage.

The fringes of the typhoon dropped light rainfall in the outer regions of <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, peaking at on <a href="Iriomote-jima">Iriomote-jima</a>. The highest wind gust was 72 km/h (45 mph) on <a href="Yonaguni">Yonaguni</a>. Omar damaged the sugar cane and okra in the southern Japanese islands, leading to crop losses of ¥476 million <a href="Japanese%20Yen">JPY</a> ($3.8 million USD). In addition, traffic was disrupted and 38 flights were canceled. Later, Omar spread rainfall along its path through southern China, flooding parts of northwestern <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> on September 7.

Immediately after Omar's landfall in Guam, former Governor <a href="Joseph%20Franklin%20Ada">Joseph Franklin Ada</a> declared a state of emergency, and former U.S. President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> declared the island a federal <a href="disaster%20area">disaster area</a>. In the wake of the storm, several people were arrested for looting. The <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> opened up disaster assistance centers where residents were able to apply for federal aid; it ultimately provided about $18.4 million in assistance, including disaster housing, storm-related unemployment benefits, and grant programs for families or businesses, helping over 11,000 people. The federal government paid for 100% of the debris removal, emergency work, and reconstruction of uninsured public buildings, although it usually only provides 75% of the cost for typical disasters. This was due to the sequence of three significant tropical cyclones affecting the United States in three weeks; in addition to Omar, <a href="Hurricane%20Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a> struck Florida in August and <a href="Hurricane%20Iniki">Hurricane Iniki</a> hit Hawaii in September. The Department of Defense assisted the affected areas with 27 members of the <a href="Guam%20National%20Guard">Guam National Guard</a> and 700 members of the military. The military provided temporary housing, generators, and construction supplies, at a cost of $5.75 million, though most of the disaster needs were handled by the government. The local <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> provided $6 million in assistance after the storm. Due to the combined damages from Andrew, Iniki, and Omar, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> passed the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1992, which provided additional funding for the agencies responding to the disasters through the fiscal year ending on September 30.

For 11 days, the JTWC on Guam was unable to continue operations, relying on a backup agency. The damage to the airport radar prompted the <a href="NEXRAD">NEXRAD</a>—a network of high-resolution weather radars—to be installed earlier than scheduled, in February 1993, and limited incoming and outgoing flights to the daytime. On August 30, a naval ship docked at Apra Harbor to provide a temporary mobile radar. By September 15, both ships that had been washed ashore were refloated. In the aftermath of the destruction, insurance companies decided to stop issuing new policies for structures not made of concrete. In January 1996, former Governor <a href="Carl%20Gutierrez">Carl Gutierrez</a> issued an executive order, mandating that homes or <a href="hurricane%20shutter">storm shutters</a> on the island withstand winds of at least 250 m/h (155 mph).

The citizens left homeless by Omar resided in a <a href="tent%20city">tent city</a> nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200 tents holding more than 1,000 people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by three days after the storm. The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and most businesses resumed their work by the end of the month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and <a href="Typhoon%20Gay%20%281992%29">Typhoon Gay</a> in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal "<a href="Depression%20and%20Anxiety">Anxiety</a>" found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed <a href="acute%20stress%20reaction">acute stress reaction</a>, and another 15% developed early traumatic stress response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a>, similar to the levels shown after <a href="Hurricane%20Hugo">Hurricane Hugo</a> in 1989.

Due to the destruction in Guam, the name "Omar" was retired and was replaced with "Oscar" in 1993.

2005 Qeshm earthquake

The 2005 Qeshm earthquake occurred on November 27 at 13:52 <a href="Iran%20Standard%20Time">IRST</a> (10:22 <a href="UTC">UTC</a>) on the sparsely populated <a href="Qeshm">Qeshm Island</a> off <a href="Southern%20Iran">Southern Iran</a>, killing 13 people and devastating 13 villages. It was Iran's second major <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> of 2005, following that at <a href="2005%20Zarand%20earthquake">Zarand</a> in February. The <a href="epicenter">epicenter</a> was about south of <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, close to Iran's southern borders. Initial measurements showed that the earthquake registered about 6.0 on the <a href="moment%20magnitude%20scale">moment magnitude scale</a>, although that was reduced to 5.8 after further analysis. More than 400 minor <a href="aftershock">aftershock</a>s followed the main quake, 36 of which were greater than magnitude 2.5. The earthquake occurred in a remote area during the middle of the day, limiting the number of fatalities. Iranian relief efforts were effective and largely adequate, leading the country to decline offers of support from other nations and <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>.

Qeshm Island is part of the Simply Folded Belt, the most seismically active part of the <a href="Zagros%20fold%20and%20thrust%20belt">Zagros fold and thrust belt</a>. Similar to most earthquakes in the area, the 2005 event resulted from <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Dip-slip%20faults">reverse slip faulting</a>. Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is a high risk of destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are attributable to earthquakes. One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern.

Iran experiences at least one minor earthquake per day on average, and the Zagros region is particularly prone to seismic activity. During the last 100 years, Iran has been hit by more than 130 events stronger than magnitude 5, with damaging earthquakes near Qeshm recorded in 1360, 1703, 1884, 1897, 1902, and 1905. The majority of Iranian quakes occur in the upper <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a>, close to the surface, which means that they are potentially more destructive.

In terms of <a href="earthquake%20engineering">earthquake protection</a>, Iran was named the "worst offender" in 2004 by Professor Roger Bilham of the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a>. Bilham, a <a href="geophysicist">geophysicist</a> who specializes in earthquake-related deformation and hazards, blames construction practices for many of the deaths in Iranian earthquakes. Since the start of the 20th century 1 in 3,000 Iranians have died in earthquake-related incidents. The United Nations' Common Country Assessment for Iran states that the greatest damage occurs in rural areas, for which no building code exists. Large cities have a building code that takes account of the seismic hazard, but it is not rigorously followed, despite the susceptibility of three quarters of Iranian major cities to damaging earthquakes. The risk posed by poor engineering is of significant concern to the populace and an impediment to economic development. The <a href="1990%20Manjil%E2%80%93Rudbar%20earthquake">1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake</a>, with at least 42,000 fatalities, cost Iran roughly 7.2 percent of its <a href="Gross%20National%20Product">Gross National Product</a> (GNP) for that year, and wiped out two years of economic growth.

Iran lies within the complex zone of <a href="continental%20collision">collision</a> between the <a href="Arabian%20Plate">Arabian Plate</a> and the <a href="Eurasian%20Plate">Eurasian Plate</a>; near Qeshm the rate of convergence is about 25 millimeters annually. Part of this convergence is accommodated by <a href="Thrust%20tectonics">crustal shortening and thickening</a> within the Zagros fold and thrust belt, with the remainder occurring to the north of the <a href="Iranian%20Plateau">Iranian Plateau</a>. The most active part of the Zagros is the Simply Folded Belt, which is characterised by large <a href="Fold%20%28geology%29">folds</a> formed above a layer of late <a href="Neoproterozoic">Neoproterozoic</a> to <a href="Early%20Cambrian">Early Cambrian</a> <a href="Hormuz%20Formation">Hormuz</a> <a href="halite">salt</a>, which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some <a href="anticline">anticline</a>s as <a href="salt%20diapir">salt diapir</a>s. The sequence of <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s above the salt layer comprises a basal <a href="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> <a href="Conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerate</a> beneath a thick sequence of <a href="limestone">limestone</a>s of <a href="Palaeozoic">Palaeozoic</a> to <a href="Upper%20Cretaceous">late Cretaceous</a> age, known together as the "<a href="Competence%20%28geology%29">Competent</a> <a href="Group%20%28stratigraphy%29">Group</a>" owing to their relatively high <a href="Strength%20of%20materials">mechanical strength</a>, overlain by a sequence of weaker <a href="marl">marl</a>s and <a href="Interbedding">interbedded</a> limestones of latest Cretaceous to early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> age, topped by <a href="Neogene">Neogene</a> <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>s and conglomerates. There is evidence of intermediate level <a href="decollement">detachment</a> at some of the weaker layers, which means that folds at different <a href="Stratigraphy">stratigraphic</a> levels may have different locations, orientations, or <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a>s. Measurements of earthquake <a href="focal%20mechanism">focal mechanism</a>s and <a href="Hypocenter">hypocentral</a> depths show that shortening is accommodated by a mixture of high-angle and low-angle <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Dip-slip%20faults">reverse faulting</a>, within either the lowest part of the sedimentary cover or in the <a href="Basement%20%28geology%29">basement</a> beneath the Hormuz salt.

The island of Qeshm is elongated WSW–ENE, parallel to the coastline and the regional trend of the main fold axes. Neogene sedimentary rocks outcrop at the surface over the whole island, apart from a diapir of older Hormuz salt that pierces through to the surface at its western end. The sediments are affected by a series of large, mainly anticlinal folds that show a variety of trends in the central part of the island. The axis of the Laft anticline runs mainly NW–SE, while the Salakh anticline trends roughly W–E and the Suza anticline and Ramkan <a href="syncline">syncline</a> trend SW–NE. The island shows clear evidence of recent uplift in the form of <a href="marine%20terrace">marine terrace</a>s, with the highest terrace identified at above sea level. An uplift rate of 0.2 millimeters annually has been estimated from <a href="Uranium-thorium%20dating">uranium series dating</a> (<a href="Thorium">Th</a>/<a href="Uranium">U</a>) of <a href="aragonite">aragonite</a> from <a href="coral">coral</a>s on the terraces.

The earthquake was initially measured at 6.0 on the <a href="moment%20magnitude%20scale">moment magnitude scale</a>, although later analysis suggests a slightly lower value of 5.8. The <a href="epicenter">epicenter</a> was near the village of <a href="Gavarzin">Gavarzin</a> in central Qeshm, and a <a href="hypocentre">hypocentral</a> depth of was estimated. The focal mechanism derived for the earthquake indicates that it was the result of reverse faulting on a fault plane <a href="Strike%20and%20dip">dipping</a> either to the north at 50° or to the south-southeast at 40°. No evidence has been found of surface faulting, but a 3-kilometer-long (2 mi) set of <a href="Bed%20%28geology%29">bedding</a>-parallel cracks was observed on the northwestern flank of the Ramkan syncline, interpreted as representing probable <a href="Fold%20%28geology%29%23Flexural%20slip">slip along bedding planes</a>, possibly due to further tightening of this fold. Other NW–SE trending tensional cracks observed further southwest along the syncline are more likely to be due to salt movement at depth.

Surface displacement during the earthquake was measured using <a href="Interferometric%20synthetic%20aperture%20radar">SAR interferometry</a>. The computed area of uplift is elongated W-E, with a maximum value of about centered over the eastern end of the Latif anticline. A smaller area of subsidence was observed to the south of the uplifted area, and the lack of a sharp boundary between the two suggests that the fault does not come to the surface. The pattern of displacement is consistent with a north-dipping fault rupturing between about and in depth, which also provides a good match to the results of <a href="Synthetic%20seismogram%23Source%20modelling">seismic modeling</a> using <a href="Seismic%20wave%23Body%20waves">body waves</a>, although a SSE-dipping plane remains possible. This depth range strongly suggests that the fault affected the lower part of the sedimentary cover, while not ruling out some basement involvement. The mismatch between the orientation of the fault planes that caused the earthquake and the observed surface folds suggests that deformation at these two levels is decoupled by the presence of a detachment, possibly within marl layers.

Most aftershocks occurred at significantly greater depths than the mainshock and are dominated by <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Strike-slip%20faults">strike-slip</a> focal mechanisms. This suggests that the mainshock triggered later movement on a complex set of right and left lateral strike-slip faults within the basement, together accommodating north-south shortening beneath the Hormuz salt layer.

On September 10, 2008, there was another <a href="2008%20Qeshm%20earthquake">major earthquake on Qeshm</a>, with a magnitude of 5.9 and hypocentral depth of . The pattern of uplift observed for this earthquake is also consistent with rupturing within the lower sedimentary sequence, but on a fault with two segments, dipping overall to the southeast. The earthquakes of 2005 and 2008 may have ruptured adjacent segments of the same southeast-dipping reverse fault. Seven deaths were reported as a result of the 2008 earthquake.

The earthquake hit at 13:52:19 <a href="IRST">IRST</a>, or 1:52 pm (10:22:19 UTC), and lasted between 10 and 30 seconds. It killed 13 people and injured 100 on Qeshm Island. In <a href="Zirang">Zirang</a> (Ziranag), a village on Qeshm, 80 percent of the buildings were demolished. Seven villages experienced extensive damage, and 13 villages were destroyed: <a href="Tonban">Tonban</a>, <a href="Ramekan">Ramekan</a>, <a href="Gevarzin">Gevarzin</a>, <a href="Khaledeyn%2C%20Hormozgan">Khaledin</a>, <a href="Direstan">Direstan</a>, <a href="Kushah%2C%20Hormozgan">Kushe</a>, <a href="Karavan%2C%20Iran">Karavan</a>, <a href="Turyan%2C%20Iran">Turyan</a>, <a href="Tomsenati">Tom senati</a>, <a href="Gorbehdan">Gorbehdan</a>, Ziranag, <a href="Giahdan">Giahdan</a>, and Gourian. There were reports of intensity III effects on the <a href="Mercalli%20intensity%20scale">Mercalli scale</a> from <a href="Bandar%20Abbas">Bandar Abbas</a>, <a href="Abu%20Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>, <a href="Ajman">Ajman</a>, <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a>, <a href="Fujairah">Fujairah</a> and <a href="Ras%20al-Khaimah">Ras al-Khaimah</a>; Intensity IV ("Light") effects occurred at <a href="Sharjah%20%28emirate%29">Sharjah</a>. <a href="Quake%20%28natural%20phenomenon%29">Shaking</a> from the earthquake was also noted in <a href="Oman">Oman</a>. No major damage occurred directly at the epicenter; residents of <a href="Qeshm%2C%20Iran">Qeshm</a> reported that the shaking smashed windows, leading citizens to evacuate their homes fearing collapse. In total more than 2,000 people were affected.

One major hospital damaged by the earthquake was inundated with the injured and lacked medical supplies for treatment. An airport on the epicentral island sustained damage, and power lines on the island were severed. The director of <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>'s seismological building dismissed fears of a tsunami, saying that the Persian Gulf was not deep enough to allow for one. In one school, some people suffered broken legs when the building collapsed, but there were no fatalities. Buildings in Dubai, including the <a href="Emirates%20Towers">Emirates Towers</a>, were evacuated because of concerns that the structures might collapse, but no such incidents occurred. One woman described the locals as "panicked". Television stations throughout Iran released footage of quake damage and of injured residents being taken to hospitals.

A <a href="landslide">landslide</a> and 36 major <a href="aftershock">aftershock</a>s of more than magnitude 2.5 (in total, 400 aftershocks) followed the earthquake. A former <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese</a> fortress, built by Admiral <a href="Afonso%20de%20Albuquerque">Afonso de Albuquerque</a> in 1507, sustained heavy damage to its eastern wall but otherwise remained intact.

If the earthquake had occurred during the early morning while residents were asleep, rather than mid-afternoon (1:52 pm local time), it could have been deadlier as housing in the epicentral area consisted chiefly of mud and brick.

Aid workers from the domestic region began delivering supplies such as food, blankets, and tents. A dispatch of 101 relief helpers, 40 IRCS staff, and four people from the public relations department at <a href="ReliefWeb">ReliefWeb</a> also assisted survivors. Three ambulances, 46 trucks, three helicopters, 12 vans, nine cars, two minibuses, and two <a href="detection%20dog">sniffer dog</a>s were also dispatched to help citizens of quake-struck areas.

Injured residents were transported to Bandar Abbas by helicopter. An Iranian police official, citing concerns about possible <a href="looting">looting</a>, said all movement into and out of damaged houses would require prior approval from the governor's office, the police, and the Unexpected Events Committee on the island. <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> offered assistance to Iran, and the official in charge of response stated: "we are preparing to respond if needed". They elaborated that the Iranian authorities "appeared to have things under control".

In 2007, the Asian Centre on Seismic Risk Reduction was formed in response to the regular earthquakes experienced in south, west, and central Asia, to "encourage regional and inter-regional networking and partnerships to reduce seismic damage". Earthquakes account for 73 percent of natural disaster deaths in these locations.

Ion Heliade Rădulescu

Ion Heliade Rădulescu or Ion Heliade (also known as "Eliad"e or "Eliade Rădulescu"; ; January 6, 1802 – April 27, 1872) was a <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>n, later <a href="Romania">Romania</a>n academic, <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> and <a href="Classicism">Classicist</a> poet, essayist, memoirist, short story writer, newspaper editor and politician. A prolific translator of foreign literature into <a href="Romanian%20language">Romanian</a>, he was also the author of books on <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a> and history. For much of his life, Heliade Rădulescu was a teacher at <a href="Saint%20Sava%20College">Saint Sava College</a> in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, which he helped reopen. He was a founding member and first president of the <a href="Romanian%20Academy">Romanian Academy</a>.

Heliade Rădulescu is considered one of the foremost champions of <a href="Romanian%20culture">Romanian culture</a> from the first half of the 19th century, having first risen to prominence through his association with <a href="Gheorghe%20Laz%C4%83r">Gheorghe Lazăr</a> and his support of Lazăr's drive for discontinuing education in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>. Over the following decades, he had a major role in shaping the modern Romanian language, but caused controversy when he advocated the massive introduction of <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> <a href="neologism">neologism</a>s into the <a href="Romanian%20lexis">Romanian lexis</a>. A <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">Romantic nationalist</a> landowner siding with moderate <a href="Liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Romania">liberals</a>, Heliade was among the leaders of the <a href="1848%20Wallachian%20revolution">1848 Wallachian revolution</a>, after which he was forced to spend several years in exile. Adopting an original form of conservatism, which emphasized the role of the aristocratic <a href="boyar">boyar</a>s in <a href="History%20of%20Romania">Romanian history</a>, he was rewarded for supporting the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and clashed with the <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> wing of the 1848 revolutionaries.

Heliade Rădulescu was born in <a href="T%C3%A2rgovi%C5%9Fte">Târgovişte</a>, the son of Ilie Rădulescu, a wealthy proprietor who served as the leader of a patrol unit during the 1810s, and Eufrosina Danielopol, who had been educated in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>. Three of his siblings died of <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> before 1829. Throughout his early youth, Ion was the focus of his parents' affectionate supervision: early on, Ilie Rădulescu purchased a house once owned by the scholar <a href="Gheorghe%20Laz%C4%83r">Gheorghe Lazăr</a> on the outskirts of <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> (near <a href="Obor">Obor</a>), as a gift for his son. At the time, the Rădulescus were owners of a large garden in the Bucharest area, nearby <a href="Her%C4%83str%C4%83u%20Park">Herăstrău</a>, as well as of estates in the vicinity of <a href="F%C4%83g%C4%83ra%C5%9F">Făgăraş</a> and <a href="G%C3%A2rbovi">Gârbovi</a>.

After basic education in Greek with a <a href="tutor">tutor</a> known as Alexe, Ion Heliade Rădulescu taught himself reading in <a href="Romanian%20Cyrillic%20alphabet">Romanian Cyrillic</a> (reportedly by studying the "<a href="Alexander%20Romance">Alexander Romance</a>" with the help of his father's <a href="Oltenia">Oltenia</a>n servants). He subsequently became an avid reader of popular novels, especially during his 1813 sojourn in Gârbovi (where he had been sent after other areas of the country came to be ravaged by "<a href="Caragea%27s%20plague">Caragea's plague</a>"). After 1813, the teenaged Rădulescu was a pupil of the <a href="Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> monk <a href="Naum%20R%C3%A2mniceanu">Naum Râmniceanu</a>; in 1815, he moved on to the Greek school at <a href="Schitu%20M%C4%83gureanu">Schitu Măgureanu</a>, in Bucharest, and, in 1818, to the <a href="Saint%20Sava%20College">Saint Sava School</a>, where he studied under Gheorghe Lazăr's supervision.
Between his 1820 graduation and 1821, when effects of the <a href="Wallachian%20uprising%20of%201821">Wallachian uprising</a> led to the School ceasing its activities, he was kept as Lazăr's assistant teacher, tutoring in <a href="arithmetics">arithmetics</a> and <a href="geometry">geometry</a>. It was during those years that he adopted the surname "Heliade" (also rendered "Heliad", "Eliad" or "Eliade"), which, he later explained, was a Greek version of his <a href="patronymic">patronymic</a>, in turn stemming from the Romanian version of "<a href="Elijah">Elijah</a>".

In 1822, after Gheorghe Lazăr had fallen ill, Heliade reopened Saint Sava and served as its main teacher (initially, without any form of remuneration). He was later joined in this effort by other <a href="intellectual">intellectual</a>s of the day, such as <a href="Eufrosin%20Poteca">Eufrosin Poteca</a>, and, eventually, also opened an art class overseen by the <a href="Croats">Croat</a> <a href="Carol%20Val%C5%9Ftain">Carol Valştain</a>. This re-establishment came as a result of ordinances issued by <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia">Prince</a> <a href="Grigore%20IV%20Ghica">Grigore IV Ghica</a>, who had just been assigned by the Ottoman Empire to the throne of Wallachia upon the disestablishment of <a href="Phanariotes">Phanariote</a> rule, encouraging the marginalization of <a href="Greeks%20in%20Romania">ethnic Greeks</a> who had assumed public office in previous decades. Thus, Prince Ghica had endorsed education in Romanian and, in one of his official "<a href="firman%20%28decree%29">firmans</a>", defined teaching in Greek as "the foundation of evils" ("temelia răutăţilor").

During the late 1820s, Heliade became involved in cultural policies. In 1827, he and <a href="Dinicu%20Golescu">Dinicu Golescu</a> founded "Soţietatea literară românească" (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a college, the opening of another such institution in <a href="Craiova">Craiova</a>, and the creation of schools in virtually all Wallachian localities. In addition, "Soţietatea" attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling for an end to the state monopoly on <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a>es. The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's <a href="Calea%20Victoriei">Podul Mogoşoaiei</a>, benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, <a href="Gheorghe%20Bibescu">Gheorghe Bibescu</a> and <a href="Barbu%20Dimitrie%20%C5%9Etirbei">Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei</a>. Its character was based on <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>; around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.

In 1828, Heliade published his first work, an essay on <a href="Romanian%20grammar">Romanian grammar</a>, in the <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>n city of <a href="Sibiu">Hermannstadt</a> (which was part of the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a> at the time), and, on April 20, 1829, began printing the Bucharest-based paper "<a href="Curierul%20Rom%C3%A2nesc">Curierul Românesc</a>". This was the most successful of several attempts to create a local newspaper, something Golescu first attempted in 1828. Publishing articles in both Romanian and French, "Curierul Românesc" had, starting in 1836, its own literary supplement, under the title of "<a href="Curier%20de%20Ambe%20Sexe">Curier de Ambe Sexe</a>"; in print until 1847, it notably published one of Heliade's most famous poems, "<a href="Zbur%C4%83torul">Zburătorul</a>". "Curierul Românesc" was edited as a weekly, and later as a bimonthly, until 1839, when it began to be issued three or four times a week. Its best-known contributors were Heliade himself, <a href="Grigore%20Alexandrescu">Grigore Alexandrescu</a>, <a href="Costache%20Negruzzi">Costache Negruzzi</a>, <a href="Dimitrie%20Bolintineanu">Dimitrie Bolintineanu</a>, <a href="Ioan%20Catina">Ioan Catina</a>, <a href="Vasile%20C%C3%A2rlova">Vasile Cârlova</a>, and <a href="Iancu%20V%C4%83c%C4%83rescu">Iancu Văcărescu</a>.

In 1823, Heliade met Maria Alexandrescu, with whom he fell passionately in love, and whom he later married. By 1830, the Heliades' two children, a son named Virgiliu and a daughter named Virgilia, died in infancy; subsequently, their marriage entered a long period of crisis, marked by Maria's frequent outbursts of jealousy. Ion Heliade probably had a number of extramarital affairs: a <a href="Wallachian%20military%20forces">Wallachian Militia</a> officer named Zalic, who became known during the 1840s, is thought by some, including the literary critic <a href="George%20C%C4%83linescu">George Călinescu</a>, to have been the writer's illegitimate son. Before the death of her first child, Maria Heliade welcomed into her house Grigore Alexandrescu, himself a celebrated writer, whom Ion suspected had become her lover. Consequently, the two authors became bitter rivals: Ion Heliade referred to Alexandrescu as "that ingrate", and, in an 1838 letter to <a href="George%20Bari%C5%A3">George Bariţ</a>, downplayed his poetry and character (believing that, in one of his <a href="fable">fable</a>s, Alexandrescu had depicted himself as a <a href="nightingale">nightingale</a>, he commented that, in reality, he was "a piteous <a href="Rook%20%28bird%29">rook</a> dressed in foreign feathers"). Despite these household conflicts, Maria Heliade gave birth to five other children, four daughters and one son (Ion, born 1846).

In October 1830, together with his uncle Nicolae Rădulescu, he opened the first privately owned printing press in his country, operating on his property at "Cişmeaua Mavrogheni", in <a href="Obor">Obor</a> (the land went by the name of "Câmpul lui Eliad"—"Eliad's Field", and housed several other large buildings). Among the first works he published was a collection of poems by <a href="Alphonse%20de%20Lamartine">Alphonse de Lamartine</a>, translated by Heliade from French, and grouped together with some of his own poems. Later, he translated a textbook on <a href="Meter%20%28poetry%29">meter</a> and <a href="Louis-Benjamin%20Francoeur">Louis-Benjamin Francoeur</a>'s standard manual of "Arithmetics", as well as works by <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> authors—<a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>'s "<a href="Mahomet%20%28play%29">Mahomet, ou le fanatisme</a>", and stories by <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Marmontel">Jean-François Marmontel</a>. They were followed, in 1839, by a version of <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s "<a href="Julie%2C%20or%20the%20New%20Heloise">Julie, or the New Heloise</a>".

Heliade began a career as a <a href="Civil%20service">civil servant</a> after the "<a href="Postelnic">Postelnic</a>ie" commissioned him to print the "<a href="Monitorul%20Oficial">Official Bulletin</a>", and later climbed through the <a href="Historical%20Romanian%20ranks%20and%20titles">official hierarchy</a>, eventually serving as "<a href="Clucer">Clucer</a>". This rise coincided with the establishment of the "<a href="Regulamentul%20Organic">Regulamentul Organic</a>" regime, inaugurated, upon the end of the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281828-1829%29">Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829</a>, by an <a href="Russian%20Empire">Imperial Russian</a> administration under <a href="Pavel%20Kiselyov">Pavel Kiselyov</a>. When Kiselyov placed an order with Heliade for the printing of official documents, including the "Regulament", the writer and his family were made prosperous by the sales. Nevertheless, Heliade maintained contacts with the faction of reformist <a href="boyar">boyar</a>s: in 1833, together with <a href="Ion%20C%C3%A2mpineanu">Ion Câmpineanu</a>, <a href="Iancu%20V%C4%83c%C4%83rescu">Iancu Văcărescu</a>, <a href="Ioan%20Voinescu%20II">Ioan Voinescu II</a>, <a href="Constantin%20Aristia">Constantin Aristia</a>, <a href="%C5%9Etefan%20Golescu">Ştefan</a> and <a href="Nicolae%20Golescu">Nicolae Golescu</a>, as well as others, he founded the short-lived "Soţietatea Filarmonică" (the Philharmonic Society), which advanced a cultural agenda (and was especially active in raising funds for the <a href="National%20Theatre%20Bucharest">National Theater of Wallachia</a>). Aside from its stated cultural goals, "Soţietatea Filarmonică" continued a covert political activity.

In 1834, when <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia">Prince</a> <a href="Alexandru%20II%20Ghica">Alexandru II Ghica</a> came to the throne, Heliade became one of his close collaborators, styling himself "court poet". Several of the poems and discourses he authored during the period are written as <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a>s, and dedicated to Ghica, whom Heliade depicted as an ideal prototype of a monarch. As young reformists came into conflict with the prince, he kept his neutrality, arguing that all sides involved represented a privileged minority, and that the disturbances were equivalent to "the quarrel of wolves and the noise made by those in higher positions over the torn-apart animal that is the peasant". He was notably critical of the <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> <a href="Mitic%C4%83%20Filipescu">Mitică Filipescu</a>, whom he satirized in the poem "Căderea dracilor" ("The Demons' Fall"), and later defined his own position with the words "I hate <a href="tyrant">tyrant</a>s. I fear <a href="Anomie">anarchy</a>".

It was also in 1834 that Heliade began teaching at the "Soţietatea Filarmonică"'s school (alongside Aristia and the musician <a href="Ioan%20Andrei%20Wachmann">Ioan Andrei Wachmann</a>), and published his first translations from <a href="George%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a> (in 1847, he completed the translation of Byron's "<a href="Don%20Juan%20%28Byron%29">Don Juan</a>"). The next year, he began printing "Gazeta Teatrului Naţional" (official voice of the National Theater, published until 1836), and translated <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>'s "<a href="Amphitryon%20%28Moli%C3%A8re%29">Amphitryon</a>" into Romanian. In 1839, Heliade also translated <a href="Miguel%20de%20Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a>' "<a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a>" from a French source. The first collection of his own prose and poetry works saw print in 1836. Interested in the development of <a href="Art%20of%20Romania">local art</a>, he contributed a <a href="brochure">brochure</a> on drawing and architecture in 1837, and, during the same year, opened the first permanent exhibit in Wallachia (featuring copies of Western paintings, portraits, and <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a> <a href="Casting">casts</a> of various known sculptures).

By the early 1840s, Heliade began expanding on his notion that modern Romanian needed to emphasize its connections with other <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a> through <a href="neologism">neologism</a>s from <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, and, to this goal, he published ("Parallelism between the Romanian language and Italian", 1840) and ("Parallelism between the Romanian and Italian Dialects or the Form or Grammar of These Two Dialects", 1841). The two books were followed by a <a href="compendium">compendium</a>, "Prescurtare de gramatica limbei româno-italiene" ("Summary of the Grammar of the Romanian-Italian Language"), and, in 1847, by a comprehensive list of Romanian words that had originated in <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a>, <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, <a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish</a>, <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a>, and German ("see <a href="Romanian%20lexis">Romanian lexis</a>"). By 1846, he was planning to begin work on a "universal library", which was to include, among other books, the major the philosophical writings of, among others, <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a>, <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a>, <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>, <a href="Gottfried%20Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a>, <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, <a href="Johann%20Gottlieb%20Fichte">Johann Gottlieb Fichte</a> and <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a>.

Before Alexandru Ghica was replaced with <a href="Gheorghe%20Bibescu">Gheorghe Bibescu</a>, his relations with Heliade had soured. In contrast with his earlier call for moderation, the writer decided to side with the <a href="Liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Romania">liberal current</a> in its <a href="Conspiracy%20%28political%29">conspiratorial</a> opposition to Bibescu. The so-called "Trandafiloff affair" of early 1844 was essential in this process—it was provoked by Bibescu's decision to lease all Wallachian mines to a Russian engineer named <a href="Alexander%20Trandafiloff">Alexander Trandafiloff</a>, a measure considered illegal by the <a href="Sfatul%20boieresc">Assembly</a> and ultimately ending in Bibescu's decision to dissolve his legislative. These events made Heliade publish a <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a> titled "Măceşul" ("The <a href="Rosa%20rubiginosa">Eglantine</a>"), which was heavily critical of Russian influence and reportedly sold over 30,000 copies. It was centered on the pun alluding to Trandafiloff's name—"trandafir cu of în coadă" (lit. "a rose ending in -of", but also "a rose with grief for a stem"). Making additional covert reference to Trandafiloff as "the eglantine", it featured the lyrics: 

In spring 1848, when the first <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">European revolutions</a> had erupted, Heliade was attracted into cooperation with "Frăţia", a <a href="secret%20society">secret society</a> founded by <a href="Nicolae%20B%C4%83lcescu">Nicolae Bălcescu</a>, <a href="Ion%20Ghica">Ion Ghica</a>, <a href="Christian%20Tell">Christian Tell</a>, and <a href="Alexandru%20G.%20Golescu">Alexandru G. Golescu</a>, and sat on its leadership committee. He also collaborated with the reform-minded French teacher <a href="Jean%20Alexandre%20Vaillant">Jean Alexandre Vaillant</a>, who was ultimately expelled after his activities were brought to the attention of authorities. On April 19, 1848, following financial setbacks, "<a href="Curierul%20Rom%C3%A2nesc">Curierul Românesc</a>" ceased printing (this prompted Heliade to write "Cântecul ursului", "The Bear's Song", a piece ridiculing his political enemies).

Heliade progressively distanced himself from the more radical groups, especially after discussions began on the issue of <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a> and the disestablishment of the <a href="boyar">boyar</a> class. Initially, he accepted the reforms, and, after the matter was debated within "Frăţia" just before rebellion broke out, he issued a resolution acknowledging this (the document was probably inspired by <a href="Nicolae%20B%C4%83lcescu">Nicolae Bălcescu</a>). The compromise also set other goals, including national independence, <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a>, <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, five-year terms of office for Princes (and their election by the <a href="Sfatul%20boieresc">National Assembly</a>), <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">freedom of the press</a>, and <a href="decentralization">decentralization</a>. On June 21, 1848, present in <a href="Turnu%20M%C4%83gurele">Islaz</a> alongside Tell and the <a href="Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> priest known as <a href="Popa%20%C5%9Eapc%C4%83">Popa Şapcă</a>, he read out these goals to a cheering crowd, in what was to be the effective start of the uprising ("see <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Islaz">Proclamation of Islaz</a>"). Four days after the Islaz events, the revolution succeeded in toppling Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government which immediately attracted Russian hostility. Presided over by <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Hungro-Wallachia">Metropolitan</a> <a href="Neofit%20II%2C%20Metroplitan%20of%20Ungro-Wallachia">Neofit</a>, it included Heliade, who was also Minister of Education, as well as Tell, <a href="%C5%9Etefan%20Golescu">Ştefan Golescu</a>, <a href="Gheorghe%20Magheru">Gheorghe Magheru</a>, and, for a short while, the Bucharest merchant <a href="Gheorghe%20Scurti">Gheorghe Scurti</a>.

Disputes regarding the shape of land reform continued, and in late July, the Government created "Comisia proprietăţii" (the Commission on Property), representing both peasants and landlords and overseen by <a href="Alexandru%20Racovi%C5%A3%C4%83">Alexandru Racoviţă</a> and <a href="Ion%20Ionescu%20de%20la%20Brad">Ion Ionescu de la Brad</a>. It too failed to reach a compromise over the amount of land to be allocated to peasants, and it was ultimately recalled by Heliade, who indicated that the matter was to be deliberated once a new Assembly had been voted into office. In time, the writer adopted a <a href="Conservatism">conservative</a> outlook in respect to boyar tradition, developing a singular view of <a href="History%20of%20Romania">Romanian history</a> from a consideration of property and rank in Wallachia. In the words of historian <a href="Nicolae%20Iorga">Nicolae Iorga</a>: "Eliad had wanted to lead, as <a href="dictator">dictator</a>, this movement that added liberal institutions to the old society that had been almost completely maintained in place".

Like most other revolutionaries, Heliade favored maintaining good relations with the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia's <a href="Suzerainty">suzerain</a> power, hoping that this policy could help counter Russian pressures. As <a href="Ottoman%20Dynasty">Sultan</a> <a href="Abd%C3%BClmecid%20I">Abdülmecid I</a> was assessing the situation, <a href="Suleiman%20Pasha%20%28Ottoman%20general%29">Süleyman Paşa</a> was dispatched to Bucharest, where he advised the revolutionaries to carry on with their diplomatic efforts, and ordered the Provisional Government to be replaced by "Locotenenţa domnească", a <a href="triumvirate">triumvirate</a> of <a href="regent">regent</a>s comprising Heliade, Tell, and <a href="Nicolae%20Golescu">Nicolae Golescu</a>. Nonetheless, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into joining a clampdown on revolutionary forces, which resulted, during September, in the reestablishment of "<a href="Regulamentul%20Organic">Regulamentul Organic</a>" and its system of government. Together with Tell, Heliade sought refuge at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">British</a> consulate in Bucharest, where they were hosted by <a href="Robert%20Gilmour%20Colquhoun">Robert Gilmour Colquhoun</a> in exchange for a deposit of <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20gulden">Austrian florins</a>.

Leaving his family behind, he was allowed to pass into the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian</a>-ruled <a href="Banat">Banat</a>, before moving into self-exile in France while his wife and children were sent to Ottoman lands. In 1850–1851, several of his memoirs of the revolution, written in both Romanian and French, were published in Paris, the city where he had taken residence. He shared his exile with Tell and Magheru, as well as with <a href="Nicolae%20Rusu%20Locusteanu">Nicolae Rusu Locusteanu</a>.

It was during his time in Paris that he met with <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, the <a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a> philosopher who had come to advance a moderate small-scale property project (to counter both <a href="economic%20liberalism">economic liberalism</a> and socialism). Heliade used this opportunity to make the Romanian cause known to the staff of Proudhon's "La Voix de Peuple". Major French publications to which he contributed included "<a href="La%20Presse%20%28France%29">La Presse</a>", "<a href="La%20Semaine">La Semaine</a>", and "<a href="Le%20Si%C3%A8cle">Le Siècle</a>", where he also helped publicize political issues pertaining to his native land. Heliade was credited with having exercised influence over historian <a href="%C3%89lias%20Regnault">Élias Regnault</a>; <a href="Nicolae%20Iorga">Nicolae Iorga</a> argued that Regnault's discarded his own arguments in favor of a unified Romanian state to include <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a> (a concept which Heliade had come to resent), as well amending his earlier account of the 1848 events, after being exposed to "Eliad's <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>".

While claiming to represent the entire body of Wallachian "<a href="%C3%A9migr%C3%A9">émigré</a>s", Heliade had by then grown disappointed with the political developments, and, in his private correspondence, commented that <a href="Romanians">Romanians</a> in general were "idle", "womanizing", as well as having "the petty and base envies of women", and argued that they required "supervision [and] leadership". His fortune was declining, especially after pressures began for him to pay his many debts, and he often lacked the funds for basic necessities. At the time, he continuously clashed with other former revolutionaries, including Bălcescu, <a href="C.%20A.%20Rosetti">C. A. Rosetti</a>, and the Golescus, who resented his ambiguous stance in respect to reforms, and especially his willingness to accept "Regulamentul Organic" as an instrument of power; Heliade issued the first in a series of <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>s condemning young radicals, contributing to factionalism inside the "émigré" camp. His friendship with Tell also soured, after Heliade began speculating that the revolutionary general was committing <a href="adultery">adultery</a> with Maria.

In 1851, Heliade reunited with his family on the island of <a href="Chios">Chios</a>, where they stayed until 1854. Following the evacuation of Russian troops from the <a href="Danubian%20Principalities">Danubian Principalities</a> during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, Heliade was appointed by the <a href="Ottoman%20Porte">Porte</a> to represent the Romanian nation in <a href="Shumen">Shumen</a>, as part of <a href="Omar%20Pasha">Omar Pasha</a>'s staff. Again expressing sympathy for the Ottoman cause, he was rewarded with the title of "<a href="Bey">Bey</a>". According to Iorga, Heliade's attitudes reflected his hope of "recovering the power lost" in 1848; the historian also stressed that Omar never actually made use of Heliade's services.

Later in the same year, he decided to return to Bucharest, but his stay was cut short when the Austrian authorities, who, under the leadership of <a href="Johann%20Coronini-Cronberg">Johann Coronini-Cronberg</a>, had taken over administration of the country as a neutral force, asked for him to be expelled. Returning to Paris, Heliade continued to publish works on political and cultural issues, including an analysis of the European situation after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281856%29">Peace Treaty of 1856</a> and an 1858 essay on the Bible. In 1859, he published his own translation of the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, under the name "Biblia sacră ce cuprinde Noul şi Vechiul Testament" ("The Holy Bible, Comprising the <a href="New%20Testament">New</a> and <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>").

As former revolutionaries, grouped in the "<a href="Partida%20Na%C5%A3ional%C4%83">Partida Naţională</a>" faction, advanced the idea of union between Wallachia and <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a> in election for the <a href="ad%20hoc%20Divan">"ad hoc" Divan</a>, Heliade opted not to endorse any particular candidate, while rejecting outright the candidature of former prince <a href="Alexandru%20II%20Ghica">Alexandru II Ghica</a> (in a private letter, he stated: "let them elect whomever [of the candidates for the throne], for he would still have the heart of a man and some principles of a Romanian; only don't let that creature [Ghica] be elected, for he is capable of going to the dogs with this country").

Later in 1859, Heliade returned to Bucharest, which had become the capital of the United Principalities after the common election of <a href="Alexandru%20Ioan%20Cuza">Alexandru Ioan Cuza</a> and later that of an internationally recognized <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Principality of Romania</a>. It was during that period that he again added "Rădulescu" to his surname. Until his death, he published influential volumes on a variety of issues, while concentrating on contributions to history and literary criticism, and editing a new collection of his own poems. In 1863, "<a href="Domnitor">Domnitor</a>" Cuza awarded him an annual <a href="pension">pension</a> of 2,000 <a href="Romanian%20leu">lei</a>.

One year after the creation of the <a href="Romanian%20Academy">Romanian Academy</a> (under the name of "Academic Society"), he was elected its first President (1867), serving until his death. In 1869, Heliade and <a href="Alexandru%20Papiu-Ilarian">Alexandru Papiu-Ilarian</a> successfully proposed the <a href="Italy">Italian</a> diplomat and <a href="Philology">philologist</a> <a href="Giovenale%20Vegezzi%20Ruscalla">Giovenale Vegezzi Ruscalla</a> as honorary member of the Academy. By then, like most other 1848 Romantics, he had become the target of criticism from the younger generation of intellectuals, represented by the <a href="Ia%C5%9Fi">Iaşi</a>-based literary society "<a href="Junimea">Junimea</a>"; in 1865, during one of its early public sessions, "Junimea" explicitly rejected works by Heliade and <a href="Iancu%20V%C4%83c%C4%83rescu">Iancu Văcărescu</a>.

During the <a href="Romanian%20general%20election%2C%201866">elections of 1866</a>, Heliade Rădulescu won a seat in the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Romania">Chamber</a> as a deputy for the city of <a href="T%C3%A2rgovi%C5%9Fte">Târgovişte</a>. As Cuza had been ousted from power by a coalition of political groupings, he was the only Wallachian deputy to join <a href="Nicolae%20Ionescu">Nicolae Ionescu</a> and other disciples of <a href="Simion%20B%C4%83rnu%C5%A3iu">Simion Bărnuţiu</a> in opposing the appointment of <a href="Carol%20I%20of%20Romania">Carol of Hohenzollern</a> as "Domnitor" and a proclamation stressing the perpetuity of the Moldo-Wallachian union. Speaking in <a href="Parliament%20of%20Romania">Parliament</a>, he likened the adoption of foreign rule to the <a href="Phanariotes">Phanariote</a> period. The opposition was nevertheless weak, and the resolution was passed with a large majority.

Among Ion Heliade Rădulescu's last printed works were a textbook on <a href="poetics">poetics</a> (1868) and a volume on Romanian <a href="orthography">orthography</a>. By that time, he had come to consider himself a <a href="prophet">prophet</a>-like figure, and the redeemer of his motherland, notably blessing his friends with the words "<a href="Christ">Christ</a> and <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Magdalene</a> be with you!" His mental health declining, he died at his Bucharest residence on Polonă Street, nr. 20. Heliade Rădulescu's grandiose funeral ceremony attracted a large number of his admirers; the coffin was buried in the courtyard of the Mavrogheni Church.

Heliade's most influential contributions are related to his interest in developing the modern <a href="Romanian%20language">Romanian language</a>, in which he synthesized <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> tenets and <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">Romantic nationalist</a> ideals of the 1848 generation. At a time when Romanian was being discarded by the educated in favor of French or <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, he and his supporters argued in favor of adapting Romanian to the requirements of <a href="modernization">modernization</a>; he wrote: "Young people, preoccupy yourselves with the national language, speak and write in it; prepare yourselves for its study, for its cultivation,—and cultivating a language means to write in it about all sciences and arts, about all eras and peoples. The language alone unites, strengthens and defines a nation; preoccupy yourselves with it first and foremost, as, through this, you shall be carrying out the most fundamental of policies, you shall be laying the foundation of nationality".

Heliade inaugurated his series of proposals for reforming the language in 1828, when his work on <a href="Romanian%20grammar">Romanian grammar</a> called for the <a href="Romanian%20Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic script</a> to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting <a href="phonetic%20spelling">phonetic spelling</a> (for this rule, Heliade cited the example of the <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> as used in <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Rome</a>). Soon after, he began a campaign in favor of introducing <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance</a> <a href="neologism">neologism</a>s, which he wanted to adapt to Romanian spelling. By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify the <a href="Romanian%20dialects">varieties of Romanian</a> and create a standard <a href="Romanian%20lexis">Romanian lexis</a>: this notion was first supported by the <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>ns <a href="Gheorghe%20%C5%9Eincai">Gheorghe Şincai</a> and <a href="Petru%20Maior">Petru Maior</a>, whose proposal was to unite Romanians around the issue of the choice of liturgical language, both <a href="Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> and <a href="Romanian%20Church%20United%20with%20Rome%2C%20Greek-Catholic">Greek-Catholic</a> ("see <a href="Transylvanian%20School">Transylvanian School</a>"). Heliade, who first proposed a <a href="Standard%20language">language regulator</a> (an idea which was to be employed in creating the <a href="Romanian%20Academy">Romanian Academy</a>), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in <a href="Muntenia">Muntenia</a>, which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer <a href="Coresi">Coresi</a>, serve as the standard language.

In addition, he advocated <a href="Aesthetics">aesthetical</a> guidelines in respect to the standard shape of Romanian, stressing three basic principles in selecting words: "proper wording", which called for <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a> words of <a href="Latin">Latin</a> origin to be prioritized; "harmony", which meant that words of Latin origin were to be used in their most popular form, even in cases where <a href="Phonaesthetics">euphony</a> had been altered by prolonged usage; and "energy", through which Heliade favored the primacy of the shortest and most expressive of <a href="synonym">synonym</a>s used throughout Romanian-speaking areas. In parallel, Heliade frowned upon <a href="Linguistic%20purism">purist</a> policies of removing widely used neologisms of foreign origin—arguing that these were "a fatality", he indicated that the gains of such a process would have been shadowed by the losses.

These early theories exercised a lasting influence, and, when the work of unifying Romanian was accomplished in the late 19th century, they were used as a source of inspiration: Romania's major poet of the period, <a href="Mihai%20Eminescu">Mihai Eminescu</a>, himself celebrated for having created the modern <a href="literary%20language">literary language</a>, gave praise to Heliade for "writing just as [the language] is spoken". This assessment was shared by <a href="Ovid%20Densusianu">Ovid Densusianu</a>, who wrote: "Thinking of how people wrote back then, in thick, drawly, sleepy phrases, Heliade thus shows himself superior to all his contemporaries, and ... we can consider him the first prose writer who brings in the note of <a href="History%20of%20modern%20literature">modernity</a>".

A second period in Heliade's linguistic researches, inaugurated when he adopted <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Bonnot%20de%20Condillac">Étienne Condillac</a>'s theory that a language could be developed from conventions, eventually brought about the rejection of his own earlier views. By the early 1840s, he postulated that Romanian and <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> were not distinct languages, but rather dialects of Latin, which prompted him to declare the necessity of replacing Romanian words with "superior" Italian ones. One of his <a href="stanza">stanza</a>s, using his version of the <a href="Romanian%20alphabet">Romanian Latin alphabet</a>, read:
<poem style="margin-left:2em;font-style:italic">

</poem>

Approximated into modern Romanian and English, this is:
The target of criticism and ridicule, these principles were dismissed by Eminescu as "errors" and "<a href="A%20priori%20%28languages%29">a priori systems</a> of <a href="orthography">orthography</a>". During their existence, they competed with both <a href="August%20Treboniu%20Laurian">August Treboniu Laurian</a>'s adoption of strong Latin mannerisms and the inconsistent <a href="Francization">Francized</a> system developed in Moldavia by <a href="Gheorghe%20Asachi">Gheorghe Asachi</a>, which, according to the 20th century literary critic <a href="Garabet%20Ibr%C4%83ileanu">Garabet Ibrăileanu</a>, constituted "the <a href="boyar">boyar</a> language of his time". Ibrăileanu also noted that Asachi had come to admire Heliade's attempts, and had praised them as an attempt to revive the language "spoken by <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a>'s men"—in reference to <a href="Roman%20Dacia">Roman Dacia</a>.

While defending the role Moldavian politicians in the 1840s had in shaping modern Romanian culture, Ibrăileanu argued that practices such as those of Heliade and Laurian carried the risk of "suppressing the Romanian language", and credited <a href="Alecu%20Russo">Alecu Russo</a>, more than his successors at "<a href="Junimea">Junimea</a>", with providing a passionate defense of spoken Romanian. He notably cited Russo's verdict: "The modern political hatred aimed at [Russia] has thrown us into Italianism, into Frenchism, and into other -isms, that were not and are not Romanianism, but the political perils, in respect to the enslavement of the Romanian soul, have since passed; true Romanianism ought to hold its head up high". The literary critic <a href="George%20C%C4%83linescu">George Călinescu</a> also connected Heliade's experimentation to his <a href="Anti-Russian%20sentiment">Russophobia</a>, in turn reflecting his experiences as a revolutionary: "Hating <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavism</a> and the Russians, who had striven to underline [Slavic influences in Romanian], he said to himself that he was to serve his motherland by discarding all Slavic vestiges". Călinescu notably attributed Heliade's inconsistency to his "<a href="autodidacticism">autodidacticism</a>", which, he contended, was responsible for "[his] casual implication in all issues, the unexpected move from common sense ideas to the most insane theories".

Overall, Heliade's experiments had marginal appeal, and their critics (Eminescu included) contrasted them with Heliade's own tenets. Late in his life, Heliade seems to have acknowledged this, notably writing: "This language, as it is written today by people who can speak Romanian, is my work". One of the few authors to be influenced by the theory was the <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> poet <a href="Alexandru%20Macedonski">Alexandru Macedonski</a>, who, during his youth, wrote several pieces in Heliade's Italian-sounding Romanian. Despite Heliade's thesis being largely rejected, some of its practical effects on everyday language were very enduring, especially in cases where Italian words were borrowed as a means to illustrate nuances and concepts for which Romanian had no equivalent. These include "afabil" ("affable"), "adorabil" ("adorable"), ("colossal"), "implacabil" ("implacable"), "inefabil" ("ineffable"), "inert" ("inert"), "mistic" ("mystical"), "pervers" ("perverse" or "pervert"), "suav" ("suave"), and "venerabil" ("venerable").

Celebrated as the founder of Wallachian <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>, Heliade was equally influenced by <a href="Classicism">Classicism</a> and the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. His work, written in a special cultural context (where Classiciasm and Romanticism coexisted), took the middle path between two opposing camps: the Romantics (<a href="Alecu%20Russo">Alecu Russo</a>, <a href="Mihail%20Kog%C4%83lniceanu">Mihail Kogălniceanu</a> and others) and the Classicists (<a href="Gheorghe%20Asachi">Gheorghe Asachi</a>, <a href="Grigore%20Alexandrescu">Grigore Alexandrescu</a>, <a href="George%20Baronzi">George Baronzi</a> etc.). <a href="George%20C%C4%83linescu">George Călinescu</a> defined Heliade as "a devourer of books", noting that his favorites, who all played a part in shaping his style and were many times the subject of his translations, included: <a href="Alphonse%20de%20Lamartine">Alphonse de Lamartine</a>, <a href="Dante%20Aligheri">Dante Aligheri</a>, <a href="Ludovico%20Ariosto">Ludovico Ariosto</a>, <a href="Torquato%20Tasso">Torquato Tasso</a>, <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Marmontel">Jean-François Marmontel</a>, <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Chateaubriand">François-René de Chateaubriand</a>.

His poetic style, influenced from early on by Lamartine, was infused with Classicism during his middle age, before he again adopted Romantic tenets. Initially making use of guidelines set by <a href="Nicolas%20Boileau-Despr%C3%A9aux">Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux</a> in respect to poetry, he came to oppose them after reading <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>'s Romantic preface to "<a href="Cromwell%20%28play%29">Cromwell</a>" (without ever discarding them altogether).

Like the Classicists, Heliade favored a literature highlighting "types" of characters, as the union of universal traits and particular characteristics, but, like the Romantics, he encouraged writers to write from a <a href="Subjectivism">subjective</a> viewpoint, which he believed to be indicative of their mission as "prophets, ... men who criticize, who point out their society's plagues and who look on to a happier future, waiting for a savior". Through the latter ideal of moral regeneration, Heliade also complimented the Romantic stress on "national specificity", which he adopted in his later years. At the same time, he centered much of his own literary work on non-original material, either by compiling it from various translations or by translating from a single source—having his focus on creating the basis for further development by introducing samples of untapped <a href="literary%20genre">literary genre</a>s and styles to <a href="Literature%20of%20Romania">Romanian literature</a>.

While several of Heliade's contributions to literature have been considered to be of low importance, many others, above all his Romantic poem "<a href="Zbur%C4%83torul">Zburătorul</a>", are hailed as major accomplishments. "Zburătorul", borrowing from <a href="Romanian%20mythology">Romanian mythology</a> its main character (the eponymous "<a href="Incubus%20%28demon%29">incubus</a>"-like being who visits nubile girls at night) also serves to depict the atmosphere of a Wallachian village from that period. According to <a href="George%20C%C4%83linescu">George Călinescu</a>, the poem's value partly relies on its depiction of lust through the girls' eyes: "lacking the rages of <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a> and <a href="Phaedra%20%28mythology%29">Phaedra</a>. The <a href="puberty">puberty</a> crisis is explained through mythology and cured through <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a>".

An 1837 essay of his, centered on a debate regarding the translation of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s works into Romanian, featured a series of counsels to younger writers: "This is not the time for criticism, children, it is the time for writing, so write as much and as good as you can, but without meanness; create, do not ruin; for the nation receives and blesses the maker and curses the destroyer. Write with a clear conscience". Paraphrased as "Write anything, boys, as long as you go on writing!" ("Scrieţi, băieţi, orice, numai scrieţi!"), this quote became the topic of derision in later decades, and was hailed as an example of Heliade's failure to distinguish between quality and quantity. The latter verdict was considered unfair by the literary historian <a href="%C5%9Eerban%20Cioculescu">Şerban Cioculescu</a> and others, who argued that Ion Heliade Rădulescu's main goal was to encourage the rapid development of local literature to a European level. Although he recognized, among other things, Heliade's merits of having removed pretentious boyar discourse from poetry and having favored regular <a href="rhyme">rhyme</a>, <a href="Paul%20Zarifopol">Paul Zarifopol</a> accused him and <a href="Gheorghe%20Asachi">Gheorghe Asachi</a> of "tastelessness" and "literary insecurity". He elaborated: "Rădulescu was arguably afflicted with this sin more than Asachi, given his unfortunate ambitions of fabricating a literary language".

Heliade's name is closely connected with the establishment of <a href="Theatre%20of%20Romania">Romanian-language theater</a>, mirroring the activities of Asachi in <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>. Ever since he partook in creating "Soţietatea Filarmonică" and the <a href="National%20Theatre%20Bucharest">Bucharest Theater</a>, to the moment of his death, he was involved in virtually all major developments in local dramatic and operatic art. In August 1834, he was one of the intellectuals who organized the first show hosted by "Soţietatea Filarmonică", which featured, alongside a <a href="cavatina">cavatina</a> from <a href="Vincenzo%20Bellini">Vincenzo Bellini</a>'s "<a href="Il%20pirata">Il pirata</a>", Heliade's translation of <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>'s "<a href="Mahomet%20%28play%29">Mahomet</a>". In subsequent years, members of the association carried out the translation of <a href="Theatre%20of%20France">French theater</a> and other foreign pieces, while encouraging Romanian-language dramatists, an effort which was to become successful during and after the 1840s (when <a href="Constantin%20Aristia">Constantin Aristia</a> and <a href="Costache%20Caragiale">Costache Caragiale</a> entered their most creative periods). Heliade himself advocated <a href="didacticism">didacticism</a> in drama (defining it as "the preservation of social health"), and supported professionalism in <a href="acting">acting</a>.

Ion Heliade Rădulescu made extensive use of the <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">Romantic nationalist</a> focus on history, which he initially applied to his poetry. In this instance as well, the goal was to educate his public; he wrote: "Nothing is worthy of derision as much as someone taking pride in his parents and ancestors and nothing more worthy of praise than when the ancestors' great deeds serve as a model and an impulse for competition among descendants". The main historical figure in his poetry is the late 16th century <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia">Wallachian Prince</a> <a href="Michael%20the%20Brave">Michael the Brave</a>, the first one to rally Wallachia, Moldavia and <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a> under a single rule: celebrated in Heliade's poem "O noapte pe ruinele Târgoviştii" ("A Night on the Ruins of <a href="T%C3%A2rgovi%C5%9Fte">Târgovişte</a>"), he was to be the main character of a lengthy <a href="epic%20poem">epic poem</a>, "Mihaiada", of which only two sections, written in very different styles, were ever completed (in 1845 and 1859 respectively). Other historical poems also expanded on the ideal of a single Romanian state, while presenting the 1848 generation as a model for future Romanian politicians.

Throughout the 1860s, one of Heliade's main interests was an investigation into the issues involving Romanian history during the <a href="origin%20of%20the%20Romanians">origin of the Romanians</a> and the <a href="Romania%20in%20the%20Early%20Middle%20Ages">early medieval history</a> of the <a href="Danubian%20Principalities">Danubian Principalities</a>. At a time when, in Moldavia, the newly surfaced "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Huru">Chronicle of Huru</a>" traced a political lineage of the country to the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> through the means of a narrative which was later proven to be entirely fictional, Heliade made use of its theses to draw similar conclusions regarding Wallachia. His <a href="Conservatism">conservative</a> views were thus expanded to the level of <a href="Historiography">historiographic</a> thesis: according to Heliade, <a href="boyars">boyars</a> had been an <a href="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> and permeable class, which, from as early as the times of <a href="Radu%20Negru">Radu Negru</a>, had adopted humane laws that announced and welcomed those of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> (he notably claimed that the <a href="Counties%20of%20Romania">county</a>-based administration was a <a href="Democracy">democratic</a> one, and that it had been copied from the <a href="Israelite">Israelite</a> model as depicted in the Bible).

The ideal he expressed in a work of the period, "Equilibru între antithesi" ("A Balance between <a href="Antithesis">Antitheses</a>") was moderate <a href="progressivism">progressivism</a>, with the preservation of social peace. In <a href="Tudor%20Vianu">Tudor Vianu</a>'s view, partly based on earlier assessments by other critics, "Equilibru", with its stress on making political needs coincide with social ones through the means of counterweights, evidenced strong influences from <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>'s thought, as well as vaguer ones from that of <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a>. Nonetheless, his system parted with <a href="Hegelianism">Hegelianism</a> in that, instead of seeking a balance between the "<a href="Geist">Geist</a>" and existence, it considered the three states of human progress ("<a href="Thesis%2C%20antithesis%2C%20synthesis">Thesis, antithesis, synthesis</a>") the reflection of a <a href="Numerology">mystical number</a> favored throughout history.

In parallel, Heliade worked on a vast synthesis of his own <a href="philosophy%20of%20history">philosophy of history</a>, based on his interpretation of <a href="Biblical%20theology">Biblical theology</a>. His 1858 work, "Biblice" ("Biblical Writings"), was supposed to form the first of four sections in a Christian history of the world. Referring to this project, Călinescu defined Heliade's ideas as "interesting, no matter how naïve at times, in general <a href="Voltaire">Voltairian</a> and <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a> [in shape]". "Biblicele" partly evidenced Heliade's interests in the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> and "<a href="Zohar">Zohar</a>"-like <a href="gematria">gematria</a>—with emphasis placed on the numbers 3, 7, and 10—, as well as ample references to the "<a href="Sephirot">Sephirot</a>". One of his original thoughts on the matter was a reference to "<a href="Delta%20%28letter%29">deltas</a>" (triangles) of <a href="Deity">deities</a>—<a href="Elohim">Elohim</a>-<a href="Spirit">Spirit</a>-<a href="Matter">Matter</a> and Spirit-Matter-the Universe. A portion of Heliade Rădulescu's poems also draw on religious themes and discourse. According to <a href="George%20C%C4%83linescu">George Călinescu</a>, the poet had attempted to create a parallel to both "<a href="The%20Divine%20Comedy">The Divine Comedy</a>" and the Bible, from <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a> to <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Revelation</a>, with a style influenced by Lamartine and <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>.

Heliade was aware of the often negative response to his work: in a poem dedicated to the memory of <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>, he expanded on the contrast between creation and social setting (in reference to mankind, it stressed "Te iartă să faci răul, iar binele nici mort"—"They forgive the evil committed against them, but never the good"). A noted author of <a href="satire">satire</a>, he used it as a vehicle to criticize social customs of his day, as well as to publicize personal conflicts and resentments. As a maverick, he attacked political figures on both sides: conservatives who mimicked liberalism were the subject of his "Areopagiul bestielor" ("The <a href="Areopagus">Areopagus</a> of the Beasts"), while many other of his post-1848 prose and poetry pieces mocked people on the <a href="Left-wing%20politics">left wing</a> of liberalism, most notably <a href="C.%20A.%20Rosetti">C. A. Rosetti</a> and his supporters. During and after his exile, his conflicts with <a href="Cezar%20Bolliac">Cezar Bolliac</a> and <a href="Ion%20Ghica">Ion Ghica</a> also made the latter two the target of irony, most likely based on Heliade's belief that they intended to downplay his contributions to the <a href="Wallachian%20Revolution%20of%201848">Wallachian Revolution of 1848</a>.

His autobiographical pieces, marked by acid comments on <a href="Greek%20language">Greek-language</a> education, and, in this respect, similar to the writings of his friend <a href="Costache%20Negruzzi">Costache Negruzzi</a>, also display a dose of self-irony. The enduring polemic with <a href="Grigore%20Alexandrescu">Grigore Alexandrescu</a>, as well as his quarrel with Bolliac, formed the basis of his <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a> "Domnul Sarsailă autorul" ("Mr. <a href="Devil%20in%20Christianity">Old Nick</a>, the Author"), an attack on what Heliade viewed as writers whose pretensions contrasted with their actual mediocrity. In other short prose works, Ion Heliade Rădulescu commented on the caricature-like nature of "<a href="parvenu">parvenu</a>" <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>ers (the male prototype, "Coconul Drăgan", was "an ennobled hoodlum", while the female one, "Coconiţa Drăgana", always wished to be the first in line for the <a href="Anointing%20of%20the%20Sick">unction</a>).

In various of his articles, he showed himself a critic of social trends. During the 1830s, he reacted against <a href="misogyny">misogyny</a>, arguing in favor of <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a>: "Who has made man create himself unfair laws and customs, in order for him to cultivate his spirit and forsake [women] into ignorance...?". In 1859, after the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Romania">Jewish community</a> in <a href="Gala%C5%A3i">Galaţi</a> fell victim to a <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>, he spoke out against <a href="Antisemitism">Antisemitic</a> <a href="Blood%20libel%20against%20Jews">blood libel</a> accusations: "Jews do not eat children in England, nor do they in France, nor do they in <a href="German%20Confederation">Germany</a>, nor do they do so wherever humans have become humans. Where else are they accused of such an inhumane deed? Wherever peoples are still <a href="Barbarian">Barbaric</a> or semi-Barbaric".

A large portion of Heliade's satirical works rely on mockery of speech patterns and physical traits: notable portraits resulting from this style include mimicking the manner of Transylvanian educators (with their strict adherence to <a href="Latin">Latin</a> <a href="Etymology">etymologies</a>), and his critique of the <a href="exophthalmos">exophthalmos</a> Rosetti (with eyes "more bulged than those of a giant frog"). Without sharing Heliade's views on literature, the younger <a href="Titu%20Maiorescu">Titu Maiorescu</a> drew comparisons with his predecessor for launching into similar attacks, and usually in respect to the same rivals.

A monument to Ion Heliade Rădulescu, sculpted by the <a href="Italy">Italian</a> artist <a href="Ettore%20Ferrari">Ettore Ferrari</a>, stands in front of the <a href="University%20of%20Bucharest">University</a> building in central Bucharest. In addition to naming a lecture room after him, the <a href="Romanian%20Academy">Romanian Academy</a> has instituted the "Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award"—in 1880, it was awarded to <a href="Bogdan%20Petriceicu%20Hasdeu">Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu</a>, for his "Cuvinte den bătrâni", and worth 5,000 gold <a href="Romanian%20leu">lei</a>. Ten years after, the prize was the center of a scandal, involving on one side the dramatist <a href="Ion%20Luca%20Caragiale">Ion Luca Caragiale</a> and, on the other, the cultural establishment formed around members of the <a href="National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201875%29">National Liberal Party</a>, including Hasdeu and <a href="Dimitrie%20Sturdza">Dimitrie Sturdza</a>. The latter disapproved of Caragiale's anti-Liberal stance and his association with "<a href="Junimea">Junimea</a>", as well as to his anti-nationalism, dislike of <a href="didacticism">didacticism</a>, and alleged <a href="cosmopolitanism">cosmopolitanism</a>. They thus refused to grant him the prize.

A high school in his native <a href="T%C3%A2rgovi%C5%9Fte">Târgovişte</a> bears the name "Ion Heliade Rădulescu", as does a village in the <a href="Commune%20in%20Romania">commune</a> of <a href="Ziduri">Ziduri</a>, <a href="Buz%C4%83u%20County">Buzău County</a>. The grave of <a href="Take%20Ionescu">Take Ionescu</a>, an influential political figure and one-time <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Romania">Prime Minister of Romania</a> who was Heliade's descendant, is situated in <a href="Sinaia%20Monastery">Sinaia Monastery</a>, in the immediate vicinity of a fir tree planted by Heliade and his fellow 1848 revolutionaries.

In his 1870 poem "Epigonii" ("The <a href="wiktionary%3Aepigone">Epigone</a>s"), <a href="Mihai%20Eminescu">Mihai Eminescu</a> paid tribute to early Romanian-language writers and their contributions to literature. An entire <a href="stanza">stanza</a> is dedicated to Heliade:
During the early 1880s, <a href="Alexandru%20Macedonski">Alexandru Macedonski</a> and his "<a href="Literatorul">Literatorul</a>" attempted to preserve Heliade's status and his theories when these were faced with criticism from "Junimea"; by 1885, this rivalry ended in defeat for Macedonski, and contributed to the disestablishment of "Literatorul".

Although a "Junimist" for a large part of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a precursor in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade in the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201880%E2%80%931918%29">Conservative Party</a>'s main journal, "<a href="Epoca%20%28Romania%29">Epoca</a>". One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher <a href="Marius%20Chico%C5%9F%20Rostogan">Marius Chicoş Rostogan</a>, shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories. Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade Rădulescu, <a href="Ion%20C%C3%A2mpineanu">Ion Câmpineanu</a>, and <a href="Nicolae%20B%C4%83lcescu">Nicolae Bălcescu</a>, and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around <a href="Pantazi%20Ghica">Pantazi Ghica</a>, <a href="Nicolae%20Misail">Nicolae Misail</a> and <a href="Mihail%20P%C4%83t%C3%A2rl%C4%83geanu">Mihail Pătârlăgeanu</a>—he identified the latter grouping with <a href="hypocrisy">hypocrisy</a>, <a href="demagogy">demagogy</a>, and <a href="political%20corruption">political corruption</a>, while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.

Comments about Heliade and his Bucharest statue feature prominently in Macedonski's short story "Nicu Dereanu", whose main character, a daydreaming <a href="Bohemianism">Bohemian</a>, idolizes the Wallachian writer. "<a href="Sbur%C4%83torul">Sburătorul</a>", a <a href="Modernism">modernist</a> literary magazine of the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, edited by <a href="Eugen%20Lovinescu">Eugen Lovinescu</a>, owed its name to "<a href="Zbur%C4%83torul">Zburătorul</a>", making use of an antiquated variant of the name (a form favored by Heliade). During the same years, <a href="Camil%20Petrescu">Camil Petrescu</a> made reference to Heliade in his novel "<a href="Un%20om%20%C3%AEntre%20oameni">Un om între oameni</a>", which depicts events from <a href="Nicolae%20B%C4%83lcescu">Nicolae Bălcescu</a>'s lifetime.

In his "Autobiography", the Romanian philosopher <a href="Mircea%20Eliade">Mircea Eliade</a> indicated that it was likely that his ancestors, whose original surname was "Ieremia", had adopted the new name as a tribute to Heliade Rădulescu, whom they probably admired.

Music of Athens, Georgia

The music of Athens, Georgia, includes a wide variety of popular music and was an important part of the early evolution of <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> and <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a>. The city is well known as the home of chart-topping bands like <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a> and <a href="The%20B-52s">The B-52s</a>, and several long-time <a href="indie%20rock">indie /rock</a> hip-hop groups. <a href="Athens%2C%20Georgia">Athens</a> hosts the <a href="Athens%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Athens Symphony Orchestra</a> and other music institutions, as well as prominent local music media, such as the college radio station <a href="WUOG">WUOG</a>. Much of the modern Athens music scene relies on students from the large <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">University of Georgia</a> campus in the city. The University sponsors <a href="Western%20classical%20music">Western classical</a> performances and groups specializing in other styles.

Athens became a center for music in the region during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and gained further fame in the early twentieth century with the founding of the <a href="Morton%20Theatre">Morton Theatre</a>, which was a major touring destination for African American performers. The city's local <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> scene can be traced to the 1950s, with live music at <a href="Allen%27s">Allen's</a> Hamburgers in <a href="Normaltown">Normaltown</a>. International attention came in the 1970s when the B-52's began releasing the first of several best-selling recordings. Athens-based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles, and the city has never had a characteristic style of rock; most of the bands have been united only in their quirky and iconoclastic image.

Music author Richie Unterberger describes the town as an unlikely center for musical development, as a "sleepy [place where] it's difficult to imagine anyone working up a sweat, let alone playing rock music." The contributions of Athens to <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>, <a href="country%20music">country music</a>, and <a href="bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a> have earned it the nickname "the <a href="Music%20of%20Liverpool">Liverpool</a> of the South", and the city is known as one of the American birthplaces for both modern alternative rock and new wave music. Athens was home to the first and most famous college music scene in the country, beginning in the 1970s.

Athens' local music is based primarily in the small downtown area of the northern part of the town. The <a href="nightclub">nightclub</a> <a href="40%20Watt%20Club">40 Watt Club</a> is among the most famous indie rock venues on the East Coast; the club opened on Halloween in 1978, with a band called Strictly American featuring Curtis Crowe, founder of the club and future member of the band <a href="Pylon%20%28band%29">Pylon</a>. Other major music venues in the city include the Georgia Theater, (a converted <a href="Movie%20theater">cinema</a> that hosted both local and touring performers. The Theater burned down in June 2009, but has been fully remodelled into a state of the art music venue reopening in early August 2011), the Caledonia Lounge, the historic Foundry Music Venue (which was originally built in 1850 as an iron foundry), and the UGA Performing Arts Center, home to the Ramsey Concert Hall and the Hugh Hodgson Concert Hall. The <a href="Morton%20Theater">Morton Theater</a> is a historic venue, a major part of the city's African American community in the early 20th century; it claims to be the only theater from that era remaining in operation.

Athens is home to the summer <a href="music%20festival">music festival</a> <a href="Athfest">Athfest</a>, AlanFest, the <a href="Athens%20Popfest">Athens Popfest</a> and the late spring Athens Human Rights Festival and <a href="North%20Georgia%20Folk%20Festival">North Georgia Folk Festival</a>. The <a href="college%20radio">college radio</a> station <a href="WUOG">WUOG</a> (90.5 FM), the low-power (100.7) FM <a href="WPPP-LP">WPPP-LP</a> and the free weekly "<a href="Flagpole%20Magazine">Flagpole</a>" are the city's most prominent modern music media. Athens has never produced a major local label like many similar indie rock towns; the most important label of the 1970s and 1980s was <a href="DB%20Records">DB Records</a>, based out of Atlanta, though <a href="jangle%20pop">jangle pop</a> pioneers <a href="Kindercore%20Records">Kindercore Records</a> and <a href="Wuxtry%20Records">Wuxtry Records</a> were also Athens-based. Athens is home to long-running indie label <a href="Happy%20Happy%20Birthday%20To%20Me%20Records">Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records</a>, which has been operating consistently since 1999.

Local music institutions include the <a href="Athens%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Athens Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a href="Athens%20Choral%20Society">Athens Choral Society</a> (founded in 1971), <a href="Athens%20Youth%20Symphony">Athens Youth Symphony</a> and the <a href="Athens%20Folk%20Music%20and%20Dance%20Society">Athens Folk Music and Dance Society</a>. The Athens Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1978 as a firmly non-profit, strictly volunteer organization, conducted by Albert Ligotti of the University of Georgia. The first performance came in 1979; the Orchestra now has two regular performances, one in the summer and one in the winter, and has also done shows for young people, pops concerts and Christmas concerts. In 1996, the Athens Symphony moved into its modern home, the Classic Center Theatre in downtown Athens.

The University of Georgia's Athens campus has long been an important part of local music. Country Music Hall of Fame songwriter and performer "Whispering" Bill Anderson attended UGA and used to play guitar around campus. The faculty of the Hugh Hodgson School of Music operate the Georgia Brass Quintet and Georgia Woodwind Quintet. Student institutions include the ARCO Chamber Orchestra, Men's and Women's <a href="Glee%20club">Glee Clubs</a>, several concert choirs, jazz bands, and brass and woodwind ensembles, the Redcoat <a href="marching%20band">Marching Band</a>, the University Philharmonia and a Symphony Orchestra. The University of Georgia also has multiple a cappella groups, including the Ecotones, Noteworthy, and the <a href="UGA%20Accidentals">Accidentals</a>, who are regionally known.

The earliest music in <a href="North%20Georgia">North Georgia</a>, including what is now Athens, was that of the Native Americans of the area, principally the <a href="Creek%20people">Creek</a> and the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>. Athens was officially chartered in 1806, and began growing rapidly near the middle of the 19th century. By the time of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> in the 1860s, the city was an important part of musical life in Georgia. The war accelerated the development of the city's musical importance, as Athens was largely spared widespread destruction while the larger city of Atlanta took a long time to recover. Major touring acts like the <a href="Dixie%20Family">Dixie Family</a> and <a href="The%20Slomans">The Slomans</a> visited Athens during the war; the Dixie Family, a prominent touring group, performed disastrously, according to local newspapers, who said that the highlight of the performance came from four local African American musicians, and the Dixie Family had absconded with the concert's proceeds, which had been promised to the local Ladies Aid Society. In the 1870s, the city was almost half African American, and local black-owned industry flourished; among the residents was <a href="Bob%20Cole%20%28composer%29">Bob Cole</a>, born in 1868 to a musically active family. Cole would later become a pioneer in African American theater, known for works like the 1898 musical "<a href="A%20Trip%20to%20Coontown">A Trip to Coontown</a>".

African American industry, churches and other institutions grew rapidly in prominence through the end of the 19th century. The city's <a href="African%20American">African American</a> community was well established by the beginning of the 20th century, when the corner of Lumpkin and Washington Streets became a major center for the city's black culture. This area was known as the "Hot Corner", and was owned by a number of black professional businesses, as well as many performance spaces and a renowned <a href="opera">opera</a> house in the Morton Building that hosted such national figures as <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> and <a href="Duke%20Ellington">Duke Ellington</a>. The <a href="Morton%20Theater">Morton Theater</a> was one of the preeminent venues in the city in the early 20th century, and is the only such theater to survive to the present, though it was not in operation for many years, until re-opening in 1993.

In the 1950s, the city's musical life consisted primarily of dances at local venues like the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion Hall</a> and the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>, where popular bandleaders included most famously <a href="Jimmy%20Dorsey">Jimmy Dorsey</a>. The Canteen was a spot in Memorial Park in Athens, which became an important performance space after local musician Terry "Mad Dog" Melton and his group began playing there in 1958. The Canteen later hosted local <a href="Motown">Motown</a>/<a href="beach%20music">beach</a> legends <a href="The%20Jesters%20%28R%26amp%3BB%20band%29">The Jesters</a>, who have continued to perform from 1964 to the present.

Later in the 1960s and into the 1970s, locally prominent bands gradually changed from primarily cover bands to more well rounded groups, while the city's musical opportunities grew with the foundation of venues and institutions. This period has been called the "Normaltown River of Music", and included long-time local performers like Mad Dog Melton as well as Brian Burke, Davis Causey and <a href="Randall%20Bramblett">Randall Bramblett</a>, many of whom later worked with <a href="Gregg%20Allman">Gregg Allman</a> and the <a href="Nitty%20Gritty%20Dirt%20Band">Nitty Gritty Dirt Band</a>. The most influential local bands to emerge from this period included the Normaltown Flyers, and Dixie Grease. The oldest bar featuring live music in Athens is <a href="Allen%27s">Allen's</a> Hamburgers where the Normaltown Flyers were the house band for many years. <a href="Allen%27s">Allen's</a> opened in 1955 on Prince Avenue, closed for a brief time, and has since reopened on Hawthorne Ave. as part of a restoration project. Bars like The Last Resort (currently the Last Resort Grille restaurant) opened in the 1960s, beginning the local club scene just as some bands were beginning to gain some regional fame for Athens.

In the late 1970s, the 40 Watt Club became a well-known regional attraction for music fans, and was followed by the Uptown Lounge; with the local industry's growth in the 1980s, both the 40 Watt Club and the Uptown Lounge moved to larger spaces, the latter taking over the landmark <a href="Georgia%20Theatre">Georgia Theatre</a>. The early 1980s saw a host of new bands and venues appear, while the city's musical subculture became more diversified. <a href="LSD">LSD</a>, a <a href="hallucinogen">hallucinogen</a>ic drug, was widely used in the college music scene in this era. Many members of Athens's most prominent later bands became locally renowned starting in the 1970s, including The B-52's.

"Ort's Oldies", a used record store on Jackson Street, and its proprietor, William Orten Carlton, commonly known as "Ort", were among the institutional figures that made the Athens music scene possible. Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia, which served him well in running the store. Perhaps more importantly, his off-the-wall sense of humor and warmly iconoclastic personality (and his thrift-sale wardrobe) were regularly on display at parties, gigs and musical venues around town.

A final element in creating and sustaining the Athens musical culture was the University of Georgia <a href="Lamar%20Dodd%20School%20of%20Art">Lamar Dodd School of Art</a>. The great majority of Athens' musicians and their fan base were associated with the University's liberal arts curriculum, and the School of Art, rather than the music department, was the area where the creative and musical alliances that later defined the scene began forming in the 1970s. <a href="Michael%20Stipe">Michael Stipe</a> of R.E.M. was an art major (although he did not graduate), and the Art School incubated other major figures such as Curtis Crowe, founding member and drummer for <a href="Pylon%20%28band%29">Pylon</a>. The cinematographer for the documentary film "Athens GA: Inside/Out" was Jim Herbert, an art school professor. Herbert went on to direct music videos for a number of Athens bands, including 14 for R.E.M.
The B-52's and R.E.M. became by far the most famous musical products of Athens in the 1980s, when both bands launched a string of hits. Their roots in the city's local scene go back to the 1970s and early 1980s. The B-52's formed after a St. Valentine's Day party in 1977. The members had little musical knowledge, but performed <a href="new%20wave%20music">new wave music</a> with a cheeky and humorous image and sound. They were known for their <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">campy</a> thrift store fashion, and their unusual and eye-catching <a href="music%20video">music video</a>s for hits like "<a href="Rock%20Lobster">Rock Lobster</a>" and "<a href="Love%20Shack">Love Shack</a>". Though the B-52's were the first Athens band to achieve national prominence, their popularity was soon eclipsed by <a href="R.E.M.%20%28band%29">R.E.M.</a>. The future members of the band <a href="R.E.M.%20%28band%29">R.E.M.</a> moved to Athens to work and/or attend the University of Georgia, including bassist <a href="Mike%20Mills">Mike Mills</a> and former drummer <a href="Bill%20Berry">Bill Berry</a>. The group began performing as R.E.M. in 1980. They became locally prominent, and released a single, "<a href="Radio%20Free%20Europe%20%28song%29">Radio Free Europe</a>", that was a major <a href="college%20rock">college rock</a> hit. Their popularity grew with a series of singles, EPs and albums that made R.E.M. the top underground band in the country, finally breaking into the mainstream with 1987's "<a href="The%20One%20I%20Love%20%28R.E.M.%20song%29">The One I Love</a>" and "<a href="It%27s%20the%20End%20of%20the%20World%20as%20We%20Know%20It%20%28And%20I%20Feel%20Fine%29">It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)</a>". By 1991's "<a href="Out%20of%20Time%20%28album%29">Out of Time</a>" album — which featured vocals by <a href="Kate%20Pierson">Kate Pierson</a> of The B-52s — and its acclaimed follow-up "<a href="Automatic%20for%20the%20People">Automatic for the People</a>" (named after the motto of Weaver D's, a local Athens soul-food eatery), R.E.M. had become one of the world's biggest rock bands. The band's style went through many evolutions but originally had a <a href="jangle%20pop">jangle pop</a> sound and harmonies often compared to <a href="folk-rock">folk-rock</a> band <a href="The%20Byrds">The Byrds</a>; singer and songwriter <a href="Michael%20Stipe">Michael Stipe</a> is known for obscure, allusive lyrics delivered in a monotonous drone. The success of R.E.M. and the B-52's brought attention from major labels and music media to Athens, and many local bands received a career boost.

The band Pylon was a long-standing and influential part of the Athens scene, and became critical darlings in the 1980s, but never achieved significant mainstream success. This was partially because they eschewed several record contracts from the major labels due to a lack of trust in their corporate goodwill. Pylon's dance rock style was not very accessible or commercial, and was accompanied grating, chanting-style vocals, funky guitars and bass-heavy beats. Other 1980s local bands with nationwide alternative followings included <a href="Love%20Tractor">Love Tractor</a>, <a href="Oh-OK">Oh-OK</a>, with Michael Stipe's sister <a href="Lynda%20Stipe">Lynda Stipe</a>, vocalist Linda Hopper (later of Magnapop) and future solo performer <a href="Matthew%20Sweet">Matthew Sweet</a>, <a href="Dreams%20So%20Real">Dreams So Real</a>. The members of R.E.M. have remained fixtures in Athens as they have also become international stars, helping out local performers like <a href="Vic%20Chesnutt">Vic Chesnutt</a>, the <a href="Chickasaw%20Mudd%20Puppies">Chickasaw Mudd Puppies</a> and <a href="Jack%20Logan">Jack Logan</a>. The <a href="Elephant%206%20Collective">Elephant 6 Collective</a>, a group of like-minded indie bands, gained limited nationwide exposure starting in the mid-1990s with the rise of <a href="Neutral%20Milk%20Hotel">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>, <a href="Elf%20Power">Elf Power</a> and <a href="Olivia%20Tremor%20Control">Olivia Tremor Control</a>. The same period saw the <a href="Kindercore%20Records">Kindercore Records</a> roster find critical acclaim, including the bands <a href="Sunshine%20Fix">Sunshine Fix</a>, <a href="Masters%20of%20the%20Hemisphere">Masters of the Hemisphere</a>, <a href="Japancakes">Japancakes</a>, Love Tractor, Gresham Disco and <a href="Of%20Montreal">Of Montreal</a>. Candy, a DJ store owned by Michael Lachowski of Pylon, opened in 1998; the store became an important part of the burgeoning dance music scene that produced <a href="Danger%20Mouse%20%28musician%29">Danger Mouse</a>, <a href="Phungus">Phungus</a> and <a href="DJ%2043">DJ 43</a>.

Athens is near the <a href="Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> area of North Georgia; this is an important region in the development of several varieties of folk music, including the <a href="Appalachian%20folk%20music">Appalachian</a> <a href="bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a> style and the <a href="Piedmont%20blues">Piedmont blues</a>. North Georgia's bluegrass heritage can be traced back to the 19th century, when bluegrass was a nascent style throughout Appalachia and North Georgia was home to major fiddling contests, beginning in the 1880s. A 1983 recording expedition by Art and Margo Rosenbaum documented the continued existence of many forms of folk music, including work songs, string bands, African American hymns and <a href="spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a>, banjo tunes and unaccompanied ballads; the collection includes a chapter devoted to Doc and Lucy Barnes of Athens. Athens' modern contributions to the field of bluegrass include the <a href="Packway%20Handle%20Band">Packway Handle Band</a> and <a href="BlueBilly%20Grit">BlueBilly Grit</a>.

Athens' local country scene has never been as significant as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band <a href="Drive-By%20Truckers">Drive-By Truckers</a>, Power Play, and the Holman Autry Band, have done much in recent years to make <a href="country%20rock">country rock</a> a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as <a href="The%20Broken%20String%20Band">The Broken String Band</a> have emerged influenced by the <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a> genre. The rapper <a href="Bubba%20Sparxxx">Bubba Sparxxx</a>, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his <a href="Dirty%20South%20%28music%29">Dirty South</a> style of <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a>.

Folk artists and singer-songwriters have always flourished in the Athens atmosphere, albeit, as mentioned, not as significantly as Pop and Rock. Some of Athens' most notable solo singer-songwriter performers are <a href="Vic%20Chesnutt">Vic Chesnutt</a>, <a href="Corey%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Corey Smith</a>, T. Graham Brown, <a href="John%20Berry%20%28singer%29">John Berry</a>, <a href="Patterson%20Hood">Patterson Hood</a>, along with younger, emerging musicians like <a href="Thayer%20Sarrano">Thayer Sarrano</a> and T. Hardy Morris.

Athens also has an Irish band community representing several Irish folk bands (e.g. The Green Flag Band).

Athens also was the launching point for some nationally-recognized contemporary Christian music artists including <a href="Mark%20Heard">Mark Heard</a>, who started playing while a student at UGA, and the <a href="Vigilantes%20of%20Love">Vigilantes of Love</a>.

Recently, a <a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin music</a> scene has emerged with a diverse array of different musical styles that include <a href="bossa%20nova">bossa nova</a>, <a href="samba">samba</a>, <a href="salsa%20music">salsa music</a>, and <a href="tango">tango</a>. Notable groups include Grogus, Incatepec, <a href="Athens%20Tango%20Project">Athens Tango Project</a>, and Quiabo De Chapeu.

Recently, Athens has been home to several notable acts, including <a href="Kishi%20Bashi">Kishi Bashi</a>, <a href="Dead%20Confederate">Dead Confederate</a>, <a href="Futurebirds">Futurebirds</a>, <a href="Reptar%20%28band%29">Reptar</a>, <a href="The%20Whigs%20%28band%29">The Whigs</a>, New Madrid, <a href="of%20Montreal">of Montreal</a>, <a href="Perpetual%20Groove">Perpetual Groove</a>, <a href="Phosphorescent%20%28band%29">Phosphorescent</a> and <a href="Lera%20Lynn">Lera Lynn</a>.

Kindercore has pressed for artists such as <a href="Sufjan%20Stevens">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href="Cindy%20Wilson">Cindy Wilson</a>, and <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>. . The 2018 documentary, Athens Rising: The Sicyon Project: Volume One, presents stories about the arts in Athens and features several acts from this era, including <a href="Athens%20Tango%20Project">Athens Tango Project</a>, Dimmen, Potted Plant, Half Acid, Linqua Franqa, Scooterbabe, Cinemechanica, Waitress, Blue Bodies, A.

1994 San Marino Grand Prix

The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix (formally the 14° Gran Premio di San Marino) was a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor race held on 1 May 1994 at the <a href="Autodromo%20Enzo%20e%20Dino%20Ferrari">Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari</a>, located in <a href="Imola">Imola</a>, Italy. The <a href="San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">San Marino Grand Prix</a> was the third race of the <a href="1994%20Formula%20One%20season">1994 Formula One season</a>.

Fatalities and injuries at this Grand Prix proved to be a major turning point in both the 1994 season, and in the development of Formula One itself, particularly with regard to safety. The race weekend was marked by the deaths of Austrian driver <a href="Roland%20Ratzenberger">Roland Ratzenberger</a> and of three-time world champion <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a> in separate accidents. Other incidents saw driver <a href="Rubens%20Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a> injured and several mechanics and spectators injured. They were the first fatalities in the Formula One World Championship since the <a href="1982%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">1982 Canadian Grand Prix</a>, and the first with two driver deaths since the <a href="1960%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">1960 Belgian Grand Prix</a>.

<a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a>, driving for <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a>, won the race despite contact with <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a> (who dropped to the back of the field and battled back to finish sixth). <a href="Nicola%20Larini">Nicola Larini</a>, driving for <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>, scored the first points of his career when he achieved a podium finish in second position. <a href="Mika%20H%C3%A4kkinen">Mika Häkkinen</a> finished third in a <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a>.

The race led to an increased emphasis on safety in the sport as well as the reforming of the <a href="Grand%20Prix%20Drivers%27%20Association">Grand Prix Drivers' Association</a> after a 12-year hiatus, and the changing of many track layouts and car designs. Since the race, numerous regulation changes have been made to slow Formula One cars down and new <a href="Race%20track">circuits</a> incorporate large run-off areas to slow cars before they collide with a wall. Senna was given a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> in his home town of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, where around 500,000 people lined the streets to watch the coffin pass. Italian prosecutors charged six people with manslaughter in connection with <a href="Death%20of%20Ayrton%20Senna">Senna's death</a>, all of whom were later acquitted. The case took more than 11 years to conclude due to an appeal and a retrial following the original verdict of not guilty.

As a result of increased standards in safety following this race, there was a 20-year gap between the deaths of Ratzenberger and Senna, and the crash of <a href="Jules%20Bianchi">Jules Bianchi</a> at the <a href="2014%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">2014 Japanese Grand Prix</a> which led to his death the following year.

Heading into the third round of the season, <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> driver <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> was leading the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">World Drivers' Championship</a> with 20 points; <a href="Jordan%20Grand%20Prix">Jordan</a> driver <a href="Rubens%20Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a> was second on seven points, 13 points behind Schumacher. Behind Schumacher and Barrichello was <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a> in third place on six points, tied on points with <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> driver <a href="Gerhard%20Berger">Gerhard Berger</a>. Berger's teammate <a href="Jean%20Alesi">Jean Alesi</a> was fifth on four points. In the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">World Constructors' Championship</a>, Benetton were leading on 20 points and Ferrari were second on ten points, with Jordan third on seven points.

There were two driver changes heading into the race. <a href="JJ%20Lehto">JJ Lehto</a> replaced <a href="Jos%20Verstappen">Jos Verstappen</a> at Benetton, the latter having replaced Lehto for the opening two races of the season due to an injury sustained by Lehto in pre-season testing. <a href="Aguri%20Suzuki">Aguri Suzuki</a> was replaced with <a href="Andrea%20de%20Cesaris">Andrea de Cesaris</a> at Jordan.

On Friday, 29 April, during the first qualifying session to determine the starting order for the race, <a href="Rubens%20Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a>, a driver for Jordan, hit a kerb at the "Variante Bassa" corner at 140 mph (225 km/h), launching him into the air. He hit the top of the tyre barrier, and was knocked unconscious. His car rolled several times after landing before coming to rest upside down. Medical teams treated him at the crash site, and he was taken to the circuit's medical centre before being transferred to <a href="Ospedale%20Maggiore%20di%20Bologna">Maggiore Hospital</a> in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> by helicopter for routine tests and observation to be carried out. He returned to the race meeting the next day, although his broken nose and a plaster cast on his arm forced him to sit out the rest of the race weekend. Ten years after the incident, <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a>, who drove for the <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams-Renault</a> team at the time, described the feeling after the crash: "We all brushed ourselves off and carried on qualifying, reassured that our cars were tough as tanks and we could be shaken but not hurt."

Despite a spin, Senna was the fastest driver at the end of Friday's session with a time of 1:21.548, almost five-tenths of a second faster than Schumacher and Berger. Senna's teammate <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a> was seventh, having spun himself, over 1.6 seconds behind Senna.

Twenty minutes into the final qualifying session, Austrian driver <a href="Roland%20Ratzenberger">Roland Ratzenberger</a> failed to negotiate the "Villeneuve curva" in his <a href="Simtek">Simtek</a>; he subsequently hit the opposing concrete barrier wall almost head-on and was critically injured. Although the survival cell remained largely intact, the force of the impact inflicted a <a href="basal%20skull%20fracture">basal skull fracture</a>. Ratzenberger, in his first season as a Formula One driver, had run over a kerb at the "Acque Minerali" chicane on his previous lap, the impact of which is believed to have damaged his front wing. Rather than return to the pitlane, he continued on another fast lap. Travelling at 190 mph (306 km/h) his car suffered a <a href="Formula%20One%20car%23Wings">front wing</a> failure leaving him unable to control it.

The session was stopped while doctors attended to Ratzenberger. After initially being taken by ambulance to the on-circuit medical centre, he was airlifted to Maggiore Hospital shortly after, the second driver to be admitted there during the weekend. The session was restarted approximately 25 minutes later, but several teams—including Williams and Benetton—took no further part. Later in hospital, it was announced that Ratzenberger had died as a result of his multiple injuries. His death marked the first Formula One race weekend fatality since the <a href="1982%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">1982 Canadian Grand Prix</a> when <a href="Riccardo%20Paletti">Riccardo Paletti</a> was killed. It had been eight years since <a href="Elio%20de%20Angelis">Elio de Angelis</a> died testing a <a href="Brabham">Brabham</a> car at the <a href="Circuit%20Paul%20Ricard">Circuit Paul Ricard</a>. Professor <a href="Sid%20Watkins">Sid Watkins</a>, then head of the Formula One on-track medical team, recalled in his memoirs <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a>'s reaction to the news, stating that "Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder." Watkins tried to persuade Senna not to race the following day, asking "What else do you need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing." Senna replied, "Sid, there are certain things over which we have no control. I cannot quit, I have to go on."

Senna had qualified on <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, having not set a lap time following Ratzenberger's death. He was joined on the front row by Schumacher and Berger qualified in 3rd. Damon Hill was able to improve on his disastrous Friday session before the red flag, improving his time by one second and qualifying fourth as a result. A time posted by Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and final position on the grid; <a href="Paul%20Belmondo">Paul Belmondo</a> and Barrichello did not qualify.

The race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 <a href="Central%20European%20Summer%20Time">CEST</a> (<a href="UTC">UTC</a>+2), in dry and sunny weather. At the start of the race, <a href="J.J.%20Lehto">J.J. Lehto</a> stalled his Benetton on the grid. <a href="Pedro%20Lamy">Pedro Lamy</a>, starting from further back on the grid, had his view of the stationary Benetton blocked by other cars and hit the back of Lehto's car, causing bodywork and tyres to fly into the air. Parts of the car went over the safety fencing designed to protect spectators at the startline causing minor injuries to nine people. Further back, Martin Brundle had a good start, overtaking two cars as well as Lehto, propelling him from thirteenth to tenth place.

The incident between Lehto and Lamy caused the <a href="safety%20car">safety car</a> to be deployed, with all the remaining competitors holding position behind it while travelling at a reduced speed. During this period, as a result of travelling at slower speeds, tyre temperatures dropped. At the drivers' briefing before the race, Senna, along with <a href="Gerhard%20Berger">Gerhard Berger</a>, had expressed concern that the safety car (itself only reintroduced in Formula One in 1993 and only the third time used since then, the other occurrences being the <a href="1993%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">1993 Brazilian Grand Prix</a> and the <a href="1993%20British%20Grand%20Prix">1993 British Grand Prix</a>) did not go fast enough to keep tyre temperatures high. Senna was also worried by a procedure introduced at the <a href="1994%20Pacific%20Grand%20Prix">1994 Pacific Grand Prix</a>, whereby the safety car would lead the grid on the <a href="formation%20lap">formation lap</a>, rather than letting the race leader choose the pace of the formation lap. The procedure was removed for this race. The safety car chosen for the event, an Opel Vectra, traveled very slowly on the track, even when the reduced speeds of a safety car period were factored in, and Senna pulled alongside it several times, urging the driver to increase his speed. It was later learned the car's brakes had been overwhelmed and started fading on the first lap, and thus the driver had to reduce his speed to avoid the possibility of the safety car itself causing an accident.

Once the track was reported clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn and the race restarted on lap five. <a href="Jonathan%20Palmer">Jonathan Palmer</a>, commentating alongside <a href="Murray%20Walker">Murray Walker</a> for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as his time in the warm-up session on Sunday morning gave rise to speculation that he was going to make one pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. <a href="Martin%20Brundle">Martin Brundle</a> had told BBC presenter <a href="Steve%20Rider">Steve Rider</a> that <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a> were going to make two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190 mph (306 km/h) to 131 mph (211 km/h), hit the concrete wall, with debris flying into the path of the other drivers.

At 14:17 local time, a red flag was shown to indicate the race was stopped and FIA race doctor <a href="Sid%20Watkins">Sid Watkins</a> arrived at the scene to treat Senna. When a race is stopped under a red flag, cars must slow down and make their way back to the pit lane or starting grid unless notified of a restart. This protects <a href="Marshal%23Racing%20and%20other%20competitions">race marshals</a> and medical staff at the crash scene, and allows easier access for medical cars to the incident. Approximately 10 minutes after Senna's crash, the <a href="Larrousse">Larrousse</a> team mistakenly allowed one of their drivers, <a href="%C3%89rik%20Comas">Érik Comas</a>, to leave the pits despite the circuit being closed under red flags. Marshals frantically waved him down as he approached the scene of the accident travelling at close to full speed. Eurosport commentator <a href="John%20Watson%20%28racing%20driver%29">John Watson</a> described the incident as "the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at any time in my life". Comas avoided hitting any of the people or cars that were on the circuit but after going over towards Senna's accident scene, he was so distressed at what he saw that he withdrew from the race.

The pictures shown on the world feed (supplied by host broadcaster <a href="RAI">RAI</a>) of Senna being treated were considered by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> (the corporation responsible for broadcasting the San Marino Grand Prix to viewers in the United Kingdom) to be too upsetting for general viewing at the time (around 13:20 GMT), and the BBC abandoned RAI's world feed to focus on their own camera in the pit lane. BBC commentator <a href="Murray%20Walker">Murray Walker</a> has frequently talked about how upsetting it was to have to talk to viewers whilst avoiding mentioning the images shown on RAI. Referring to the number of times the incident was replayed on the world feed, Ferrari team principal Jean Todt stated that "even if you didn't want to watch it, you could barely fail to". Senna was lifted from the wrecked Williams, and after approximately fifteen minutes of on-site medical attention, was airlifted directly to Maggiore Hospital, becoming the third and final driver to be admitted there during the weekend. Medical teams continued to treat him during the flight. Thirty-seven minutes after the crash, at 2:55 pm local time, the race was restarted.

The race was restarted from the beginning of lap 6. The first five laps would be added to the second part of the race and the overall result would be decided on aggregate. The race ran to a total of 58 laps, five from the first section and 53 from the second section.

On the second formation lap, <a href="Heinz-Harald%20Frentzen">Heinz-Harald Frentzen</a> stalled his Sauber whilst attempting to leave the grid and was forced to start from the pitlane. The other cars started from the grid in the order they were at the point the race was stopped. Michael Schumacher had a poor start and Gerhard Berger took the lead on track (but Schumacher still led the race overall due to the amount of time he was ahead of Berger before the race was stopped). Hill, from third, made contact attempting to overtake Schumacher at the Tosa corner, dropping Hill to the back of the field and was forced to make a pitstop in order to fit a new nose cone. Hill battled back to finish in sixth position.

Schumacher took the lead on track on lap 12 when Berger ran wide, before relinquishing the race lead overall to Berger when he made his first pitstop, confirming that his pace both before and after the red flag was down to him running a three-stop strategy, therefore racing with a lighter car. Berger pitted at the end of lap 15 for his first of two scheduled stops, before retiring a lap later with handling problems. Häkkinen led his first ever laps of a Formula One World Championship race, before pitting at the end of lap 18. Following the first series of pit stops, Schumacher resumed the race lead.

Schumacher's extra pace as a result of his lighter fuel loads meant he was able to pull out enough of a gap to Häkkinen which enabled him to make an extra pit stop. Häkkinen's pace was very slow, allowing <a href="Nicola%20Larini">Nicola Larini</a> to leapfrog him when the two-stoppers made their final pit stops.

On lap 48, <a href="Michele%20Alboreto">Michele Alboreto</a> came in for a pit stop, but as he left, the rear-right wheel came loose from the Minardi as it left the pit lane, striking two Ferrari and two Lotus mechanics, who were left needing hospital treatment.

Meanwhile towards the end of the race <a href="Christian%20Fittipaldi">Christian Fittipaldi</a> would eventually retired his Footwork with brake problems on lap 55 but would be classified 13th whilst battling for 5th with <a href="Ukyo%20Katayama">Ukyo Katayama</a>'s Tyrrell & <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a>'s Williams. 

Towards the end of the race, Häkkinen's pace was so slow that <a href="Karl%20Wendlinger">Karl Wendlinger</a> was catching him in the <a href="Sauber">Sauber</a>, aiming to give Sauber their first podium finish. However, Häkkinen was able to resist Wendlinger's challenge and finish in third place, with Wendlinger fourth. <a href="Ukyo%20Katayama">Ukyo Katayama</a> finished fifth for <a href="Tyrrell%20Racing">Tyrrell</a> and Hill was able to battle back to finish sixth, the last of the points-scorers.

Michael Schumacher won the race ahead of Larini and Häkkinen, giving him a maximum 30 points after 3 rounds of the <a href="1994%20Formula%20One%20season">1994 Formula One season</a>. It was the only podium finish of Larini's career, and the first of just two occasions when he scored world championship points. <a href="Karl%20Wendlinger">Karl Wendlinger</a> rode back to the pits on Häkkinen's McLaren after Wendlinger's car broke down on the slowing-down lap. At the podium ceremony, out of respect for Roland Ratzenberger, who had died the day before, no champagne was sprayed.

In the press conference following the race, Schumacher said that he "couldn't feel satisfied, couldn't feel happy" with his win following the events that had occurred during the race weekend. Two hours and 20 minutes after Schumacher crossed the finish line, at 6:40 pm local time, Dr. Maria Teresa Fiandri announced that Ayrton Senna had died. The official time of death was given, however, as 2:17 pm local time, meaning that Senna had been killed instantly. The autopsy recorded the cause of death as head injuries likely caused by an impact from a wheel and suspension. <a href="BBC%20Television">BBC Television</a> commentator <a href="Murray%20Walker">Murray Walker</a> described it as "the blackest day for Grand Prix racing that I can remember".

On 3 May, the FIA called a meeting at the request of the Italian Automobile Club to review the events of the Weekend. Later on, the governing body announced new safety measures for the next round in <a href="1994%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco</a> which included the entry and exit of the pitlane to be controlled by a curve to force cars to run at a reduced speed, no team mechanic would be allowed onto the pit lane surface except for pit stops and a draw would be arranged to determine the order in which cars make pit stops and be limited to emergencies with cars not taking on new tyres or allowed to refuel.

Senna was given a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> in São Paulo, Brazil on 5 May 1994. Approximately 500,000 people lined the streets to watch the coffin pass. Senna's rival <a href="Alain%20Prost">Alain Prost</a> was among the pallbearers. The majority of the Formula One community attended Senna's funeral; however the president of the sport's governing body, the FIA, <a href="Max%20Mosley">Max Mosley</a> attended the funeral of Ratzenberger instead which took place on 7 May 1994 in <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>, Austria. Mosley said in a press conference ten years later, "I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his."
The 1994 Imola layout, which had been in place since 1981, was never again used for a Formula One race. The circuit was heavily modified following the race, including a change at Tamburello—also the scene of major accidents for <a href="Gerhard%20Berger">Gerhard Berger</a> (<a href="1989%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">1989</a>) and <a href="Nelson%20Piquet">Nelson Piquet</a> (<a href="1987%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">1987</a>)—from a high speed corner to a much slower <a href="chicane">chicane</a>. The FIA also changed the regulations governing Formula One car design, to the extent that the 1995 regulations required all teams to create completely new designs, as their 1994 cars could not be adapted to them. The concern raised at the drivers briefing the morning of the race, by Senna and Berger, would lead to the <a href="Grand%20Prix%20Drivers%27%20Association">Grand Prix Drivers' Association</a> reforming at the following race, the <a href="1994%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">1994 Monaco Grand Prix</a>. The GPDA, which was founded in 1961, had previously disbanded in 1982. The primary purpose of it reforming was to allow drivers to discuss safety issues with a view to improve standards following the incidents at Imola. The front two grid slots at the Monaco Grand Prix that year, which were painted with Brazilian and Austrian flags, were left clear in memory of the two drivers who had lost their lives, while both Williams and Simtek entered only one car each. Additionally, a minute of silence was observed before the race.

In October 1996 FIA set about researching a driver restraint system for head-on impacts, in conjunction with McLaren and Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes contacted the makers of the <a href="HANS">HANS</a> (Head and Neck Support) device, with a view to adapting it for Formula One. The HANS device was first released in 1991 and was designed to restrain the head and neck in the event of an accident to avoid basal skull fracture, the injury which killed Ratzenberger. Initial tests proved successful, and at the <a href="2000%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">2000 San Marino Grand Prix</a> the final report was released which concluded that the HANS should be recommended for use. Its use was made compulsory from the start of the 2003 season.

Senna was the last driver for twenty years to die in a Formula One accident, until the death of <a href="Jules%20Bianchi">Jules Bianchi</a> in 2015 from injuries sustained at the <a href="2014%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">2014 Japanese Grand Prix</a>. However, three trackside marshals were killed during those years as a direct result of such crashes: <a href="Paolo%20Gislimberti">Paolo Gislimberti</a> at the <a href="2000%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">2000 Italian Grand Prix</a>, Graham Beveridge at the <a href="2001%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">2001 Australian Grand Prix</a> and Mark Robinson at the <a href="2013%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">2013 Canadian Grand Prix</a>.

Italian prosecutors brought legal proceedings against six people in connection with <a href="Death%20of%20Ayrton%20Senna">Senna's death</a>. They were <a href="Frank%20Williams%20%28Formula%20One%29">Frank Williams</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Head">Patrick Head</a> and <a href="Adrian%20Newey">Adrian Newey</a> of <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams</a>; Fedrico Bendinelli representing the owners of the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari; Giorgio Poggi as the circuit director and <a href="Roland%20Bruynseraede">Roland Bruynseraede</a> who was race director and sanctioned the circuit. The trial verdict was given on 16 December 1997, clearing all six defendants of manslaughter charges. The cause of Senna's accident was established by the court as the steering column breaking. The column had been cut and <a href="welding">welded</a> back together at Senna's request in order for him to be more comfortable in the car.

Following the court's decision, an appeal was lodged by the state prosecutor against Patrick Head and Adrian Newey. On 22 November 1999, the appeal absolved Head and Newey of all charges, stating that no new evidence had come to light (there was missing data from the black box recorder on Senna's car due to damage, and 1.6 seconds of video from the onboard camera of Senna's car was unavailable because the broadcaster switched to another car's camera just before the accident), and so under Article 530 of the Italian Penal Code, the accusation had to be declared as "non-existent or the fact doesn't subsist". This appeal result was annulled in January 2003, as the <a href="Court%20of%20Cassation%20%28Italy%29">Court of Cassation</a> believed that Article 530 was misinterpreted, and a retrial was ordered. On 27 May 2005, Newey was acquitted of all charges while Head's case was "timed out" under a statute of limitations. The Italian Court of Appeal, on 13 April 2007, stated the following in the verdict numbered 15050: "It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control". Even being found responsible for Senna's accident, Patrick Head was not arrested, as the verdict was delivered past the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter.

<a href="Liverpool%20Data%20Research%20Associates">Liverpool Data Research Associates</a> (LDRA) were called in to investigate allegations of cheating using banned driving aids, such as <a href="traction%20control">traction control</a> and <a href="launch%20control%20%28automotive%29">launch control</a>, both prohibited at the start of the year. The top three cars of <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a>, <a href="Nicola%20Larini">Nicola Larini</a> and <a href="Mika%20H%C3%A4kkinen">Mika Häkkinen</a> were investigated and their teams were asked to surrender their systems' source code to the company. Larini's team, <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>, complied in light of allegations that they were cheating, but Schumacher and Häkkinen's teams, <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> and <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a> refused, claiming copyright reasons. After being fined $100,000 by the <a href="FIA">FIA</a>, both teams complied eight days after the race. LDRA discovered that McLaren were running a programme that permitted <a href="automatic%20gearbox">automatic gearshifts</a> but the car was declared legal.

Benetton sent an alternative suggestion to the company on 10 May 1994, accepted by LDRA five days later. Tests on the <a href="Benetton%20B194">car</a> were to be carried out on 28 June 1994, but were cancelled. The tests eventually took place on 6 July 1994. LDRA found the tests unsatisfactory. Benetton therefore complied with the original request, the source code, on 18 July 1994. Analysis of the software found that it included <a href="launch%20control%20%28automotive%29">launch control</a>, a banned aid. Benetton stated that "it can only be switched on by recompilation of the code." However LDRA found this to be untrue; launch control could be switched on by connecting a computer to the <a href="gearbox%20control%20unit">gearbox control unit</a>. Benetton conceded that this was possible but this "came as a surprise to them". To switch the system on, the user is presented with a menu with 10 visible options. "Launch Control" was not visibly listed as an option, however, should the user scroll down to option 13, launch control could be enabled.

Doomsday (Doctor Who)

"Doomsday" is the thirteenth and final episode in the <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28series%202%29">second series</a> of the revival of the British <a href="science%20fiction%20television">science fiction television</a> programme "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>". It was first broadcast on 8 July 2006 and is the conclusion of a two-part story; the first part, "<a href="Army%20of%20Ghosts">Army of Ghosts</a>", was broadcast on 1 July 2006. The two-part story features the <a href="Dalek">Dalek</a>s, presumed extinct after the events of <a href="The%20Parting%20of%20the%20Ways">the 2005 series' finale</a>, and the <a href="Cyberman">Cybermen</a>, who appeared in a <a href="parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">parallel universe</a> in the 2006 episodes "<a href="Rise%20of%20the%20Cybermen">Rise of the Cybermen</a>" and "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Steel">The Age of Steel</a>". Both species unexpectedly arrive on Earth at the conclusion of "Army of Ghosts".

The concept of the Daleks and the Cybermen both appearing on-screen was first proposed in 1967, but was vetoed by <a href="Terry%20Nation">Terry Nation</a>, the creator of the Daleks. The episode is the first conflict between the two species in "Doctor Who"s -year history, and features <a href="Billie%20Piper">Billie Piper</a>'s last appearance in the lead <a href="companion%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">companion</a> role as <a href="Rose%20Tyler">Rose Tyler</a>; the final regular appearance of <a href="Noel%20Clarke">Noel Clarke</a> as Rose's ex-boyfriend and previous companion <a href="Mickey%20Smith">Mickey Smith</a>; and the final regular appearances of <a href="Camille%20Coduri">Camille Coduri</a> and <a href="Shaun%20Dingwall">Shaun Dingwall</a> as Rose's parents, <a href="Jackie%20Tyler">Jackie</a> and <a href="Pete%20Tyler">Pete Tyler</a>. The episode and its predecessor were filmed between November 2005 and January 2006, alongside the episodes "Rise of the Cybermen" and "The Age of Steel".

Set mainly in the <a href="One%20Canada%20Square">One Canada Square</a> skyscraper in <a href="Canary%20Wharf">Canary Wharf</a>, the episode's plot consists mostly of the Daleks and Cybermen waging a global war, with humanity on the verge of extinction in the cataclysm. The <a href="Tenth%20Doctor">Tenth Doctor</a> (<a href="David%20Tennant">David Tennant</a>), the Tyler family, and Mickey Smith fight for their lives trying to reverse the situation. They are successful, but at an emotional cost to the Doctor and Rose, as they are left in separate universes.

The episode is one of the most popular "Doctor Who" episodes since the show's revival. It was nominated, along with "Army of Ghosts", for the 2007 <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dramatic%20Presentation%2C%20Short%20Form">Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form</a>; the award was won by the fourth episode in the series, "<a href="The%20Girl%20in%20the%20Fireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace</a>". It shared the revived series' highest <a href="Appreciation%20Index">Audience Appreciation</a> rating of 89 with "<a href="The%20Parting%20of%20the%20Ways">The Parting of the Ways</a>", "<a href="Silence%20in%20the%20Library">Silence in the Library</a>", and "<a href="Forest%20of%20the%20Dead">Forest of the Dead</a>" until 28 June 2008—"<a href="The%20Stolen%20Earth">The Stolen Earth</a>" gained an AI rating of 91—and is favoured by most critics for both the Dalek-Cyberman conflict and the farewell scene between the Doctor and Rose.

Four <a href="Dalek">Dalek</a>s, accompanied by a device known as the "Genesis Ark", have emerged from the Void ship inside the <a href="Torchwood%20Institute">Torchwood Institute</a>'s sphere chamber. The <a href="Cyberman">Cybermen</a> who took control of Torchwood confront the Daleks, offering an alliance. The Daleks decline and kill two Cybermen, causing the Cyber Leader to declare war on the Daleks.

A strike team from the parallel universe takes <a href="Tenth%20Doctor">the Doctor</a> to meet with <a href="Pete%20Tyler">Pete Tyler</a>. After hearing that the parallel Earth has started warming at an unprecedented rate following the opening of the breach between the two Earths, the Doctor theorises this is the start of the process that will lead to both planets falling into the Void.

In the sphere chamber, the Doctor realises that the four Daleks are the enigmatic <a href="Cult%20of%20Skaro">Cult of Skaro</a>, and brings the Cybermen in to attack. <a href="Mickey%20Smith">Mickey</a> accidentally activates the Ark while escaping with the Doctor, <a href="Rose%20Tyler">Rose</a>, and Pete. Dalek Sec takes the Ark outside. Pete saves <a href="Jackie%20Tyler">Jackie</a> from the Cybermen and the two embrace. The Doctor then takes everyone to the control room. Outside, the Ark — a prison ship — opens. Millions of Daleks pour out and begin killing humans and Cybermen on the ground.

The Doctor explains that if he opens the breach and reverses it, anyone who has travelled between the two separate worlds will be pulled in, including Rose, Mickey and Pete. The Doctor sends them along with Jackie to the parallel universe. Rose jumps back to help the Doctor. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in, but the Cult of Skaro escapes. Rose starts to fall towards the Void, but at the last second, Pete transports Rose back to the parallel universe as the breach is closed.

Some time later, Rose has a dream where she hears the Doctor's voice calling her. The Tylers follow the voice to a remote bay in Norway where a holographic image of the Doctor appears. He tells Rose he is using the energy of a supernova to transmit to her via one last small breach between universes. Rose breaks down in tears and tells the Doctor that she loves him; before the Doctor can finish his reply, the breach seals and the Doctor's image disappears. As he gets back to piloting the <a href="TARDIS">TARDIS</a>, he notices a mysterious woman in a wedding dress standing inside.

The concept of the Daleks and Cybermen appearing together on screen is not new; in December 1967, the BBC approached <a href="Terry%20Nation">Terry Nation</a> to have both races in a serial, but Nation vetoed this idea. The concept came to Davies while mapping out the 2006 series: the story would both serve to resurrect the popular Daleks and provide a suitable exit for Piper, who had decided to leave "Doctor Who" after two series. "Doomsday" is the first episode in the history of "Doctor Who" where the Cybermen and the Daleks appear on-screen together; Cybermen and Daleks were both featured in "<a href="The%20Five%20Doctors">The Five Doctors</a>" and "<a href="Army%20of%20Ghosts">Army of Ghosts</a>", but in separate scenes.

The two-part finale was originally going to take place in Cardiff on the <a href="Cardiff%20Rift">time rift</a>, which was the focus of the episodes "<a href="The%20Unquiet%20Dead">The Unquiet Dead</a>" and "<a href="Boom%20Town%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Boom Town</a>". When "Torchwood" was commissioned in 2005, Davies decided to base the spin-off in Cardiff and relocate "Army of Ghosts" and "Doomsday" to <a href="Canary%20Wharf">Canary Wharf</a> in London.

An item of discussion between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose; Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise that he had accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter. The Doctor's intended reply to Rose was also discussed; Davies, who left the reply unspecified, stated he didn't know when asked by Collinson on the episode's <a href="DVD%20commentary">commentary track</a>, and Gardner vehemently believed the Doctor would reciprocate Rose's love.

Some elements of the story were inspired by <a href="Philip%20Pullman">Philip Pullman</a>'s "<a href="His%20Dark%20Materials">His Dark Materials</a>" trilogy. Pullman was "flattered" by the references in the episode, and compared Davies' actions to his own practice of referencing works.

To ensure that Clarke and Dingwall were available for filming, the story was filmed in the season's third production block with "<a href="Rise%20of%20the%20Cybermen">Rise of the Cybermen</a>" and "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Steel">The Age of Steel</a>". Filming for the story started on 2 November 2005 on location in <a href="Kennington">Kennington</a>, London, but did not become the primary focus of the production crew until 29 November, when filming began on the scenes in and around the sphere chamber. The scene of the Tylers driving through Norway was filmed at Bridgend on 6 December. Scenes in the lever room, the main setting for the story, were filmed on 12–15 December 2005 and 3–5 January 2006. <a href="Greenscreen">Greenscreen</a> work for Rose being sucked into the void took place on 13 January, and the skirmish between the military and Cybermen on the bridge was filmed on 15 January.

Other location shooting took place at the Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square, <a href="Cardiff%20Bay">Cardiff Bay</a>. The penultimate scene of the episode, the Doctor's farewell to Rose, was filmed on 16 January 2006; it was the last day of filming for Clarke and Dingwall. As with all scenes set at Bad Wolf Bay, these were in fact filmed at <a href="Southerndown">Southerndown</a> beach in the <a href="Vale%20of%20Glamorgan">Vale of Glamorgan</a>. Piper's last scene was Rose's reunion with the Doctor in "<a href="The%20Satan%20Pit">The Satan Pit</a>" on 31 March, but the shoot was rather emotional, to the point there were several tears on set. The last scene of "Doomsday", Catherine Tate's appearance in the TARDIS as <a href="Donna%20Noble">Donna Noble</a> (credited as "The Bride"), was filmed on 31 March during the <a href="wrap%20party">wrap party</a>. To ensure the secrecy of Rose's departure and Tate's appearance, only Piper and Tennant were given scripts of the departure scene, and director Graeme Harper was not informed of the final scene until the last possible second.

As well as using existing music, such as the themes for the Daleks, Cybermen, and Rose, <a href="Murray%20Gold">Murray Gold</a> specially composed a piece of music for Rose's farewell entitled "Doomsday", which featured vocal work from <a href="Melanie%20Pappenheim">Melanie Pappenheim</a>. Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies and the rest of the production team had expected, Gold took a minimalist approach. When pitching the track to the production team, Gold described the track as representing Rose's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor. He later said, "I wanted to get that kind of throbbing, sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock, because I thought that's what Rose would do if she was hurting and ran up to her bedroom and locked herself in her room and had a good old cry, really." The piece uses the same vocal work from "<a href="Rose%20%28Doctor%20Who%20episode%29">Rose</a>", when Rose first enters the TARDIS, thus creating a <a href="framing%20device">bookend effect</a>. It is a favourite among fans and of executive producer Julie Gardner, and is one of the reasons, along with Pappenheim's overall contribution and the "Song for Ten" from "<a href="The%20Christmas%20Invasion">The Christmas Invasion</a>", that the was released several months later.

To protect as much information concerning the episode as possible, the final scene of "Army of Ghosts" was withheld from all pre-screeners given to reviewers. The BBC website's Fear Forecasters, a panel who rate the episodes, were not allowed to see "Doomsday" before its airing, and access to copies was restricted; the website thus does not have a Fear Forecast for the episode. Despite this, the Dalek Sec prop, which had been previously unused in the series, had invaded the stage at the 2006 <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Awards">BAFTA Television Awards</a> while the production team were collecting an award. A similar moratorium would be placed on the following series' finale, "<a href="Last%20of%20the%20Time%20Lords">Last of the Time Lords</a>".

The episode's finalised average viewing figure was 8.22 million viewers and was, excepting World Cup games, the second most-watched television programme of the week, behind an episode of "<a href="Coronation%20Street">Coronation Street</a>", and eighth most-watched overall. The companion episode of "<a href="Doctor%20Who%20Confidential">Doctor Who Confidential</a>" gained just over one million viewers, making it the second most watched programme on a non-terrestrial channel that week. The ratings for the episode were higher than the following <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> match between <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a> and <a href="Portugal%20national%20football%20team">Portugal</a>, which had a million fewer viewers.

"Doomsday" is one of the most popular episodes of the revived "Doctor Who". It gained an audience <a href="Appreciation%20Index">Appreciation Index</a> (AI) of 89, which was the highest figure for nearly two years—it was later surpassed by "<a href="The%20Stolen%20Earth">The Stolen Earth</a>", which had an AI of 91—and is the first episode of "Doctor Who" to receive a perfect 10 rating on "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>", who congratulated Davies on making an action-packed episode so emotional. "<a href="Television%20Without%20Pity">Television Without Pity</a>" gave the episode an A+ rating. "<a href="The%20Stage">The Stage</a>" commented that the Dalek-Cybermen conflict was the "only thing worth watching" at the weekend, overshadowing even the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">World Cup Final</a>, and that the parting scene was "beautifully written and movingly played," with "not a dry eye in the universe". Dek Hogan of "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>" felt that the episode was "beautifully balanced and with moments of high excitement and touching poignancy" and that the single oil tear shed by the Cyberman version of Hartman was a "nice touch". He criticised Catherine Tate's appearance as being unnecessary to end the episode and for "breaking the mood". Stephen Brook of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" thought that the episode was "a highpoint of the modern series, highly emotional, scary and genuinely exciting", while Rose's departure was "brilliantly handled". He positively compared the episode's plot of a war between "the greatest monsters in the programme history" against the film "<a href="Alien%20vs.%20Predator%20%28film%29">Alien vs. Predator</a>".

After its initial airing, the episode was released on DVD, with "<a href="Fear%20Her">Fear Her</a>" and "<a href="Army%20of%20Ghosts">Army of Ghosts</a>", on 25 September 2006. It was first aired on <a href="CBC%20Television">CBC Television</a> on 19 February 2007. The story ("Army of Ghosts" and "Doomsday") was one of three from the second series of "Doctor Who" to be nominated for the <a href="2007%20Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dramatic%20Presentation%2C%20Short%20Form">2007</a> <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> for <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dramatic%20Presentation%2C%20Short%20Form">Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form</a>; the other stories nominated were "<a href="School%20Reunion%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">School Reunion</a>" and "<a href="The%20Girl%20in%20the%20Fireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace</a>", the latter winning the award.

In a poll by "<a href="SFX%20%28magazine%29">SFX</a>", 90,000 readers voted the farewell scene between the Doctor and Rose at Bad Wolf Bay as the greatest Sci-fi moment ever.

Frank Pick

Frank Pick <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Hon. RIBA</a> (23 November 1878 – 7 November 1941) was a British transport administrator. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1902, he worked at the <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">North Eastern Railway</a>, before moving to the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Electric Railways Company of London</a> (UERL) in 1906. He was <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a> and vice-chairman of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> from its creation in 1933 until 1940.

Pick had a strong interest in design and its use in public life. He steered the development of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>'s <a href="corporate%20identity">corporate identity</a> by commissioning eye-catching <a href="commercial%20art">commercial art</a>, <a href="graphic%20design">graphic design</a> and modern architecture, establishing a highly recognisable brand, including the first versions of the roundel and <a href="Johnston%20%28typeface%29">typeface</a> still used today. Under his direction, the UERL's Underground network and associated bus services expanded considerably reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to him being likened to <a href="Georges-Eug%C3%A8ne%20Haussmann">Baron Haussmann</a> and <a href="Robert%20Moses">Robert Moses</a>.

Pick's interest extended beyond his own organisation; he was a founding member and later served as President of the <a href="Design%20and%20Industries%20Association">Design and Industries Association</a>. He was also the first chairman of the Council for Art and Industry and regularly wrote and lectured on design and <a href="urban%20planning">urban planning</a> subjects. For the government, Pick prepared the transport plan for the mass <a href="Evacuations%20of%20civilians%20in%20Britain%20during%20World%20War%20II">evacuation of civilians</a> from London at the outbreak of war and produced reports on the wartime use of canals and ports.

Frank Pick was born on 23 November 1878 at <a href="Spalding%2C%20Lincolnshire">Spalding</a>, <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. He was the first child of five born to <a href="draper">draper</a> Francis Pick and his wife Fanny Pick (née Clarke). Pick's paternal grandfather, Charles Pick, was a farmer in Spalding who died in his forties, leaving eight children. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Clarke, was a blacksmith and <a href="Wesleyanism">Wesleyan</a> <a href="laity">lay preacher</a>. As a child, Pick was bookish, preferring to read and build collections of moths and butterflies and objects found on the beach rather than take part in sports.

Before becoming a draper, Pick's father had had an ambition to become a lawyer and he encouraged his son to follow this career. Pick attended <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20School%2C%20York">St Peter's School</a> in <a href="York">York</a> on a <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a>, and was <a href="articled%20clerk">articled</a> to a York solicitor, George Crombie, in March 1897. He qualified in January 1902 and completed a law degree at the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> in the same year, but did not apply to practice.

In 1902, Pick began working for the North Eastern Railway. He worked first in the company's traffic statistics department before becoming assistant to the company's general manager, Sir <a href="George%20Gibb">George Gibb</a> in 1904. In 1904, Pick married Mabel Mary Caroline Woodhouse. The couple had no children.

In 1906, Gibb was appointed managing director of the UERL. At Gibb's invitation, Pick also moved to the UERL to continue working as his assistant. The UERL controlled the <a href="District%20Railway">District Railway</a> and, during 1906 and 1907, opened three deep-level tube lines – the <a href="Baker%20Street%20and%20Waterloo%20Railway">Baker Street and Waterloo Railway</a> (Bakerloo tube), the <a href="Charing%20Cross%2C%20Euston%20and%20Hampstead%20Railway">Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway</a> (Hampstead tube) and the <a href="Great%20Northern%2C%20Piccadilly%20and%20Brompton%20Railway">Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway</a> (Piccadilly tube).

The UERL had financial problems. Ticket prices were low and passenger numbers were significantly below the pre-opening estimates. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly the result of competition between the UERL's lines and those of the other tube and sub-surface railway companies. The spread of street-level electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, also took a large number of passengers away from the trains.

By 1908, Pick had become publicity officer responsible for marketing and it was at this time that, working with the company's general manager <a href="Albert%20Stanley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ashfield">Albert Stanley</a>, he began developing the strong corporate identity and visual style for which the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> later became famous, including the introduction of the "UNDERGROUND" brand. Pick's philosophy on design was that "the test of the goodness of a thing is its fitness for use. If it fails on this first test, no amount of ornamentation or finish will make it any better; it will only make it more expensive, more foolish."
Pick became traffic development officer in 1909 and commercial manager in 1912. Albert Stanley replaced Gibb as managing director in 1910. During 1912 and 1913, the UERL increased its control over transport services in London by purchasing two tube railways, the <a href="City%20and%20South%20London%20Railway">City & South London Railway</a> (C&SLR) and <a href="Central%20London%20Railway">Central London Railway</a> (CLR), and a number of bus and <a href="tram">tram</a> companies. One of Pick's responsibilities was to increase passenger numbers, and he believed that the best way to do so was by encouraging increased patronage of the company's services outside peak hours. He commissioned posters which promoted the Underground's trains and <a href="London%20General%20Omnibus%20Company">London General Omnibus Company</a>'s (LGOC's) buses as a means of reaching the countryside around London and attractions within the city. Pick realised that variety was important to maintain travellers' interest and he commissioned designs from artists working in many different styles. At the same time, he rationalised bus routes to ensure that they complemented and acted as feeder services for the company's railway lines, tripling the number of LGOC operated routes during 1912 and extending the area covered to five times its previous size. Sunday excursion services to leisure destinations were implemented to fully utilise otherwise idle buses and agreements were established with rural bus operators to coordinate services rather than compete with them.

Pick introduced a common advertising policy, improving the appearance of stations by standardising poster sizes, limiting the number used and controlling their positioning. Before he took control of advertising, posters had been stuck up on any available surface on station buildings and platform walls in a crowded jumble of shapes and sizes that led to complaints from passengers that it was difficult to find the station name. Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising. Pick described the process: "after many fumbling experiments I arrived at some notion of how poster advertising ought to be. Everyone seemed quite pleased and I got a reputation that really sprang out of nothing."

To make the Underground Group's posters and signage more distinctive he commissioned <a href="calligraphy">calligrapher</a> and <a href="type%20designer">typographer</a> <a href="Edward%20Johnston">Edward Johnston</a> to design a clear new <a href="typeface">typeface</a>. Pick specified to Johnston in 1913 that he wanted a typeface that would ensure that the Underground Group's posters would not be mistaken for advertisements; it should have "the bold simplicity of the authentic lettering of the finest periods" and belong "unmistakably to the twentieth century". Johnston's <a href="sans-serif">sans serif</a> "Underground" typeface, (now known as <a href="Johnston%20%28typeface%29">Johnston</a>) was first used in 1916 and was so successful that, with minor modifications in recent years, it is still in use today.
In conjunction with his changes to poster display arrangements, Pick experimented with the positioning and sizing of station name signs on platforms, which were often inadequate in number or poorly placed. In 1908, he settled on an arrangement where the sign was backed by a red disc to make it stand out clearly, creating the "bulls-eye" device – the earliest form of what is today known as the roundel. In 1909, Pick started to combine the "bulls-eye" and the "UNDERGROUND" brand on posters and station buildings, but was not satisfied with the arrangement. By 1916, he had decided to adapt the logo used by the LGOC, the Underground Group's bus company, which was in the form of a ring with a bar bearing the name "GENERAL" across the centre. Pick commissioned Johnston to redesign the "bulls-eye" and the form used today is based on that developed by Johnston and first used in 1919.

In 1919, with a return to normality after the First World War, Pick began developing plans to extend the Underground network out into suburbs that lacked adequate transport services. The only major extensions made to the Underground network since the three tube lines had opened were the extension of the District Railway to <a href="Uxbridge%20tube%20station">Uxbridge</a> in 1910, and the extension of the Bakerloo tube to <a href="Watford%20Junction%20railway%20station">Watford Junction</a> between 1913 and 1917. Approved schemes put on hold during the war were revived: the CLR was extended to <a href="Ealing%20Broadway%20station">Ealing Broadway</a> in 1920, the Hampstead tube was extended to <a href="Edgware%20tube%20station">Edgware</a> between 1923 and 1924 and the C&SLR was reconstructed and extended to <a href="Camden%20Town%20tube%20station">Camden Town</a> between 1922 and 1924. Finance for the latter two extensions was obtained through the government's <a href="Trade%20Facilities%20Act">Trade Facilities Act</a>s which <a href="underwriting">underwrote</a> loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. For new lines, Pick first considered extending Underground services to the north-east of London where the mainline suburban services of the <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Great Northern Railway</a> (GNR) and <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Railway">Great Eastern Railway</a> (GER) were poor and unreliable. Studies were carried out for an extension of the Piccadilly tube on GNR tracks to <a href="New%20Barnet">New Barnet</a> and <a href="Enfield%20Town">Enfield</a> or on a new route to <a href="Wood%20Green">Wood Green</a> and plans were developed for an extension of the CLR along GER tracks to <a href="Chingford">Chingford</a> and <a href="Chipping%20Ongar">Ongar</a>, but both mainline companies strongly opposed the Underground's encroachment into their territories.

Wanting to make maximum use of the government's financial backing, which was only available for a limited period, Pick did not have time to press the Underground's case for these extensions. Instead he developed a plan for an extension of the C&SLR south-west from <a href="Clapham%20Common%20tube%20station">Clapham Common</a> to <a href="Sutton%2C%20London">Sutton</a> in Surrey. Pick still faced strong opposition from the <a href="London%2C%20Brighton%20and%20South%20Coast%20Railway">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a> and the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a> which operated in the area, but the Underground had the advantage of already having an approval for the last few miles of the route as part of an unused pre-war permission for a new <a href="Wimbledon%20and%20Sutton%20Railway">line from Wimbledon to Sutton</a>. The railway companies challenged the need for a new service, claiming it would simply drain passengers from their own trains and that any extension should only run as far as <a href="Tooting">Tooting</a>, but Pick was able to counter their arguments and negotiated a compromise settlement to extend the C&SLR as far as <a href="Morden%20tube%20station">Morden</a>.

Even before the C&SLR extension had been completed in 1926, possibilities for the northward extension of the Piccadilly tube began to reappear. From 1922, a series of press campaigns called for the improvement of services at the GNR's <a href="Finsbury%20Park%20station">Finsbury Park station</a> where interchanges between tube lines, mainline trains, buses and trams were notoriously bad. In June 1923, a petition from 30,000 local residents was submitted to parliament, and, in 1925, the government called a <a href="public%20inquiry">public inquiry</a> to review options. Pick presented plans to relieve the congestion at Finsbury Park by extending the Piccadilly tube north to <a href="Southgate%20tube%20station">Southgate</a>. Opposition from the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> (successor to the GNR following the <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">1923 grouping of railway companies</a>) was again considerable and based on claims that the new Underground line would take passengers from the mainline services. Using data from the Bakerloo tube, Hampstead tube and C&SLR extensions, Pick demonstrated that the route planned for the new line would stimulate new residential development and increase passenger numbers for all rail operators in the area, increasing those on the Piccadilly tube by 50 million per year. Parliamentary approval was granted in 1930 to extend the Piccadilly tube north beyond Southgate to a terminus at <a href="Cockfosters%20tube%20station">Cockfosters</a>. The approval also included complementary extensions of the Piccadilly tube from its western terminus at <a href="Hammersmith%20tube%20station%20%28Piccadilly%20and%20District%20lines%29">Hammersmith</a> to supplement District Railway services to <a href="Hounslow%20West%20tube%20station">Hounslow</a> and <a href="South%20Harrow%20tube%20station">South Harrow</a>. The development was again financed with government backed loans, this time through the 1929 "Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act". To ensure the most efficient integration between the new tube line and the UERL's bus and tram operations, the stations were located further apart than in central areas and where road transport services could be arranged to deliver and collect the most passengers. At <a href="Manor%20House%20tube%20station">Manor House</a>, the station was designed with <a href="subway%20%28underpass%29">subway</a> exits directly on to pedestrian islands in the road served by the local trams.

In 1924, with plans for the C&SLR extension under development, Pick commissioned <a href="Charles%20Holden">Charles Holden</a> to design the station buildings in a new style. The designs replaced a set by the Underground's own architect, <a href="Stanley%20Heaps">Stanley Heaps</a>, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. Pick had first met Holden at the <a href="Design%20and%20Industries%20Association">Design and Industries Association</a> (DIA) in 1915, and he saw the <a href="modern%20architecture">modernist</a> architect as one he could work with to define what Pick called "a new architectural idiom". Pick wanted to streamline and simplify the design of the stations to make them welcoming, brightly lit and efficient with large, uncluttered ticket halls for the rapid sale of tickets and quick access to the trains via <a href="escalator">escalator</a>s. At these new stations, tickets were issued from a number of "passimeters", glazed booths in the centre of the ticket hall, rather than the traditional ticket office windows set to one side.

Pick was pleased with the results and at a DIA dinner in 1926 proclaimed "that a new style of architectural decoration will arise" leading to a "Modern London – modern not garbled classic or Renaissance." Amongst Pick's next commissions for Holden were the redesign of <a href="Piccadilly%20Circus%20tube%20station">Piccadilly Circus station</a> (1925–28), where a wide subterranean concourse and ticket hall were built beneath the road junction, and the Underground Group's new headquarters building at <a href="55%20Broadway">55 Broadway</a>, <a href="St%20James%27s">St James's</a> (1925–1929). The new headquarters building was on an awkwardly shaped site, partly over the platforms and tracks of <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Park%20tube%20station">St. James's Park station</a>. Although Holden's practice had not designed such a large office building, it did have experience of large hospital design, which Pick saw as complementary to the design of a modern office building. When completed, the twelve-storey, high <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a> building was the tallest in London and the tower dominated the skyline. The building was well received by architectural critics and won Holden the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">RIBA</a>'s London Architecture Medal for 1929. Two sculptures commissioned for the building were less well received, generating considerable controversy in the media. The nudity and primitive carving of by <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Jacob Epstein</a> led to calls for them to be removed from the building and the board of the Underground Group considered replacing them with new sculptures by another artist. Although he privately admitted later that the sculptures were not to his taste, Pick publicly supported Holden's selection of Epstein as sculptor and offered to resign over the matter. The crisis was averted when Epstein was persuaded to reduce the length of the penis of one of the figures and the sculptures remained in place.
Pick wanted a new type of building for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what this new type should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was much more to his liking, particularly buildings by <a href="Willem%20Marinus%20Dudok">Willem Marinus Dudok</a> in <a href="Hilversum">Hilversum</a>. Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.

The designs Pick commissioned from Holden (1931–33) established a new standard for the Underground, with the prototype station at <a href="Sudbury%20Town%20tube%20station">Sudbury Town</a> being described by architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> as a "landmark" and the start of "the 'classic' phase of Underground architecture". To ensure that the new stations achieved the complete and coherent design that he wanted, Pick instructed the engineering departments to provide Holden with full details of all equipment needed for the stations. After late equipment changes by the engineers at the first few new stations compromised the integrated design, Pick took personal charge of the coordination of the architectural and engineering elements. In the mid-1930s when the introduction of <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a>es to replace trams required the installation of new street poles to support overhead wiring, Pick was keenly interested that the design of the poles was coordinated to accommodate all of the possible equipment and signage that might be needed. He also oversaw the designs of the new <a href="bus%20stop">bus stop</a>s and bus shelters that were installed when specified stopping points were introduced for bus services.

As part of the <a href="Transported%20by%20Design">Transported by Design</a> programme of activities, on 15 October 2015, after two months of public voting, the work of Frank Pick was elected by Londoners as one of the 10 favourite transport design icons.

At the beginning of the 1920s, with vehicle numbers depleted by wartime service in France and Belgium, the Underground Group's bus operations began to experience a surge in competition from a large number of new independent bus operators. These small operators were unregulated and preyed on the group's most profitable routes taking away a large number of its passengers and a large amount of its income. Albert Stanley (ennobled as Lord Ashfield in 1920) and Pick fought back by calling on parliament to regulate bus operations in the capital. The <a href="London%20Traffic%20Act%201924">London Traffic Act 1924</a> granted their request by establishing the <a href="London%20Traffic%20Area">London Traffic Area</a> to regulate road passenger traffic within London and the surrounding districts. Throughout the 1920s, Pick led the Underground Group's efforts to coordinate its services with the municipal tram operators, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> and the suburban mainline rail services. The aim was to achieve a pooling of income between all of the operators and remove wasteful competition. At the end of 1930, a solution was announced in a bill for the formation of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB), a public corporation which was to take control of the Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway and the majority of the bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area covering the <a href="County%20of%20London">County of London</a> and <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a> and parts of <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> and <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>.

Pick had become joint managing director of the Underground Group in 1928, and when, on 1 July 1933, the group was taken over by the LPTB, he became <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a> and vice-chairman, on an annual salary of £10,000 (approximately ). Ashfield was chairman. Pick led the board's negotiations on the compensation to be paid to the owners and shareholders of each of the transport operations being taken over.

With the majority of London's transport operations now under the control of a single organisation, Pick was able to commence the next round of improvements. On the Metropolitan Railway (renamed the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a>), Pick and Ashfield began to rationalise services. The barely used and loss-making <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Brill</a> and <a href="Verney%20Junction%20railway%20station">Verney Junction</a> branches beyond <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury</a> were closed in 1935 and 1936. Freight services were reduced and electrification of the remaining steam operated sections of the line was planned. In 1935, the availability of <a href="government-backed%20loan">government-backed loan</a>s to stimulate the flagging economy allowed Pick to promote system-wide improvements under the <a href="New%20Works%20Programme">New Works Programme for 1935–1940</a>, including the transfer of the Metropolitan line's <a href="Stanmore%20tube%20station">Stanmore</a> services to the <a href="Bakerloo%20line">Bakerloo line</a> in 1939, the <a href="Northern%20line">Northern line</a>'s <a href="Northern%20line%23Northern%20Heights">Northern Heights</a> project and extension of the <a href="Central%20line%20%28London%20Underground%29">Central line</a> to <a href="Ongar%20railway%20station">Ongar</a> in Essex and <a href="Denham%20railway%20station">Denham</a> in Buckinghamshire.

During 1938 and 1939, with war anticipated, an increasing part of Pick's time was spent in planning for the approaching conflict. The <a href="Railway%20Executive%20Committee">Railway Executive Committee</a> was reconstituted in 1938 to act as a central coordinating body for the country's railways with Pick as the LPTB's representative. This role absorbed most of his time after the committee took over control of the railways on 1 September 1939. Following a disagreement with other members of the LPTB board over the government's proposals to limit the dividend that it could pay to its shareholders, Pick stated his intention to retire from the board at the end of his seven-year appointment in May 1940. Pick had previously suggested a reorganisation of the LPTB's senior management structure and hoped to be able to continue with the organisation in some sort of joint general manager position. Ashfield chose not to find such a continuing role for Pick and, on 18 May 1940, to the surprise of many within the organisation, Pick retired from the LPTB board, officially due to failing health. Pick's post of chief executive was abolished and replaced with a group of six heads of department.

Pick's interest in design led to his involvement in the founding, in 1915, of the Design and Industries Association. The organisation aimed to bring manufacturers and designers together to improve the quality of industrial design. Through his improvements in the UERL's advertising and branding, Pick was considered by many of its members to be taking a practical lead in achieving the organisation's aims and he was soon lecturing on the subject, giving talks during 1916 and 1917 at the <a href="Art%20Workers%20Guild">Art Workers Guild</a> in London, at the <a href="Royal%20Scottish%20Academy">Royal Scottish Academy</a> in Edinburgh and elsewhere. After the First World War, Pick continued to give talks regularly and published articles on design. He also began to set out his ideas on reconstruction and town planning, an area of design he became interested in through its connection to transport planning. He wrote and lectured extensively on this subject during the 1920s and 1930s including presenting a 14,000 word paper to the <a href="Chartered%20Institute%20of%20Logistics%20and%20Transport">Institute of Transport</a> in 1927 and addressing the International Housing and Town Planning Congress in 1939. Concerned about the uncontrolled and unchecked growth of London, partly facilitated by the new lines that London Underground was building, Pick was a strong supporter of the need for a <a href="Green%20belt%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">green belt</a> around the capital to maintain open space within reach of urban areas.

In 1922, he wrote and published privately a pamphlet "This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation" that was influenced by the rationalist writing of <a href="Ray%20Lankester">Ray Lankester</a>. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, it would be hard to maintain creativity and an <a href="Introduction%20to%20entropy">entropic</a> decline would follow. Later, in the last year of his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, "Britain Must Rebuild" and "Paths to Peace". Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of <a href="Walter%20Gropius">Walter Gropius</a>'s "The New Architecture and the Bauhaus" published in 1935.

Beside his positions at the UERL and LPTB, Pick held a number of industrial administrative and advisory positions. In 1917, during the First World War, Pick was appointed to be head of the Mines Directorate's Household Fuel and Lighting Department at the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> where Albert Stanley was the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Business%2C%20Innovation%20and%20Skills">President</a>. Pick was responsible for the control of the rationing and distribution of domestic fuel supplies. He remained in this position until June 1919. In 1928, he was appointed as a member of the Royal Commission On Police Powers and Procedure. He also served as a member of the <a href="London%20and%20Home%20Counties%20Traffic%20Advisory%20Committee">London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee</a> and as a member of the <a href="Crown%20Estate">Crown Lands</a> Advisory Committee.

Pick was President of the Institute of Transport for 1931/32. He was President of the Design and Industries Association from 1932 to 1934 and the chairman of the Board of Trade's Council for Art and Industry from 1934 to 1939.

During 1938, the government appointed Pick to plan the transport operations for the <a href="Evacuations%20of%20civilians%20in%20Britain%20during%20World%20War%20II">evacuation of civilians from London</a>. Initially scheduled for 30 September 1938, the plans were cancelled when <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>'s with <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> averted war that year, but were activated a year later at the beginning of September 1939 on the declaration of war with Germany. After leaving the LPTB, Pick visited British ports for the <a href="Department%20for%20Transport">Ministry of Transport</a> to prepare a report on methods of improving port operations and cargo handling. In August 1940, he reluctantly accepted the position of director-general of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Information</a>. His time at the Ministry of Information was short and unhappy and he left after four months and returned to the Ministry of Transport, where he carried out studies on improvements in the use of Britain's canals and rivers.

Biographers have characterised Pick as being "very shy", and "brilliant but lonely". Christian Barman described him as a person who inspired conflicting opinions about his personality and his actions: "a man about whom so many people held so many different views". Pick acknowledged that he could be difficult to work with: "I have always kept in mind my own frailties – a short temper. Impatience with fools, quickness rather than thoroughness. I am a bad hand at the gracious word or casual congratulation." His moralistic character led to friends giving him the nickname "<a href="Jonah">Jonah</a>". Pick valued criticism and savoured challenging debate, though he complained that he found it difficult to get people to stand up to him. UERL board member Sir <a href="Ernest%20Clark%20%28governor%29">Ernest Clark</a> considered Pick to be perhaps too efficient and unable to fully delegate and relinquish responsibility: "his own efficiency has a bad effect on the efficiency of others... How can the housemaid take pride in a job to which the mistress will insist on putting the finishing touch?" Pick's friend <a href="Noel%20Carrington">Noel Carrington</a> thought that his attention to detail made him the "ideal inspector general."

Pick ran his office on a <a href="fortnight">fortnight</a>ly cycle and his workload was prodigious. Barman described Pick's office as a training school for future managers, with a regular turnover of staff who would go on to management positions when Pick thought them ready.

Ashfield considered that Pick possessed "a sterling character and steadfast loyalty", and "an administrative ability which was outstanding", with "a keen analytical mind which was able to seize upon essentials and then drive his way through to his goal, always strengthened by a sure knowledge of the problem and confidence in himself." Charles Holden described Pick's management of meetings: "Here his decisions were those of a benevolent dictator, and the members left the meeting with a clear sense of a task to be performed, difficult, perhaps, and sometimes impossible, as might subsequently prove to be, but usually well worth exploring if only in producing convincing proof of obstacles. Out of these exploratory methods there often emerged new and most interesting solutions, which Pick was quick to appreciate, and to adopt in substitution for his own proposals."
Disliking honours, Pick declined offers of a <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a> and a <a href="peerage">peerage</a>. He did accept, in 1932, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s Honorary Badge of Merit for his advice on the construction of the <a href="Moscow%20Metro">Moscow Metro</a>. He was an honorary member of the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>.

Pick was widely read and was influenced by many writers on scientific, sociological and social matters including works by <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a>, <a href="Leonard%20Trelawny%20Hobhouse">Leonard Hobhouse</a>, <a href="Edwin%20Lankester">Edwin Lankester</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a> and <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>. On design, he was influenced by <a href="D%27Arcy%20Wentworth%20Thompson">D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson</a>'s description of design in nature in "<a href="On%20Growth%20and%20Form">On Growth and Form</a>" and by architect <a href="William%20Lethaby">William Lethaby</a>. His admiration for <a href="William%20Morris">William Morris</a> led him to adopt Morris's favourite colour of green as his own, using green ink for the majority of his correspondence.

Pick had not been well for some years. The stresses of his war work took a further toll on his health and he lost two <a href="stone%20%28unit%29">stone</a> during his travels around the country to research his report on the canal industry. Although exhausted at the end of the tour, he wrote to friends that he was struggling with the idleness and was hoping for something new to do. He died at his home, 15 Wildwood Road, Golders Green, on 7 November 1941 from a <a href="cerebral%20hemorrhage">cerebral haemorrhage</a>. His funeral was held at <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green Crematorium</a> on 11 November 1941 and a memorial service was held at <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Eaton%20Square">St Peter's Church, Eaton Square</a> on 13 November 1941.

Working with Ashfield, Pick's impact on London's transport system was considerable. Transport historian <a href="Christian%20Wolmar">Christian Wolmar</a> considers it "almost impossible to exaggerate the high regard in which [London Transport] was held during its all too brief heyday, attracting official visitors from around the world eager to learn the lessons of its success and apply them in their own countries" and that "it represented the apogee of a type of confident public administration ... with a reputation that any state organisation today would envy ... only made possible by the brilliance of its two famous leaders, Ashfield and Pick." In his obituary of Pick, Charles Holden described him as "the <a href="Gaius%20Maecenas">Maecenas</a> of our time." Writing in 1968, Nikolaus Pevsner described Pick as "the greatest patron of the arts whom this century has so far produced in England, and indeed the ideal patron of our age." Considering Pick's public statements on art and life, art historian <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a> suggested that "in a different age he might have become a sort of <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>". Historian Michael Saler compared Pick's influence on London Transport to that of <a href="John%20Reith%2C%201st%20Baron%20Reith">Lord Reith</a> on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s development during the same inter-war period. Urban planner <a href="Peter%20Hall%20%28urbanist%29">Sir Peter Hall</a> suggested that Pick "had as much influence on London's development in the twentieth century as <a href="Georges-Eug%C3%A8ne%20Haussmann">Haussmann</a> had on that of Paris in the nineteenth", and historian Anthony Sutcliffe compared him to <a href="Robert%20Moses">Robert Moses</a>, the city planner responsible for many urban infrastructure projects in New York.

Pick's will was <a href="probate">probate</a>d at £36,000 (£ in present-day terms). In his will he bequeathed a <a href="Francis%20Dodd%20%28artist%29">Francis Dodd</a> painting, "Ely", to the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>. <a href="Transport%20for%20London">Transport for London</a> and the London Transport Museum hold archives of Pick's business and personal papers.

Pick is commemorated with a memorial plaque at St Peter's School, York, unveiled in 1953 by <a href="Charles%20Latham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Latham">Lord Latham</a>, and a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> was erected at his Golders Green home in 1981. A building at London Underground's Acton Works is named Frank Pick House in his honour. It stands on the north side of the Piccadilly and District line railway tracks to the east of <a href="Acton%20Town%20tube%20station">Acton Town station</a>. Pick is commemorated with a permanent memorial at <a href="Piccadilly%20Circus%20tube%20station">Piccadilly Circus station</a> by the BAFTA-winning and Turner Prize-nominated artists <a href="Langlands%20%26amp%3B%20Bell">Langlands & Bell</a>. The work, entitled "Beauty < Immortality", was commissioned by London Transport Museum and installed by <a href="Art%20on%20the%20Underground">Art on the Underground</a> (Transport for London’s official art programme). It was unveiled on 7 November 2016, the 75th anniversary of Pick's death.
