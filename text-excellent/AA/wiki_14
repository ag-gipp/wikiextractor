Edward II of England

Edward II (25 April 1284 – 21 September 1327), also called Edward of Carnarvon, was <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a> from 1307 until he was <a href="deposition%20%28politics%29">deposed</a> in January 1327. The fourth son of <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a>, Edward became the <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> to the throne following the death of his elder brother <a href="Alphonso%2C%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Alphonso</a>. Beginning in 1300, Edward accompanied his father on <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">campaigns to pacify Scotland</a>, and in 1306 was <a href="Knight%23Origins%20of%20medieval%20knighthood">knighted</a> in a <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Swans">grand ceremony</a> at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. Following his father's death, Edward succeeded to the throne in 1307. He married <a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Isabella of France</a>, the daughter of the powerful <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20France">King Philip IV</a>, in 1308, as part of a long-running effort to resolve tensions between the English and French crowns.

Edward had a close and controversial relationship with <a href="Piers%20Gaveston%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Piers Gaveston</a>, who had joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of his and Gaveston's relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, lovers or <a href="blood%20brother">sworn brothers</a>. Gaveston's arrogance and power as Edward's <a href="favourite">favourite</a> provoked discontent among both the <a href="Baron%23United%20Kingdom%20and%20the%20Commonwealth">barons</a> and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to <a href="exile">exile</a> him. On Gaveston's return, the barons pressured the king into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms, called the <a href="Ordinances%20of%201311">Ordinances of 1311</a>. The newly empowered barons banished Gaveston, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, the <a href="Thomas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Earl of Lancaster</a>, a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confrontation. English forces were pushed back in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bannockburn">Battle of Bannockburn</a> in 1314. <a href="Great%20Famine%20of%201315%E2%80%9317">Widespread famine</a> followed, and criticism of the king's reign mounted.

The Despenser family, in particular <a href="Hugh%20Despenser%20the%20Younger">Hugh Despenser the Younger</a>, became close friends and advisers to Edward, but Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers' lands in 1321, and forced the King to exile them. In response, Edward led a <a href="Despenser%20War">short military campaign</a>, capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, formally revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a <a href="War%20of%20Saint-Sardos%23Aftermath">peace treaty</a> in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Instead, she allied herself with the exiled <a href="Roger%20Mortimer%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20March">Roger Mortimer</a>, and <a href="Invasion%20of%20England%20%281326%29">invaded England</a> with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled to Wales, where he was captured in November. The king was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his 14-year-old son, <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>, and he died in <a href="Berkeley%20Castle">Berkeley Castle</a> on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.

Edward's relationship with Gaveston inspired <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>'s 1592 play "<a href="Edward%20II%20%28play%29">Edward II</a>", along with other plays, films, novels and media. Many of these have focused on the possible sexual relationship between the two men. Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">parliamentary institutions</a> during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.

Edward II was the fourth son of Edward I and his first wife, <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Castile">Eleanor of Castile</a>. His father was the king of England and had also inherited <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a> in south-western France, which he held as the <a href="feudal">feudal</a> vassal of the <a href="King%20of%20France">King of France</a>, and the <a href="Lordship%20of%20Ireland">Lordship of Ireland</a>. His mother was from the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castilian</a> royal family, and held the <a href="County%20of%20Ponthieu">County of Ponthieu</a> in northern France. Edward I proved a successful military leader, leading the <a href="Second%20Barons%27%20War">suppression of the baronial revolts</a> in the 1260s and joining the <a href="Ninth%20Crusade">Ninth Crusade</a>. During the 1280s he <a href="Conquest%20of%20Wales%20by%20Edward%20I%20of%20England">conquered North Wales</a>, removing the <a href="Welsh%20people">native Welsh</a> princes from power and, in the 1290s, he <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">intervened in Scotland's civil war</a>, claiming <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> over the country. He was considered an extremely successful ruler by his contemporaries, largely able to control the powerful <a href="earl">earl</a>s that formed the senior ranks of the English nobility. The historian <a href="Michael%20Prestwich">Michael Prestwich</a> describes Edward I as "a king to inspire fear and respect", while <a href="John%20Gillingham">John Gillingham</a> characterises him as an efficient bully.

Despite Edward I's successes, when he died in 1307 he left a range of challenges for his son to resolve. One of the most critical was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. Edward's control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings give <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">homage</a> to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved. Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.

Edward II was born in <a href="Caernarfon%20Castle">Caernarfon Castle</a> in <a href="north%20Wales">north Wales</a> on 25 April 1284, less than a year after Edward I had conquered the region, and as a result is sometimes called Edward of Caernarfon. The king probably chose the castle deliberately as the location for Edward's birth as it was an important symbolic location for the native Welsh, associated with <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman imperial history</a>, and it formed the centre of the new royal administration of North Wales. Edward's birth brought predictions of greatness from contemporary <a href="prophet">prophet</a>s, who believed that the <a href="End%20time">Last Days</a> of the world were imminent, declaring him a new <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a>, who would lead England to glory. <a href="David%20Powel">David Powel</a>, a 16th-century clergyman, suggested that the baby was offered to the Welsh as a prince "that was borne in Wales and could speake never a word of English", but there is no evidence to support this account.

Edward's name was <a href="Middle%20English">English</a> in origin, linking him to the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> <a href="saint">saint</a> <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, and was chosen by his father instead of the more traditional <a href="Norman%20language">Norman</a> and <a href="Castilian%20language">Castilian</a> names selected for Edward's brothers: Edward had three elder brothers: John and Henry, who had died before Edward was born, and <a href="Alphonso%2C%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Alphonso</a>, who died in August 1284, leaving Edward as the heir to the throne. Although Edward was a relatively healthy child, there were enduring concerns throughout his early years that he too might die and leave his father without a male heir. After his birth, Edward was looked after by a <a href="wet%20nurse">wet nurse</a> called Mariota or Mary Maunsel for a few months until she fell ill, when Alice de Leygrave became his foster mother. He would have barely known his natural mother Eleanor, who was in Gascony with his father during his earliest years. An official household, complete with staff, was created for the new baby, under the direction of a clerk, Giles of Oudenarde.

Spending increased on Edward's personal household as he grew older and, in 1293, William of Blyborough took over as its administrator. Edward was probably given a religious education by the <a href="Dominican%20friar">Dominican friar</a>s, whom his mother invited into his household in 1290. He was assigned one of his grandmother's followers, Guy Ferre, as his "magister", who was responsible for his discipline, training him in riding and military skills. It is uncertain how well educated Edward was; there is little evidence for his ability to read and write, although his mother was keen that her other children were well educated, and Ferre was himself a relatively learned man for the period. Edward likely mainly spoke <a href="Anglo-Norman%20French">Anglo-Norman French</a> in his daily life, in addition to some English and possibly <a href="Latin">Latin</a>.

Edward had a normal upbringing for a member of a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and <a href="horsebreeding">horsebreeding</a>, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>s. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in <a href="hunting">hunting</a> or <a href="falconry">falconry</a>, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including <a href="Welsh%20music">Welsh music</a> and the newly invented <a href="crwth">crwth</a> instrument, as well as <a href="Organ%20%28music%29">musical organs</a>. He did not take part in <a href="jousting">jousting</a>, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.

Edward grew up to be tall and muscular, and was considered good looking by the standards of the period. He had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his generosity to household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed <a href="Watercraft%20rowing">rowing</a>, as well as <a href="hedge">hedging</a> and <a href="ditch">ditch</a>ing, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.

In 1290, Edward's father had confirmed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Birgham">Treaty of Birgham</a>, in which he promised to marry his six-year-old son to the young <a href="Margaret%2C%20Maid%20of%20Norway">Margaret of Norway</a>, who had a potential claim to the crown of Scotland. Margaret died later that year, bringing an end to the plan. Edward's mother, Eleanor, died shortly afterwards, followed by his grandmother, Eleanor of Provence. Edward I was distraught at his wife's death and held a huge funeral for her; his son inherited the County of Ponthieu from Eleanor. Next, a French marriage was considered for the young Edward, to help secure a lasting peace with France, but <a href="Anglo-French%20War%20of%201294-1303">war</a> broke out in 1294. The idea was replaced with the proposal of a marriage to a daughter of the <a href="Guy%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Count of Flanders</a>, but this too failed after it was blocked by King <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20France">Philip IV of France</a>.

Between 1297 and 1298, Edward was left as <a href="regent">regent</a> in charge of England while the king campaigned in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> against Philip IV, who had occupied part of the English king's lands in Gascony. On his return, Edward I signed a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281303%29">peace treaty</a>, under which he took Philip's sister, <a href="Margaret%20of%20France%2C%20Queen%20of%20England">Margaret</a>, as his wife and agreed that Prince Edward would in due course marry Philip's daughter, <a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Isabella</a>, who was then only two years old. In theory, this marriage would mean that the disputed Duchy of Gascony would be inherited by a descendant of both Edward and Philip, providing a possible end to the long-running tensions. The young Edward seems to have got on well with his new stepmother, who gave birth to Edward's two half-brothers, <a href="Thomas%20of%20Brotherton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Thomas of Brotherton</a> and <a href="Edmund%20of%20Woodstock%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Kent">Edmund of Woodstock</a>, in 1300 and 1301. As king, Edward later provided his brothers with financial support and titles.

Edward I returned to Scotland once again in 1300, and this time took his son with him, making him the commander of the rearguard at the siege of <a href="Caerlaverock%20Castle">Caerlaverock</a>. In the spring of 1301, the king declared Edward the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, granting him the <a href="earldom%20of%20Chester">earldom of Chester</a> and lands across North Wales; he seems to have hoped that this would help pacify the region, and that it would give his son some financial independence. Edward received homage from his Welsh subjects and then joined his father for the 1301 Scottish campaign; he took an army of around 300 soldiers north with him and captured <a href="Turnberry%20Castle">Turnberry Castle</a>. Prince Edward also took part in the 1303 campaign during which he besieged <a href="Brechin%20Castle">Brechin Castle</a>, deploying his own siege engine in the operation. In the spring of 1304, Edward conducted negotiations with the rebel Scottish leaders on the king's behalf and, when these failed, he joined his father for the siege of <a href="Stirling%20Castle">Stirling Castle</a>.

In 1305, Edward and his father quarrelled, probably over the issue of money. The prince had an altercation with Bishop <a href="Walter%20Langton">Walter Langton</a>, who served as the royal treasurer, apparently over the amount of financial support Edward received from the Crown. Edward I defended his treasurer, and banished his son and his companions from his court, cutting off their financial support. After some negotiations involving family members and friends, the two men were reconciled.

The Scottish conflict flared up once again in 1306, when <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a> killed his rival <a href="John%20III%20Comyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Badenoch">John Comyn</a> and declared himself King of the Scots. Edward I mobilised a fresh army, but decided that, this time, his son would be formally in charge of the expedition. Prince Edward was made the <a href="Duke%20of%20Aquitaine">Duke of Aquitaine</a> and then, along with many other young men, he was <a href="Knight%23Origins%20of%20medieval%20knighthood">knighted</a> in a lavish ceremony at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> called the <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Swans">Feast of the Swans</a>. Amid a huge feast in the neighbouring hall, reminiscent of <a href="Arthurian%20legend">Arthurian legend</a>s and <a href="Crusades">crusading events</a>, the assembly took a collective oath to defeat Bruce. It is unclear what role Prince Edward's forces played in the campaign that summer, which, under the orders of Edward I, saw a punitive, brutal retaliation against Bruce's faction in Scotland. Edward returned to England in September, where diplomatic negotiations to finalise a date for his wedding to Isabella continued.

During this time, Edward became close to <a href="Piers%20Gaveston">Piers Gaveston</a>. Gaveston was the son of one of the king's household knights whose lands lay adjacent to Gascony, and had himself joined Prince Edward's household in 1300, possibly on Edward I's instruction. The two got on well; Gaveston became a <a href="squire">squire</a> and was soon being referred to as a close companion of Edward, before being knighted by the King during the <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Swans">Feast of the Swans</a> in 1306. The King then exiled Gaveston to Gascony in 1307 for reasons that remain unclear. According to one chronicler, Edward had asked his father to allow him to give Gaveston the County of Ponthieu, and the King responded furiously, pulling his son's hair out in great handfuls, before exiling Gaveston. The official court records, however, show Gaveston being only temporarily exiled, supported by a comfortable stipend; no reason is given for the order, suggesting that it may have been an act aimed at punishing the prince in some way.

The possibility that Edward had a sexual relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with <a href="heresy">heresy</a>, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity in the same way that it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both had sexual relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, <a href="Eleanor%20de%20Clare">Eleanor de Clare</a>.

The contemporary evidence supporting their homosexual relationship comes primarily from an anonymous chronicler in the 1320s who described how Edward "felt such love" for Gaveston that "he entered into a covenant of constancy, and bound himself with him before all other mortals with a bond of indissoluble love, firmly drawn up and fastened with a knot". The first specific suggestion that Edward engaged in sex with men was recorded in 1334, when <a href="Adam%20Orleton">Adam Orleton</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, was accused of having stated in 1326 that Edward was a "sodomite", although Orleton defended himself by arguing that he had meant that Edward's advisor, <a href="Hugh%20Despenser%20the%20Younger">Hugh Despenser the Younger</a>, was a sodomite, rather than the late King. The <a href="Meaux%20Chronicle">Meaux Chronicle</a> from the 1390s simply notes that Edward gave himself "too much to the vice of sodomy."

Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston may have simply been friends with a close working relationship. Contemporary <a href="chronicler">chronicler</a> comments are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were at least in part politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope <a href="Boniface%20VIII">Boniface VIII</a> and the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a> in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and <a href="J.%20R.%20S.%20Phillips">Seymour Phillips</a> have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.

A more recent theory, proposed by the historian <a href="Pierre%20Chaplais">Pierre Chaplais</a>, suggests that Edward and Gaveston entered into a bond of <a href="blood%20brother">adoptive brotherhood</a>. Compacts of adoptive brotherhood, in which the participants pledged to support each other in a form of "brotherhood-in-arms", were not unknown between close male friends in the Middle Ages. Many chroniclers described Edward and Gaveston's relationship as one of brotherhood, and one explicitly noted that Edward had taken Gaveston as his adopted brother. Chaplais argues that the pair may have made a formal compact in either 1300 or 1301, and that they would have seen any later promises they made to separate or to leave each other as having been made under duress, and therefore invalid. Such a compact, however, might not have excluded their relationship from having a sexual dimension as well.

Edward I mobilised another army for the Scottish campaign in 1307, which Prince Edward was due to join that summer, but the elderly King had been increasingly unwell and died on 7 July at <a href="Burgh%20by%20Sands">Burgh by Sands</a>. Edward travelled from London immediately after the news reached him, and on 20 July he was proclaimed king. He continued north into Scotland and on 4 August received homage from his Scottish supporters at <a href="Dumfries">Dumfries</a>, before abandoning the campaign and returning south. Edward promptly recalled Piers Gaveston, who was then in exile, and made him <a href="Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Earl of Cornwall</a>, before arranging his marriage to the wealthy Margaret de Clare. Edward also arrested his old adversary Bishop Langton, and dismissed him from his post as treasurer. Edward I's body was kept at <a href="Waltham%20Abbey%20Church">Waltham Abbey</a> for several months before being taken for burial to Westminster, where Edward erected a simple <a href="marble">marble</a> tomb for his father.

In 1308, Edward's marriage to Isabella of France proceeded. Edward crossed the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> to France in January, leaving Gaveston as his "custos regni" in charge of the kingdom in his absence. This arrangement was unusual, and involved unprecedented powers being delegated to Gaveston, backed by a specially engraved <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20Realm">Great Seal</a>. Edward probably hoped that the marriage would strengthen his position in Gascony and bring him much needed funds. The final negotiations, however, proved challenging: Edward and Philip IV did not like each other, and the French King drove a hard bargain over the size of Isabella's <a href="dower">dower</a> and the details of the administration of Edward's lands in France. As part of the agreement, Edward gave homage to Philip for the Duchy of Aquitaine and agreed to a commission to complete the implementation of the 1303 Treaty of Paris.

The pair were married in <a href="Boulogne">Boulogne</a> on 25 January. Edward gave Isabella a <a href="Isabella%20Psalter">psalter</a> as a wedding gift, and her father gave her gifts worth over 21,000 <a href="French%20livre">livres</a> and a fragment of the <a href="True%20Cross">True Cross</a>. The pair returned to England in February, where Edward had ordered <a href="Westminster%20Palace">Westminster Palace</a> to be lavishly restored in readiness for their coronation and wedding feast, complete with marble tables, forty ovens and a fountain that produced wine and pimento, a spiced medieval drink. After some delays, the ceremony went ahead on 25 February at Westminster Abbey, under the guidance of <a href="Henry%20Woodlock">Henry Woodlock</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>. As part of the coronation, Edward swore to uphold "the rightful laws and customs which the community of the realm shall have chosen". It is uncertain what this meant: it might have been intended to force Edward to accept future legislation, it may have been inserted to prevent him from overturning any future vows he might take, or it may have been an attempt by the King to ingratiate himself with the barons. The event was marred by the large crowds of eager spectators who surged into the palace, knocking down a wall and forcing Edward to flee by the back door.

Isabella was only 12 years old at the time of her wedding, young by the standards of the period, and Edward probably had sexual relations with mistresses during their first few years together. During this time Edward fathered an illegitimate son, <a href="Adam%20FitzRoy">Adam</a>, who was born possibly as early as 1307. Edward and Isabella's first son, the future <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>, was born in 1312 amid great celebrations, and three more children followed: <a href="John%20of%20Eltham%2C%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">John</a> in 1316, <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Woodstock">Eleanor</a> in 1318 and <a href="Joan%20of%20The%20Tower">Joan</a> in 1321.

Gaveston's return from exile in 1307 was initially accepted by the barons, but opposition quickly grew. He appeared to have an excessive influence on royal policy, leading to complaints from one chronicler that there were "two kings reigning in one kingdom, the one in name and the other in deed". Accusations, probably untrue, were levelled at Gaveston that he had stolen royal funds and had purloined Isabella's wedding presents. Gaveston had played a key role at Edward's coronation, provoking fury from both the English and French contingents about the earl's ceremonial precedence and magnificent clothes, and about Edward's apparent preference for Gaveston's company over that of Isabella at the feast.

<a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> met in February 1308 in a heated atmosphere. Edward was eager to discuss the potential for governmental reform, but the barons were unwilling to begin any such debate until the problem of Gaveston had been resolved. Violence seemed likely, but the situation was resolved through the mediation of the moderate <a href="Henry%20de%20Lacy%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Lincoln">Henry de Lacy</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Lincoln">Earl of Lincoln</a>, who convinced the barons to back down. A fresh parliament was held in April, where the barons once again criticised Gaveston, demanding his exile, this time supported by Isabella and the French monarchy. Edward resisted, but finally acquiesced, agreeing to send Gaveston to Aquitaine, under threat of <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a> by the Archbishop of Canterbury should he return. At the last moment, Edward changed his mind and instead sent Gaveston to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, appointing him as the <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lieutenant of Ireland</a>.

Edward called for a fresh military campaign for Scotland, but this idea was quietly abandoned, and instead the King and the barons met in August 1308 to discuss reform. Behind the scenes, Edward started negotiations to convince both <a href="Pope%20Clement%20V">Pope Clement V</a> and Philip IV to allow Gaveston to return to England, offering in exchange to suppress the Knights Templar in England, and to release Bishop Langton from prison. Edward called a new meeting of members of the Church and key barons in January 1309, and the leading earls then gathered in March and April, possibly under the leadership of <a href="Thomas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Thomas</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Earl of Lancaster</a>. Another parliament followed, which refused to allow Gaveston to return to England, but offered to grant Edward additional taxes if he agreed to a programme of reform.

Edward sent assurances to the Pope that the conflict surrounding Gaveston's role was at an end. On the basis of these promises, and procedural concerns about how the original decision had been taken, the Pope agreed to annul the Archbishop's threat to excommunicate Gaveston, thus opening the possibility of Gaveston's return. Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward. At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the <a href="Lord%20Steward">royal steward</a> and the <a href="marshal">marshal</a> of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of <a href="purveyance">purveyance</a> and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, the parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.

Following his return, Gaveston's relationship with the major barons became increasingly difficult. He was considered arrogant, and he took to referring to the earls by offensive names, including calling one of their more powerful members the "dog of Warwick". The Earl of Lancaster and Gaveston's enemies refused to attend parliament in 1310 because Gaveston would be present. Edward was facing increasing financial problems, owing £22,000 to his <a href="Frescobaldi">Frescobaldi</a> Italian bankers, and facing protests about how he was using his right of <a href="prise">prise</a>s to acquire supplies for the war in Scotland. His attempts to raise an army for Scotland collapsed and the earls suspended the collection of the new taxes.

The King and parliament met again in February 1310, and the proposed discussions of Scottish policy were replaced by debate of domestic problems. Edward was petitioned to abandon Gaveston as his counsellor and instead adopt the advice of 21 elected barons, termed <a href="Ordainers">Ordainers</a>, who would carry out a widespread reform of both the government and the royal household. Under huge pressure, Edward agreed to the proposal and the Ordainers were elected, broadly evenly split between reformers and conservatives. While the Ordainers began their plans for reform, Edward and Gaveston took a new army of around 4,700 men to Scotland, where the military situation had continued to deteriorate. Robert the Bruce declined to give battle and the campaign progressed ineffectually over the winter until supplies and money ran out in 1311, forcing Edward to return south.

By now the Ordainers had drawn up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little political choice but to give way and accept them in October. The <a href="Ordinances%20of%201311">Ordinances of 1311</a> contained clauses limiting the King's right to go to war or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he should not be allowed to live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor</a> and <a href="Kings%20Langley">Kings Langley</a>; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.

Tensions between Edward and the barons remained high, and the earls opposed to the King kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311. By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who held the earldoms of Lancaster, <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Leicester</a>, Lincoln, <a href="Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Salisbury</a> and <a href="Earl%20of%20Derby">Derby</a>, with an income of around £11,000 a year from his lands, almost double that of the next wealthiest baron. Backed by the earls of <a href="Edmund%20FitzAlan%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Arundel</a>, <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Clare%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Gloucester</a>, <a href="Humphrey%20de%20Bohun%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">Hereford</a>, <a href="Aymer%20de%20Valence%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Pembroke</a> and <a href="Guy%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Warwick</a>, Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, but he was not personally interested in practical administration, nor was he a particularly imaginative or effective politician.

Edward responded to the baronial threat by revoking the Ordinances and recalling Gaveston to England, being reunited with him at York in January 1312. The barons were furious and met in London, where Gaveston was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury and plans were put in place to capture Gaveston and prevent him from fleeing to Scotland. Edward, Isabella and Gaveston left for Newcastle, pursued by Lancaster and his followers. Abandoning many of their belongings, the royal party fled by ship and landed at <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a>, where Gaveston stayed while Edward and Isabella returned to York. After a short siege, Gaveston surrendered to the earls of Pembroke and <a href="John%20de%20Warenne%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">Surrey</a>, on the promise that he would not be harmed. He had with him a huge collection of gold, silver and gems, probably part of the royal treasury, which he was later accused of having stolen from Edward.

On the way back from the north, Pembroke stopped in the village of <a href="Deddington">Deddington</a> in the Midlands, putting Gaveston under guard there while he went to visit his wife. The Earl of Warwick took this opportunity to seize Gaveston, taking him to <a href="Warwick%20Castle">Warwick Castle</a>, where Lancaster and the rest of his faction assembled on 18 June. At a brief trial, Gaveston was declared guilty of being a traitor under the terms of the Ordinances; he was executed on <a href="Blacklow%20Hill">Blacklow Hill</a> the following day, under the authority of the Earl of Lancaster. Gaveston's body was not buried until 1315, when his funeral was held in <a href="King%27s%20Langley%20Priory">King's Langley Priory</a>.

Reactions to the death of Gaveston varied considerably. Edward was furious and deeply upset over what he saw as the murder of Gaveston; he made provisions for Gaveston's family, and intended to take revenge on the barons involved. The earls of Pembroke and Surrey were embarrassed and angry about Warwick's actions, and shifted their support to Edward in the aftermath. To Lancaster and his core of supporters, the execution had been both legal and necessary to preserve the stability of the kingdom. Civil war again appeared likely, but in December, the Earl of Pembroke negotiated a potential peace treaty between the two sides, which would pardon the opposition barons for the killing of Gaveston, in exchange for their support for a fresh campaign in Scotland. Lancaster and Warwick, however, did not give the treaty their immediate approval, and further negotiations continued through most of 1313.

Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke had been negotiating with France to resolve the long-standing disagreements over the administration of Gascony, and as part of this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV. Edward probably hoped both to resolve the problems in the south of France and to win Philip's support in the dispute with the barons; for Philip it was an opportunity to impress his son-in-law with his power and wealth. It proved a spectacular visit, including a grand ceremony in which the two kings knighted Philip's sons and 200 other men in <a href="Notre%20Dame%20de%20Paris">Notre Dame</a>, large banquets along the <a href="River%20Seine">River Seine</a>, and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. Philip gave lenient terms for settling the problems in Gascony, and the event was spoiled only by a serious fire in Edward's quarters.

On his return from France, Edward found his political position greatly strengthened. After intense negotiation, the earls, including Lancaster and Warwick, came to a compromise in October 1313, fundamentally very similar to the draft agreement of the previous December. Edward's finances improved, thanks to parliament agreeing to the raising of taxes, a loan of 160,000 <a href="florin">florin</a>s (£25,000) from the Pope, £33,000 that he borrowed from Philip, and further loans organised by Edward's new Italian banker, <a href="Antonio%20Pessagno">Antonio Pessagno</a>. For the first time in his reign, Edward's government was well-funded.

By 1314, Robert the Bruce had recaptured most of the <a href="Scottish%20castles">castles in Scotland</a> once held by Edward, pushing raiding parties into northern England as far as <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a>. In response, Edward planned a major military campaign with the support of Lancaster and the barons, mustering a large army between 15,000 and 20,000 strong. Meanwhile, Robert had besieged Stirling Castle, a key fortification in Scotland; its English commander had stated that unless Edward arrived by 24 June, he would surrender. News of this reached the King in late May, and he decided to speed up his march north from <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick</a> to relieve the castle. Robert, with between 5,500 and 6,500 troops, predominantly <a href="spearmen">spearmen</a>, prepared to prevent Edward's forces from reaching Stirling.

The battle began on 23 June as the English army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the <a href="Bannock%20Burn">Bannock Burn</a>, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir <a href="Henry%20de%20Bohun">Henry de Bohun</a>, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the <a href="archery">archers</a> − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − at the back of his army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.

Edward stayed behind to fight, but it became obvious to the Earl of Pembroke that the battle was lost and he dragged the King away from the battlefield, hotly pursued by the Scottish forces. Edward only just escaped the heavy fighting, making a vow to found a <a href="Carmelite">Carmelite</a> religious house at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> if he survived. The historian Roy Haines describes the defeat as a "calamity of stunning proportions" for the English, whose losses in the battle were huge. In the aftermath of the defeat, Edward retreated to <a href="Dunbar">Dunbar</a>, then travelled by ship to Berwick, and then back to <a href="York">York</a>; in his absence, Stirling Castle quickly fell.

After the fiasco of Bannockburn, the earls of Lancaster and Warwick saw their political influence increase, and they pressured Edward to re-implement the Ordinances of 1311. Lancaster became the head of the <a href="royal%20council">royal council</a> in 1316, promising to take forward the Ordinances through a new reform commission, but he appears to have abandoned this role soon afterwards, partially because of disagreements with the other barons, and possibly because of ill-health. Lancaster refused to meet with Edward in parliament for the next two years, bringing effective governance to a standstill. This stymied any hopes for a fresh campaign into Scotland and raised fears of civil war. After much negotiation, once again involving the Earl of Pembroke, Edward and Lancaster finally agreed to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Leake">Treaty of Leake</a> in August 1318, which pardoned Lancaster and his faction and established a new royal council, temporarily averting conflict.

Edward's difficulties were exacerbated by prolonged problems in <a href="Economics%20of%20English%20Agriculture%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages%23The%20Great%20Famine%20of%201315%E2%80%931317">English agriculture</a>, part of a wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the <a href="Great%20Famine%20of%201315%E2%80%9317">Great Famine</a>. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting in a string of bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.

Meanwhile, Robert the Bruce exploited his victory at Bannockburn to raid northern England, initially attacking Carlisle and Berwick, and then reaching further south into <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> and <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, even threatening York itself. Edward undertook an expensive but unsuccessful campaign to stem the advance in 1319, but the famine made it increasingly difficult to keep his garrisons supplied with food. Meanwhile, a Scottish expedition led by Robert's brother successfully invaded Ireland in 1315, where <a href="Edward%20Bruce">Edward Bruce</a> declared himself the <a href="King%20of%20Ireland">King of Ireland</a>. He was finally defeated in 1318 by Edward II's Irish justiciar, Edmund Butler, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Faughart">Battle of Faughart</a>, and Edward Bruce's severed head was sent back to the King. Revolts also broke out <a href="Banastre%20Rebellion">in Lancashire</a> and <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> in 1315, and in <a href="Glamorgan">Glamorgan</a> in Wales in 1316, but were suppressed.

The famine and the Scottish policy were felt to be a punishment from God, and complaints about Edward multiplied, one contemporary poem describing the "Evil Times of Edward II". Many criticised Edward's "improper" and ignoble interest in rural pursuits. In 1318, a mentally ill man named <a href="John%20of%20Powderham">John of Powderham</a> appeared in Oxford, claiming that he was the real Edward II, and that Edward was a <a href="changeling">changeling</a>, swapped at birth. John was duly executed, but his claims resonated with those criticising Edward for his lack of regal behaviour and steady leadership. Opposition also grew around Edward's treatment of his royal favourites.

He had managed to retain some of his previous advisers, despite attempts by the Ordainers to remove them, and divided the extensive <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Clare%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester%23Dispersal%20of%20estates%20and%20aftermath">de Clare inheritance</a> among two of his new favourites, the former household knights Hugh Audley and <a href="Roger%20d%27Amory">Roger Damory</a>, instantly making them extremely rich. Many of the moderates who had helped deliver the peaceful compromise in 1318 now began to turn against Edward, making violence ever more likely.

The long-threatened <a href="The%20Despenser%20War">civil war</a> finally broke out in England in 1321, triggered by the tension between many of the barons and the royal favourites, the Despenser family. <a href="Hugh%20Despenser%20the%20Elder">Hugh Despenser the Elder</a> had served both Edward and his father, while Hugh Despenser the Younger had married into the wealthy de Clare family, became the King's <a href="chamberlain%20%28office%29">chamberlain</a>, and acquired Glamorgan in the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh Marches</a> in 1317. Hugh the Younger subsequently expanded his holdings and power across Wales, mainly at the expense of the other <a href="Marcher%20Lord">Marcher Lord</a>s. The Earl of Lancaster and the Despensers were fierce enemies, and Lancaster's antipathy was shared by most of the Despensers' neighbours, including the Earl of Hereford, the <a href="Mortimer%23Medieval%20magnates">Mortimer family</a> and the recently elevated Hugh Audley and Roger Damory. Edward, however, increasingly relied on the Despensers for advice and support, and he was particularly close to Hugh the Younger, whom one chronicler noted he "loved ... dearly with all his heart and mind".

In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a coalition of the Despensers' enemies across the Marcher territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and headed west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by a coalition of the Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing that he might be deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.

Edward began to plan his revenge. With the help of Pembroke, the King formed a small coalition of his half-brothers, a few of the earls and some of the senior clergy, and prepared for war. Edward started with <a href="Bartholomew%20de%20Badlesmere%2C%201st%20Baron%20Badlesmere">Bartholomew of Badlesmere</a>, and Isabella was sent to Bartholomew's stronghold, <a href="Leeds%20Castle">Leeds Castle</a>, to deliberately create a "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>". Bartholomew's wife, <a href="Margaret%20de%20Clare%2C%20Baroness%20Badlesmere">Margaret</a>, took the bait and her men killed several of Isabella's retinue, giving Edward an excuse to intervene. Lancaster refused to help Bartholomew, who was his personal enemy, and Edward quickly regained control of south-east England. Alarmed, Lancaster now mobilised his own army in the north of England, and Edward mustered his own forces in the south-west. The Despensers returned from exile and were pardoned by the royal council.

In December, Edward led his army across the <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a> and advanced into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had gathered. The coalition of Marcher Lords crumbled and the Mortimers surrendered to the King, but Damory, Audley and the Earl of Hereford marched north in January to join Lancaster, who had laid siege the King's castle at <a href="Tickhill%20Castle">Tickhill</a>. Bolstered by fresh reinforcements from the Marcher Lords, Edward pursued them, meeting Lancaster's army on 10 March at <a href="Burton-on-Trent">Burton-on-Trent</a>. Lancaster, outnumbered, retreated without a fight, fleeing north. <a href="Andrew%20Harclay%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Carlisle">Andrew Harclay</a> cornered Lancaster at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Boroughbridge">Battle of Boroughbridge</a>, and captured the Earl. Edward and Hugh the Younger met Lancaster at <a href="Pontefract%20Castle">Pontefract</a>, where, after a <a href="summary%20trial">summary trial</a>, the earl was found guilty of treason and beheaded.

Edward punished Lancaster's supporters through a system of special courts across the country, with the judges instructed in advance how to sentence the accused, who were not allowed to speak in their own defence. Many of these so-called "Contrariants" were simply executed, and others were imprisoned or fined, with their lands seized and their surviving relatives detained. The Earl of Pembroke, whom Edward now mistrusted, was arrested and only released after pledging all of his possessions as <a href="Collateral%20%28finance%29">collateral</a> for his own loyalty. Edward was able to reward his loyal supporters, especially the Despenser family, with the confiscated estates and new titles. The fines and confiscations made Edward rich: almost £15,000 was brought in during the first few months, and by 1326, Edward's treasury contained £62,000. A parliament was held at York in March 1322 at which the Ordinances were formally revoked through the <a href="Statute%20of%20York">Statute of York</a>, and fresh taxes agreed for a new campaign against the Scots.

The English campaign against Scotland was planned on a massive scale, with a force of around 23,350 men. Edward advanced through <a href="Lothian">Lothian</a> towards <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, but Robert the Bruce declined to meet him in battle, drawing Edward further into Scotland. Plans to resupply the campaign by sea failed, and the large army rapidly ran out of food. Edward was forced to retreat south of the border, pursued by Scottish raiding parties. Edward's illegitimate son, Adam, died during the campaign, and the raiding parties almost captured Isabella, who was staying at <a href="Tynemouth">Tynemouth</a> and was forced to flee by sea. The King planned a fresh campaign, backed by a round of further taxes, but confidence in Edward's Scottish policy was diminishing. Andrew Harclay, instrumental in securing Edward's victories the previous year and recently made the <a href="Earl%20of%20Carlisle">Earl of Carlisle</a>, independently negotiated a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce, proposing that Edward would recognise Robert as the King of Scotland and that, in return, Robert would cease to interfere in England. Edward was furious and immediately executed Harclay, but agreed to a thirteen-year truce with Robert.

Hugh Despenser the Younger lived and ruled in grand style, playing a leading role in Edward's government, and executing policy through a wide network of family retainers. Supported by <a href="Robert%20Baldock">Robert Baldock</a> and <a href="Walter%20Stapledon">Walter Stapledon</a>, Edward's chancellor and lord treasurer, the Despensers accumulated land and wealth, using their position in government to provide superficial cover for what historian Seymour Phillips describes as "the reality of fraud, threats of violence and abuse of legal procedure". Meanwhile, Edward faced growing opposition. <a href="Miracle">Miracle</a>s were reported around the late Earl of Lancaster's tomb, and at the <a href="gallows">gallows</a> used to execute members of the opposition in Bristol. Law and order began to break down, encouraged by the chaos caused by the seizure of lands. The old opposition consisting of Marcher Lords' associates attempted to free the prisoners Edward held in <a href="Wallingford%20Castle">Wallingford Castle</a>, and <a href="Roger%20Mortimer%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20March">Roger Mortimer</a>, one of the most prominent of the imprisoned Marcher Lords, escaped from the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> and fled to France.

The disagreements between Edward and the French Crown over the Duchy of Gascony led to the <a href="War%20of%20Saint-Sardos">War of Saint-Sardos</a> in 1324. <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20France">Charles</a>, Edward's brother-in-law, had become King of France in 1322, and was more aggressive than his predecessors. In 1323, he insisted that Edward come to Paris to give homage for Gascony, and demanded that Edward's administrators in Gascony allow French officials there to carry out orders given in Paris. Matters came to a head in October when a group of Edward's soldiers hanged a French sergeant for attempting to build a new <a href="bastide">fortified town</a> in the <a href="Agenais">Agenais</a>, a contested section of the Gascon border. Edward denied any responsibility for this incident, but relations between Edward and Charles soured. In 1324, Edward dispatched the Earl of Pembroke to Paris to broker a solution, but the earl died suddenly of an illness along the way. Charles mobilised his army and ordered the invasion of Gascony.

Edward's forces in Gascony were around 4,400 strong, but the French army, commanded by <a href="Charles%20of%20Valois">Charles of Valois</a>, numbered 7,000. Valois took the Agenais and then advanced further and cut off the main city of <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>. In response, Edward ordered the arrest of any French persons in England and seized Isabella's lands, on the basis that she was of French origin. In November 1324 he met with the earls and the English Church, who recommended that Edward should lead a force of 11,000 men to Gascony. Edward decided not to go personally, sending instead the Earl of Surrey. Meanwhile, Edward opened up fresh negotiations with the French king. Charles advanced various proposals, the most tempting of which was the suggestion that if Isabella and Prince Edward were to travel to Paris, and the Prince was to give homage to the French King for Gascony, he would terminate the war and return the Agenais. Edward and his advisers had concerns about sending the prince to France, but agreed to send Isabella on her own as an envoy in March 1325.

Isabella, with Edward's envoys, carried out negotiations with the French in late March. The negotiations proved difficult, and they arrived at a settlement only after Isabella personally intervened with her brother, Charles. The terms favoured the French crown: in particular, Edward would give homage in person to Charles for Gascony. Concerned about the consequences of war breaking out once again, Edward agreed to the treaty but decided to give Gascony to his son, Edward, and sent the prince to give homage in Paris. The young Prince Edward crossed the English Channel and completed the bargain in September.

Edward now expected Isabella and their son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back. Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage appears to have been successful, but by the time the Queen left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated. Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women. Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322. When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's. She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324. Finally, Edward had taken away her children and given the custody of them to Hugh Despenser's wife.

By February 1326, it was clear that Isabella was involved in a relationship with the exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had no effect.

Edward's opponents began to gather around Isabella and Mortimer in Paris, and Edward became increasingly anxious about the possibility that Mortimer might invade England. Isabella and Mortimer turned to <a href="William%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Hainaut">William</a>, the <a href="Count%20of%20Hainaut">Count of Hainaut</a>, and proposed a marriage between Prince Edward and William's daughter, <a href="Philippa%20of%20Hainault">Philippa</a>. In return for the advantageous alliance with the English heir to the throne, and a sizeable dower for the bride, William offered 132 <a href="Ship%20transport">transport vessel</a>s and 8 <a href="warships">warships</a> to assist in the invasion of England. Prince Edward and Philippa were betrothed on 27 August, and Isabella and Mortimer prepared for their campaign.

During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences along the coasts of England to protect against the possibility of an invasion either by France or by Roger Mortimer. Fleets were gathered at the ports of <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> in the south and <a href="River%20Orwell">Orwell</a> on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> as a diversionary attack. Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly turned against the regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.

Roger Mortimer, Isabella, and thirteen-year-old Prince Edward, accompanied by King Edward's half-brother Edmund of Woodstock, landed in Orwell on 24 September with a small force of men and met with no resistance. Instead, enemies of the Despensers moved rapidly to join them, including Edward's other half-brother, Thomas of Brotherton; <a href="Henry%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Henry of Lancaster</a>, who had inherited the earldom from his brother Thomas; and a range of senior clergy. Ensconced in the residence halls of the fortified and secure <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, Edward attempted to garner support from within the capital. The city of London rose against his government, and on 2 October the King left London, taking the Despensers with him. London descended into anarchy, as mobs attacked Edward's remaining officials and associates, killing his former treasurer Walter Stapledon in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, and taking the Tower and releasing the prisoners inside.

Edward continued west up the <a href="Thames%20Valley">Thames Valley</a>, reaching Gloucester between 9 and 12 October; he hoped to reach Wales and from there mobilise an army against the invaders. Mortimer and Isabella were not far behind. Proclamations condemned the Despensers' recent regime. Day-by-day they gathered new supporters Edward and the younger Despenser crossed over the border and set sail from <a href="Chepstow">Chepstow</a>, probably aiming first for <a href="Lundy">Lundy</a> and then for Ireland, where the King hoped to receive refuge and raise a fresh army. Bad weather drove them back, though, and they landed at <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. Edward retreated to <a href="Caerphilly%20Castle">Caerphilly Castle</a> and attempted to rally his remaining forces.

Edward's authority collapsed in England where, in the King's absence, Isabella's faction took over the administration with the support of the Church. Her forces surrounded Bristol, where Hugh Despenser the Elder had taken shelter; he surrendered and was promptly executed. Edward and Hugh the Younger fled their castle around 2 November, leaving behind jewellery, considerable supplies and at least £13,000 in cash, possibly once again hoping to reach Ireland, but on 16 November they were betrayed and captured by a search party north of Caerphilly. Edward was escorted first to <a href="Monmouth%20Castle">Monmouth Castle</a>, and from there back into England, where he was held at Henry of Lancaster's fortress at <a href="Kenilworth%20Castle">Kenilworth</a>. The King's final remaining forces, by now besieged in Caerphilly Castle, surrendered after five months in April 1327.

Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took revenge on the former regime. Hugh Despenser the Younger was put on trial, declared a traitor and sentenced to be disembowelled, castrated and quartered; he was duly executed on 24 November 1326. Edward's former chancellor, Robert Baldock, died in <a href="Fleet%20Prison">Fleet Prison</a>; the Earl of Arundel was beheaded. Edward's position, however, was problematic; he was still married to Isabella and, in principle, he remained the king, but most of the new administration had a lot to lose were he to be released and potentially regain power.

There was no established procedure for removing an English king. Adam Orleton, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a>, made a series of public allegations about Edward's conduct as king, and in January 1327 a parliament convened at Westminster at which the question of Edward's future was raised; Edward refused to attend the gathering. Parliament, initially ambivalent, responded to the London crowds that called for Prince Edward to take the throne. On 12 January the leading barons and clergy agreed that Edward II should be removed and replaced by his son. The following day it was presented to an assembly of the barons, where it was argued that Edward's weak leadership and personal faults had led the kingdom into disaster, and that he was incompetent to lead the country.

Shortly after this, a representative delegation of barons, clergy and knights was sent to Kenilworth to speak to the King. On 20 January 1327, Henry of Lancaster and the <a href="John%20de%20Stratford">bishops of Winchester</a> and <a href="Henry%20Burghersh">Lincoln</a> met privately with Edward in the castle. They informed Edward that if he were to resign as monarch, his son Prince Edward would succeed him, but if he failed to do so, his son might be disinherited as well, and the crown given to an alternative candidate. In tears, Edward agreed to abdicate, and on 21 January, Sir <a href="William%20Trussell">William Trussell</a>, representing the kingdom as a whole, withdrew his homage and formally ended Edward's reign. A proclamation was sent to London, announcing that Edward, now known just as Edward of Caernarvon, had freely resigned his kingdom and that Prince Edward would succeed him. The coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 2 February 1327.

Those opposed to the new government began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer decided to move Edward to the more secure location of <a href="Berkeley%20Castle">Berkeley Castle</a> in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, where the former King arrived around 5 April 1327. Once at the castle, Edward was kept in the custody of Mortimer's son-in-law, <a href="Thomas%20de%20Berkeley%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Berkeley">Thomas Berkeley</a>, and <a href="John%20Maltravers%2C%201st%20Baron%20Maltravers">John Maltravers</a>, who were given £5 a day for Edward's maintenance. It is unclear how well cared for Edward was; the records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated. A poem, the "<a href="Lament%20of%20Edward%20II">Lament of Edward II</a>", was once thought to have been written by Edward during his imprisonment, although modern scholarship has cast doubt on this.

Concerns continued to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got at least as far as breaking into the prison within the castle. As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327. The political situation remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.

On 23 September Edward III was informed that his father had died at Berkeley Castle during the night of 21 September. Most historians agree that Edward II did die at Berkeley on that date, although there is a minority view, described below, that he died much later. Edward's death was, as Mark Ormrod notes, "suspiciously timely", as it simplified Mortimer's political problems considerably, and most historians believe that Edward probably was murdered on the orders of the new regime, although it is impossible to be certain. Several of the individuals suspected of involvement in the death, including Sir Thomas Gurney, Maltravers and , later fled. If Edward died from natural causes, his death may have been hastened by <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a> following his imprisonment.

The rule of Isabella and Mortimer did not last long after the announcement of Edward's death. They made peace with the Scots in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Northampton">Treaty of Northampton</a>, but this move was highly unpopular. Isabella and Mortimer both amassed, and spent, great wealth, and criticism of them mounted. Relations between Mortimer and the young Edward III became strained and in 1330 the King conducted a "<a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>" at <a href="Nottingham%20Castle">Nottingham Castle</a>. He arrested Mortimer and then executed him on fourteen charges of treason, including the murder of Edward II. Edward III's government sought to blame Mortimer for all of the recent problems, effectively politically rehabilitating the late King. The King spared Isabella, giving her a generous allowance, and she soon returned to public life.

Edward's body was <a href="Embalming">embalmed</a> at Berkeley Castle, where it was viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester. It was then taken to <a href="Gloucester%20Abbey">Gloucester Abbey</a> on 21 October, and on 20 December Edward was buried by the <a href="high%20altar">high altar</a>, the funeral having probably been delayed to allow Edward III to attend in person. Gloucester was probably chosen because other abbeys had refused or been forbidden to take the King's body, and because it was close to Berkeley. The funeral was a grand affair and cost £351 in total, complete with gilt lions, standards painted with <a href="gold%20leaf">gold leaf</a> and oak barriers to manage the anticipated crowds. Edward III's government probably hoped to put a veneer of normality over the recent political events, increasing the legitimacy of the young King's own reign.

A temporary wooden <a href="effigy">effigy</a> with a copper crown was made for the funeral; this is the first known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at <a href="Christ%20Church%20Greyfriars">Newgate Church</a> in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a> effigy, with a <a href="Chest%20tomb">tomb-chest</a> and a canopy made of <a href="oolite">oolite</a> and <a href="Purbeck%20stone">Purbeck stone</a>. Edward was buried in the shirt, <a href="coif">coif</a> and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a <a href="sceptre">sceptre</a> and <a href="Globus%20cruciger">orb</a>, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.

The King's tomb rapidly became a popular site for visitors, probably encouraged by the local monks, who lacked an existing pilgrimage attraction. Visitors donated extensively to the abbey, allowing the monks to rebuild much of the surrounding church in the 1330s. Miracles reportedly took place at the tomb, and modifications had to be made to enable visitors to walk around it in larger numbers. The chronicler <a href="Geoffrey%20the%20Baker">Geoffrey de Baker</a> depicted Edward as a saintly, tortured <a href="martyr">martyr</a>, and <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II</a> gave royal support for an unsuccessful bid to have Edward <a href="Canonization">canonised</a> in 1395. The tomb was opened by officials in 1855, uncovering a wooden coffin, still in good condition, and a sealed lead coffin inside it. The tomb remains in what is now <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">Gloucester Cathedral</a>, and was extensively restored between 2007 and 2008 at a cost of over £100,000.

Controversy rapidly surrounded Edward's death. With Mortimer's execution in 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward had been murdered at Berkeley Castle. Accounts that he had been killed by the insertion of a red-hot iron or <a href="Fire%20iron">poker</a> into his <a href="anus">anus</a> slowly began to circulate, possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s spread this account further, supported in later years by <a href="Geoffrey%20le%20Baker">Geoffrey le Baker</a>'s colourful account of the killing. It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the logic in Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.

Another set of theories surround the possibility that Edward did not really die in 1327. These theories typically involve the "<a href="Fieschi%20Letter">Fieschi Letter</a>", sent to Edward III by an Italian priest called Manuel Fieschi, who claimed that Edward escaped Berkeley Castle in 1327 with the help of a servant and ultimately retired to become a hermit in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. The body buried at Gloucester Cathedral was said to be that of the porter of Berkeley Castle, killed by the assassins and presented by them to Isabella as Edward's corpse to avoid punishment. The letter is often linked to an account of Edward III meeting with a man called William the Welshman in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> in 1338, who claimed to be Edward II. Some parts of the letter's content are considered broadly accurate by historians, although other aspects of its account have been criticised as implausible. A few historians have supported versions of its narrative. <a href="Paul%20C.%20Doherty">Paul Doherty</a> questions the veracity of the letter and the identity of William the Welshman, but nonetheless has suspicions that Edward may have survived his imprisonment. The <a href="Popular%20history">popular historian</a> <a href="Alison%20Weir">Alison Weir</a> believes the events in the letter to be essentially true, using the letter to argue that Isabella was innocent of murdering Edward. The historian <a href="Ian%20Mortimer%20%28historian%29">Ian Mortimer</a> suggests that the story in Fieschi's letter is broadly accurate, but argues that it was in fact Mortimer and Isabella who had Edward secretly released, and who then faked his death, a fiction later maintained by Edward III when he came to power. Ian Mortimer's account was criticised by most scholars when it was first published, in particular by historian <a href="David%20Carpenter%20%28historian%29">David Carpenter</a>.

Edward was ultimately a failure as a king; the historian Michael Prestwich observes that he "was lazy and incompetent, liable to outbursts of temper over unimportant issues, yet indecisive when it came to major issues", echoed by Roy Haines' description of Edward as "incompetent and vicious", and as "no man of business". Edward did not just delegate routine government to his subordinates, but also higher level decision making, and Pierre Chaplais argues that he "was not so much an incompetent king as a reluctant one", preferring to rule through a powerful deputy, such as Piers Gaveston or Hugh Despenser the Younger. Edward's willingness to promote his favourites had serious political consequences, although he also attempted to buy the loyalty of a wider grouping of nobles through grants of money and fees. Edward could take a keen interest in the minutiae of administration, however, and on occasion engaged in the details of a wide range of issues across England and his wider domains.

One of Edward's persistent challenges through most of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s. The King worked his way through many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise. He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno. Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and attempting to increase revenues directly by cutting back on the expenses of his own household.

Edward was responsible for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials. It is uncertain to what extent Edward took a personal interest in dispensing justice, but he appears to have involved himself to some degree during the first part of his reign, and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322. Edward made extensive use of <a href="Civil%20law%20%28Roman%29">Roman civil law</a> during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites, which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning the established principles of the <a href="English%20Common%20Law">English Common Law</a>. Edward was also criticised by contemporaries for allowing the Despensers to exploit the royal justice system for their own ends; the Despensers certainly appear to have abused the system, although just how widely they did so is unclear. Amid the political turbulence, armed gangs and violence spread across England under Edward's reign, destabilising the position of many of the local <a href="gentry">gentry</a>; much of Ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy.

Under Edward's rule, parliament's importance grew as a means of making political decisions and answering petitions, although as the historian Claire Valente notes, the gatherings were "still as much an event as an institution". After 1311, parliament began to include, in addition to the barons, the representatives of the <a href="knight">knight</a>s and <a href="burgess%20%28title%29">burgess</a>es, who in later years would constitute the "<a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">commons</a>". Although parliament often opposed raising fresh taxes, active opposition to Edward came largely from the barons, rather than parliament itself, although the barons did seek to use the parliamentary meetings as a way of giving legitimacy to their long-standing political demands. After resisting it for many years, Edward began intervening in parliament in the second half of his reign to achieve his own political aims. It remains unclear whether Edward was deposed in 1327 by a formal gathering of parliament or simply a gathering of the political classes alongside an existing parliament.

Edward's royal court was itinerant, travelling around the country with the King. When housed in Westminster Palace, the court occupied a complex of two halls, seven chambers and three <a href="chapel">chapel</a>s, along with other smaller rooms, but, due to the Scottish conflict, the court spent much of its time in Yorkshire and Northumbria. At the heart of the court was Edward's royal household, in turn divided into the "hall" and the "chamber"; the size of the household varied over time, but in 1317 was around 500 strong, including household knights, squires, kitchen and transport staff. The household was surrounded by a wider group of courtiers, and appears to have also attracted a circle of prostitutes and criminal elements.

Music and minstrels were very popular at Edward's court, but hunting appears to have been a much less important activity, and there was little emphasis on chivalric events. Edward was interested in buildings and paintings, but less so in literary works, which were not extensively sponsored at court. There was an extensive use of gold and silver plates, jewels and enamelling at court, which would have been richly decorated. Edward kept a <a href="camel">camel</a> as a pet and, as a young man, took a <a href="lion">lion</a> with him on campaign to Scotland. The court could be entertained in exotic ways: by an Italian <a href="snake-charmer">snake-charmer</a> in 1312, and the following year by 54 nude French dancers.

Edward's approach to religion was normal for the period, and the historian Michael Prestwich describes him as "a man of wholly conventional religious attitudes". There were daily chapel services and <a href="alms-giving">alms-giving</a> at his court, and Edward blessed the sick, although he did this less often than his predecessors. Edward remained close to the Dominican Order, who had helped to educate him, and followed their advice in asking for papal permission to be anointed with the Holy Oil of St Thomas of Canterbury in 1319; this request was refused, causing the King some embarrassment. Edward supported the expansion of the universities during his reign, establishing <a href="King%27s%20Hall%2C%20Cambridge">King's Hall</a> in Cambridge to promote training in religious and civil law, <a href="Oriel%20College">Oriel College</a> in Oxford and a <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin%23History">short-lived university in Dublin</a>.

Edward enjoyed a good relationship with <a href="Pope%20Clement%20V">Pope Clement V</a>, despite the King's repeated intervention in the operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest and concern for their own protection.

<a href="Pope%20John%20XXII">Pope John XXII</a>, elected in 1316, sought Edward's support for a new crusade, and was also inclined to support him politically. In 1317, in exchange for papal support in his war with Scotland, Edward agreed to recommence paying the annual Papal tribute, which had been first agreed to by <a href="John%20of%20England">King John</a> in 1213; Edward soon ceased the payments, however, and the King never offered his homage, another part of the 1213 agreement. In 1325 Edward asked Pope John to instruct the Irish Church to openly preach in favour of his right to rule the island, and to threaten to excommunicate any contrary voices.

No chronicler for this period is entirely trustworthy or unbiased, often because their accounts were written to support a particular cause, but it is clear that most contemporary chroniclers were highly critical of Edward. The "<a href="Polychronicon">Polychronicon</a>", "<a href="Vita%20Edwardi%20Secundi">Vita Edwardi Secundi</a>", "Vita et Mors Edwardi Secundi" and the "Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon" for example all condemned the King's personality, habits and choice of companions. Other records from his reign show criticism of Edward by his contemporaries, including the Church and members of his own household. <a href="Political%20song">Political song</a>s were written about him, complaining about his failure in war and his oppressive government. Later in the 14th century, some chroniclers, such as Geoffrey le Baker and <a href="Thomas%20Ringstead">Thomas Ringstead</a>, rehabilitated Edward, presenting him as a martyr and a potential saint, although this tradition died out in later years.

Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries focused on Edward's relationship with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign and the events surrounding the relationship of the <a href="Jean%20Louis%20de%20Nogaret%20de%20La%20Valette">Duc d'Épernon</a> and <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20France">Henry III of France</a>, and between the <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Duke of Buckingham</a> and <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. In the first half of the 19th century, popular historians such as <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href="Charles%20Knight%20%28publisher%29">Charles Knight</a> popularised Edward's life with the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian public</a>, focusing on the King's relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality. From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward's sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values. By the start of the 20th century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward's personal relationships in history lessons. Views on Edward's sexuality have continued to develop over the years.

By the end of the 19th century, more administrative records from the period had become available to historians such as <a href="William%20Stubbs">William Stubbs</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Frederick%20Tout">Thomas Tout</a> and J. C. Davies, who focused on the development of the English constitutional and governmental system during his reign. Although critical of what they regarded as Edward's inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward II, which they perceived as positive developments. During the 1970s the historiography of Edward's reign shifted away from this model, supported by the further publishing of records from the period in the last quarter of the 20th century. The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, <a href="John%20Maddicott">John Maddicott</a> and <a href="J.%20R.%20S.%20Phillips">Seymour Phillips</a> re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts. With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's early years, and <a href="Natalie%20Fryde">Natalie Fryde</a>'s study of Edward's final years, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the King were published by <a href="Roy%20Martin%20Haines">Roy Haines</a> and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.

Several plays have shaped Edward's contemporary image. <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>'s play "<a href="Edward%20II%20%28play%29">Edward II</a>" was first performed around 1592, and focuses on Edward's relationship with Piers Gaveston, reflecting 16th-century concerns about the relationships between monarchs and their favourites. Marlowe presents Edward's death as a murder, drawing parallels between the killing and martyrdom; although Marlowe does not describe the actual nature of Edward's murder in the script, it has usually been performed following the tradition that Edward was killed with a red-hot poker. The character of Edward in the play, who has been likened to Marlowe's contemporaries <a href="James%20VI%20of%20Scotland">James VI of Scotland</a> and Henry III of France, may have influenced <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s portrayal of <a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>. In the 17th century, the playwright <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> picked up the same theme for his unfinished work, "<a href="Mortimer%20His%20Fall">Mortimer His Fall</a>".

The filmmaker <a href="Derek%20Jarman">Derek Jarman</a> adapted the Marlowe play into a <a href="Edward%20II%20%28film%29">film</a> in 1991, creating a <a href="postmodern">postmodern</a> <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a> of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies. In Jarman's version, Edward finally escapes captivity, following the tradition in the Fieschi letter. Edward's current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting appearance in <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>'s 1995 film "<a href="Braveheart">Braveheart</a>", where he is portrayed as weak and implicitly homosexual, wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup, shunning the company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with the Scots. The film received extensive criticism, both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality.

Edward's life has also been used in a wide variety of other media. In the Victorian era, the painting "Edward II and Piers Gaveston" by <a href="Marcus%20Stone">Marcus Stone</a> strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit. It was initially shown at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> in 1872, but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive. More recently, the director <a href="David%20Bintley">David Bintley</a> used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet "<a href="Edward%20II%20%28ballet%29">Edward II</a>", first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer <a href="John%20McCabe%20%28composer%29">John McCabe</a>'s symphony "Edward II", produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 "The Gascon" and Chris Hunt's 1992 "Gaveston" have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while <a href="Stephanie%20Merritt">Stephanie Merritt</a>'s 2002 "Gaveston" transports the story into the 20th century.

Edward II had four children with Isabella:


Edward also fathered the illegitimate <a href="Adam%20FitzRoy">Adam FitzRoy</a> (c. 1307–1322), who accompanied his father in the Scottish campaigns of 1322 and died shortly afterwards.

As a public figure, Pitt has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, he was cited as the world's <a href="Sex%20symbol">most attractive man</a> by various media outlets, and his personal life is the subject of wide publicity. In 2000, he married actress <a href="Jennifer%20Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a>; they divorced in 2005. In 2014, Pitt married actress <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. In 2016, Jolie filed for a divorce from Pitt, which is currently pending.

Pitt was born in <a href="Shawnee%2C%20Oklahoma">Shawnee, Oklahoma</a>, to William Alvin Pitt, the proprietor of a trucking company, and Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counsellor. The family soon moved to <a href="Springfield%2C%20Missouri">Springfield, Missouri</a>, where he lived together with his younger siblings, <a href="Douglas%20Pitt">Douglas Mitchell</a> (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969). Born into a conservative household, he was raised as <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist</a> but has since stated that he does not "have a great relationship with religion" and that he "oscillate[s] between <a href="agnosticism">agnosticism</a> and <a href="atheism">atheism</a>". Pitt has described Springfield as "<a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> country, <a href="Jesse%20James">Jesse James</a> country", having grown up with "a lot of hills, a lot of lakes".

Pitt attended <a href="Kickapoo%20High%20School%20%28Springfield%2C%20Missouri%29">Kickapoo High School</a>, where he was a member of the golf, swimming and tennis teams. He participated in the school's <a href="Key%20Club">Key</a> and <a href="Forensics%20%28public%20speaking%29">Forensics</a> clubs, in school debates, and in musicals. Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the <a href="University%20of%20Missouri">University of Missouri</a> in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising. As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—"a portal into different worlds for me"—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made. Two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs. He has named his early acting heroes as <a href="Gary%20Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>, <a href="Sean%20Penn">Sean Penn</a> and <a href="Mickey%20Rourke">Mickey Rourke</a>.

While struggling to establish himself in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Pitt took lessons from acting coach <a href="Roy%20London">Roy London</a>. Pitt's acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films "<a href="No%20Way%20Out%20%281987%20film%29">No Way Out</a>" (1987), "<a href="No%20Man%27s%20Land%20%281987%20film%29">No Man's Land</a>" (1987) and "<a href="Less%20Than%20Zero%20%28film%29">Less Than Zero</a>" (1987). In May 1987, his television debut came with a two-episode role on the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> soap opera "<a href="Another%20World%20%28TV%20series%29">Another World</a>". In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> sitcom "<a href="Growing%20Pains">Growing Pains</a>". He appeared in four episodes of the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> primetime series "<a href="Dallas%20%281978%20TV%20series%29">Dallas</a>" between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by <a href="Shalane%20McCall">Shalane McCall</a>). Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> police drama "<a href="21%20Jump%20Street">21 Jump Street</a>". In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production "<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Sun%20%28film%29">The Dark Side of the Sun</a>" (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the <a href="Croatian%20War%20of%20Independence">Croatian War of Independence</a>, and was not released until 1997. Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy "<a href="Happy%20Together%20%281989%20American%20film%29">Happy Together</a>"; the second a featured role in the horror film "<a href="Cutting%20Class">Cutting Class</a>", the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters. He made guest appearances on television series "<a href="Head%20of%20the%20Class">Head of the Class</a>", "<a href="Freddy%27s%20Nightmares">Freddy's Nightmares</a>", "<a href="Thirtysomething%20%28TV%20series%29">Thirtysomething</a>", and (for a second time) "Growing Pains".

Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by <a href="Juliette%20Lewis">Juliette Lewis</a>) in the 1990 NBC television movie "<a href="Too%20Young%20to%20Die%3F">Too Young to Die?</a>", the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder. Ken Tucker, television reviewer for "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" wrote: "Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary." The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama "<a href="Glory%20Days%20%281990%20TV%20series%29">Glory Days</a>" and took a supporting role in the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> television film "<a href="The%20Image%20%28TV%29">The Image</a>". His next appearance came in the 1991 film "<a href="Across%20the%20Tracks">Across the Tracks</a>"; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by <a href="Ricky%20Schroder">Rick Schroder</a>. After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s 1991 road film "<a href="Thelma%20%26amp%3B%20Louise">Thelma & Louise</a>". He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (<a href="Geena%20Davis">Geena Davis</a>). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a <a href="sex%20symbol">sex symbol</a>. After "Thelma & Louise", Pitt starred in the 1991 film "<a href="Johnny%20Suede">Johnny Suede</a>", a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star, and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film "<a href="Cool%20World">Cool World</a>", although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.

Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film "<a href="A%20River%20Runs%20Through%20It%20%28film%29">A River Runs Through It</a>", directed by <a href="Robert%20Redford">Robert Redford</a>. His portrayal of the character was described by "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>"s Janet Mock as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could be more than a "cowboy-hatted hunk." He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his "weakest performances ... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for." Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying "when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better." In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film "<a href="Kalifornia">Kalifornia</a>". He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis's character in a performance described by <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" as "outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace." Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit "<a href="True%20Romance">True Romance</a>" as a stoner named Floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film. He capped the year by winning a <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Theatre%20Owners">ShoWest</a> Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.

1994 marked a significant turning point in Pitt's career. Starring as the vampire <a href="Louis%20de%20Pointe%20du%20Lac">Louis de Pointe du Lac</a> in the horror film "<a href="Interview%20with%20the%20Vampire%20%28film%29">Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles</a>", based on <a href="Anne%20Rice">Anne Rice</a>'s 1976 <a href="Interview%20with%20the%20Vampire">novel of the same name</a>, he was part of an ensemble cast that included <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, <a href="Kirsten%20Dunst">Kirsten Dunst</a>, <a href="Christian%20Slater">Christian Slater</a>, and <a href="Antonio%20Banderas">Antonio Banderas</a>. Despite his winning two <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Awards">MTV Movie Awards</a> at the <a href="1995%20MTV%20Movie%20Awards">1995 ceremony</a>, his performance was poorly received. According to the "<a href="Dallas%20Observer">Dallas Observer</a>", "Brad Pitt [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side [...] he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis." Following the release of "Interview with the Vampire", Pitt starred in "<a href="Legends%20of%20the%20Fall">Legends of the Fall</a>" (1994), based on a novel by the same name by <a href="Jim%20Harrison">Jim Harrison</a>, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (<a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a>) a <a href="Cornish%20American">Cornish</a> immigrant, Pitt received his first <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination, in the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Drama">Best Actor</a> category. <a href="Aidan%20Quinn">Aidan Quinn</a> and <a href="Henry%20Thomas">Henry Thomas</a> co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed, many film critics praised Pitt's performance. <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said, "Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way." The "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>" predicted that "Legends of the Fall" would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.

In 1995, Pitt starred alongside <a href="Morgan%20Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a> and <a href="Gwyneth%20Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> in the crime thriller "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Seven</a>", playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer. Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons. He expressed his intent to move on from "this 'pretty boy' thing [...] and play someone with flaws." His performance was critically well received, with "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt's ability to turn in a "determined, energetic, creditable job" as the detective. "Seven" earned $327 million at the international box office. Following the success of "Seven", Pitt took a supporting role as Jeffrey Goines in <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>'s 1995 science-fiction film "<a href="12%20Monkeys">12 Monkeys</a>". The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of the "New York Times" called "Twelve Monkeys" "fierce and disturbing" and remarked on Pitt's "startlingly frenzied performance", concluding that he "electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film." He won a Golden Globe Award for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Best Supporting Actor</a> for the film and received his first <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a>.

The following year he had a role in the legal drama "<a href="Sleepers%20%28film%29">Sleepers</a>" (1996), based on <a href="Lorenzo%20Carcaterra">Lorenzo Carcaterra</a>'s novel of the same name. The film received mixed reviews. In the 1997 film "<a href="The%20Devil%27s%20Own">The Devil's Own</a>" Pitt starred, opposite <a href="Harrison%20Ford">Harrison Ford</a>, as the <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Irish Republican Army</a> terrorist Rory Devany, a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent. Critical opinion was divided on his accent; "Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing – it's hard to understand what he's saying", wrote the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>." "<a href="The%20Charleston%20Gazette">The Charleston Gazette</a>" opined that it had favored Pitt's accent over the movie. "The Devil's Own" grossed $140 million worldwide, but was a critical failure. Later that year he led as Austrian mountaineer <a href="Heinrich%20Harrer">Heinrich Harrer</a> in the <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Annaud">Jean-Jacques Annaud</a> film "<a href="Seven%20Years%20in%20Tibet%20%281997%20film%29">Seven Years in Tibet</a>". Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in California and the European <a href="Alps">Alps</a> with his co-star <a href="David%20Thewlis">David Thewlis</a>. The film received mostly negative reviews, and was generally considered a disappointment. Pitt had the lead role in 1998's fantasy romance film "<a href="Meet%20Joe%20Black">Meet Joe Black</a>". He portrayed a <a href="death%20%28personification%29">personification of death</a> inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human. The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> of the "San Francisco Chronicle", Pitt was unable to "make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity." <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> stated "Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation."

In 1999, Pitt portrayed <a href="Fight%20Club%20%28novel%29">Tyler Durden</a> in "<a href="Fight%20Club">Fight Club</a>", a film adaptation of <a href="Chuck%20Palahniuk">Chuck Palahniuk</a>'s <a href="Fight%20Club%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>, directed by <a href="David%20Fincher">David Fincher</a>. Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in <a href="boxing">boxing</a>, <a href="taekwondo">taekwondo</a>, and <a href="grappling">grappling</a>. To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended. While promoting "Fight Club", Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to "have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end." "Fight Club" premiered at the 1999 <a href="Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">Venice International Film Festival</a>. Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Pitt's performance was widely praised. <a href="Paul%20Clinton">Paul Clinton</a> of <a href="CNN">CNN</a> noted the risky yet successful nature of the film, while "Variety" remarked upon Pitt's ability to be "cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in "Thelma and Louise"". In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, "Fight Club" became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.

Pitt was cast as an Irish Gypsy <a href="boxing">boxer</a> with a barely intelligible accent in <a href="Guy%20Ritchie">Guy Ritchie</a>'s 2000 gangster film "<a href="Snatch%20%28film%29">Snatch</a>". Several reviewers were critical of "Snatch"; however, most praised Pitt. Mick LaSalle of the "San Francisco Chronicle" said Pitt was "ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can't understand him", going on to say that, before "Snatch", Pitt had been "shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;" while <a href="Amy%20Taubin">Amy Taubin</a> of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" claimed that "Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role". The following year Pitt starred opposite <a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a> in the <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a> "<a href="The%20Mexican">The Mexican</a>", a film that garnered a range of reviews but enjoyed box office success. Pitt's next role, in 2001's $143 million-grossing <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> thriller "<a href="Spy%20Game">Spy Game</a>", was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a>'s <a href="Special%20Activities%20Division">Special Activities Division</a>, mentored by <a href="Robert%20Redford">Robert Redford</a>'s character. Mark Holcomb of <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided "much of an emotional connection for the audience".

On November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the <a href="The%20One%20with%20the%20Rumor">eighth season</a> of the television series "<a href="Friends">Friends</a>", playing a man with a grudge against <a href="Rachel%20Green">Rachel Green</a>, played by <a href="Jennifer%20Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a>, to whom Pitt was married at the time. For this performance he was nominated for an <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> in the category of <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actor%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Comedy%20Series">Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series</a>. In December 2001, Pitt played <a href="Rusty%20Ryan%20%28character%29">Rusty Ryan</a> in the heist film "<a href="Ocean%27s%20Eleven%20%282001%20film%29">Ocean's Eleven</a>", a remake of the 1960 <a href="Ocean%27s%20Eleven%20%281960%20film%29">Rat Pack original</a>. He joined an ensemble cast including <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>, <a href="Matt%20Damon">Matt Damon</a>, <a href="Andy%20Garc%C3%ADa">Andy García</a>, and Julia Roberts.

Pitt appeared in two episodes of MTV's reality series "<a href="Jackass%20%28TV%20series%29">Jackass</a>" in February 2002, first running through the streets of Los Angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits, and participating in his own staged abduction in another episode. In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney's directorial debut "<a href="Confessions%20of%20a%20Dangerous%20Mind">Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</a>".

Pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a> in "<a href="Troy%20%28film%29">Troy</a>", and reprising his role, <a href="Rusty%20Ryan%20%28character%29">Rusty Ryan</a>, in the sequel "<a href="Ocean%27s%20Twelve">Ocean's Twelve</a>". He spent six months sword training before the filming of "Troy", based on the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>". An on-set injury to his <a href="Achilles%20tendon">Achilles tendon</a> delayed production on the picture for several weeks. <a href="Stephen%20Hunter">Stephen Hunter</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role. "Troy" was the first film produced by <a href="Plan%20B%20Entertainment">Plan B Entertainment</a>, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and <a href="Brad%20Grey">Brad Grey</a>, CEO of <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. "Ocean's Twelve" earned $362 million worldwide, and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as "the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford." In 2005, Pitt starred in the <a href="Doug%20Liman">Doug Liman</a>-directed action comedy "<a href="Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Smith%20%282005%20film%29">Mr. & Mrs. Smith</a>", in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Star Tribune</a>" noted that "while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry". "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.

For his next film, Pitt starred opposite <a href="Cate%20Blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a> in <a href="Alejandro%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20I%C3%B1%C3%A1rritu">Alejandro González Iñárritu</a>'s <a href="multiperspectivity">multi-narrative</a> drama "<a href="Babel%20%28film%29">Babel</a>" (2006). Pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>" said that he was credible and gave the film visibility. Pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career. The film was screened at a special presentation at the <a href="2006%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2006 Cannes Film Festival</a> and was later featured at the 2006 <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>.

Pitt is a supporter of <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a>. In an October 2006 interview with "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>", Pitt said that he would marry Jolie when everyone in America is legally able to marry. In September 2008, he donated $100,000 to the campaign against California's 2008 ballot proposition <a href="California%20Proposition%208%20%282008%29">Proposition 8</a>, an initiative to overturn <a href="In%20re%20Marriage%20Cases">the state Supreme Court decision</a> that had <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20California">legalized same-sex marriage</a>. In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of <a href="Dustin%20Lance%20Black">Dustin Lance Black</a>'s play, "<a href="8%20%28play%29">'8'</a>" – a staged reenactment of the <a href="Perry%20v.%20Brown">federal trial</a> that overturned California's <a href="Proposition%208">Prop 8 ban</a> on same-sex marriage – as Judge <a href="Vaughn%20Walker">Vaughn Walker</a>.

In September 2012, Pitt reaffirmed his support of President Obama, saying, "I am an Obama supporter and I'm backing his US election campaign."

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pitt was involved in successive relationships with several of his co-stars, including <a href="Robin%20Givens">Robin Givens</a> ("<a href="Head%20of%20the%20Class">Head of the Class</a>"), <a href="Jill%20Schoelen">Jill Schoelen</a> ("<a href="Cutting%20Class">Cutting Class</a>"), and <a href="Juliette%20Lewis">Juliette Lewis</a> ("<a href="Too%20Young%20to%20Die%3F">Too Young to Die?</a>" and "<a href="Kalifornia">Kalifornia</a>"). In addition, Pitt had a much-publicized romance and engagement to his "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Seven</a>" co-star, <a href="Gwyneth%20Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, whom he dated from 1994 to 1997.

Pitt met "<a href="Friends">Friends</a>" actress <a href="Jennifer%20Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> in 1998 and married her in a private wedding ceremony in <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu</a> on July 29, 2000. In January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced they had decided to separate. Two months later, Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Pitt and Aniston's divorce was finalized by the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Superior%20Court">Los Angeles Superior Court</a> on October 2, 2005. Despite media reports that Pitt and Aniston had an acrimonious relationship, Pitt said in a February 2009 interview that he and Aniston "check in with each other", adding that they were both big parts of each other's lives.

During Pitt's divorce proceedings, his involvement with his "<a href="Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Smith%20%282005%20film%29">Mr. & Mrs. Smith</a>" co-star <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> attracted media attention. Jolie and Pitt stated that they "fell in love" on the set, and that there was no infidelity. In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of <a href="paparazzi">paparazzi</a> photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie and her son Maddox at a beach in <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. During 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple "<a href="Brangelina">Brangelina</a>". On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to "<a href="People%20%28American%20magazine%29">People</a>" that she was pregnant with Pitt's child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time. Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012 after seven years together. They were married on August 23, 2014, in a private ceremony in <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20Miraval%2C%20Correns-Var">Château Miraval</a>, <a href="France">France</a>. On September 19, 2016, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences.

In July 2005, Pitt accompanied Jolie to <a href="Addis%20Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, where she adopted her second child, Zahara Marley. On December 3, 2005, Pitt was in the process of becoming the adoptive father of Zahara, and Jolie's first adopted child, Maddox Chivan. On January 19, 2006, a California judge granted Jolie's request to change the children's surnames from "Jolie" to "Jolie-Pitt". The adoptions were finalized soon after.

Jolie gave birth to daughter Shiloh Nouvel in <a href="Swakopmund">Swakopmund</a>, <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, on May 27, 2006. Pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would qualify for a Namibian passport. The couple sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor <a href="Getty%20Images">Getty Images</a>; the North American rights were purchased by "People" for over $4.1 million, while "<a href="Hello%21">Hello!</a>" obtained the British rights for approximately $3.5 million. The proceeds from the sale were donated to charities serving African children. <a href="Madame%20Tussauds">Madame Tussauds</a> in New York unveiled a <a href="wax%20figure">wax figure</a> of two-month-old Shiloh; it marked the first time an infant was recreated in wax by Madame Tussauds.

On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted three-year-old Pax Thien from an orphanage in <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. Pitt adopted Pax in the United States on February 21, 2008.

At the <a href="2008%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. She gave birth to son Knox Léon and daughter Vivienne Marcheline on July 12, 2008 in <a href="Nice">Nice</a>, <a href="France">France</a>. The rights for the first images of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to "People" and "Hello!" for $14 million—<a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20celebrity%20photographs">the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken</a>. The couple donated the proceeds to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.

Pitt has been cited as physically attractive by many sources, including "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>", who named him one of the 25 sexiest stars in film history in 1995. The same year, Pitt won "<a href="People%20%28American%20magazine%29">People</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s <a href="Sexiest%20Man%20Alive">Sexiest Man Alive</a>, an accolade he won again in 2000. Pitt appeared on "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s annual <a href="Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a> list of the 100 most powerful celebrities in 2006, 2007, and 2008, at No. 20, No. 5, and No. 10 respectively. In 2007, he was listed among the <a href="Time%20100">Time 100</a>, a compilation of the 100 most influential people in the world, as selected annually by "TIME". The magazine credited Pitt with using "his star power to get people to look [to where] cameras don't usually catch". Pitt was again included in the Time 100 in 2009, this time in the Builders and Titans list.

Starting in 2005, Pitt's relationship with Angelina Jolie became one of the most reported celebrity stories worldwide. After confirming that Jolie was pregnant in early 2006, the significant media hype surrounding the couple reached what <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a>, in a story titled "The <a href="Brangelina">Brangelina</a> fever," called "the point of insanity". To avoid media attention, the couple flew to <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> for the birth of their daughter Shiloh, which was described by a paparazzi blog as "the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ." Similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement two years later of Jolie's second pregnancy; for the two weeks Jolie spent in a seaside hospital in <a href="Nice">Nice</a>, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.

In a 2006 global industry survey by <a href="ACNielsen">ACNielsen</a> in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide. Pitt has appeared in several <a href="television%20commercials">television commercials</a>.

Ryan White

Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971 – April 8, 1990) was an American teenager from <a href="Kokomo%2C%20Indiana">Kokomo, Indiana</a>, who became a national <a href="poster%20child">poster child</a> for <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20the%20United%20States">HIV/AIDS in the United States</a> after failing to be re-admitted to school following a diagnosis of AIDS. As a <a href="hemophilia">hemophilia</a>c, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated <a href="factor%20VIII%20%28medication%29">factor VIII</a> blood treatment and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, as AIDS is not an airborne disease and spreads solely through body fluids, but AIDS was poorly understood by the general public at the time. When White tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in <a href="Howard%20County%2C%20Indiana">Howard County</a> rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for <a href="AIDS%20research">AIDS research</a> and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted. He died on April 8, 1990, one month before his high school graduation.

Before Ryan White, AIDS was a <a href="disease">disease</a> stigmatized as an illness impacting the <a href="gay%20community">gay community</a>, because it was first diagnosed among <a href="gay%20men">gay men</a>. That perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent <a href="Heterosexuality">straight</a> HIV-infected people such as <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Ashe">Arthur Ashe</a> and the <a href="Ray%20brothers">Ray brothers</a> appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the <a href="Ryan%20White%20CARE%20Act">Ryan White CARE Act</a>, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.

Ryan White was born at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in <a href="Kokomo%2C%20Indiana">Kokomo, Indiana</a>, to Hubert Wayne and Jeanne Elaine (Hale) White. When he was <a href="Circumcision">circumcised</a>, the bleeding would not stop. When he was three days old, doctors diagnosed him with severe <a href="hemophilia%20A">hemophilia A</a>, a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the <a href="X%20chromosome">X chromosome</a>, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of <a href="factor%20VIII%20%28medication%29">factor VIII</a>, a <a href="blood%20product">blood product</a> created from pooled <a href="blood%20plasma">plasma</a> of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.

Healthy for most of his childhood, White became extremely ill with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in December 1984. On December 17, 1984, during a lung biopsy, White was diagnosed with <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a>. By this time the scientific community had studied the epidemic in great detail. Earlier that year, HTLV-III was identified and isolated by American research scientists, confirming the work done by French research scientists who called it LAV. A lengthy public battle to determine who should be recognized as the discoverer of the human retro virus delayed development of a test for what would later be called HIV. White had apparently received a contaminated treatment of factor VIII that was infected with HIV, as did thousands of other Americans with hemophilia and hemophiliacs around the world. At that time, because the retrovirus that causes AIDS had been recently identified, much of the pooled factor VIII concentrate was tainted. Blood banks and pharmaceuticals dismissed calls by the CDC to use a Hepatitis B test as a surrogate until a HIV test could be developed. Late plasma products were screened and heat-treated to deactivate both HIV and Hepatitis. Among hemophiliacs treated with blood-clotting factors between 1979 and 1984, nearly 90% became infected with HIV and/or Hepatitis C. At the time of his diagnosis, his <a href="T%20helper%20cell">T-cell count</a> had dropped to 25 (a healthy individual without HIV will have around 500–1200). Doctors predicted Ryan White had only six months to live.

After the diagnosis, White was too ill to return to school, but by early 1985 he began to feel better. His mother asked if he could return to school, but was told by school officials that he could not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by <a href="Western%20School%20Corporation">Western School Corporation</a> superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.

<a href="Western%20School%20Corporation">Western Middle School</a> in <a href="Russiaville">Russiaville</a> faced enormous pressure from many parents and faculty to prevent White from returning to the campus after his diagnosis became widely known. In the school of 360 total students, 117 parents and 50 teachers signed a petition encouraging school leaders to ban White from school. Due to the widespread fear and ignorance of AIDS, the principal and later the school board succumbed to this pressure and prohibited re-admittance. The White family filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision. The Whites initially filed suit in the <a href="U.S.%20District%20Court%20in%20Indianapolis">U.S. District Court in Indianapolis</a>. The court, however, declined to hear the case until administrative appeals had been resolved. On November 25, an <a href="Indiana%20Department%20of%20Education">Indiana Department of Education</a> officer ruled that the school must follow the Indiana Board of Health guidelines and that White must be allowed to attend school.

The means of transmission of HIV had not yet been fully resolved by the mid to late 1980s. Scientists knew it spread via blood and was not transmittable by any sort of casual contact, but as recently as 1983, the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> had thought that "Evidence Suggests Household Contact May Transmit AIDS", and the belief that the disease could easily spread persisted. Children with AIDS were still rare; at the time of White's rejection from school, the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> knew of only 148 cases of pediatric AIDS in the United States. Many families in Kokomo believed his presence posed an unacceptable risk. When White was permitted to return to school for one day in February 1986, 151 of 360 students stayed home. He also worked as a <a href="paperboy%20%28newspaper%20delivery%29">paperboy</a>, and many of the people on his route canceled their subscriptions, believing that HIV could be transmitted through newsprint.

The Indiana state health commissioner, Dr. Woodrow Myers, who had extensive experience treating AIDS patients in San Francisco, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both notified the board that White posed no risk to other students, but the school board and many parents ignored their statements. In February 1986, "<a href="The%20New%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>" published a study of 101 people who had spent three months living in close but non-sexual contact with people with AIDS. The study concluded that the risk of infection was "minimal to nonexistent," even when contact included sharing toothbrushes, razors, clothing, combs and drinking glasses; sleeping in the same bed; and hugging and kissing.

When White was finally readmitted in April, a group of families withdrew their children and started an alternative school. Threats of violence and lawsuits persisted. According to White's mother, people on the street would often yell, "we know you're queer" at Ryan. The editors and publishers of the "<a href="Kokomo%20Tribune">Kokomo Tribune</a>", which supported White both editorially and financially, were also ridiculed by members of the community and threatened with death for their actions.

White attended Western Middle School for eighth grade for the entire 1986–87 school year, but was deeply unhappy and had few friends. The school required him to eat with disposable utensils, use separate bathrooms, and waived his requirement to enroll in a gym class. Threats continued. When a bullet was fired through the White's living room window (no one was home at the time), the family decided to leave Kokomo. After finishing the school year, his family moved to <a href="Cicero%2C%20Indiana">Cicero, Indiana</a>, where he enrolled at <a href="Hamilton%20Heights%20School%20Corporation">Hamilton Heights High School</a>, in <a href="Arcadia%2C%20Indiana">Arcadia, Indiana</a>. On August 31, 1987, a "very nervous" White was greeted by school principal Tony Cook, school system superintendent Bob G. Carnal, and a handful of students who had been educated about AIDS and were unafraid to shake Ryan's hand.

The publicity of Ryan White's story catapulted him into the national spotlight, amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media. Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled. While isolated in middle school, White appeared frequently on national television and in newspapers to discuss his tribulations with the disease. Eventually, he became known as a <a href="poster%20child">poster child</a> for the AIDS crisis, appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome. White participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS. Many celebrities appeared with him, starting during his trial and continuing for the rest of his life, to help publicly destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS. Singers <a href="John%20Mellencamp">John Mellencamp</a>, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> and <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, actor <a href="Matt%20Frewer">Matt Frewer</a>, diver <a href="Greg%20Louganis">Greg Louganis</a>, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and <a href="First%20Lady">First Lady</a> <a href="Nancy%20Reagan">Nancy Reagan</a>, Surgeon General Dr. <a href="C.%20Everett%20Koop">C. Everett Koop</a>, <a href="Indiana%20University%20Bloomington">Indiana University</a> <a href="Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball">basketball</a> coach <a href="Bobby%20Knight">Bobby Knight</a> and basketball player <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> all befriended White. He also was a friend to many children with AIDS or other potentially debilitating conditions.

For the rest of his life, White appeared frequently on <a href="Phil%20Donahue">Phil Donahue</a>'s talk show. His celebrity crush, <a href="Alyssa%20Milano">Alyssa Milano</a> of the then-popular TV show "<a href="Who%27s%20the%20Boss%3F">Who's the Boss?</a>", met White and gave him a friendship bracelet and a kiss. Elton John loaned Jeanne White $16,500 to put toward a down payment on the Cicero home, and rather than accept repayment, placed the repaid money into a college fund for White's sister. In high school, White drove a red 1988 Ford Mustang GT, a gift from Michael Jackson. Despite the fame and donations, Ryan White stated that he disliked the public spotlight, loathed remarks that seemingly blamed his mother or his upbringing for his illness, and emphasized that he would be willing at any moment to trade his fame for freedom from the disease.

In 1988, Ryan White spoke before the <a href="President%27s%20Commission%20on%20the%20AIDS%20Epidemic">President's Commission on the AIDS Epidemic</a>. Ryan White told the commission of the discrimination he had faced when he first tried to return to school, but how education about the disease had made him welcome in the town of Cicero. Ryan White emphasized his differing experiences in Kokomo and Cicero as an example of the power and importance of AIDS education.

In 1989, <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> aired the television movie "<a href="The%20Ryan%20White%20Story">The Ryan White Story</a>", starring <a href="Lukas%20Haas">Lukas Haas</a> as Ryan, <a href="Judith%20Light">Judith Light</a> as Jeanne and <a href="Nikki%20Cox">Nikki Cox</a> as his sister Andrea. Ryan White had a small cameo appearance as "Chad" in the film, playing a boy also suffering from HIV who befriends Haas. Others in the film included <a href="Sarah%20Jessica%20Parker">Sarah Jessica Parker</a> as a sympathetic nurse, <a href="George%20Dzundza">George Dzundza</a> as his doctor, and <a href="George%20C.%20Scott">George C. Scott</a> as Ryan's attorney, who legally argued against school board authorities. <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen</a> estimated that the movie was seen by 15 million viewers. Some residents of Kokomo felt that the movie was condemning of them for their actions against White. After the film aired, the office of Kokomo mayor Robert F. Sargent was flooded with complaints from across the country, although Robert Sargent had not been elected to the office during the time of the controversy.

By early 1990, White's health was deteriorating rapidly. In his final public appearance, he hosted an after-<a href="Oscars%20party">Oscars party</a> with former president Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan in California. Although his health was declining, Ryan White spoke to the Reagans about his date to the prom and his hopes of attending college.

On March 29, 1990, Ryan White entered <a href="Riley%20Hospital%20for%20Children">Riley Hospital for Children</a> in Indianapolis with a <a href="respiratory%20tract%20infection">respiratory tract infection</a>. As his condition deteriorated, he was sedated and placed on a ventilator. He was visited by Elton John and the hospital was deluged with calls from well-wishers. Ryan White died on April 8, 1990.

Over 1,500 people attended Ryan's funeral on April 11, a <a href="standing-room%20only">standing-room only</a> event held at the Second Presbyterian Church on <a href="Meridian%20Street%20%28Indianapolis%29">Meridian Street</a> in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>. White's pallbearers included Elton John, football star <a href="Howie%20Long">Howie Long</a> and <a href="Phil%20Donahue">Phil Donahue</a>. Elton John performed "<a href="Skyline%20Pigeon">Skyline Pigeon</a>" at the funeral. The funeral was also attended by Michael Jackson and <a href="Barbara%20Bush">Barbara Bush</a>. On the day of the funeral, Ronald Reagan wrote a tribute to Ryan that appeared in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>". Reagan's statement about AIDS and White's funeral were seen as indicators of how greatly Ryan White had helped change perceptions of AIDS.

Ryan White is buried in Cicero, close to the former home of his mother. In the year following his death, his grave was vandalized on four occasions. As time passed, White's grave became a shrine for his admirers.

Ryan White was one of a handful of highly visible people with AIDS in the 1980s and early 1990s who helped change the public perception of the disease. Ryan, along with actor <a href="Rock%20Hudson">Rock Hudson</a>, was one of the earliest public faces of AIDS. Other public figures who were infected with HIV included <a href="Keith%20Haring">Keith Haring</a>, <a href="Holly%20Johnson">Holly Johnson</a>, <a href="Freddie%20Mercury">Freddie Mercury</a>, <a href="Ray%20brothers">Ray brothers</a>, <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a>, <a href="Greg%20Louganis">Greg Louganis</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Ashe">Arthur Ashe</a>, <a href="Liberace">Liberace</a>, <a href="Eazy-E">Eazy-E</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Perkins">Anthony Perkins</a>, <a href="Randy%20Shilts">Randy Shilts</a>, <a href="Ricky%20Wilson%20%28American%20musician%29">Ricky Wilson</a> and <a href="Robert%20Reed">Robert Reed</a>. Ryan White helped to increase public awareness that HIV/AIDS was a significant epidemic.

Numerous charities formed around White's death. The <a href="Indiana%20University%20Dance%20Marathon">Indiana University Dance Marathon</a>, started in 1991, raises money for the Riley Hospital for Children. Between 1991 and 2016, this event helped raise over $28 million for children at Riley. The money raised has also helped found the Ryan White Infectious Disease Clinic at the hospital to take care of the nation's sickest children. Ryan's personal physician, with whom he was close friends, Dr. Martin Kleiman, became the Ryan White Professor of Pediatrics at <a href="Indiana%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine">Indiana University School of Medicine</a> in Indianapolis. In a 1993 interview, prominent gay rights and AIDS activist <a href="Larry%20Kramer">Larry Kramer</a> said, "I think little Ryan White probably did more to change the face of this illness and to move people than anyone. And he continues to be a presence through his mom, Jeanne White. She has an incredibly moving presence as she speaks around the world."

In 1992, White's mother founded the national nonprofit Ryan White Foundation. The foundation worked to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS-related issues, with a focus on hemophiliacs like Ryan White, and on families caring for relatives with the disease. The foundation was active throughout the 1990s, with donations reaching $300,000 a year in 1997. Between 1997 and 2000, however, AIDS donations declined nationwide by 21%, and the Ryan White Foundation saw its donation level drop to $100,000 a year. In 2000, Ryan's mother closed the foundation, and merged its remaining assets with AIDS Action, a larger charity. She became a spokeswoman for AIDS activism and continues to arrange speaking events through the site devoted to her son, <a href="http%3A//ryanwhite.com/">ryanwhite.com</a>. White's high school, Hamilton Heights, has had a student-government sponsored annual AIDS Walk, with proceeds going to a Ryan White Scholarship Fund.

White's death inspired Elton John to create the <a href="Elton%20John%20AIDS%20Foundation">Elton John AIDS Foundation</a>. White also became the inspiration for a handful of popular songs. Elton John donated proceeds from "<a href="The%20Last%20Song%20%28Elton%20John%20song%29">The Last Song</a>," which appears on his album "<a href="The%20One%20%28Elton%20John%20album%29">The One</a>", to a Ryan White fund at Riley Hospital. <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> dedicated the song "<a href="Gone%20Too%20Soon">Gone Too Soon</a>" from his "<a href="Dangerous%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Dangerous</a>" album to White, as did 1980s pop star <a href="Tiffany%20%28American%20singer%29">Tiffany</a> with the song "<a href="Here%20in%20My%20Heart%20%28Tiffany%20song%29">Here in My Heart</a>" on her "<a href="New%20Inside">New Inside</a>" album. In November 2007, <a href="The%20Children%27s%20Museum%20of%20Indianapolis">The Children's Museum of Indianapolis</a> opened an exhibit called "," which remains a sobering, featured exhibit and continues to develop, while it features White's bedroom and belongings alongside similar tributes to <a href="Anne%20Frank">Anne Frank</a> and <a href="Ruby%20Bridges">Ruby Bridges</a>.

In the early 1980s, AIDS was known as <a href="gay-related%20immune%20deficiency">gay-related immune deficiency</a>, because the disease had first been identified among primarily homosexual communities in Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco. At the start of the <a href="HIV/AIDS%20epidemic%20in%20the%20United%20States">HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States</a>, the disease was thought to be a "homosexual problem" and was largely ignored by policy makers. White's diagnosis demonstrated to many that AIDS was not exclusive to homosexual men. In his advocacy for AIDS research, White always rejected any criticism of homosexuality, although not gay himself.

Ryan White was seen by some as an "innocent victim" of the AIDS epidemic. Ryan White and his family strongly rejected the language of "innocent victim" because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were "guilty". Ryan's mother told "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Ryan always said, 'I'm just like everyone else with AIDS, no matter how I got it.' And he would never have lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana. I hear mothers today say they're not gonna work with no gay community on anything. Well, if it comes to your son's life, you better start changing your heart and your attitude around.

In August 1990, four months after Ryan White's death, Congress enacted The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (often known simply as the Ryan White CARE Act), in his honor. The act is the United States' largest federally funded program for people living with HIV/AIDS. The Ryan White CARE Act funds programs to improve availability of care for low-income, uninsured and under-insured victims of AIDS and their families.

Ryan White programs are "payers of last resort," which subsidize treatment when no other resources are available. The act was reauthorized in 1996, 2000, 2006 and 2009 and remains an active piece of legislation today. The program provides some level of care for around 500,000 people a year and, in 2004, provided funds to 2,567 organizations. The Ryan White programs also provide funding and technical assistance to local and state primary medical care providers, support services, healthcare provider and training programs.

The Ryan White CARE Act was set to expire on September 30, 2009, but an extension was signed by President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>.

North Cascades National Park

North Cascades National Park is an American <a href="national%20park">national park</a> in the state of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>. At more than , North Cascades National Park is the largest of the three <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> units that comprise the <a href="North%20Cascades%20National%20Park%20Complex">North Cascades National Park Complex</a>. North Cascades National Park consists of a northern and southern section, bisected by the <a href="Skagit%20River">Skagit River</a> that flows through <a href="Ross%20Lake%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Ross Lake National Recreation Area</a>. <a href="Lake%20Chelan%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Lake Chelan National Recreation Area</a> lies on the southern border of the south unit of the park. In addition to the two <a href="National%20Recreation%20Area">national recreation area</a>s, other protected lands including several <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">national forests</a> and <a href="National%20Wilderness%20Preservation%20System">wilderness areas</a>, as well as <a href="List%20of%20Canadian%20protected%20areas">Canadian provincial parks</a> in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, nearly surround the park. North Cascades National Park features the rugged mountain peaks of the <a href="North%20Cascades">North Cascades Range</a>, the most expansive glacial system in the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>, the headwaters of numerous waterways, and vast forests with the highest degree of flora <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> of any American national park.

The region was first settled by <a href="Paleo-Indian">Paleo-Indian</a> <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a>s; by the time <a href="European%20American">European American</a> explorers arrived it was inhabited by <a href="Skagit%20tribes">Skagit tribes</a>. By the early 19th century, the region was visited by fur trappers and several British and American companies vied for control over the <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">fur trade</a>. After the <a href="international%20boundary%20between%20Canada%20and%20the%20United%20States">international boundary between Canada and the United States</a> was set at the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel</a> in 1846, explorers came to chart potential routes through the mountains for roads and railroads. Limited mining and logging occurred from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. The first significant human impact in the region occurred in the 1920s, when several dams were built in the Skagit River valley to generate hydroelectric power. <a href="Environmentalists">Environmentalists</a> then campaigned to preserve the remaining wilderness, culminating on October 2, 1968, with the designation of North Cascades National Park.

Heavy snows and a high risk of <a href="avalanches">avalanches</a> due to the steep terrain, especially on the western slopes, severely limit visitation in the winter. Most access to the park is from <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%2020">State Route 20</a>, which follows the Skagit River, though even this road is closed for months at a time in the winter. Most of the plant and animal species native to the park region are still found there, though <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> and pollutants from industrialized regions to the west pose risks to the environment. The park has one of the earliest and longest lasting research programs dedicated to studying climate change, primarily through examining the effects of <a href="glacial%20retreat">glacial retreat</a>.

North Cascades National Park is almost entirely protected as <a href="wilderness">wilderness</a>, and so the park has few structures, roads or other improvements. Visitors wishing to drive to a campground must do so in the adjacent national forests or national recreation areas. Camping inside the park requires hiking in by trail, horseback or boat, and camping is regulated by a permit system to ensure the wilderness is not over-exploited. Mountaineering is popular in the park and only unobtrusive <a href="clean%20climbing">clean climbing</a> is allowed.

Human history in North Cascades National Park and the surrounding region begins 8–10,000 years ago, after the end of the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>. <a href="Paleo-Indians">Paleo-Indians</a> slowly advanced from <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> into the interior mountain region as the glacial ice retreated. Archaeological evidence from other sites hundreds of miles away from the park indicate that Hozomeen <a href="chert">chert</a>, a type of rock well-suited to the fabrication of implements, was mined from near <a href="Hozomeen%20Mountain">Hozomeen Mountain</a>, just east of the park border, for the last 8,400 years. Tools such as <a href="Microblade%20technology">microblade</a>s made from Hozomeen chert are part of the archaeological record throughout the <a href="Skagit%20River">Skagit River</a> Valley, west of the park and in regions to the east. Prehistoric micro blades 9,600 years old have been discovered at <a href="Cascade%20Pass">Cascade Pass</a>, a mountain pass that connects the western lowlands to the interior regions of the park and the Stehekin River Valley. The microblades are part of an archaeological assemblage that includes five distinct cultural periods, indicating that people were traveling into the mountains nearly 10,000 years ago. As well as the archaeological excavation at Cascade Pass, there are another 260 prehistoric sites that have been identified in the park.

When white explorers first entered the area in the late 18th century, perhaps a thousand <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> <a href="Skagits">Skagits</a> lived in the park and surrounding areas. Residing mainly to the west of the park near <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a>, the Skagits lived in settlements, culling their needs from the waterways and traveling by canoe. Skagits formed a loose confederation of tribes that united if threatened by outside tribes such as the <a href="Haidas">Haidas</a>, who lived to the north. They erected large houses or lodges that could house multiple families, each with their own partitioned area and entrance. The lodges were in length and in width, and the roofs were <a href="Mono-pitched%20roof">shed-style</a>s, with a single pitch; structures built by other Puget Sound tribes usually had <a href="gable">gable</a> roofs with more than one pitch. The Skagits were generally lowlanders, who only ventured into the North Cascades during the summer months, and structures in the mountains were more modest, consisting mostly of temporary buildings erected with poles and covered with branches. The Skagits erected <a href="totem%20pole">totem pole</a>s and participated in <a href="potlatch">potlatch</a> ceremonies, similar to the Haidas, but with less complexity and extravagance. By 1910, only about 56 Skagits remained in the region, but their numbers have since rebounded to several hundred. 

Inland and residing to the north and east of the Skagits, the <a href="Nlaka%27pamux">Nlaka'pamux</a> (or Thompson Indians after explorer <a href="David%20Thompson%20%28explorer%29">David Thompson</a>), <a href="Chelan%20tribe">Chelan</a>, <a href="Syilx">Okanogan</a> and <a href="Wenatchi">Wenatchi</a> tribes lived partly or year-round in the eastern sections of the North Cascades. The Skagits and Thompsons often had disputes, and raided one another's camps in search of slaves or to exact retribution. Like the coastal-based Skagits, inland tribes also constructed long lodges which were occupied by numerous families, though the style of construction was slightly different as the lodges did not have partitions separating one family from another, and were frame constructed and covered with reed mats rather than from cedar planking. One Wenatchi lodge was described by Thompson as being long. Inland tribes were more likely to travel on foot or horseback than by canoe since the inland regions were less densely forested. Inland tribes also had less bountiful fisheries and greater weather extremes due to being further away from the moderating influence of the Pacific Ocean. Inland tribes rarely erected totem poles or participated in potlatch ceremonies. By the beginning of the 20th century, inland tribes, like their coastal neighbors, had experienced population decline from their first contact with white explorers a hundred years earlier, mostly due to <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and other diseases.

The first white explorer to enter the North Cascades was most likely a Scotsman named <a href="Alexander%20Ross%20%28fur%20trader%29">Alexander Ross</a>, who was in the employ of the American-owned <a href="Pacific%20Fur%20Company">Pacific Fur Company</a>. To the southeast of the modern park boundary, Ross and other members of the company constructed <a href="Fort%20Okanogan">Fort Okanogan</a> in 1811, as a base from which to operate during the early period of the Pacific Northwest fur trade. Fort Okanogan was the first American settlement in present-day Washington State, well north of the route followed by members of the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a> of 1804–1806, and also north of <a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a>, on the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>. Fort Okanogan was later owned by the <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a>, and then the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>, both of which were British-owned.

Both Native American and white trappers conducted fur transactions at the trading post, which was staffed by representatives of the fur trading company. During one season, Ross traded 1,500 beaver pelts. In 1814, Ross became the first known white explorer to explore the valleys and high passes of the North Cascades, but he was less interested in exploration than discovering a route that would easily connect the fur trading posts of interior Washington with Puget Sound to the west. Ross was accompanied by three Indians, one of whom was a guide who led the party to a high pass in the North Cascades. Ross and the guide may have traveled as far west as the Skagit River, but failed to get to Puget Sound. Fur trading slowed considerably as demand for furs decreased in the 1840s, but a few residents continued to augment their income by trapping for furs in the area until 1968, when the park was established, rendering the activity illegal.

Aside from isolated trappers, the North Cascades saw no further explorations until the 1850s. In 1853, US Army Captain <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> led a party that explored the area for potential locations for the construction of a railroad through the region. McClellan determined the mountains were too numerous and precipitous, and that any railway would have to be constructed well to the south.

American and British disputes in the region centered on the fur trade, and the <a href="Treaty%20of%201818">Treaty of 1818</a> allowed for joint administration of <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a>, as it was referred to in the United Statesthe <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> referred to the region as the <a href="Columbia%20District">Columbia District</a>. The treaty set the international border at the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel</a>, but this was disputed west of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, since the rival fur trading outfits had their own ideas about where the border should be. The <a href="Oregon%20boundary%20dispute">Oregon boundary dispute</a> between Britain and the United States eventually led to the <a href="Oregon%20Treaty">Oregon Treaty</a> of 1846, and the 49th parallel forms both the current international border as well as the northern limit of the current park. During the late 1850s, members of the US North West Boundary Commission explored the border region, attempting to identify which mountains, rivers and lakes belonged to which country. One party of the commission was led by explorer Henry Custer, and they explored the northern district of the park, publishing their report in the 1860s. Custer's party crossed Whatcom Pass in 1858, and were the first whites to see <a href="Challenger%20Glacier%20%28Washington%29">Challenger Glacier</a> and Hozomeen Mountain. Impressed with the scenic grandeur of the region, Custer stated, "must be seen, it cannot be described".

In 1882, US Army Lieutenant Henry Hubbard Pierce led a government-sponsored exploration that traversed the western boundary of the southern section of the current park, in search of transportation routes and natural resources. As with the party led by McClellan in the 1850s, Pierce failed to find a suitable route for a railway, and only marginally suitable routes for roads. However, the expedition discovered gold in a <a href="quartz">quartz</a> vein on the slopes of <a href="Eldorado%20Peak">Eldorado Peak</a>. Further expeditions by the military in 1883 and 1887 also determined that the mountains were virtually impenetrable. Explorers continued to seek out routes for wagon roads and railways and by the end of the 19th century, much of the park had been explored, but it was not until 1972 that the <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%2020">North Cascades Highway</a> bisected the mountains.

Mineral prospectors entered the North Cascades region, and by the 1850s were doing <a href="placer%20mining">placer mining</a> along the banks of the Skagit River in search of gold. In the 1870s, placer mining also commenced along <a href="Ruby%20Creek%20%28Washington%29">Ruby Creek</a>, and hundreds of miners came to the region even though it was difficult to access. Most mining activity along Ruby Creek had ended by the 1880s, but was soon replaced by <a href="Underground%20mining%20%28hard%20rock%29">hard rock mining</a> for silver and other minerals. This second period of mining lasted from the 1890s to the 1940s, but was only marginally more lucrative. Miners were hampered by short working seasons, difficult terrain, low quantities of ore and a lack of financial investment. Miners built some of the first trails and roads into portions of the backcountry, some of which involved intricate engineering, including bridges over the numerous streams and dynamiting rock ledges above steep gorges during trail construction. One mining company built a series of <a href="flume">flume</a>s, the longest of which was over , to transport lumber and to supply water for use in their <a href="hydraulic%20mining">hydraulic mining</a> operation.

During the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, larger operations mined silver and lead in addition to gold, mostly with little or no profitability. The demand for metals was not constant, and so prices tended to fluctuate too greatly for mining to be viable. Once the region became a national park, some privately owned mining inholdings remained. One such inholding, the Thunder Creek mine, was still privately owned as of 1997.

Unlike in many other regions of the Pacific Northwest, logging had little impact on the future park. The ruggedness of the terrain and the existence of more economically viable timber resources that were closer to transportation routes largely dissuaded the timber industry from logging in the area. In 1897 the <a href="Washington%20National%20Forest">Washington Forest Reserve</a> was set aside, preserving the forestland that would later become the park. By 1905, the management of the reserve was transferred from the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Department of the Interior</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">Forest Service</a> was subsequently created to administer these forest reserves nationwide, which were redesignated as National Forests. Though the Department of Agriculture allowed commercial enterprises to log the forest with a permit, most of the timber taken from the region was used only locally for the construction of cabins and similar small-scale enterprises. Logging expanded when the <a href="Skagit%20River%20Hydroelectric%20Project">Skagit River Hydroelectric Project</a> was commenced by the public utility, <a href="Seattle%20City%20Light">Seattle City Light</a> in the 1920s. Almost of timber would have been left underwater by the completion of the <a href="Ross%20Dam">Ross Dam</a>. A contract to extract the timber was awarded in 1945 and the project was completed in 1958. None of the dams or areas that were extensively logged are within the current boundaries of the national park, but they are in the adjoining <a href="Ross%20Lake%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Ross Lake National Recreation Area</a>.

The establishment of <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> in 1872, and <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park">Yosemite National Park</a> in 1890, led <a href="Historic%20preservation">preservationists</a> to argue for similar protections for other areas. Even before the North Cascade region was designated as a Forest Reserve in 1897, activists argued the region should be afforded the greater protection accorded from a National Park designation. Washingtonians submitted a petition in 1892 to establish a national park to the north of <a href="Lake%20Chelan">Lake Chelan</a>, as many who had visited the region believed it to have scenery "greater than Switzerland's". Further efforts took place in 1906, and again between 1916 and 1921, when artist Julian Itter and the Mazamas Alpine Club lobbied for a bill to designate "Mount Baker National Park". The proposals failed to gain approval from the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">US Congress</a> and were shelved for decades.

Not all locals supported the idea of a national park, as they felt that such a designation would damage the economics of the region. The Forest Service was also not in favor of park designation, as they would have to relinquish control over the land to the Park Service, which was not uncommon, since many parks being established were originally managed by the Forest Service. In an effort to appease their detractors, the Forest Service designated <a href="Primitive%20Area">Primitive Area</a>s which would provide increased protection to some of the most pristine regions they managed.

By the mid-1930s, forester <a href="Bob%20Marshall%20%28wilderness%20activist%29">Bob Marshall</a> argued that the region should be set aside as wilderness. Rival interests continued to argue over whether the lands should remain under the management of the Forest Service or the National Park Service, but by the 1960s the environmentalist argument advocating for a national park prevailed. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> directed the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior to fund a joint study into a possible national park in the North Cascades region, which was completed in January 1966 and submitted to Congress. The size of the national park was subject to debate locally and in Congress, as well as its effect on the local logging industry. The North Cascades National Park Act designated the region as a National Park on October 2, 1968, and the National Park Service commenced direct management on January 1, 1969. The North Cascades National Park Act also designated Ross Lake and <a href="Lake%20Chelan%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Lake Chelan National Recreation Area</a>s. <a href="Redwood%20National%20and%20State%20Parks">Redwood National Park</a> in California was also signed into existence on the same day as the North Cascades. By 1988, much of Bob Marshall's original plan to set aside the future park as wilderness was achieved when almost all of North Cascades National Park was designated as the <a href="Stephen%20Mather%20Wilderness">Stephen Mather Wilderness</a>.

North Cascades National Park is managed by the National Park Service, and the park headquarters is in <a href="Sedro-Woolley%2C%20Washington">Sedro-Woolley, Washington</a>. The park consists of a northern and a southern district or unit. These are separated by Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The southeast boundary of the southern district abuts Lake Chelan National Recreation Area; the park and two recreation areas are managed as the North Cascades National Park Complex. Most of the park complex was designated as the Stephen Mather Wilderness, preventing further human-induced alterations to 93 percent of the park. The mandate of the National Park Service is to "preserve and protect natural and cultural resources". In keeping with this mandate, hunting is illegal in the park, as is mining, logging, oil and gas extraction, and removal of natural or cultural resources.

In 2016, North Cascades National Park recorded 28,646 visitors, while adjoining Ross Lake National Recreation Area reported 905,418 visitors and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area had 45,514 visitors. Peak visitation is between the months of June and September. The vast majority of visitors come to Ross Lake National Recreation Area which is easily accessible on <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%2020">State Route 20</a>, also known as the North Cascades Highway and the only road which bisects the park complex. North Cascades National Park Complex had an operating base budget of $7,700,000 for fiscal year 2010, augmented by another $3,700,000 of non-base funding (which can fluctuate significantly on an annual basis), and additional funding from revenue generated from concessionaire contracts and user fees. Much of the budget is for staffing, with 83 percent covering the cost of 81 permanent employees, not all of whom are employed year-round, and the nearly 250 seasonal and term employees who work primarily in the summer months. In 2017, the fiscal year budget was approximately 7.5 million dollars, and budgets have been stagnant overall for all National Park Service sites for many years.

Although there are some gravel roads open to the public that enter the park, such as the Cascade River Road beginning at <a href="Marblemount%2C%20Washington">Marblemount</a>, and the Thornton Lakes Road near <a href="Newhalem%2C%20Washington">Newhalem</a>, most automobile traffic travels on State Route 20, which passes through the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The visitor center at Newhalem on the North Cascades Highway is open in the summer. Some of the best views of Mount Shuksan are from the Heather Meadows Visitor Center in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest well outside of the park. All backcountry access requires a permit, and most are obtained at the Wilderness Information Center near Marblemount. Full accessibility for all is not available in the park, but the adjacent National Recreation Areas have a few trails, and all visitor centers, campgrounds and restrooms are fully accessible.

The nearest large town on the west side of the park is <a href="Sedro-Woolley%2C%20Washington">Sedro-Woolley, Washington</a>, while <a href="Winthrop%2C%20Washington">Winthrop</a> lies to the east. <a href="Chelan%2C%20Washington">Chelan</a> is located at the southeastern end of Lake Chelan where east-side access to the park from <a href="Stehekin%2C%20Washington">Stehekin</a> serves the eastern Washington communities. The closest international airport is <a href="Seattle-Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle-Tacoma International Airport</a> (Sea-Tac), which is from North Cascades Visitor Center and from Chelan. In Chelan, the "Lady of the Lake" is a passenger-only ferry that transports visitors to Stehekin, and the trailheads hikers can use to access the southern end of the park.
North Cascades National Park is located in portions of <a href="Whatcom%20County%2C%20Washington">Whatcom</a>, <a href="Skagit%20County%2C%20Washington">Skagit</a>, and <a href="Chelan%20County%2C%20Washington">Chelan</a> counties in the U.S. state of Washington. Bisected by Ross Lake National Recreation Area (NRA), the park consists of two districts; the northern and southern. The northern boundary of the north district is also the international border between the United States and Canada; the latter manages adjoining <a href="Skagit%20Valley%20Provincial%20Park">Skagit Valley Provincial Park</a>. The entire eastern and southern boundary of the north district is bordered by Ross Lake NRA. The western side of the north district is bordered by <a href="Mount%20Baker-Snoqualmie%20National%20Forest">Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest</a>, within which lies the <a href="Mount%20Baker%20Wilderness">Mount Baker</a> and <a href="Noisy-Diobsud%20Wilderness">Noisy-Diobsud Wilderness</a>es, both of which border the park. Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest also borders a portion of the southern district of the park, to the southwest. Along the southwest border is <a href="Wenatchee%20National%20Forest">Wenatchee National Forest</a>, within which lies the <a href="Glacier%20Peak%20Wilderness">Glacier Peak Wilderness</a>. The southern boundary of the park is shared with Lake Chelan NRA, and a small section of the eastern boundary is shared with <a href="Okanogan%20National%20Forest">Okanogan National Forest</a>. The <a href="Lake%20Chelan-Sawtooth%20Wilderness">Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness</a> lies in the Wenatchee and Okanogan National Forests along the southeastern park boundary.

North Cascades National Park has nearly of vertical relief, with the park's highest point atop <a href="Goode%20Mountain">Goode Mountain</a>, and the western valleys situated at only around above mean <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, the park has a highly varied ecosystem, including eight <a href="life%20zone">life zone</a>s. Erosion from water and glacial ice have created some of the steepest mountain ranges in the contiguous US, rising between above their bases. The park is home to over 300 glaciers as well as 300 lakes, and contains the <a href="River%20source">headwaters</a> for some streams that flow into the Skagit River, as well as the <a href="Stehekin%20River">Stehekin</a> and <a href="Nooksack%20River">Nooksack River</a>s. The ruggedness of the terrain was an obstacle to human encroachment and consequently, the park is almost entirely wilderness, though it is only from <a href="Seattle-Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle-Tacoma International Airport</a>.

North Cascades National Park was named after the <a href="North%20Cascades">North Cascades</a> mountains, which are a subsection of the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> that extends from northern California into British Columbia. The North Cascades are the northernmost section of the range and unlike their southern counterparts that consist of <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> to <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> volcanic rocks, the North Cascades are composed primarily of <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> crystalline and <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a>s. Though most rocks in the park are from the more recent Mesozoic, the oldest rocks are 400 million years old, dating from the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a>. A complex assemblage of various rock formations have repeatedly been eroded, reburied, subjected to fracturing and heat, creating a geological puzzle that is one of the most complicated and least understood geological records in North America. These forces are ongoing and the region continues to see uplift and faulting.

Evidence from the fossils and magnetism found in the rocks indicates that the <a href="terrane">terrane</a>s composing the North Cascades drifted thousands of miles north until they impacted the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> 90 million years ago. The collision between the rocks caused fracturing and folding as well as uplift and the terranes were further fractured into north or south trending faults. The uplifted rocks mostly eroded away; 40 million years ago the heavier <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic rocks of the ocean floor started to push the lighter <a href="granite">granitic</a> rocks that are the core of the mountains upward, a process that continues. Subjected to intense heat, rocks deep underground near the collision zone became recrystallized into granitic rocks, which comprise the backbone of the highest peaks. Continued uplift and erosion and finally the action of glacial ice on the landscape during the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> exposed the rocks visible today.

Much harder and more durable than the younger volcanic rocks of the southern Cascades, the North Cascades are consequently more rugged, with steep terrain being the norm due to heavy erosion from water and ice. Continued rising in conjunction with erosion from water and ice has created deep valleys and significant vertical relief that is comparable to much taller mountain ranges.

The tallest mountain in North Cascades National Park is <a href="Goode%20Mountain">Goode Mountain</a> at . It lies in a remote backcountry region of the southern section of the park. Nearby are several other peaks that exceed , including <a href="Buckner%20Mountain">Buckner Mountain</a> () and <a href="Mount%20Logan%20%28Washington%29">Mount Logan</a> (). At about , about northeast of Goode Mountain, is <a href="Black%20Peak%20%28Washington%29">Black Peak</a> (). Other prominent peaks in the southern section of the park include <a href="Boston%20Peak">Boston Peak</a> (), <a href="Eldorado%20Peak">Eldorado Peak</a> () and <a href="Forbidden%20Peak">Forbidden Peak</a> ().

The northern region of the park contains the <a href="Picket%20Range">Picket Range</a>, a subrange of the <a href="Skagit%20Range">Skagit Range</a>, which is in turn a subrange of the North Cascades. The Picket Range has numerous spires with ominous names such as <a href="Mount%20Fury">Mount Fury</a>, <a href="Mount%20Challenger%20%28Washington%29">Mount Challenger</a>, <a href="Poltergeist%20Pinnacle">Poltergeist Pinnacle</a>, <a href="Mount%20Terror%20%28Washington%29">Mount Terror</a>, <a href="Ghost%20Peak">Ghost Peak</a> and <a href="Phantom%20Peak">Phantom Peak</a>, all of which exceed . The Picket Range is only long yet contains 21 peaks over . North of the Picket Range and near the border with Canada lie <a href="Mount%20Redoubt%20%28Washington%29">Mount Redoubt</a> (), <a href="Mount%20Spickard">Mount Spickard</a> () and the spires of the <a href="Mox%20Peaks">Mox Peaks</a> (). Isolated and dominating the northwestern reaches of the park lies the oft photographed <a href="Mount%20Shuksan">Mount Shuksan</a> (), which towers more than above <a href="Baker%20Lake%20%28Washington%29">Baker Lake</a> only to the south.

More than 500 lakes and ponds are located within North Cascades National Park. Many of these are devoid of fish, not uncommon in steep terrain where fish may not be able to access high altitude waterways. Around 240 of these lakes exist in the higher elevations and stocking of some of these lakes with fish has been ongoing since the late 19th century. In 2008 an Environmental Impact Statement was produced that examined whether these lakes should continue to be stocked, and if so, what the impact would be on native species such as salamanders and other aquatic life.

Hundreds of creeks and streams and several rivers originate within the park. The streams at higher elevation are often directly supplied by <a href="meltwater">meltwater</a> from glaciers, and they carry finely ground rock particles commonly referred to as <a href="glacial%20flour">glacial flour</a>. Turning the water a turquoise hue at times, this finely ground powder remains suspended in lakes the creeks flow into, also causing some of them to appear turquoise. <a href="Thunder%20Creek%20%28Washington%29">Thunder Creek</a> is particularly well known for this attribute, as it is supplied melt water from dozens of glaciers and transports the suspended particles into <a href="Diablo%20Lake">Diablo Lake</a>.

The Skagit River divides the park into the north and south districts; it lies outside the park boundaries, but some of the creeks and streams that supply it originate within the park; the <a href="Baker%20River%20%28Washington%29">Baker River</a> is the largest of these tributaries. The Skagit River is the largest river that flows into Puget Sound to the west, and the dams located in Ross Lake National Recreation Area and impounding other lakes adjacent to the park supply nearly 90 percent of the electricity used in Seattle. Other important rivers that originate in the park include the <a href="Vedder%20River">Chilliwack</a>, Nooksack and the Stehekin rivers.

With approximately 312 glaciers, North Cascades National Park has the most glaciers of any US park outside Alaska, and a third of all the glaciers in the lower 48 states. Counting a few glaciers in the adjoining National Recreation Areas, the North Cascades National Park Complex glaciers covered an expanse totaling as of 2009. <a href="Boston%20Glacier">Boston Glacier</a>, on the north slope of Boston Peak, is the largest glacier in the park, measured in 1971 to have an area of . Other glaciers that were measured in 1971 to be larger than 2 square kilometers include <a href="East%20Nooksack%20Glacier">East Nooksack</a> and <a href="Sulphide%20Glacier">Sulphide Glacier</a>s on <a href="Mount%20Shuksan">Mount Shuksan</a>, <a href="McAllister%20Glacier">McAllister</a> and <a href="Inspiration%20Glacier">Inspiration Glacier</a>s on Eldorado Peak, <a href="Redoubt%20Glacier">Redoubt Glacier</a> on <a href="Mount%20Redoubt%20%28Washington%29">Mount Redoubt</a>, <a href="Neve%20Glacier">Neve Glacier</a> on <a href="Snowfield%20Peak">Snowfield Peak</a>, and <a href="Challenger%20Glacier%20%28Washington%29">Challenger Glacier</a> on Mount Challenger.
The dense concentration and relative ease of access to the North Cascade glaciers brought about some of the earliest series of scientific studies regarding glaciology in the United States. Beginning in 1955, the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> sponsored Richard C. Hubley to undertake annual aerial photography expeditions designed to capture images of the glaciers and to show any alterations that might be occurring. In 1960, <a href="Austin%20Post">Austin Post</a> expanded the aerial coverage to include other regions and he also used ground-based imagery to augment the research. In 1971, based on the photographs and other data collected since 1955, Post and others wrote a report that documented the number and scale of glaciers in the North Cascades. At the time of Austin Post's inventory, their study concluded that some North Cascades glaciers had experienced a period of minor growth or equilibrium in the mid-20th century, after undergoing decades of retreat. The study concluded that annual glacial melt due to seasonal variations has a significant influence on river levels, accounting for about 30 percent of the late summer water flow, which directly impacted the supported ecosystems such as salmon fisheries.

The National Park Service, United States Geological Survey (USGS) and <a href="glaciologist">glaciologist</a>s such as <a href="Mauri%20S.%20Pelto">Mauri S. Pelto</a>, who has led the North Cascades Glacier Climate Project since 1984, have continued research on North Cascade glaciers. Since 1993, the National Park Service has conducted rigorous studies on four park glaciers: <a href="Noisy%20Creek%20Glacier">Noisy Creek</a>, <a href="Silver%20Glacier">Silver</a>, <a href="North%20Klawatti%20Glacier">North Klawatti</a> and <a href="Sandalee%20Glacier">Sandalee Glacier</a>s. The National Park Service research indicated that these four glaciers experienced rapid decrease in volumes between 1993 and 2011. In 1998, a National Park Service and <a href="Portland%20State%20University">Portland State University</a> aerial photographic inventory showed a 13 percent loss in park-wide glacial volume since Austin Post's inventory in 1971. The NPS stated that in the last 150 years since the end of the <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a>, a period of several centuries in which the earth experienced a cooling phase, glacial ice volumes in the North Cascades have been reduced by 40 percent. This loss of glacial ice has contributed to decreased melt in the summer. In a paper published in 2016, it was reported that since 1959 the Skagit River watershed has seen a 25 percent reduction in the summertime streamflow.

Eight distinctive life zones support thousands of different plant and animal species in the North Cascades National Park <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. With an elevation gain of nearly , the park has one of the largest ranges of biodiversity found in any US national park.

The flora in North Cascades National Park is influenced by the great vertical relief, the amount of moisture an area receives, the slope and soil types as well as the <a href="fire%20ecology">fire ecology</a>. This wide array of <a href="ecological%20niches">ecological niches</a> has allowed a great biodiversity to evolve. Few other North American national parks have recorded as many <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a> species as have been documented in North Cascades National Park. With 1,630 species documented, experts estimate adding <a href="non-vascular%20plant">non-vascular plant</a>s and <a href="fungus">fungi</a> could more than double the number of known plant species. 

The park contains an estimated of <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a>s. As little of the park was previously logged, significant stands of old growth forest can be found in the valleys and lower slopes up to the timberline at . From the lowest valley floors to about , virgin stands of <a href="Tsuga%20heterophylla">western hemlock</a>, <a href="Thuja%20plicata">red cedar</a> and <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a> are common. These species are heavily dependent on deep soils, and red cedars 1,000 years old and over tall can be found on Big Beaver Creek. These lowest elevation forests can be accessed by trails, such as the Happy Creek Forest Walk off State Route 20, the Shadows of the Sentinels at Baker Lake, Thunder Creek Trail at Diablo Lake and the Horseshoe Bend Trail from <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20542">State Route 542</a>. In openings in the forest canopy, <a href="Alnus%20rubra">red alder</a> and <a href="Acer%20macrophyllum">bigleaf maple</a> can be found but throughout this dense forest, ferns, shrubs and mosses abound.

Between the forest is dominated by the <a href="Abies%20amabilis">pacific silver fir</a> tree near State Route 20 at Rainy Pass. Also at this elevation, the western hemlock is replaced by the <a href="Tsuga%20mertensiana">mountain hemlock</a> as a dominate species. At elevations between in the <a href="subalpine">subalpine</a> zone, the forest gives way to meadows dominated by grasses and flowering plants and shrubs. Above lies the <a href="Alpine%20climate">alpine</a> zone where few plant species survive aside from some sparse grasses, the occasional shrub and lichens. A warming climate has led to an altitude adjustment for many flora species, with the timberline reaching further up the mountain slopes since the 1960s.

The biodiversity of the area is threatened by climate change and invasive <a href="Introduced%20species">exotic plant</a> species. These plants have spread across the park through the inadvertent redistribution from human activities, attaching themselves to cars and hikers. Invasive plants include the <a href="Centaurea%20diffusa">diffuse knapweed</a> and <a href="Phalaris%20arundinacea">reed canary grass</a>. True grass species number nearly 150 in the park; half of those are considered exotic and nonnative to the ecosystem.

<a href="Pinus%20albicaulis">Whitebark pine</a> is native to the park and grows at elevations over in the drier eastern region of the park. Whitebark pine is a stabilizing species for other species of high altitude flora and provides a food source for birds such as the <a href="Clark%27s%20nutcracker">Clark's nutcracker</a> and mammals including <a href="red%20squirrel">red</a> and <a href="Douglas%20squirrel">Douglas squirrel</a>s. Scientists believe that increasing temperatures will have a negative impact on the habitat necessary to support whitebark pine, and therefore impact a wide array of other species. <a href="Cronartium%20ribicola">White pine blister rust</a> and <a href="mountain%20pine%20beetle">mountain pine beetle</a>s have devastated whitebark pine populations in many regions; as of 2018, "28 percent of whitebark pine trees are dead, 30 percent are infected with blister rust, and 1 percent have died from mountain pine beetles."

The park has a diversity of animal species including 75 mammal species. A total of 18 species of <a href="carnivores">carnivores</a> including <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>, <a href="Canada%20lynx">lynx</a>, <a href="North%20American%20cougar">cougar</a>, <a href="American%20mink">mink</a>, <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">river otter</a> and <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bear</a> have been reported in the park. Several species of <a href="deer">deer</a> such as the <a href="elk">elk</a> and <a href="moose">moose</a>, several more species of <a href="Bovidae">bovids</a> including the <a href="mountain%20goat">mountain goat</a> and <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a>, and more than two dozen species of <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s like the <a href="beaver">beaver</a>, <a href="hoary%20marmot">hoary marmot</a> and <a href="American%20pika">pika</a> are also present. Ten species of bats have been documented. The <a href="Northwestern%20wolf">wolf</a> is listed as an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a>, while the <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a> is listed as <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a>. North Cascade National Park has management plans in place to return grizzly bears to the park but not wolves, as the latter is seen as likely to reestablish themselves naturally over time.

The park is a prime habitat for grizzly bear, but the species was extirpated from the region by 1860. Only two grizzly bear sightings occurred in the decade before 2015, and these were outside the park boundary in Canada. In 1991, a decision was reached by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, a US Government land management agency committee, to make efforts to restore self-sustaining populations of grizzlies in the North Cascades region, which included the national park and surrounding national forests. In 1997, the North Cascades region was added to the National Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan; by 2017, the environmental impact statement for grizzly bear restoration was still in the public comment stage. Various action plans had been proposed to reestablish a self-sustaining population of 200 grizzlies in the region.
<a href="Wolverine">Wolverine</a>s are one of the rarest and most elusive mammals in North America. They are seldom sighted in the park, both due to the limited numbers of the species and the habitats they prefer, which are snowy high-altitude regions far removed from human encroachment. Approximately nine wolverines were captured in the national forest east of the park and fitted with transmitters that were tracked by <a href="Argos%20system">Argos satellite</a> telemetry. Four of the wolverines frequented the southern sections of North Cascades National Park, and of those, two spent the majority of their time there; researchers were unable to determine if these study animals had reproduced in the park. A warming climate may impact any wolverine recovery efforts implemented due to the loss of snow cover this species needs to reproduce. Research indicates that wolverines den in deep snow at least deep that lasts well into May, and as climate warms, these regions are becoming less common, especially in the lower 48 states.

More than 200 species of birds that pass through or use the park as a breeding ground have been recorded. These bird species include both <a href="golden%20eagle">golden</a> and <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a> as well as <a href="northern%20spotted%20owl">northern spotted owl</a>, <a href="harlequin%20duck">harlequin duck</a>, <a href="Clark%27s%20nutcracker">Clark's nutcracker</a>, <a href="trumpeter%20swan">trumpeter swan</a> and seasonal appearances of <a href="western%20tanager">western tanager</a>, <a href="Cassin%27s%20vireo">Cassin's vireo</a>, <a href="pine%20grosbeak">pine grosbeak</a>, woodpeckers such as the <a href="pileated%20woodpecker">pileated woodpecker</a> and primarily ground-dwelling birds such as the <a href="sooty%20grouse">sooty grouse</a>. The <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a> is the only species found in the park that is federally designated as an endangered species, while the <a href="marbled%20murrelet">marbled murrelet</a> and northern spotted owl are listed as threatened.

There are at least 28 species of fish documented, including all five species of Pacific salmon: <a href="pink%20salmon">pink</a>, <a href="chinook%20salmon">chinook</a> (king), <a href="sockeye%20salmon">sockeye</a>, <a href="coho%20salmon">coho</a> and <a href="chum%20salmon">chum</a>. Various trout species including <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow</a>, <a href="lake%20trout">lake</a> and <a href="brook%20trout">brook trout</a> can be found as can the <a href="largemouth%20bass">largemouth bass</a> and <a href="longnose%20dace">longnose dace</a>.

Seven species of reptiles and about a dozen species of amphibians have been documented. Reptiles such as the <a href="northern%20alligator%20lizard">northern alligator lizard</a> and the <a href="common%20garter%20snake">common garter snake</a> and amphibians such as the <a href="western%20toad">western toad</a>, <a href="Pacific%20giant%20salamander">Pacific giant salamander</a> and <a href="rough-skinned%20newt">rough-skinned newt</a> reside in the park.

More than 500 species of insects have been recorded, including at least two dozen species of butterflies. Around 250 species of aquatic invertebrates can be found in the parks waterways.

In North Cascades National Park, fire was used by Native Americans in the region near present day Ross Lake to clear out brush, to ease foot travel, and possibly to flush animals out of the foliage. Evidence found in the patterns of tree growth as well as from tree ring analysis indicates human-caused fires were created for many hundreds of years. Similar evidence is found in the Stehekin Valley, where both smaller low intensity fires and larger fires are suggested by the growth patterns and burn scars in tree ring evidence. The low-intensity fires that were likely human induced were only found in the easternmost regions of the park. In the subalpine regions such as the Thunder Creek area, the studies concluded fire occurs at frequencies ranging from 30 years to 400 years.

Across the entire North Cascades National Park Service Complex, between 1973 and 2003, there were 113 human-caused fires that burned , and 264 lightning-caused fires that burned . During this period, the largest fire consumed , mostly in Ross Lake National Recreation Area. North Cascades National Park Complex has three different zones with varying ratings for fire potential and severity. The park is managed as the Skagit Fire Management Unit (FMU) and has a low frequency of large natural fires that occur on average only every 50 to 400 years.

North Cascades National Park has a condition type that shows "...natural (historical) range of variability of vegetation characteristics; fuel composition; fire frequency, severity and pattern; and other associated disturbances." This condition type, in keeping with the wilderness designation applied to most of the park, equates to a natural "let it burn" policy overall, so long as people and historical property are not threatened and the fire was lightning-caused. As part of the management plan, the few historic structures in the FMU are prioritized for fire protection including backcountry shelters like <a href="Beaver%20Pass%20Shelter">Beaver Pass Shelter</a>, and <a href="Fire%20lookout%20tower">fire lookouts</a> such as <a href="Sourdough%20Mountain%20Lookout">Sourdough</a>, <a href="Desolation%20Peak%20%28Washington%29">Desolation</a> and <a href="Copper%20Mountain%20Fire%20Lookout">Copper lookout</a>, all of which are on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

The Cascade Range is tall enough to cause a significant <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> on the eastern slopes. Annually, the western portions of the park receive more precipitation than the eastern sections. The higher precipitation in the west also correlates to increased snowfall with more measured in the west than the east annually. On the western slopes, snowfall depths range from in lower altitudes annually, increasing to at elevations between above sea level. Snow depths peak in early March and range from depending on altitude. 

Snow covers the ground more than six months out of the year, even at lower elevations, and State Route 20, the only highway through the park, is generally closed from late November until late April. Numerous avalanche chutes, as many as traverse any state or federal highway, and including some over long, cross the highway and make snow removal during that period infeasible. Heavy snow and frequent avalanches are common, especially on the western slopes, from autumn to spring. The high elevation trails are generally open by mid-summer and the majority of tourism is between mid-June and late September. The east side of the park is generally warmer and drier, especially in the summer with highs reaching . Since the 1950s, there has been a five-degree Fahrenheit (2.77°C) mean winter minimum temperature increase at elevations above . This has led to a reduced winter snowpack as the mean winter freezing level is now higher.

Overall the relative proximity of the Pacific Ocean moderates temperatures in the park, and it is warmer than other regions at a similar latitude farther inland. Winter generally sees a high of and low of , and the summer high is usually at with a low of . Altitude and location have a direct influence on the overall mean temperatures.

While North Cascades National Park is in a remote region for the most part, the prevailing westerly winds bring various pollutants into the park from the industrialized region around Puget Sound and the <a href="Fraser%20Valley">Fraser River Valley</a> of British Columbia. These pollutants deposit onto plants and glaciers and are then carried by rainfall or ice melt and dispersed into rivers and lakes. The industrialized regions around Puget Sound and the Fraser River Valley have had a more noticeable negative impact on water and air quality than at <a href="Mount%20Rainier%20National%20Park">Mount Rainier National Park</a> well to the south due to the prevailing winds. Lakes at higher elevations show a higher level of acidity due to this phenomenon; the current and long-term impact on the ecosystem of the park has not yet been fully assessed.

<a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">Mercury</a> and toxins from pesticides have been detected in the park, as has <a href="ozone">ozone</a>; these have not been demonstrated to be at sufficient concentrations to greatly impact the ecosystem. Sulfur, <a href="nitrogen%20dioxide">nitrogen dioxide</a> and ozone from factories and automobile emissions as well as increased dust and fine particulates from sources such as farming and construction are dispersed into the atmosphere, reducing long-range visibility. Visibilities of up to have been reduced to less than on the worst days due to the increased haze.

Climate change will impact the temperatures of high altitude lakes and streams, which in turn will have an effect on the fish that can thrive in these waters. Retreating glaciers reduce the amount of glacial ice melt available in warmer months that kept streams and lakes cold, even in late summer.

North Cascades National Park is approximately northeast of <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>. Nearly all of the national park is protected as the <a href="Stephen%20Mather%20Wilderness">Stephen Mather Wilderness</a> and it is "one of the premier "wilderness parks" in the lower-48 states". Unlike some national parks, there is no entrance fee at North Cascades, and hiking trailheads accessed by vehicle do not require a parking pass; trailheads on some national forest properties adjacent to the park may require a pass. Mount Shuksan, in the northwest corner of the park, is often photographed, and at is the second highest peak in the park.

Hikers and <a href="backpacking%20%28wilderness%29">backpackers</a> often visit <a href="Cascade%20Pass">Cascade Pass</a> in the southwestern section of the southern unit of the park, which was used as a travel route by Native Americans. The pass can be reached by a hiking trail accessed from a parking lot at the end of a gravel road that starts at Marblemount. There are nearly of hiking trails in the park. Hikers can also access two <a href="National%20Scenic%20Trails">National Scenic Trails</a> including of the <a href="Pacific%20Crest%20Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a>, located in the southern unit of the park, and of the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest%20Trail">Pacific Northwest Trail</a> that passes through the northern unit. The north and south <a href="Picket%20Range">Picket Range</a>s, <a href="Mount%20Triumph">Mount Triumph</a>, Eldorado Peak and <a href="Boston%20Peak">Boston Peak</a> regions are popular backcountry camping zones.

Unlike most US national parks, there are no places within North Cascades National Park where one can drive to a campground. There are many vehicular access camp grounds in Ross Lake National Recreation Area and in surrounding national forests. All overnight camping is considered backcountry camping and camping areas are protected to prevent overcrowding. Permits can be obtained at the Wilderness Information Center near Marblemount. Since the vast majority of the park is designated wilderness, the goal is to ensure all hikers and backcountry travelers enjoy the opportunities for solitude. Group sizes are limited to parties of less than a dozen on what are known as trail and camping corridors, and in more remote areas off trails, groups larger than six are not permitted. Backcountry camping spots can be reserved in early spring only; all visitors must obtain a permit for the reservation by visiting the Wilderness Information Center.

Bicycles are allowed in the park but only on the same roads that vehicles are allowed on. No mountain bike access is allowed on hiking trails. Hiker/biker camping is available at Newhalem Campground, Colonial Creek and near Stehekin.

High quality climbing routes on the numerous cliffs, ice and other challenges make the park a favorite destination for many mountaineering enthusiasts. While some peaks and cliffs can be accessed fairly easily, the most remote ones entail a multi-day excursion, challenging for even experienced mountaineers. The park has banned the installation of any new fixed anchors such as <a href="piton">piton</a>s, and only removable anchors such as <a href="Nut%20%28climbing%29">chocks</a> and <a href="Spring-loaded%20camming%20device">cams</a> are permitted. This <a href="clean%20climbing">clean climbing</a> has been implemented to help protect the resource, since fixed point anchors deface the rock and are considered intrusive.

With much of the rock climbing and mountaineering done above the tree line, the effort to protect alpine ecosystems is of paramount importance. <a href="Leave%20No%20Trace">Leave No Trace</a> policies are strictly enforced and encouraged, such as camping only on bare rock, using only a camp stove, storing food safely where animals cannot get to it, and carrying out or properly burying human waste as necessary. Mountaineering in the North Cascades was first popularized by <a href="Fred%20Beckey">Fred Beckey</a>; at age 15 he was the first to reach the summit of <a href="Sinister%20Peak">Sinister Peak</a> in 1938, in 1939 he was the first atop <a href="Mount%20Despair%20%28Washington%29">Mount Despair</a>, and the following year he was the first to climb <a href="Forbidden%20Peak">Forbidden Peak</a>. Beckey was the first to summit at least two dozen peaks in the North Cascades, and his exhaustive three-volume <a href="Cascade%20Alpine%20Guide">Cascade Alpine Guide</a> books, first published in the early 1970s, have been called the "Beckey Bible".

Arthur Sullivan

Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Order">MVO</a> (13 May 1842 – 22 November 1900) was an English composer. He is best known for 14 <a href="comic%20opera">operatic</a> <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">collaborations</a> with the dramatist <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>, including "<a href="H.M.S.%20Pinafore">H.M.S. Pinafore</a>", "<a href="The%20Pirates%20of%20Penzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a>" and "<a href="The%20Mikado">The Mikado</a>". His works include 24 operas, 11 major orchestral works, ten choral works and <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s, two ballets, <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> to several plays, and numerous church pieces, songs, and piano and chamber pieces. His hymns and songs include "<a href="Onward%2C%20Christian%20Soldiers">Onward, Christian Soldiers</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lost%20Chord">The Lost Chord</a>".

The son of a military bandmaster, Sullivan composed his first anthem at the age of eight and was later a soloist in the boys' choir of the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a>. In 1856, at 14, he was awarded the first <a href="Mendelssohn%20Scholarship">Mendelssohn Scholarship</a> by the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a>, which allowed him to study at the academy and then at the <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn%20College%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre">Leipzig Conservatoire</a> in Germany. His graduation piece, <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> to <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare's</a> "<a href="The%20Tempest%20%28Sullivan%29">The Tempest</a>" (1861), was received with acclaim on its first performance in London. Among his early major works were a ballet, "<a href="L%27%C3%8Ele%20Enchant%C3%A9e">L'Île Enchantée</a>" (1864), a <a href="Symphony%20in%20E%20%28Sullivan%29">symphony</a>, a <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20%28Sullivan%29">cello concerto</a> (both 1866) and his "<a href="Overture%20di%20Ballo">Overture di Ballo</a>" (1870). To supplement the income from his concert works he wrote hymns, <a href="Parlour%20music">parlour ballads</a> and other light pieces, and worked as a church organist and music teacher.
In 1866 Sullivan composed a one-act <a href="comic%20opera">comic opera</a>, "<a href="Cox%20and%20Box">Cox and Box</a>", which is still widely performed. He wrote his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, "<a href="Thespis%20%28opera%29">Thespis</a>", in 1871. Four years later, the <a href="impresario">impresario</a> <a href="Richard%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a> engaged Gilbert and Sullivan to create a one-act piece, "<a href="Trial%20by%20Jury">Trial by Jury</a>" (1875). Its box-office success led to a series of twelve full-length comic operas by the collaborators. After the extraordinary success of "H.M.S. Pinafore" (1878) and "The Pirates of Penzance" (1879), Carte used his profits from the partnership to build the <a href="Savoy%20Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a> in 1881, and their joint works became known as the <a href="Savoy%20operas">Savoy operas</a>. Among the best known of the later operas are "The Mikado" (1885) and "<a href="The%20Gondoliers">The Gondoliers</a>" (1889). Gilbert broke from Sullivan and Carte in 1890, after a quarrel over expenses at the Savoy. They reunited in the 1890s for two more operas, but these did not achieve the popularity of their earlier works.

Sullivan's infrequent serious pieces during the 1880s included two <a href="cantata">cantata</a>s, "<a href="The%20Martyr%20of%20Antioch">The Martyr of Antioch</a>" (1880) and "<a href="The%20Golden%20Legend%20%28cantata%29">The Golden Legend</a>" (1886), his most popular choral work. He also wrote incidental music for <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> productions of several Shakespeare plays and held conducting and academic appointments. Sullivan's only <a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a>, "<a href="Ivanhoe%20%28opera%29">Ivanhoe</a>", though initially successful in 1891, has rarely been revived. In his last decade Sullivan continued to compose comic operas with various librettists and wrote other major and minor works. He died at the age of 58, regarded as Britain's foremost composer. His comic opera style served as a model for generations of musical theatre composers that followed, and his music is still frequently performed, recorded and <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a>d.

Sullivan was born in <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>, London, the younger of the two children, both boys, of Thomas Sullivan (1805–1866) and his wife, Mary Clementina "née" Coghlan (1811–1882). His father was a military bandmaster, clarinettist and music teacher, born in Ireland and raised in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>, London; his mother was English born, of Irish and Italian descent. Thomas Sullivan was based from 1845 to 1857 at the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>, where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income. Young Arthur became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and composed an <a href="anthem">anthem</a>, "By the Waters of Babylon", when he was eight. He later recalled:
While recognising the boy's obvious talent, his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it. Sullivan studied at a private school in <a href="Bayswater">Bayswater</a>. In 1854 he persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a>. Despite concerns that, at nearly 12 years of age, Sullivan was too old to give much service as a <a href="Boy%20soprano">treble</a> before his voice broke, he was accepted and soon became a soloist. By 1856, he was promoted to "first boy". Even at this age, his health was delicate, and he was easily fatigued.

Sullivan flourished under the training of the Reverend <a href="Thomas%20Helmore">Thomas Helmore</a>, <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Children%20of%20the%20Chapel%20Royal">Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal</a>, and began to write anthems and songs. Helmore encouraged his compositional talent and arranged for one of his pieces, "O Israel", to be published in 1855, his first published work. Helmore enlisted Sullivan's assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of "The Hymnal Noted" and arranged for the boy's compositions to be performed; one anthem was performed at the Chapel Royal in <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a> under the direction of <a href="George%20Thomas%20Smart">Sir George Smart</a>.

In 1856 the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> awarded the first <a href="Mendelssohn%20Scholarship">Mendelssohn Scholarship</a> to the 14-year-old Sullivan, granting him a year's training at the academy. His principal teacher there was <a href="John%20Goss%20%28composer%29">John Goss</a>, whose own teacher, <a href="Thomas%20Attwood%20%28composer%29">Thomas Attwood</a>, had been a pupil of <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>. He studied piano with <a href="William%20Sterndale%20Bennett">William Sterndale Bennett</a> (the future head of the academy) and <a href="Arthur%20O%27Leary%20%28composer%29">Arthur O'Leary</a>. During this first year at the academy Sullivan continued to sing solos with the Chapel Royal, which provided a small amount of spending money.

Sullivan's scholarship was extended to a second year, and in 1858, in what his biographer <a href="Arthur%20Jacobs">Arthur Jacobs</a> calls an "extraordinary gesture of confidence", the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in Germany, at the <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn%20College%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre">Leipzig Conservatoire</a>. There, Sullivan studied composition with <a href="Julius%20Rietz">Julius Rietz</a> and <a href="Carl%20Reinecke">Carl Reinecke</a>, counterpoint with <a href="Moritz%20Hauptmann">Moritz Hauptmann</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Richter">Ernst Richter</a>, and the piano with <a href="Louis%20Plaidy">Louis Plaidy</a> and <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Ignaz Moscheles</a>. He was trained in <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn's</a> ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of styles, including those of <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>, <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>. Visiting a <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>, he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his <a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a>, "<a href="Ivanhoe%20%28opera%29">Ivanhoe</a>". He became friendly with the future impresario <a href="Carl%20Rosa">Carl Rosa</a> and the violinist <a href="Joseph%20Joachim">Joseph Joachim</a>, among others.

The academy renewed Sullivan's scholarship to allow him a second year of study at Leipzig. For his third and last year there, his father scraped together the money for living expenses, and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees. Sullivan's graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> to <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare's</a> "<a href="The%20Tempest%20%28Sullivan%29">The Tempest</a>". Revised and expanded, it was performed at the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace</a> in 1862, a year after his return to London; "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" described it as a sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer.

Sullivan embarked on his composing career with a series of ambitious works, interspersed with hymns, <a href="parlour%20songs">parlour songs</a> and other light pieces in a more commercial vein. His compositions were not enough to support him financially, and from 1861 to 1872 he worked as a church organist, which he enjoyed, and as a music teacher, which he hated and gave up as soon as he could. He took an early opportunity to compose several pieces for royalty in connection with the wedding of the <a href="Edward%20VII">Prince of Wales</a> in 1863.

With "<a href="The%20Masque%20at%20Kenilworth">The Masque at Kenilworth</a>" (<a href="Birmingham%20Triennial%20Music%20Festival">Birmingham Festival</a>, 1864), Sullivan began his association with works for voice and orchestra. While an organist at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House%23The%20third%20theatre">Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden</a>, he composed his first ballet, "<a href="L%27%C3%8Ele%20Enchant%C3%A9e">L'Île Enchantée</a>" (1864). His "<a href="Symphony%20in%20E%20%28Sullivan%29">"Irish" Symphony</a>" and "<a href="Cello%20Concerto%20%28Sullivan%29">Cello Concerto</a>" (both 1866) were his only works in their respective genres. In the same year, his <a href="Overture%20in%20C%2C%20%26quot%3BIn%20Memoriam%26quot%3B">Overture in C ("In Memoriam")</a>, commemorating the recent death of his father, was a commission from the <a href="Norfolk%20and%20Norwich%20Festival">Norwich Festival</a>. It achieved considerable popularity. In June 1867 the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Philharmonic Society</a> gave the first performance of his overture "Marmion". "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reviewer called it "another step in advance on the part of the only composer of any remarkable promise that just at present we can boast." In October Sullivan travelled with <a href="George%20Grove">George Grove</a> to Vienna in search of neglected scores by Schubert. They unearthed manuscript copies of symphonies and vocal music, and were particularly elated by their final discovery, the incidental music to "<a href="Rosamunde">Rosamunde</a>".

Sullivan's first attempt at opera, "<a href="The%20Sapphire%20Necklace">The Sapphire Necklace</a>" (1863–64) to a libretto by <a href="Henry%20Fothergill%20Chorley">Henry F. Chorley</a>, was not produced and is now lost, except for the overture and two songs that were separately published. His first surviving opera, "<a href="Cox%20and%20Box">Cox and Box</a>" (1866), was written for a private performance. It then received charity performances in London and Manchester, and was later produced at the <a href="Gallery%20of%20Illustration">Gallery of Illustration</a>, where it ran for an extraordinary 264 performances. <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>, writing in "<a href="Fun%20%28magazine%29">Fun</a>" magazine, pronounced the score superior to <a href="F.%20C.%20Burnand">F. C. Burnand</a>'s libretto. Sullivan and Burnand were soon commissioned by <a href="Thomas%20German%20Reed">Thomas German Reed</a> for a two-act opera, "<a href="The%20Contrabandista">The Contrabandista</a>" (1867; revised and expanded as "<a href="The%20Chieftain">The Chieftain</a>" in 1894), but it did not do as well. Among Sullivan's early <a href="part%20song">part song</a>s is "<a href="The%20Long%20Day%20Closes%20%28song%29">The Long Day Closes</a>" (1868). Sullivan's last major work of the 1860s was a short <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>, "<a href="The%20Prodigal%20Son%20%28Sullivan%29">The Prodigal Son</a>", first given in <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Worcester Cathedral</a> as part of the 1869 <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a> to much praise.

Sullivan's most enduring orchestral work, the "<a href="Overture%20di%20Ballo">Overture di Ballo</a>", was composed for the Birmingham Festival in 1870. The same year, Sullivan first met the poet and dramatist W. S. Gilbert. In 1871 Sullivan published his only <a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a>, "<a href="The%20Window%20%28song%20cycle%29">The Window</a>", to words by <a href="Alfred%20Tennyson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a>, and he wrote the first of a series of incidental music scores for productions of Shakespeare plays. He also composed a dramatic <a href="cantata">cantata</a>, "<a href="On%20Shore%20and%20Sea">On Shore and Sea</a>", for the opening of the London International Exhibition, and the <a href="hymn">hymn</a> "<a href="Onward%2C%20Christian%20Soldiers">Onward, Christian Soldiers</a>", with words by <a href="Sabine%20Baring-Gould">Sabine Baring-Gould</a>. <a href="The%20Salvation%20Army">The Salvation Army</a> adopted the latter as its favoured <a href="Processional%20hymn">processional</a>, and it became Sullivan's best-known hymn.

At the end of 1871 <a href="John%20Hollingshead">John Hollingshead</a>, proprietor of London's <a href="Gaiety%20Theatre%2C%20London">Gaiety Theatre</a>, commissioned Sullivan to work with Gilbert to create the <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">burlesque</a>-style comic opera "<a href="Thespis%20%28opera%29">Thespis</a>". Played as a Christmas entertainment, it ran through to Easter 1872, a good run for such a piece. Gilbert and Sullivan then went their separate ways until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late 1874 and early 1875.

Sullivan's large-scale works of the early 1870s were the "<a href="Festival%20Te%20Deum">Festival Te Deum</a>" (Crystal Palace, 1872); and the oratorio "<a href="The%20Light%20of%20the%20World%20%28Sullivan%29">The Light of the World</a>" (Birmingham Festival, 1873). He provided incidental music for productions of "<a href="The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>" at the Gaiety in 1874 and "<a href="Henry%20VIII%20%28play%29">Henry VIII</a>" at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, in 1877. He continued to compose hymns throughout the decade. In 1873 Sullivan contributed songs to Burnand's Christmas "drawing room extravaganza", "The Miller and His Man".

In 1875 the manager of the <a href="Royalty%20Theatre">Royalty Theatre</a>, <a href="Richard%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a>, needed a short piece to fill out a bill with Offenbach's "<a href="La%20P%C3%A9richole">La Périchole</a>". Carte had conducted Sullivan's "Cox and Box". Remembering that Gilbert had suggested a libretto to him, Carte engaged Sullivan to set it, and the result was the one-act <a href="comic%20opera">comic opera</a> "<a href="Trial%20by%20Jury">Trial by Jury</a>". "Trial", starring Sullivan's brother <a href="Fred%20Sullivan">Fred</a> as the Learned Judge, became a surprise hit, earning glowing praise from the critics and playing for 300 performances over its first few seasons. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" commented that the piece illustrated the composer's "great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class", and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music. One wrote, "it seems, as in the great <a href="Wagner">Wagner</a>ian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain." A few months later, another Sullivan one-act comic opera opened: "<a href="The%20Zoo">The Zoo</a>", with a libretto by <a href="B.%20C.%20Stephenson">B. C. Stephenson</a>. It was less successful than "Trial", and for the next 15 years Sullivan's sole operatic collaborator was Gilbert; <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">the partners</a> created a further twelve operas together.
Sullivan also turned out more than 80 popular songs and <a href="parlour%20ballads">parlour ballads</a>, most of them written before the end of the 1870s. His first popular song was "Orpheus with his Lute" (1866), and a well-received <a href="part%20song">part song</a> was "Oh! Hush thee, my Babie" (1867). The best known of his songs is "<a href="The%20Lost%20Chord">The Lost Chord</a>" (1877, lyrics by <a href="Adelaide%20Anne%20Procter">Adelaide Anne Procter</a>), written at the bedside of his brother during Fred's last illness. The sheet music for his best-received songs sold in large numbers and was an important part of his income.
In this decade, Sullivan's conducting appointments included the <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> Choral Union concerts (1875–77) and the <a href="Royal%20Aquarium">Royal Aquarium Theatre</a>, London (1876). In addition to his appointment as Professor of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music, of which he was a Fellow, he was appointed as the first Principal of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music%23Background">National Training School for Music</a> in 1876. He accepted the latter post reluctantly, fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing; in this he was correct. He was not effective in the post, and resigned in 1881.

Sullivan's next collaboration with Gilbert, "<a href="The%20Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a>" (1877), ran for 178 performances, a success by the standards of the day, but "<a href="H.M.S.%20Pinafore">H.M.S. Pinafore</a>" (1878), which followed it, turned Gilbert and Sullivan into an international phenomenon. Sullivan composed the bright and cheerful music of "Pinafore" while suffering from excruciating pain from a kidney stone. "Pinafore" ran for 571 performances in London, then the second-longest theatrical run in history, and more than 150 unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in America alone. Among other favourable reviews, "The Times" noted that the opera was an early attempt at the establishment of a "national musical stage" free from risqué French "improprieties" and without the "aid" of Italian and German musical models. "The Times" and several of the other papers agreed that although the piece was entertaining, Sullivan was capable of higher art, and frivolous light opera would hold him back. This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career.

In 1879 Sullivan suggested to a reporter from "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" the secret of his success with Gilbert: "His ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable. His numbers ... always give me musical ideas." "Pinafore" was followed by "<a href="The%20Pirates%20of%20Penzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a>" in 1879, which opened in New York and then ran in London for 363 performances.

In 1880 Sullivan was appointed director of the triennial <a href="Leeds%20Festival%20%28classical%20music%29">Leeds Music Festival</a>. He had earlier been commissioned to write a sacred choral work for the festival and chose, as its subject, <a href="Henry%20Hart%20Milman">Henry Hart Milman</a>'s 1822 dramatic poem based on the life and death of <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20the%20Virgin">St. Margaret of Antioch</a>. Gilbert adapted the libretto for Sullivan. "<a href="The%20Martyr%20of%20Antioch">The Martyr of Antioch</a>" was first performed in October 1880. A grateful Sullivan presented his collaborator with an engraved silver cup inscribed "W.S. Gilbert from his friend Arthur Sullivan." Sullivan was not a showy conductor, and some thought him dull and old-fashioned on the podium, but his composition had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived. Besides his festival and other conducting appointments, Sullivan invariably conducted the opening nights of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

Carte opened the next Gilbert and Sullivan piece, "<a href="Patience%20%28operetta%29">Patience</a>", in April 1881 at London's <a href="Opera%20Comique">Opera Comique</a>, where their past three operas had played. In October, "Patience" transferred to the new, larger, state-of-the-art <a href="Savoy%20Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a>, built with the profits of the previous Gilbert and Sullivan works. The rest of the partnership's collaborations were produced at the Savoy, and are widely known as the "<a href="Savoy%20opera">Savoy opera</a>s". "<a href="Iolanthe">Iolanthe</a>" (1882), the first new opera to open at the Savoy, was Gilbert and Sullivan's fourth hit in a row. Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed the composition of comic operas as unimportant, beneath his skills, and also repetitious. After "Iolanthe", Sullivan had not intended to write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882. Therefore, he concluded that his financial needs obliged him to continue writing Savoy operas. In February 1883, he and Gilbert signed a five-year agreement with Carte, requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.

On 22 May 1883 Sullivan was <a href="Knight%20bachelor">knight</a>ed by <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> for his "services ... rendered to the promotion of the art of music" in Britain. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should end his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or <a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a>. Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan suddenly felt trapped. The next opera, "<a href="Princess%20Ida">Princess Ida</a>" (1884, the duo's only three-act, <a href="blank%20verse">blank verse</a> work), had a shorter run than its four predecessors; Sullivan's score was praised. With box office receipts lagging in March 1884, Carte gave the six months' notice, under the partnership contract, requiring a new opera. Sullivan's close friend, the composer <a href="Frederic%20Clay">Frederic Clay</a>, had recently suffered a career-ending stroke at the age of 45. Sullivan, reflecting on this, on his own long-standing kidney problems, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, replied to Carte, "[I]t is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself."
Gilbert had already started work on a new opera in which the characters fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge. Sullivan wrote on 1 April 1884 that he had "come to the end of my tether" with the operas: "I have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one [syllable] should be lost. ... I should like to set a story of human interest & probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous (not serious) situation, & where, if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character." In a lengthy exchange of correspondence, Sullivan pronounced Gilbert's plot sketch (particularly the "lozenge" element) unacceptably mechanical, and too similar in both its grotesque "elements of topsyturveydom" and in actual plot to their earlier work, especially "The Sorcerer". He repeatedly requested that Gilbert find a new subject. The impasse was finally resolved on 8 May when Gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device. The result was Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful work, "<a href="The%20Mikado">The Mikado</a>" (1885). The piece ran for 672 performances, which was the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre, and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece, up to that time.

In 1886 Sullivan composed his second and last large-scale choral work of the decade. It was a cantata for the Leeds Festival, "<a href="The%20Golden%20Legend%20%28cantata%29">The Golden Legend</a>", based on <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Longfellow</a>'s poem of the same name. Apart from the comic operas, this proved to be Sullivan's best received full-length work. It was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime, and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation, fearing that it would become over-exposed. Only <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>'s "<a href="Messiah%20%28Handel%29">Messiah</a>" was performed more often in Britain in the 1880s and 1890s. It remained in the repertory until about the 1920s, but since then it has seldom been performed; it received its first professional recording in 2001. The musical scholar and conductor <a href="David%20Russell%20Hulme">David Russell Hulme</a> writes that the work influenced <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a> and <a href="William%20Walton">Walton</a>.

"<a href="Ruddigore">Ruddigore</a>" followed "The Mikado" at the Savoy in 1887. It was profitable, but its nine-month run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier Savoy operas. For their next piece, Gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot, which Sullivan again rejected. Gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera, to which Sullivan agreed. Although it was not a grand opera, "<a href="The%20Yeomen%20of%20the%20Guard">The Yeomen of the Guard</a>" (1888) provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date. As early as 1883 Sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera. In 1885 he told an interviewer, "The opera of the future is a compromise [among the French, German and Italian schools] – a sort of eclectic school, a selection of the merits of each one. I myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school. ... Yes, it will be an historical work, and it is the dream of my life." After "The Yeomen of the Guard" opened, Sullivan turned again to Shakespeare, composing incidental music for <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a>'s <a href="Lyceum%20Theatre%2C%20London">Lyceum Theatre</a> production of "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>" (1888).

Sullivan wished to produce further serious works with Gilbert. He had collaborated with no other librettist since 1875. But Gilbert felt that the reaction to "The Yeomen of the Guard" had "not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still". He proposed instead that Sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera, but should continue also to compose comic works for the Savoy. Sullivan was not immediately persuaded. He replied, "I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it." Nevertheless, Sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from <a href="Julian%20Sturgis">Julian Sturgis</a> (who was recommended by Gilbert), and suggested to Gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful <a href="Venice">Venice</a>. The comic opera was completed first: "<a href="The%20Gondoliers">The Gondoliers</a>" (1889) was a piece described by <a href="Gervase%20Hughes">Gervase Hughes</a> as a pinnacle of Sullivan's achievement. It was the last great Gilbert and Sullivan success.

The relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan suffered its most serious breach in April 1890, during the run of "The Gondoliers", when Gilbert objected to Carte's financial accounts for the production, including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the Savoy Theatre lobby. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Carte was building a new theatre to present Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera, and Sullivan sided with Carte, going so far as to sign an affidavit that contained erroneous information about old debts of the partnership. Gilbert took legal action against Carte and Sullivan, vowing to write no more for the Savoy, and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end. Sullivan wrote to Gilbert in September 1890 that he was "physically and mentally ill over this wretched business. I have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled ... in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds".

Sullivan's only grand opera, "<a href="Ivanhoe%20%28opera%29">Ivanhoe</a>", based on <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a>'s <a href="Ivanhoe">novel</a>, opened at Carte's new <a href="Royal%20English%20Opera%20House">Royal English Opera House</a> on 31 January 1891. Sullivan completed the score too late to meet Carte's planned production date, and costs mounted; Sullivan was required to pay Carte a contractual penalty of £3,000 () for his delay. The production lasted for 155 consecutive performances, an unprecedented run for a grand opera, and earned good notices for its music. Afterwards, Carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions and sold the theatre. Despite the initial success of "Ivanhoe", some writers blamed it for the failure of the opera house, and it soon passed into obscurity. <a href="Herman%20Klein">Herman Klein</a> called the episode "the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise!" Later in 1891 Sullivan composed music for <a href="Alfred%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Foresters">The Foresters</a>", which ran well at Daly's Theatre in New York in 1892, but failed in London the following year.
Sullivan returned to comic opera, but because of the fracture with Gilbert, he and Carte sought other collaborators. Sullivan's next piece was "<a href="Haddon%20Hall%20%28opera%29">Haddon Hall</a>" (1892), with a libretto by <a href="Sydney%20Grundy">Sydney Grundy</a> based loosely on the legend of the elopement of <a href="Dorothy%20Vernon">Dorothy Vernon</a> with John Manners. Although still comic, the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with Gilbert. It ran for 204 performances, and was praised by critics. In 1895 Sullivan once more provided incidental music for the Lyceum, this time for <a href="J.%20Comyns%20Carr">J. Comyns Carr</a>'s "".

With the aid of an intermediary, Sullivan's music publisher <a href="Chappell%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Tom Chappell</a>, the three partners were reunited in 1892. Their next opera, "<a href="Utopia%2C%20Limited">Utopia, Limited</a>" (1893), ran for 245 performances, barely covering the expenses of the lavish production, although it was the longest run at the Savoy in the 1890s. Sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady, <a href="Nancy%20McIntosh">Nancy McIntosh</a>, and refused to write another piece featuring her; Gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera. Instead, Sullivan teamed up again with his old partner, F. C. Burnand. "<a href="The%20Chieftain">The Chieftain</a>" (1894), a heavily revised version of their earlier two-act opera, "The Contrabandista", flopped. Gilbert and Sullivan reunited one more time, after McIntosh announced her retirement from the stage, for "<a href="The%20Grand%20Duke">The Grand Duke</a>" (1896). It failed, and Sullivan never worked with Gilbert again, although their operas continued to be revived with success at the Savoy.

In May 1897 Sullivan's full-length ballet, "<a href="Victoria%20and%20Merrie%20England">Victoria and Merrie England</a>", opened at the <a href="Alhambra%20Theatre">Alhambra Theatre</a> to celebrate the Queen's <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee">Diamond Jubilee</a>. The work celebrates English history and culture, with the Victorian period as the grand finale. Its six-month run was considered a great achievement. "<a href="The%20Beauty%20Stone">The Beauty Stone</a>" (1898), with a libretto by <a href="Arthur%20Wing%20Pinero">Arthur Wing Pinero</a> and J. Comyns Carr, was based on mediaeval <a href="morality%20play">morality play</a>s. The collaboration did not go well: Sullivan wrote that Pinero and Comyns Carr were "gifted and brilliant men, with "no" experience in writing for music", and, when he asked for alterations to improve the structure, they refused. The opera, moreover, was too serious for the Savoy audiences' tastes. It was a critical failure and ran for only seven weeks.

In 1899, to benefit "the wives and children of soldiers and sailors" on active service in the <a href="South%20African%20War">Boer War</a>, Sullivan composed the music of a song, "<a href="The%20Absent-Minded%20Beggar">The Absent-Minded Beggar</a>", to a text by <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £300,000 () for the fund from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise. In "<a href="The%20Rose%20of%20Persia">The Rose of Persia</a>" (1899), Sullivan returned to his comic roots, writing to a libretto by <a href="Basil%20Hood">Basil Hood</a> that combined an exotic "<a href="Arabian%20Nights">Arabian Nights</a>" setting with plot elements of "The Mikado". Sullivan's tuneful score was well received, and the opera proved to be his most successful full-length collaboration apart from those with Gilbert. Another opera with Hood, "<a href="The%20Emerald%20Isle">The Emerald Isle</a>", quickly went into preparation, but Sullivan died before it was completed. The score was finished by <a href="Edward%20German">Edward German</a>, and produced in 1901.

Sullivan's health was never robust – from his thirties his kidney disease often obliged him to conduct sitting down. He died of heart failure, following an attack of bronchitis, at his flat in London on 22 November 1900. His "<a href="Te%20Deum%20Laudamus%20%28Sullivan%29">Te Deum Laudamus</a>", written in expectation of victory in the Boer War, was performed posthumously.

A monument in the composer's memory featuring a weeping <a href="Muse">Muse</a> was erected in the <a href="Victoria%20Embankment">Victoria Embankment</a> Gardens in London and is inscribed with Gilbert's words from "The Yeomen of the Guard": "Is life a boon? If so, it must befall that Death, whene'er he call, must call too soon". Sullivan wished to be buried in <a href="Brompton%20Cemetery">Brompton Cemetery</a> with his parents and brother, but by order of the Queen he was buried in <a href="St.%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St. Paul's Cathedral</a>. In addition to his knighthood, honours awarded to Sullivan in his lifetime included Doctor in Music, "honoris causa", by the Universities of <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> (1876) and <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> (1879); Chevalier, <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>, France (1878); <a href="Medjidie">The Order of the Medjidieh</a> conferred by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Sultan of Turkey</a> (1888); and appointment as a <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order</a> (MVO) in 1897.

Sullivan's operas have often been adapted, first in the 19th century as dance pieces and in foreign adaptations of the operas themselves. Since then, his music has been made into ballets ("<a href="Pineapple%20Poll">Pineapple Poll</a>" (1951) and "<a href="Pirates%20of%20Penzance%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Ballet%21">Pirates of Penzance – The Ballet!</a>" (1991)) and musicals ("<a href="The%20Swing%20Mikado">The Swing Mikado</a>" (1938), "<a href="The%20Hot%20Mikado%20%281939%20production%29">The Hot Mikado</a>" (1939) and "<a href="Hot%20Mikado">Hot Mikado</a>" (1986), "<a href="Hollywood%20Pinafore">Hollywood Pinafore</a>" and "<a href="Memphis%20Bound">Memphis Bound</a>" (both 1945), "<a href="The%20Black%20Mikado">The Black Mikado</a>" (1975), etc.). His operas are frequently performed, and also <a href="Parody">parodied</a>, <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a>d, quoted and imitated in <a href="Cultural%20influence%20of%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">comedy routines, advertising, law, film, television, and other popular media</a>. He has been portrayed on screen in "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan</a>" (1953) and "<a href="Topsy-Turvy">Topsy-Turvy</a>" (2000). He is celebrated not only for writing the Savoy operas and his other works, but also for his influence on the development of modern American and British musical theatre.

Sullivan never married, but he had serious love affairs with several women. The first was with Rachel Scott Russell (1845–1882), the daughter of the engineer <a href="John%20Scott%20Russell">John Scott Russell</a>. Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel's parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer of uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868 Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841–1878). Both relationships ended by early 1869.

Sullivan's longest love affair was with the American socialite <a href="Fanny%20Ronalds">Fanny Ronalds</a>, a woman three years his senior, who had two children. He met her in Paris around 1867, and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to London in 1871. According to a contemporary description of Ronalds, "Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown – "châtain foncé" [deep chestnut] – and very abundant ... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth." Sullivan called her "the best amateur singer in London". She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soirées. She became particularly associated with "The Lost Chord", singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan accompanying her. When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests.

Ronalds was separated from her American husband, but they never divorced. Social conventions of the time compelled Sullivan and Ronalds to keep their relationship private. She apparently became pregnant at least twice and procured abortions in 1882 and 1884. Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrels when Ronalds discovered his other liaisons, but he always returned to her. Around 1889 or 1890 the sexual relationship evidently ended – he started to refer to her in his diary as "Auntie" – but she remained a constant companion for the rest of his life.

In 1896 the 54-year-old Sullivan proposed marriage to the 22-year-old Violet Beddington (1874–1962), but she refused him.

Sullivan loved to spend time in France (both in Paris and on the <a href="French%20Riviera">Riviera</a>), where his acquaintances included European royalty and where the casinos enabled him to indulge his passion for gambling. He enjoyed hosting private dinners and entertainments at his home, often featuring famous singers and well-known actors. In 1865 he was initiated into <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> and was Grand Organist of the <a href="United%20Grand%20Lodge%20of%20England">United Grand Lodge of England</a> in 1887 during Queen Victoria's <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%23For%20Queen%20Victoria">Golden Jubilee</a>. Sullivan's talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many not only in the musical establishment, such as Grove, Chorley and Herman Klein, but also in society circles, such as <a href="Alfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh</a>. Sullivan enjoyed playing tennis; according to <a href="George%20Grossmith">George Grossmith</a>, "I have seen some bad lawn-tennis players in my time, but I never saw anyone so bad as Arthur Sullivan".

Sullivan was devoted to his parents, particularly his mother. He corresponded regularly with her when away from London, until her death in 1882. <a href="Henry%20Lytton">Henry Lytton</a> wrote, "I believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between [Sullivan] and his mother, a very witty old lady, and one who took an exceptional pride in her son's accomplishments." Sullivan was also very fond of his brother Fred, whose acting career he assisted whenever possible, and of Fred's children. After Fred died at the age of 39, leaving his pregnant wife, Charlotte, with seven children under the age of 14, Sullivan visited the family often and became guardian to the children.

In 1883 Charlotte and six of her children emigrated to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, California, leaving the oldest boy, <a href="Herbert%20Sullivan">"Bertie"</a>, in Sullivan's sole care. Despite his reservations about the move to America, Sullivan paid all the costs and gave substantial financial support to the family. A year later, Charlotte died, leaving the children to be raised mostly by her brother. From June to August 1885, after "The Mikado" opened, Sullivan visited the family in Los Angeles and took them on a sightseeing trip of the American west. Throughout the rest of his life, and in his will, he contributed financially to Fred's children, continuing to correspond with them and to be concerned with their education, marriages and financial affairs. Bertie remained with his Uncle Arthur for the rest of the composer's life.

Three of Sullivan's cousins, the daughters of his uncle John Thomas Sullivan, performed with the <a href="D%27Oyly%20Carte%20Opera%20Company">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a>: Rose, Jane ("Jennie") and Kate Sullivan, the first two of whom used the stage surname Hervey. Kate was a chorister who defected to the Comedy Opera Company's rival production of "H.M.S. Pinafore", where she had the opportunity to play the leading soprano role, Josephine, in 1879. Jennie was a D'Oyly Carte chorister for fourteen years. Rose took principal roles in many of the <a href="Savoy%20opera%23Companion%20pieces">companion pieces</a> that played with the Savoy operas.

Sullivan's works comprise 24 operas, 11 full orchestral works, ten choral works and oratorios, two ballets, one song cycle, incidental music to several plays, more than 70 hymns and anthems, over 80 songs and parlour ballads, and a body of part songs, carols, and piano and chamber pieces. The operatic output spanned his whole career, as did that of his songs and religious music. The solo piano and chamber pieces are mostly from his early years, and are generally in a Mendelssohnian style. With the exception of his "Imperial March", composed for a royal occasion in 1893, the large-scale orchestral concert works also date from early in the composer's career.

Reviewers and scholars often cite Mendelssohn as the most important influence on Sullivan. The music for "The Tempest" and the "Irish Symphony", among other works, was seen by contemporary writers as strikingly Mendelssohnian. Percy Young writes that Sullivan's early affection for Mendelssohn remained evident throughout his composing career. Hughes remarks that although Sullivan emulated Mendelssohn in certain ways he seldom "lapsed into those harmonic clichés which mar some of Mendelssohn's more sentimental effusions". When "The Tempest" music was first presented the "<a href="Neue%20Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20Musik">Neue Zeitschrift für Musik</a>" identified <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a> as a stronger influence, and Benedict Taylor, writing in 2017, concurs. In a 2009 study Taylor adds Schubert as another major influence on Sullivan in his orchestral works, although "from the beginning ... there is the peculiar, intangible stamp of Sullivan emerging confidently". Meinhard Saremba notes that from Sullivan's first meeting with <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Rossini</a> in Paris, in 1862, Rossini's output became a model for Sullivan's comic opera music, "as evidenced in several rhythmic patterns and constructions of long finales".
As a young man, Sullivan's conservative musical education led him to follow in the conventions of his predecessors. Later he became more adventurous; Richard Silverman, writing in 2009, points to the influence of Liszt in later works – a harmonic ambiguity and <a href="chromaticism">chromaticism</a> – so that by the time of "The Golden Legend" Sullivan had abandoned a <a href="Tonic%20%28music%29">home</a> key altogether for the prelude. Sullivan disliked much of Wagner's <a href="Musikdrama">Musikdrama</a>, but he modelled the overture to "The Yeomen of the Guard" on the prelude of "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger">Die Meistersinger</a>", which he described as "the greatest comic opera ever written". Saremba writes that in works from his middle and later years, Sullivan was inspired by Verdi's example both in details of orchestration, and in "la tinta musical" – the individual musical character of a piece – ranging from the "nautical air of "H.M.S Pinafore"" to "the swift Mediterranean lightness of "The Gondoliers"" and "the bleakness of Torquilstone in "Ivanhoe"".

Sullivan told an interviewer, Arthur Lawrence, "I don't use the piano in composition – that would limit me terribly". Sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration, but "to dig for it. ... I decide on [the rhythm] before I come to the question of melody. ... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not until I have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation." Sullivan's text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was "vastly more sensitive. ... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis", and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve "the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own".

In composing the Savoy operas, Sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first, and these were given to the actors. He, or an assistant, improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals; he wrote the orchestrations later, after he had seen what Gilbert's stage business would be. He left the overtures until last and sometimes delegated their composition, based on his outlines, to his assistants, often adding his suggestions or corrections. Those Sullivan wrote himself include "Thespis", "Iolanthe", "Princess Ida", "The Yeomen of the Guard", "The Gondoliers", "The Grand Duke" and probably "Utopia, Limited". Most of the overtures are structured as a <a href="potpourri%20%28music%29">pot-pourri</a> of tunes from the operas in three sections: fast, slow and fast. Those for "Iolanthe" and "The Yeomen of the Guard" are written in a modified <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a>.

"The Musical Times" noted that Sullivan's tunes, at least in the comic operas, appeal to the professional as much as to the layman: his continental contemporaries such as <a href="Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Saint-Saëns</a> and the Viennese critic <a href="Eduard%20Hanslick">Eduard Hanslick</a> held the Savoy operas in high regard. Hughes writes, "When Sullivan wrote what we call 'a good tune' it was nearly always 'good music' as well. Outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said." Although his melodies sprang from rhythm, some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques.
In the comic operas, where many numbers are in verse-plus-refrain form, Sullivan shaped his melodies to provide a climax for the verse, capped by an overall climax in the refrain. Hughes cites "If you go in" ("Iolanthe") as an example. He adds that Sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence in instrumental works, where he had no librettist to feed his imagination. Even with Gilbert, on those occasions when the librettist wrote in unvaried metre, Sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition, such as in "Love Is a Plaintive Song" ("Patience") and "A Man Who Would Woo a Fair Maid" ("The Yeomen of the Guard").

Sullivan preferred to write in <a href="major%20key">major key</a>s, overwhelmingly in the Savoy operas, and even in his serious works. Examples of his rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the "Irish Symphony", "Go Away, Madam" in the Act I finale of "Iolanthe" (echoing <a href="Verdi">Verdi</a> and <a href="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>) and the execution march in the Act I finale of "The Yeomen of the Guard".

Sullivan was trained in the classical style, and contemporary music did not greatly attract him. Harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of early-nineteenth-century composers including Mendelssohn, <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Auber</a>, <a href="Gaetano%20Donizetti">Donizetti</a>, <a href="Michael%20William%20Balfe">Balfe</a> and Schubert. Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in "Expressive Glances" ("Princess Ida"), where he negotiates smoothly E major, C sharp minor and C major, or "Then One of Us will Be a Queen" ("The Gondoliers"), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.

When reproached for using <a href="consecutive%20fifths">consecutive fifths</a> in "Cox and Box", Sullivan replied "if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, so long as there is no offence to the ear." Both Hughes and Jacobs in "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>" comment adversely on Sullivan's overuse of <a href="Pedal%20point">tonic pedals</a>, usually in the bass, which Hughes attributes to "lack of enterprise or even downright laziness". Another Sullivan trademark criticised by Hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the <a href="augmented%20fourth">augmented fourth</a> at moments of pathos. In his serious works, Sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the Savoy operas, with the result, according to Hughes, that "The Golden Legend" is a "hotch-potch of harmonic styles".
One of Sullivan's best-known devices is what Jacobs terms his "'counterpoint of characters': the presentation by different personages of two seemingly independent tunes which later come together" simultaneously. He was not the first composer to combine themes in this way, but in Jacobs's phrase it became almost "the trademark of Sullivan's operetta style". Sometimes the melodies were for solo voices, as in "I Am So Proud" ("The Mikado"), which combines three melodic lines. Other examples are in choruses, where typically a graceful tune for the women is combined with a robust one for the men. Examples include "When the Foeman Bares his Steel" ("The Pirates of Penzance"), "In a Doleful Train" ("Patience") and "Welcome, Gentry" ("Ruddigore"). In "How Beautifully Blue the Sky" ("The Pirates of Penzance"), one theme is given to the chorus (in 2/4 time) and the other to solo voices (in 3/4).

Sullivan rarely composed <a href="fugue">fugue</a>s. Examples are from the "Epilogue" to "The Golden Legend" and "Victoria and Merrie England". In the Savoy operas, fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in "Trial by Jury" and "Iolanthe" (e.g., the Lord Chancellor's <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a> in the latter). Less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as "Brightly Dawns Our Wedding Day" ("The Mikado") and "When the Buds Are Blossoming" ("Ruddigore").

Hughes concludes his chapter on Sullivan's orchestration: "[I]n this vitally important sector of the composer's art he deserves to rank as a master." Sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments (flute, clarinet, trumpet and trombone) and technically a most skilful orchestrator. Though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra, he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect. Young writes that orchestral players generally like playing Sullivan's music: "Sullivan never asked his players to do what was either uncongenial or impracticable."
Sullivan's orchestra for the Savoy operas was typical of the theatre orchestra of his era: 2 flutes (+ <a href="piccolo">piccolo</a>), oboe, 2 clarinets, <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>, 2 <a href="French%20horn">horns</a>, 2 <a href="cornet">cornet</a>s, 2 trombones, <a href="timpani">timpani</a>, percussion and strings. According to <a href="Geoffrey%20Toye">Geoffrey Toye</a>, the number of players in Sullivan's Savoy Theatre orchestras was a "minimum" of 31. Sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestra's size, and, starting with "The Yeomen of the Guard", the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone. He generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment, noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging, so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music. For his large-scale orchestral pieces, which often employed very large forces, Sullivan added a second oboe part, sometimes <a href="double%20bassoon">double bassoon</a> and <a href="bass%20clarinet">bass clarinet</a>, more horns, trumpets, tuba, and occasionally an organ and/or a harp.

One of the most recognisable features in Sullivan's orchestration is his woodwind scoring. Hughes especially notes Sullivan's clarinet writing, exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument, and his particular fondness for oboe solos. For instance, the "Irish Symphony" contains two long solo oboe passages in succession, and in the Savoy operas there are many shorter examples. In the operas, and also in concert works, another characteristic Sullivan touch is his fondness for <a href="pizzicato">pizzicato</a> passages for the string sections. Hughes instances "Kind Sir, You Cannot Have the Heart" ("The Gondoliers"), "Free From his Fetters Grim" ("The Yeomen of the Guard") and "In Vain to Us You Plead" ("Iolanthe").

Throughout the Savoy operas, and occasionally in other works, Sullivan quotes or imitates well-known themes or parodies the styles of famous composers. On occasion he may have echoed his predecessors unconsciously: Hughes cites a <a href="George%20Frederick%20Handel">Handelian</a> influence in "Hereupon We're Both Agreed" ("The Yeomen of the Guard"), and <a href="Rodney%20Milnes">Rodney Milnes</a> called "Sighing Softly" in "The Pirates of Penzance" "a song plainly inspired by – and indeed worthy of – Sullivan's hero, Schubert". <a href="Edward%20Greenfield">Edward Greenfield</a> found a theme in the slow movement of the "Irish Symphony" "an outrageous crib" from Schubert's <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Schubert%29">"Unfinished" Symphony</a>. In early pieces, Sullivan drew on Mendelssohn's style in his music for "The Tempest", Auber's in his "Henry VIII" music and <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a>'s in "The Light of the World". The influence of Mendelssohn pervades the fairy music in "Iolanthe". "The Golden Legend" shows the influence of <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> and Wagner.

Sullivan adopted traditional musical forms, such as <a href="Madrigal%20%28music%29">madrigals</a> in "The Mikado", "Ruddigore" and "The Yeomen of the Guard" and <a href="glee%20%28music%29">glee</a>s in "H.M.S. Pinafore" and "The Mikado", and the Venetian <a href="barcarolle">barcarolle</a> in "The Gondoliers". He made use of dance styles to enhance the sense of time or place in various scenes: <a href="gavotte">gavotte</a>s in "Ruddigore" and "The Gondoliers"; a country dance in "The Sorcerer"; a nautical hornpipe in "Ruddigore"; and the Spanish <a href="cachucha">cachucha</a> and Italian <a href="saltarello">saltarello</a> and <a href="tarantella">tarantella</a> in "The Gondoliers". Occasionally he drew on influences from further afield. In "The Mikado", he used an old Japanese war song, and his 1882 trip to Egypt inspired musical styles in his later opera "The Rose of Persia".

Elsewhere, Sullivan wrote undisguised parody. Of the sextet "I Hear the Soft Note" in "Patience", he said to the singers, "I think you will like this. It is <a href="Michael%20Arne">Dr. Arne</a> and <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a> at their best." In his comic operas, he followed <a href="Jacques%20Offenbach">Offenbach</a>'s lead in lampooning the idioms of French and Italian opera, such as those of <a href="Gaetano%20Donizetti">Donizetti</a>, <a href="Vincenzo%20Bellini">Bellini</a> and Verdi. Examples of his operatic parody include Mabel's aria "Poor Wand'ring One" in "The Pirates of Penzance", the duet "Who Are You, Sir?" from "Cox and Box", and the whispered plans for elopement in "This Very Night" in "H.M.S. Pinafore", parodying the conspirators' choruses in Verdi's "<a href="Il%20trovatore">Il trovatore</a>" and "<a href="Rigoletto">Rigoletto</a>". The mock-jingoistic "He Is an Englishman" in "H.M.S. Pinafore" and choral passages in "The Zoo" satirise patriotic British tunes such as Arne's "<a href="Rule%2C%20Britannia%21">Rule, Britannia!</a>". The chorus "With Catlike Tread" from "The Pirates" parodies Verdi's "<a href="Anvil%20Chorus">Anvil Chorus</a>" from "Il trovatore".

Hughes calls Bouncer's song in "Cox and Box" "a jolly Handelian parody" and notes a strong Handelian flavour to Arac's song in Act III of "Princess Ida". In "A More Humane Mikado", at the words "Bach interwoven with <a href="Louis%20Spohr">Spohr</a> and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>", the clarinet and bassoon quote the fugue subject of Bach's <a href="Great%20Fantasia%20and%20Fugue%20in%20G%20minor%2C%20BWV%20542">Fantasia and Fugue in G minor</a>. Sullivan sometimes used Wagnerian <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s for both comic and dramatic effect. In "Iolanthe", a distinctive four-note theme is associated with the title character, the Lord Chancellor has a fugal motif, and the Fairy Queen's music parodies that of Wagner heroines such as <a href="Br%C3%BCnnhilde">Brünnhilde</a>. In "The Yeomen of the Guard" the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> is evoked by its own motif. This use of the leitmotif technique is repeated and developed further in "Ivanhoe".

Sullivan's critical reputation has undergone extreme changes since the 1860s when critics, struck by his potential, hailed him as the long-awaited great English composer. His incidental music to "The Tempest" was received with acclaim at the Crystal Palace, just before his 20th birthday, in April 1862. "<a href="The%20Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">The Athenaeum</a>" commented:

His "Irish Symphony" of 1866 won similarly enthusiastic praise, but as Arthur Jacobs notes, "The first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last." A comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that "Sullivan's unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation."

When Sullivan turned to comic opera with Gilbert, the serious critics began to express disapproval. The music critic <a href="Peter%20Gammond">Peter Gammond</a> writes of "misapprehensions and prejudices, delivered to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd. ... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art." As early as 1877 "<a href="London%20Figaro">The London Figaro</a>" commented that Sullivan "wilfully throws his opportunity away. ... He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling." Few critics denied the excellence of Sullivan's theatre scores. "The Theatre" commented, ""Iolanthe" sustains Dr. Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced." Comic opera, no matter how skilfully crafted, was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. "The Athenaeum's" review of "The Martyr of Antioch" declared: "[I]t is an advantage to have the composer of "H.M.S. Pinafore" occupying himself with a worthier form of art."

Sullivan's knighthood in 1883 gave the serious music critics further ammunition. "The Musical Review" of that year observed:
Even Sullivan's friend George Grove wrote: "Surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice, orchestra, and stage effect – master, too, of so much genuine sentiment – may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest." Sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with "The Golden Legend" in 1886. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" hailed it as a "triumph of English art". "<a href="The%20World%20%28journal%29">The World</a>" called it "one of the greatest creations we have had for many years. Original, bold, inspired, grand in conception, in execution, in treatment, it is a composition which will make an 'epoch' and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory. ... The effect of the public performance was unprecedented."

Hopes for a new departure were expressed in "The Daily Telegraph's" review of "The Yeomen of the Guard" (1888), Sullivan's most serious opera to that point: "[T]he music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage." Sullivan's only grand opera, "Ivanhoe" (1891), received generally favourable reviews, although <a href="John%20Alexander%20Fuller%20Maitland">J. A. Fuller Maitland</a>, in "The Times", expressed reservations, writing that the opera's "best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan has given to the world, and have such force and dignity, that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts." Sullivan's 1897 ballet "<a href="Victoria%20and%20Merrie%20England">Victoria and Merrie England</a>" was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics: 
Although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive Sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible, he was, nevertheless, "the nation's "de facto" composer laureate". His obituary in "The Times" called him England's "most conspicuous composer ... the musician who had such power to charm all classes. ... The critic and the student found new beauties at every fresh hearing. What ... set Sullivan in popular esteem far above all the other English composers of his day was the tunefulness of his music, that quality in it by which ... [it] was immediately recognized as a joyous contribution to the gaiety of life. ... Sullivan’s name stood as a synonym for music in England.

In the decade after his death, Sullivan's reputation sank considerably among music critics. In 1901 Fuller Maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of the obituaries: "Is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of Sir Arthur Sullivan, who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius, and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life? ... It is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater, perhaps, than fell to any English musician since ... Purcell – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them." Edward Elgar, to whom Sullivan had been particularly kind, rose to Sullivan's defence, branding Fuller Maitland's obituary "the shady side of musical criticism ... that foul unforgettable episode".
Fuller Maitland's followers, including <a href="Ernest%20Walker%20%28composer%29">Ernest Walker</a>, also dismissed Sullivan as "merely the idle singer of an empty evening". As late as 1966 <a href="Frank%20Howes">Frank Howes</a>, a music critic for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", condemned Sullivan for a "lack of sustained effort ... a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art [and] inability to perceive the smugness, the sentimentality and banality of the Mendelssohnian detritus ... to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms, this yielding to a fatal facility, that excludes Sullivan from the ranks of the good composers." <a href="Thomas%20Dunhill">Thomas Dunhill</a> wrote in 1928 that Sullivan's "music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles. These attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius."

<a href="Henry%20Wood">Sir Henry Wood</a> continued to perform Sullivan's serious music. In 1942 Wood presented a Sullivan centenary concert at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, but it was not until the 1960s that Sullivan's music other than the Savoy operas began to be widely revived. In 1960 Hughes published the first full-length book about Sullivan's music "which, while taking note of his weaknesses (which are many) and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste (which were comparatively rare) [attempted] to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship." The work of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, founded in 1977, and books about Sullivan by musicians such as Young (1971) and Jacobs (1986) contributed to the re-evaluation of Sullivan's serious music. The "Irish Symphony" had its first professional recording in 1968, and many of Sullivan's non-Gilbert works have since been recorded. Scholarly critical editions of an increasing number of Sullivan's works have been published.

In 1957 a review in "The Times" explained Sullivan's contributions to "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas": "Gilbert's lyrics ... take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music. ... [Sullivan, too, is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody". A 2000 article in "The Musical Times" by Nigel Burton noted the resurgence of Sullivan's reputation beyond the comic operas:
On 14 August 1888 <a href="George%20Edward%20Gouraud">George Gouraud</a> introduced <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>'s phonograph to London in a press conference, including the playing of a piano and cornet recording of Sullivan's "The Lost Chord", one of the first recordings of music ever made. At a party on 5 October 1888 given to demonstrate the technology, Sullivan recorded a speech to be sent to Edison, saying, in part: "I am astonished and somewhat terrified at the result of this evening's experiments: astonished at the wonderful power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever. But all the same I think it is the most wonderful thing that I have ever experienced, and I congratulate you with all my heart on this wonderful discovery." These recordings were found in the Edison Library in New Jersey in the 1950s:

The first commercial recordings of Sullivan's music, beginning in 1898, were of individual numbers from the Savoy operas. In 1917 the <a href="Gramophone%20Company">Gramophone Company</a> (HMV) produced the first album of a complete Gilbert and Sullivan opera, "The Mikado", followed by eight more. <a href="Sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction%23Electrical%20recording">Electrical recordings</a> of most of the operas issued by HMV and <a href="Victor%20Talking%20Machine%20Company">Victor</a> followed from the 1920s, supervised by <a href="Rupert%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Rupert D'Oyly Carte</a>. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce recordings until 1979. After the copyrights expired, recordings were made by opera companies such as <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan%20for%20All">Gilbert and Sullivan for All</a> and <a href="Opera%20Australia">Australian Opera</a>, and <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Sir Malcolm Sargent</a> and <a href="Charles%20Mackerras">Sir Charles Mackerras</a> each conducted audio sets of several Savoy operas. Since 1994, the <a href="International%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan%20Festival">International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival</a> has released professional and amateur CDs and videos of its productions and other Sullivan recordings, and <a href="Ohio%20Light%20Opera">Ohio Light Opera</a> has recorded several of the operas in the 21st century.

Sullivan's non-Savoy works were infrequently recorded until the 1960s. A few of his songs were put on disc in the early years of the 20th century, including versions of "The Lost Chord" by <a href="Enrico%20Caruso">Enrico Caruso</a> and <a href="Clara%20Butt">Clara Butt</a>. The first of many recordings of the "Overture di Ballo" was made in 1932, conducted by Sargent. The "Irish Symphony" was first recorded in 1968 under <a href="Charles%20Groves">Sir Charles Groves</a>. Since then, much of Sullivan's serious music and his operas without Gilbert have been recorded, including the "Cello Concerto" by <a href="Julian%20Lloyd%20Webber">Julian Lloyd Webber</a> (1986); and "The Rose of Persia" (1999); "The Golden Legend" (2001); "Ivanhoe", (2009); and "<a href="The%20Masque%20at%20Kenilworth">The Masque at Kenilworth</a>" and "<a href="On%20Shore%20and%20Sea">On Shore and Sea</a>" (2014), conducted by, respectively, Tom Higgins, <a href="Ronald%20Corp">Ronald Corp</a>, <a href="David%20Lloyd-Jones%20%28conductor%29">David Lloyd-Jones</a> and <a href="Richard%20Bonynge">Richard Bonynge</a>. In 2017 <a href="Chandos%20Records">Chandos Records</a> released an album, "Songs", which includes "The Window" and 35 individual Sullivan songs. Mackerras's Sullivan ballet, "<a href="Pineapple%20Poll">Pineapple Poll</a>", has received many recordings since its first performance in 1951.

Jochen Rindt

Karl Jochen Rindt (; 18 April 1942 – 5 September 1970) was a German-born racing driver who <a href="Formula%20One%20drivers%20from%20Austria">represented Austria during his career</a>. In , he was killed during practice for the <a href="1970%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a> and became the only driver to be posthumously awarded the <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">World Drivers' Championship</a>.

Rindt started motor racing in 1961. Switching to <a href="Open-wheel%20car">single-seaters</a> in 1963, he was successful in both <a href="Formula%20Junior">Formula Junior</a> and <a href="Formula%20Two">Formula Two</a>. In , Rindt made his debut in Formula One at the <a href="1964%20Austrian%20Grand%20Prix">Austrian Grand Prix</a>, before securing a full drive with <a href="Cooper%20Car%20Company">Cooper</a> for . After mixed results with the team, he moved to <a href="Brabham">Brabham</a> for and then <a href="Team%20Lotus">Lotus</a> in . It was at Lotus that Rindt found a competitive car, although he was often concerned about the safety of the notoriously unreliable Lotus vehicles. He won his first Formula One race at the <a href="1969%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix">1969 United States Grand Prix</a>. He had a very successful 1970 season, mainly racing the revolutionary <a href="Lotus%2072">Lotus 72</a>, and won five of the first nine races. In practice for the Italian Grand Prix at <a href="Autodromo%20Nazionale%20Monza">Monza</a>, he spun into the guardrails after a failure on his car's brake shaft. Rindt was killed owing to severe throat injuries caused by his seat belt; he was pronounced dead while on the way to hospital. As his closest competitor <a href="Jacky%20Ickx">Jacky Ickx</a> was unable to score sufficient points in the remaining races of the season, Rindt was awarded the World Championship posthumously.

Overall, he competed in 62 Grands Prix, winning six and achieving 13 podium finishes. He was also successful in <a href="sports%20car%20racing">sports car racing</a>, winning the <a href="1965%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">1965 24 Hours of Le Mans</a> paired with <a href="Masten%20Gregory">Masten Gregory</a> in a <a href="Ferrari%20P%23250%20LM">Ferrari 250LM</a>.

Rindt was a popular figure in Austria and his success resulted in increased interest in motorsport and Formula One in particular. He hosted a monthly television show titled "Motorama" and set up a successful exhibition of racing cars in Vienna. During his time in Formula One, he was involved, alongside <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a>, in a campaign to improve safety in Formula One. Rindt left behind his wife, Nina, and a daughter, Natasha.

Jochen Rindt was born on 18 April 1942 in <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a>, Germany, to an Austrian mother and German father. His mother had been a successful tennis player in her youth and, like her father, studied law. Rindt's parents owned a spice mill in Mainz, which he later inherited. They were killed <a href="Bombing%20of%20Hamburg%20in%20World%20War%20II">in a bombing raid in Hamburg</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> when he was one year old, after which he was raised by his grandparents in <a href="Graz">Graz</a>, Austria. Although his grandfather chose to retain Rindt's German citizenship, for his entire career he drove under an Austrian racing licence. In an interview, he described his heritage as a "terrible mixture" and, when asked if he felt more Austrian or German, said that he felt "like a European". Rindt had one half-brother, Uwe, through his mother.

Rindt's childhood friends and his brother described him as a "laddish child" who often performed tricks to amuse others. While on a skiing holiday, he broke his <a href="Femur%20neck">femoral neck</a>, leading to several surgeries that left one leg shorter than the other. As a result of this, Rindt limped slightly for the rest of his life. At the age of sixteen, he received a <a href="moped">moped</a> and started racing his friends on motocross tracks. His time in school was troubled and he was excluded from schools several times. He said:

His chances of obtaining a licence were put into further jeopardy because he had collected eight recorded misdemeanours with the police during his youth. In 1960, he received his first car, an old <a href="Volkswagen%20Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a>. His interest in motorsport greatly increased when he visited the <a href="1961%20German%20Grand%20Prix">1961 German Grand Prix</a> at the <a href="N%C3%BCrburgring">Nürburgring</a> with school friends, including fellow future Formula One driver <a href="Helmut%20Marko">Helmut Marko</a>.

Rindt drove his first race at the "Flugplatzrennen" in 1961, in his grandmother's <a href="Abarth%20Simca%202000">Abarth Simca 2000</a>. After missing the official application period, he only entered after a friendly high-ranking motorsport functionary from Graz intervened on his behalf. During the race, he was <a href="Racing%20flags%23Black%20flag">black flagged</a> for his dangerous driving style and therefore disqualified; he did not immediately return to the pit lane as he was unaware of the regulations. Rindt entered several rallies with his Simca but did not achieve good results. It was only when he was provided with a race-prepared <a href="Alfa%20Romeo%20105/115%20Series%20Coup%C3%A9s%23GT%201300%20Junior%20.281965.E2.80.931977.29">Alfa Romeo GT 1300</a> at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer that he became more successful. In the Alfa Romeo, he achieved eight victories.

In 1963, Rindt switched to <a href="Formula%20Junior">Formula Junior</a> with the assistance of Kurt Bardi-Barry, a wealthy owner of a travel agency and one of Austria's leading drivers at the time; Barry gave him his one-year-old <a href="Cooper%20Car%20Company">Cooper</a> T67 and the two men formed a partnership, driving to races together. Rindt was fastest in practice for his first race in <a href="ACI%20Vallelunga%20Circuit">Vallelunga</a>, a race won by Barry, and took victory in his second at <a href="Cesenatico">Cesenatico</a>. In the race, Rindt had taken advantage of an accident in the early stages. While most drivers slowed for the incoming ambulance, he raced ahead between the straw barriers and the parked medical vehicle to take the lead. At the time, he was notorious for his dangerous style, almost crashing into the spectators at a race in the streets of <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>.

Rindt was highly successful in <a href="Formula%20Two">Formula Two</a> racing, amassing a total of 29 victories. He once again entered the series in partnership with Barry, driving <a href="Brabham">Brabham</a> cars. The engines provided by <a href="Cosworth">Cosworth</a> were slower and inconsistent in performance; Rindt responded to his reduced pace by declaring: "Then I just brake two metres later." He entered his first F2 race in April 1964 at the "Preis von Wien" at <a href="Aspern">Aspern</a>, retiring from both heats. The international motor racing world first took notice of him on 18 May 1964, when Rindt won the "London Trophy" race at the <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20circuit">Crystal Palace circuit</a> in a <a href="Brabham%20BT10">Brabham BT10</a> ahead of <a href="Graham%20Hill">Graham Hill</a>.

Like many other drivers at the time, Rindt continued to race in Formula Two races alongside his duties in Formula One; his last F2 appearance was the "Festspielpreis der Salzburg" in August 1970. In 1967, he dominated Formula Two, winning nine races in his <a href="Brabham%20BT23">Brabham BT23</a>. As an experienced Formula One driver, he was graded "A", meaning his results did not count towards the championship, and the title went to <a href="Jacky%20Ickx">Jacky Ickx</a>. Still, his performances led him to be called "king of Formula 2" by the racing press. He had a long-standing relationship with Roy Winkelmann, and drove with his team until it closed at the end of 1969.

Along with <a href="Open-wheel%20car">single-seater racing</a>, Rindt took up <a href="sports%20car%20racing">sports car racing</a> in the mid-1960s. Rindt started at the <a href="24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> a total of four times. At his debut in <a href="1964%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">1964</a>, sharing a <a href="Ferrari%20P">Ferrari 250LM</a> with <a href="David%20Piper">David Piper</a>, the car retired too early for Rindt even to take the wheel.

Rindt's best result came the following year at the <a href="1965%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">1965 24 Hours of Le Mans</a>. Sharing the drive of a Ferrari 250LM with American <a href="Masten%20Gregory">Masten Gregory</a> for the <a href="North%20American%20Racing%20Team">North American Racing Team</a>, Rindt won the event. Neither driver was happy to race in a seemingly uncompetitive car. A 1998 article in "<a href="Motor%20Sport%20%28magazine%29">Motor Sport</a>" stated that neither appeared to show much interest in the race, but instead it was "more a case of 'hope it breaks soon' so they could draw their money and split". At the start, the drivers had to run to their cars; Rindt entered with a forward roll that allowed him to get his foot on the throttle instantly and take an early lead. The pair experienced considerable trouble in the early part of the race; the car did not restart during Gregory's first pit stop. Later, the engine failed partially and Gregory brought the car into the pits on only six of twelve cylinders. At this point, Rindt had already changed back into his civilian clothes, expecting their race to be over. After thirty minutes of repairs, the car restarted and Rindt and Gregory agreed to drive the rest of the event "flat out", at full speed and with the accompanying risk. Rindt drove most of the night, advancing from 18th to third position by dawn. Gregory persuaded Rindt to let him drive the closing part of the race, suspecting that his young teammate might not drive moderately enough to nurse the car to the finish. Jacky Ickx later recalled that the two had driven "like maniacs". Even so, the car survived, handing the pair what Ickx called an "unexpected victory".

Later that year, Rindt drove, again in a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 kilometre race at <a href="Zeltweg%20Air%20Base">Zeltweg</a>. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of <a href="Mike%20Parkes">Mike Parkes</a> owing to a special lever that manually activated the brake lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.

Apart from his 1965 victory, he never finished the race in Le Mans. In <a href="1966%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">1966</a>, his <a href="Ford%20GT40">Ford GT40</a> (shared with <a href="Innes%20Ireland">Innes Ireland</a>) suffered an engine failure. <a href="1967%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">A year later</a>, he drove a <a href="Porsche%20907">Porsche 907</a> with <a href="Gerhard%20Mitter">Gerhard Mitter</a> until their camshaft failed.

Rindt made his Formula One debut at his home race, the <a href="1964%20Austrian%20Grand%20Prix">1964 Austrian Grand Prix</a>, in a loaned <a href="Brabham%20BT11">Brabham BT11</a> supplied by the <a href="Rob%20Walker%20Racing%20Team">Rob Walker Racing Team</a>. He retired on the 58th lap with a broken steering column in his only Grand Prix of the season.
For the <a href="1965%20Formula%20One%20season">1965 Formula One season</a>, Rindt signed as a permanent driver with Cooper, paired with <a href="Bruce%20McLaren">Bruce McLaren</a>. He was not immediately successful as Cooper, formerly a top team, were struggling at the time. In his first race, the <a href="1965%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">1965 South African Grand Prix</a>, he developed transistor trouble; the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and Rindt had to retire from the race. His best result was a fourth place at the <a href="1965%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> at the Nürburgring. He ended the season with four points, 13th in the championship.
For , Cooper introduced the <a href="Cooper%20T81">T81</a> chassis and used nine-year old <a href="Maserati%20in%20Formula%20One">Maserati</a> <a href="V12%20engine">V12 engine</a>s, which were powerful but heavy. A new engine formula was introduced for the season, with the capacity doubled to three litres. Many teams struggled with the new rules, leaving Cooper competitive even with their old Maserati V12s. After McLaren left, Rindt became team leader until world champion <a href="John%20Surtees">John Surtees</a> joined from <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>. At the second race of the year, the <a href="1966%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a>, Rindt overcame an engine failure in practice to qualify second, next to Surtees on the front row of the grid. In a race affected by heavy rain, he overtook Surtees for the lead on lap four. He spun several times on the wet track and suffered from a <a href="limited-slip%20differential">limited-slip differential</a>, but held onto the lead until lap 21, when Surtees repassed him and won. It was Rindt's first ever podium finish in Formula One, after what "Motor Sport" magazine called a "very courageous" drive. Overall, he achieved three podium positions, handing him third place in the championship at the end of the year.

Prior to , Rindt received offers from every team except <a href="Team%20Lotus">Lotus</a> and <a href="Honda%20in%20Formula%20One">Honda</a>, and moved to Brabham, who had been world champions in the two previous seasons. Technical problems restricted him that year. Brabham's <a href="Repco%23Repco%20V8%20engine">Repco V8 engine</a> was not competitive against the now widely used <a href="Cosworth%20DFV">Cosworth DFV</a> and Rindt finished just two races, both in third place. At the season opener in <a href="1968%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">South Africa</a> on New Year's Day, Rindt placed third, being elevated by a late retirement from <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a> and closing on second-placed Graham Hill towards the end. The race was won by <a href="Jim%20Clark">Jim Clark</a>, a close friend of Rindt's. It was Clark's final Formula One race; he died three months later at a Formula Two race at <a href="Hockenheimring">Hockenheim</a>. Rindt was deeply affected by his death, telling Austrian journalist Heinz Prüller: "If Jim Clark is not safe, what can happen to us?" His second podium finish came in heavy rain and fog at the Nürburgring at the <a href="1968%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a>, a race dominated by Stewart, who finished four minutes ahead of Hill in second place. Rindt had closed on Hill in the latter stages of the race after the Englishman spun, and finished just four seconds behind after a close battle during the last lap. His eight points placed him twelfth in the championship at the end of the season.

During these years, he also raced in the <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a> in both <a href="1967%20Indianapolis%20500">1967</a> and <a href="1968%20Indianapolis%20500">1968</a>, but finished only 24th and 32nd, completing only five laps in 1968 after finishing slightly more than half of the 1967 race. In an interview in 2014, Heinz Prüller recalled Rindt speaking about Indianapolis in 1967: "In Indianapolis, I always feel like I am on my way to my own funeral." At another occasion, he said about the track: "It is catastrophic, I only drive there because of the money."

For the <a href="1969%20Formula%20One%20season">1969 season</a>, Rindt signed for the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where he joined the defending Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: "Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, I know I am in a Lotus." When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and "de facto" manager <a href="Bernie%20Ecclestone">Bernie Ecclestone</a>, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham may have been a better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: "At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die." Because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the <a href="1969%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">1969 Spanish Grand Prix</a>.

Rindt's hesitancy appeared justified when both he and Hill suffered high speed crashes at the Spanish Grand Prix at <a href="Montju%C3%AFc%20circuit">Montjuïc</a>. In both instances, the suspension mounted wings on the cars broke off, causing accidents that could have killed either driver. The effect of the failure lifted Rindt's car off the track and into the barriers, where it collided with the stationary car of Hill, whose accident occurred at the same spot. Although Rindt only suffered a broken nose, one <a href="Motorsport%20marshal">marshal</a> lost an eye and another had his foot broken. Rindt was furious with Lotus's team owner, <a href="Colin%20Chapman">Colin Chapman</a>, over the failure; he told a reporter after the accident: "I place the blame on him [Chapman] and rightfully so, because he should have calculated that the wing would break." In an interview on Austrian television a day later, he said: "These wings are insanity ["ein Wahnsinn"] in my eyes and should not be allowed on racing cars. [...] But to get any wisdom into Colin Chapman's head is impossible." Asked whether he had lost trust in Lotus after the accident, he replied: "I never had any trust in Lotus", going on to describe his relationship with the team as "purely business". His accident left him sidelined for the <a href="1969%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>, a race that Hill won.

Jackie Stewart later described Rindt's 1969 season as the year that he "came of age". At the end of the year, "Motor Sport" magazine called him "[t]he only driver to challenge Stewart seriously throughout the season", albeit placing only fourth in the championship. The poor reliability of the <a href="Lotus%2049">Lotus 49B</a> affected him; he retired from seven races. At the <a href="1969%20British%20Grand%20Prix">British Grand Prix</a>, Rindt fought a close battle with Stewart for the lead; both men were 90 seconds ahead of third-placed Jacky Ickx. The race was decided in Stewart's favour only when Rindt had to enter the pits after part of his car's bodywork started to rub on the tyre; he finished fourth. At the <a href="1969%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a>, he was involved in a memorable finish. Having started from pole position, he traded the lead with Stewart and <a href="Piers%20Courage">Piers Courage</a> several times. During the last lap, Rindt, Stewart, McLaren, and <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Beltoise">Jean-Pierre Beltoise</a> were running close together as they approached the finish line. Stewart took the win, only eight hundredths of a second ahead of Rindt, while fourth placed McLaren was also within two tenths of a second. It was the closest 1–2–3–4 finish in the history of the sport. Rindt recorded his maiden Grand Prix win at the penultimate race of the season <a href="1969%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix">at Watkins Glen</a>, winning $50,000—the largest monetary prize in Formula One history at the time. His victory was overshadowed by a serious accident involving his teammate Hill, who crashed after a high speed puncture and suffered major leg injuries.

For , Rindt's partner at Lotus was <a href="John%20Miles%20%28racing%20driver%29">John Miles</a>; Graham Hill had left the team to drive for Rob Walker's <a href="Privateer%20%28motorsport%29">customer franchise</a>. Rindt became the clear team leader. At the first Grand Prix of the season in <a href="1970%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">South Africa</a>, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with <a href="Chris%20Amon">Chris Amon</a> and <a href="Jack%20Brabham">Jack Brabham</a>, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the <a href="1970%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">Spanish Grand Prix</a>, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the <a href="Lotus%2072">Lotus 72</a> featured two, one on each side of the cockpit. Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight. During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.

As the Lotus 72 was not as effective as the team hoped, it was returned to the factory to be re-built and Rindt used the old Lotus 49 for the next race in <a href="1970%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco</a>. The necessity of using tyres intended for the new design made the older car unstable. Seemingly unaffected by this, Rindt produced what his race engineer <a href="Herbie%20Blash">Herbie Blash</a> called "the race of his life". From eighth on the grid, he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities. In the closing stages, he was second, steadily closing the gap on leader Jack Brabham. On the final lap, on the final corner, Brabham braked too late, touched the kerbstone and went straight ahead into the straw bales, allowing Rindt through to take his first victory of the season. Rindt used the Lotus 49 one last time at the <a href="1970%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a>, a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them. He had originally started practice in the remodelled 72, but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken <a href="Double%20wishbone%20suspension">lower wishbone</a>, forcing Rindt to switch cars once more. Despite engine troubles during the rest of practice, he managed to qualify on the front row, but later retired with another engine failure.
At the <a href="1970%20Dutch%20Grand%20Prix">Dutch Grand Prix</a>, Rindt eventually used the new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole position in the final practice session, almost a quarter of a second ahead of his closest challenger, Stewart. Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, but it was not a joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.

After the success of <a href="Circuit%20Park%20Zandvoort">Zandvoort</a>, Rindt gained confidence in the new Lotus 72, describing it as "the best racing car that exists at the moment". But he continued to have problems. During practice for the <a href="1970%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>, Rindt opted to drop his new all-enveloping Bell-Star crash helmet, finding it too hot. He went back to using his open-front helmet, only to be hit in the face by a stone from another car, causing a deep cut on his right cheek. He also suffered a steering failure on his car. Furious over yet another mechanical problem, he stormed into the Lotus garage and yelled at Colin Chapman: "If this happens again and I survive, I will kill all of you!" Rindt was still able to win the race, taking the lead in the championship. The next race was the <a href="1970%20British%20Grand%20Prix">British Grand Prix</a> at <a href="Brands%20Hatch">Brands Hatch</a>. Jacky Ickx established an early lead ahead of Brabham and Rindt, but when Ickx's transmission failed, Rindt seized the opportunity to pass Brabham for the lead. Brabham was then able to regain the top spot on lap 69 as Rindt missed a gear and looked the certain winner, only to repeat his misfortune of Monaco: on the last lap, he ran out of fuel, allowing Rindt to take his third win in a row. His victory was cast into doubt shortly after the race when Chief Scrutineer Cecil Mitchell found the rear aerofoil not at the regulated height. Rindt was provisionally disqualified, only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation.

The <a href="1970%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> was originally set to take place at its traditional venue, the Nürburgring. The <a href="Grand%20Prix%20Drivers%27%20Association">Grand Prix Drivers' Association</a> (GPDA), represented by Rindt and Graham Hill, demanded changes to the circuit to increase safety, including <a href="AK%20Steel%20Holding">Armco</a> barriers along the entire of the "Nordschleife". No agreement was reached and the Grand Prix moved to Hockenheim, where Rindt took his fourth victory in succession. The race was another two-way fight, this time between Rindt and Ickx, who exchanged the lead several times. This meant that he could have secured the drivers' title at his home event at the <a href="1970%20Austrian%20Grand%20Prix">Austrian Grand Prix</a>. He set the Lotus 72 on pole position, to the delight of the crowd, but retired from the race with an engine failure. The title decision was therefore postponed to the next race in <a href="Autodromo%20Nazionale%20Monza">Monza</a>.

The paddock moved to the <a href="1970%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a> at Monza, a track known for high speeds; drivers often used the <a href="slipstream">slipstream</a> of cars in front to increase their pace. Because of this, many teams, including Lotus, opted to drop the rear wings mounted on the cars to reduce drag and further increase speeds. The more powerful <a href="flat-twelve%20engine">flat-12</a> Ferraris of Jacky Ickx and <a href="Clay%20Regazzoni">Clay Regazzoni</a> had been up to faster than the Lotus at the previous race in Austria. Rindt's teammate John Miles was unhappy with the wingless setup in Friday practice, reporting that the car "wouldn't run straight". Rindt reported no such problems, and Chapman recalled that Rindt reported the car to be "almost 800 rpm faster on the straight" without wings.

On the following day, Rindt ran with higher gear ratios fitted to his car to take advantage of the reduced drag, increasing the car's potential top speed to . On his fifth lap of his practice session, he crashed heavily at the approach to the Parabolica corner. <a href="Denny%20Hulme">Denny Hulme</a>, who was following Rindt at the time, described the accident as follows:
Upon impact, a joint in the crash barrier parted, the suspension of the vehicle went under the barrier, and the car hit a <a href="stanchion">stanchion</a> head-on. The front end was destroyed. Rindt was in the habit of using only four points on the five-point harness then available and did not wear the crotch straps, as he wanted to be able to exit the car quickly in the event of fire. As a result, upon impact he slid under the belts and suffered fatal throat injuries. Later investigations found that the accident was initiated by a failure of the car's right front <a href="Inboard%20brake">brake shaft</a>, but that Rindt's death was caused by poorly installed crash barriers.

Rindt was pronounced dead on the way to hospital and Lotus withdrew all cars from the race, including the Lotus 72 entered by Rob Walker. The Grand Prix went ahead and Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted. There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt's death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed Lotus 72 remained in Italy after the trial, going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a <a href="Lola%20Cars">Lola</a> Formula 3 car. Since then, the car has rested in a garage near <a href="Milan">Milan</a>.
Rindt was buried at the central cemetery (Zentralfriedhof) in Graz on 11 September 1970. At his funeral, <a href="Joakim%20Bonnier">Joakim Bonnier</a> gave the eulogy, saying:
At the time he died Rindt had won five of that year's ten Grands Prix, which meant that he had a substantial lead in the Drivers' Championship. After winning the <a href="1970%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">next race in Canada</a>, Jacky Ickx moved within 17 points of Rindt in the Championship, giving him a chance to win the title if he won the two remaining races. At the <a href="1970%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix">United States Grand Prix</a>, a race won by Rindt's replacement at Lotus, <a href="Emerson%20Fittipaldi">Emerson Fittipaldi</a>, Ickx placed only fourth, making Rindt motor racing's only posthumous world champion. The championship trophy was handed to his widow Nina by Jackie Stewart on 18 November 1970 in a ceremony near the <a href="Place%20de%20la%20Concorde">Place de la Concorde</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>.

Rindt was commemorated in many ways. The early season BARC 200 Formula Two race was renamed the "Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy" for as long as the series existed. In 2000, on the 30th anniversary of his death, the city of Graz unveiled a bronze plaque in remembrance of Rindt, with wife Nina and daughter Natasha present. The penultimate corner at the <a href="Red%20Bull%20Ring">Red Bull Ring</a> in Austria is named after Rindt.

In March 1967, Rindt married Nina Lincoln, a Finnish model and daughter of racing driver <a href="Curt%20Lincoln">Curt Lincoln</a>, whom he had raced in the early part of his career. After becoming engaged, Lincoln had originally broken up with Rindt and sent the engagement ring back. Rindt then put it back into the box with a note telling her to keep it until she changed her mind, which she did upon receiving the package, later explaining: "I like men who know what they want." The couple moved to Switzerland, near <a href="Begnins">Begnins</a>, where they built a house together. The Rindts had one daughter, Natasha, who was two years old at the time of her father's death. Nina Rindt married twice more after Rindt's death, first Philip Martyn, with whom she had another daughter, and then <a href="Alexander%20Hood%2C%204th%20Viscount%20Bridport">Alexander Hood, 4th Viscount Bridport</a>, making her Nina Hood, Lady Bridport. The couple had a son, Anthony. Their daughter Natasha later worked with Bernie Ecclestone for several years after he had taken over the commercial rights of Formula One.

Rindt had met Bernie Ecclestone during his time at Cooper and the two became friends. Noticing his commercial talent, Rindt allowed Ecclestone to manage his professional contracts, without ever officially employing him as a manager. Ecclestone said of the relationship: "I was never his manager, we were good friends. I helped him with any help he ever needed." After Rindt's accident, it was Ecclestone who carried his bloody helmet back to the pit lane.

In Formula One, Rindt had several friendly relationships with other drivers, most notably Jackie Stewart. They met at a Formula Two event in 1964 and soon became friends, often going on holiday together and living near each other in Switzerland. Until his death, they were sometimes accompanied by Jim Clark. Rindt became involved in Stewart's fight for increased safety in Formula One, being one of the leading figures of the GPDA. For his role in the safety campaign, Rindt was criticised by fellow drivers and the press alike; reporters derogatively called Stewart, Rindt and Joakim Bonnier the "Geneva connection", due to their residence in Switzerland. Stewart said that it took Rindt some time to understand the graveness of the situation but after that, he was a "good ally". After Rindt's death, his wife Nina stayed close with the Stewarts and can be seen visiting them at the <a href="1971%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">1971 Monaco Grand Prix</a> in the <a href="Roman%20Polanski">Roman Polanski</a>-produced film "<a href="Weekend%20of%20a%20Champion">Weekend of a Champion</a>".

Privately, Rindt was known to family and friends as an often reckless driver when on public roads. During the early years of his career, he took his <a href="Jaguar%20E-Type">Jaguar E-Type</a> out in the streets of Vienna, where he lived, and <a href="Drifting%20%28motorsport%29">drifted</a> through the streets. He sparked public criticism in 1968 when he flipped over a during a demonstration run at an <a href="autocross">autocross</a> event in <a href="Gro%C3%9Fh%C3%B6flein">Großhöflein</a>, while his pregnant wife was on board.

Rindt's success popularised motorsport in Austria. Helmut Zwickl called him "the driving instructor of the nation". In 1965, Rindt put together the first exhibition of racing cars in Austria, the "Jochen-Rindt-Show" in Vienna. It was an immediate success, with 30,000 visitors on the first weekend alone. Using his connections, he brought in his friend Joakim Bonnier and former <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20in%20Formula%20One">Mercedes</a> Grand Prix manager <a href="Alfred%20Neubauer">Alfred Neubauer</a> as opening speakers, with other drivers such as Jackie Stewart attending. The show soon became an annual event and later moved to the German city of <a href="Essen">Essen</a> in 1970, shortly after Rindt's death, and remains there as the <a href="Essen%20Motor%20Show">Essen Motor Show</a>. Rindt, with the help of Ecclestone, was able to successfully promote himself, including lucrative sponsorship and advertising contracts. Following his ascent in racing, two race tracks were built in Austria, the Österreichring (now Red Bull Ring), for which Rindt worked as a consultant, and the <a href="Salzburgring">Salzburgring</a>. Rindt's popularity was further increased through the TV show "Motorama", which he hosted. The monthly programme included tips for driving on public roads, reports from Grands Prix and interviews of fellow drivers by Rindt.

Grand Teton National Park

Grand Teton National Park is an American <a href="national%20park">national park</a> in northwestern <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. At approximately , the park includes the major peaks of the <a href="Teton%20Range">Teton Range</a> as well as most of the northern sections of the valley known as <a href="Jackson%20Hole">Jackson Hole</a>. Grand Teton National Park is only south of <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, to which it is connected by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>-managed <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller%2C%20Jr.%20Memorial%20Parkway">John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway</a>. Along with surrounding <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">national forests</a>, these three protected areas constitute the almost <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a>, one of the world's largest intact mid-latitude temperate ecosystems.

Human history of the Grand Teton region dates back at least 11,000 years, when the first nomadic <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> <a href="Paleo-Indians">Paleo-Indian</a>s began migrating into the region during warmer months pursuing food and supplies. In the early 19th century, the first <a href="White%20American">white</a> explorers encountered the eastern <a href="Shoshone%20people">Shoshone</a> <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">natives</a>. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted fur trading companies that vied for control of the lucrative beaver pelt trade. U.S. Government expeditions to the region commenced in the mid-19th century as an offshoot of exploration in Yellowstone, with the first permanent white settlers in Jackson Hole arriving in the 1880s.

Efforts to preserve the region as a national park began in the late 19th century, and in 1929 Grand Teton National Park was established, protecting the Teton Range's major peaks. The valley of Jackson Hole remained in private ownership until the 1930s, when conservationists led by <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller%2C%20Jr.">John D. Rockefeller, Jr.</a> began purchasing land in Jackson Hole to be added to the existing national park. Against public opinion and with repeated <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congressional</a> efforts to repeal the measures, much of Jackson Hole was set aside for protection as <a href="Jackson%20Hole%20National%20Monument">Jackson Hole National Monument</a> in 1943. The monument was abolished in 1950 and most of the monument land was added to Grand Teton National Park.

Grand Teton National Park is named for <a href="Grand%20Teton">Grand Teton</a>, the tallest mountain in the Teton Range. The <a href="Grand%20Teton%23Name">naming of the mountains</a> is attributed to early 19th-century <a href="French%20language">French</a>-speaking trappers—"les trois tétons" (the three teats) was later anglicized and shortened to "Tetons". At , Grand Teton abruptly rises more than above Jackson Hole, almost higher than <a href="Mount%20Owen%20%28Wyoming%29">Mount Owen</a>, the second-highest summit in the range. The park has numerous lakes, including <a href="Jackson%20Lake">Jackson Lake</a> as well as streams of varying length and the upper <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a> of the <a href="Snake%20River">Snake River</a>. Though in a state of recession, a dozen small glaciers persist at the higher elevations near the highest peaks in the range. Some of the rocks in the park are the oldest found in any American national park and have been dated at nearly 2.7 billion years.

Grand Teton National Park is an almost pristine ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1,000 species of <a href="vascular%20plants">vascular plants</a>, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, more than a dozen fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians inhabit the park. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened <a href="whitebark%20pine">whitebark pine</a>.

Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking, fishing and other forms of recreation. There are more than 1,000 drive-in campsites and over of hiking trails that provide access to <a href="backcountry">backcountry</a> camping areas. Noted for world-renowned trout fishing, the park is one of the few places to catch <a href="Snake%20River%20fine-spotted%20cutthroat%20trout">Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout</a>. Grand Teton has several National Park Service-run visitor centers, and privately operated <a href="concession%20%28contract%29">concessions</a> for motels, lodges, gas stations and marinas.

Paleo-Indian presence in what is now Grand Teton National Park dates back more than 11,000 years. Jackson Hole valley climate at that time was colder and more alpine than the <a href="semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid climate</a> found today, and the first humans were migratory hunter-gatherers spending summer months in Jackson Hole and wintering in the valleys west of the Teton Range. Along the shores of <a href="Jackson%20Lake">Jackson Lake</a>, fire pits, tools and what are thought to have been fishing weights have been discovered. One of the tools found is of a type associated with the <a href="Clovis%20culture">Clovis culture</a>, and tools from this cultural period date back at least 11,500 years. Some of the tools are made of <a href="obsidian">obsidian</a> which chemical analysis indicates came from sources near present-day <a href="Teton%20Pass">Teton Pass</a>, south of Grand Teton National Park. Though obsidian was also available north of Jackson Hole, virtually all the obsidian spear points found are from a source to the south, indicating that the main seasonal migratory route for the Paleo-Indian was from this direction. <a href="Elk">Elk</a>, which winter on the <a href="National%20Elk%20Refuge">National Elk Refuge</a> at the southern end of Jackson Hole and northwest into higher altitudes during spring and summer, follow a similar migratory pattern to this day. From 11,000 to about 500 years ago, there is little evidence of change in the migratory patterns amongst the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> groups in the region and no evidence that indicates any permanent human settlement.

When white American explorers first entered the region in the first decade of the 19th century, they encountered the eastern tribes of the Shoshone people. Most of the Shoshone that lived in the mountain vastness of the greater Yellowstone region continued to be pedestrian while other groups of Shoshone that resided in lower elevations had limited use of horses. The mountain-dwelling Shoshone were known as "<a href="Sheep-eaters">Sheep-eaters</a>" or ""<a href="Tukudika">Tukudika</a>"" as they referred to themselves, since a staple of their diet was the <a href="Bighorn%20Sheep">Bighorn Sheep</a>. The Shoshones continued to follow the same migratory pattern as their predecessors and have been documented as having a close spiritual relationship with the Teton Range. A number of stone enclosures on some of the peaks, including on the upper slopes of Grand Teton (known simply as "The Enclosure") are thought to have been used by Shoshone during <a href="vision%20quest">vision quest</a>s. The Teton and Yellowstone region Shoshone relocated to the <a href="Wind%20River%20Indian%20Reservation">Wind River Indian Reservation</a> after it was established in 1868. The reservation is situated southeast of Jackson Hole on land that was selected by <a href="Washakie">Chief Washakie</a>.

The <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a> (1804–1806) passed well north of the Grand Teton region. During their return trip from the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, expedition member <a href="John%20Colter">John Colter</a> was given an early discharge so he could join two <a href="fur">fur</a> trappers who were heading west in search of beaver pelts. Colter was later hired by <a href="Manuel%20Lisa">Manuel Lisa</a> to lead fur trappers and to explore the region around the <a href="Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone River</a>. During the winter of 1807/08 Colter passed through Jackson Hole and was the first Caucasian to see the Teton Range. Lewis and Clark expedition co-leader <a href="William%20Clark%20%28explorer%29">William Clark</a> produced a map based on the previous expedition and included the explorations of John Colter in 1807, apparently based on discussions between Clark and Colter when the two met in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a> in 1810. Another map attributed to William Clark indicates John Colter entered Jackson Hole from the northeast, crossing the <a href="Continental%20Divide%20of%20the%20Americas">Continental Divide</a> at either <a href="Togwotee%20Pass">Togwotee Pass</a> or <a href="Union%20Pass">Union Pass</a> and left the region after crossing Teton Pass, following the well established Native American trails. In 1931, the <a href="Colter%20Stone">Colter Stone</a>, a rock carved in the shape of a head with the inscription "John Colter" on one side and the year "1808" on the other, was discovered in a field in <a href="Tetonia%2C%20Idaho">Tetonia, Idaho</a>, which is west of Teton Pass. The Colter Stone has not been authenticated to have been created by John Colter and may have been the work of later expeditions to the region.
John Colter is widely considered the first <a href="mountain%20man">mountain man</a> and, like those that came to the Jackson Hole region over the next 30 years, he was there primarily for the profitable fur trapping; the region was rich with the highly sought after pelts of <a href="beaver">beaver</a> and other fur bearing animals. Between 1810 and 1812, the <a href="Astorians">Astorians</a> traveled through Jackson Hole and crossed Teton Pass as they headed east in 1812. After 1810, American and British fur trading companies were in competition for control of the <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">North American fur trade</a>, and American sovereignty over the region was not secured until the signing of the <a href="Oregon%20Treaty">Oregon Treaty</a> in 1846. One party employed by the British <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a> and led by explorer <a href="Donald%20Mackenzie%20%28explorer%29">Donald Mackenzie</a> entered Jackson Hole from the west in 1818 or 1819. The Tetons, as well as the valley west of the Teton Range known today as <a href="Pierre%27s%20Hole">Pierre's Hole</a>, may have been named by French speaking <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> or <a href="French%20Canadian">French Canadian</a> trappers that were part of Mackenzie's party. Earlier parties had referred to the most prominent peaks of the Teton Range as the Pilot Knobs. The French trappers' "les trois tétons" (the three breasts) was later shortened to the Tetons.

Formed in the mid-1820s, the <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20Fur%20Company">Rocky Mountain Fur Company</a> partnership included <a href="Jedediah%20Smith">Jedediah Smith</a>, <a href="William%20Sublette">William Sublette</a> and <a href="David%20Edward%20Jackson">David Edward Jackson</a> or "Davey Jackson". Jackson oversaw the trapping operations in the Teton region between 1826 and 1830. Sublette named the valley east of the Teton Range "Jackson's Hole" (later simply Jackson Hole) for Davey Jackson. As the demand for beaver fur declined and the various regions of the American West became depleted of beaver due to <a href="Animal%20trapping">over trapping</a>, American fur trading companies folded; however, individual mountain men continued to trap beaver in the region until about 1840. From the mid-1840s until 1860, Jackson Hole and the Teton Range were generally devoid of all but the small populations of Native American tribes that had already been there. Most overland human migration routes such as the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon</a> and <a href="Mormon%20Trail">Mormon Trail</a>s crossed over <a href="South%20Pass%20%28Wyoming%29">South Pass</a>, well to the south of the Teton Range, and Caucasian influence in the Teton region was minimal until the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Government</a> commenced organized explorations.

The first U.S. Government sponsored expedition to enter Jackson Hole was the 1859–60 <a href="Raynolds%20Expedition">Raynolds Expedition</a>. Led by U.S. Army Captain <a href="William%20F.%20Raynolds">William F. Raynolds</a> and guided by mountain man <a href="Jim%20Bridger">Jim Bridger</a>, it included naturalist <a href="Ferdinand%20Vandeveer%20Hayden">F. V. Hayden</a>, who later led other expeditions to the region. The expedition had been charged with exploring the Yellowstone region, but encountered difficulties crossing mountain passes due to snow. Bridger ended up guiding the expedition south over Union Pass then following the <a href="Gros%20Ventre%20River">Gros Ventre River</a> drainage to the Snake River and leaving the region over Teton Pass. Organized exploration of the region was halted during the American Civil War but resumed when F. V. Hayden led the well-funded <a href="Hayden%20Geological%20Survey%20of%201871">Hayden Geological Survey of 1871</a>. In 1872, Hayden oversaw explorations in Yellowstone, while a branch of his expedition known as the Snake River Division was led by James Stevenson and explored the Teton region. Along with Stevenson was photographer <a href="William%20Henry%20Jackson">William Henry Jackson</a> who took the first photographs of the Teton Range. The Hayden Geological Survey named many of the mountains and lakes in the region. The explorations by early mountain men and subsequent expeditions failed to identify any sources of economically viable mineral wealth. Nevertheless, small groups of prospectors set up claims and mining operations on several of the creeks and rivers. By 1900 all organized efforts to retrieve minerals had been abandoned.
Though the Teton Range was never permanently inhabited, pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley to the east of the range in 1884. These earliest <a href="Homestead%20Act">homesteaders</a> were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that were hard to cultivate. The region was mostly suited for the cultivation of hay and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. <a href="Menor%27s%20Ferry">Menor's Ferry</a> was built in 1892 near present-day <a href="Moose%2C%20Wyoming">Moose, Wyoming</a> to provide access for wagons to the west side of the Snake River. Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920, but a series of agricultural related economic downturns in the early 1920s left many ranchers destitute. Beginning in the 1920s, the automobile provided faster and easier access to areas of natural beauty and old military roads into Jackson Hole over Teton and Togwotee Passes were improved to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic. In response to the increased tourism, <a href="Guest%20ranch">dude ranches</a> were established, some new and some from existing cattle ranches, so urbanized travelers could experience the life of a cattleman.

To the north of Jackson Hole, Yellowstone National Park had been established in 1872, and by the close of the 19th century, conservationists wanted to expand the boundaries of that park to include at least the Teton Range. By 1907, in an effort to regulate water flow for irrigation purposes, the <a href="U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">U.S. Bureau of Reclamation</a> had constructed a log crib dam at the Snake River outlet of Jackson Lake. This dam failed in 1910 and a new concrete <a href="Jackson%20Lake%20Dam">Jackson Lake Dam</a> replaced it by 1911. The dam was further enlarged in 1916, raising lake waters as part of the <a href="Minidoka%20Project">Minidoka Project</a>, designed to provide irrigation for agriculture in the state of Idaho. Further dam construction plans for other lakes in the Teton Range alarmed Yellowstone National Park superintendent <a href="Horace%20Albright">Horace Albright</a>, who sought to block such efforts. Jackson Hole residents were opposed to an expansion of Yellowstone, but were more in favor of the establishment of a separate national park which would include the Teton Range and six lakes at the base of the mountains. After congressional approval, President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> signed the executive order establishing the Grand Teton National Park on February 26, 1929.

The valley of Jackson Hole remained primarily in private ownership when <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller%2C%20Jr.">John D. Rockefeller, Jr.</a> and his wife visited the region in the late 1920s. Horace Albright and Rockefeller discussed ways to preserve Jackson Hole from commercial exploitation, and in consequence, Rockefeller started buying Jackson Hole properties through the <a href="Snake%20River%20Land%20Company">Snake River Land Company</a> for the purpose of later turning them over to the National Park Service. In 1930, this plan was revealed to the residents of the region and was met with strong disapproval. Congressional efforts to prevent the expansion of Grand Teton National Park ended up putting the Snake River Land Company's holdings in limbo. By 1942 Rockefeller had become increasingly impatient that his purchased property might never be added to the park, and wrote to the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a> <a href="Harold%20L.%20Ickes">Harold L. Ickes</a> that he was considering selling the land to another party. Secretary Ickes recommended to President <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> that the <a href="Antiquities%20Act">Antiquities Act</a>, which permitted Presidents to set aside land for protection without the approval of Congress, be used to establish a <a href="National%20Monument%20%28United%20States%29">national monument</a> in Jackson Hole. Roosevelt created the <a href="Jackson%20Hole%20National%20Monument">Jackson Hole National Monument</a> in 1943, using the land donated from the Snake River Land Company and adding additional property from Teton National Forest. The monument and park were adjacent to each other and both were administered by the National Park Service, but the monument designation ensured no funding allotment, nor provided a level of resource protection equal to the park. Members of Congress repeatedly attempted to have the new national monument abolished.

After the end of World War II national public sentiment was in favor of adding the monument to the park, and though there was still much local opposition, the monument and park were combined in 1950. In recognition of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s efforts to establish and then expand Grand Teton National Park, a parcel of land between Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks was added to the National Park Service in 1972. This land and the road from the southern boundary of the park to <a href="West%20Thumb">West Thumb</a> in Yellowstone National Park was named the <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller%2C%20Jr.%20Memorial%20Parkway">John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway</a>. The Rockefeller family owned the <a href="JY%20Ranch">JY Ranch</a>, which bordered Grand Teton National Park to the southwest. In November 2007, the Rockefeller family transferred ownership of the ranch to the park for the establishment of the <a href="Laurance%20S.%20Rockefeller%20Preserve">Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve</a>, which was dedicated on June 21, 2008.

During the last 25 years of the 19th century, the mountains of the Teton Range became a focal point for explorers wanting to claim first ascents of the peaks. However, white explorers may not have been the first to climb many of the peaks and the earliest first ascent of even the formidable Grand Teton itself might have been achieved long before written history documented it. Native American relics remain including "The Enclosure", an obviously man-made structure that is located about below the summit of Grand Teton at a point near the Upper Saddle (). <a href="Nathaniel%20P.%20Langford">Nathaniel P. Langford</a> and James Stevenson, both members of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1872, found The Enclosure during their early attempt to summit Grand Teton. Langford claimed that he and Stevenson climbed Grand Teton, but were vague as to whether they had made it to the summit. Their reported obstacles and sightings were never corroborated by later parties. Langford and Stevenson likely did not get much further than The Enclosure. The first ascent of Grand Teton that is substantiated was made by <a href="William%20O.%20Owen">William O. Owen</a>, Frank Petersen, John Shive and <a href="Franklin%20Spencer%20Spalding">Franklin Spencer Spalding</a> on August 11, 1898. Owen had made two previous attempts on the peak and after publishing several accounts of this first ascent, discredited any claim that Langford and Stevenson had ever reached beyond The Enclosure in 1872. The disagreement over which party first reached the top of Grand Teton may be the greatest controversy in the history of American mountaineering. After 1898 no other ascents of Grand Teton were recorded until 1923.

By the mid-1930s, more than a dozen different climbing routes had been established on Grand Teton including the northeast ridge in 1931 by <a href="Glenn%20Exum">Glenn Exum</a>. Glenn Exum teamed up with another noted climber named <a href="Paul%20Petzoldt">Paul Petzoldt</a> to found the <a href="Exum%20Mountain%20Guides">Exum Mountain Guides</a> in 1931. Of the other major peaks on the Teton Range, all were climbed by the late 1930s including Mount Moran in 1922 and Mount Owen in 1930 by <a href="Fritiof%20Fryxell">Fritiof Fryxell</a> and others after numerous previous attempts had failed. Both <a href="Middle%20Teton">Middle</a> and <a href="South%20Teton">South Teton</a> were first climbed on the same day, August 29, 1923, by a group of climbers led by <a href="Albert%20R.%20Ellingwood">Albert R. Ellingwood</a>. New routes on the peaks were explored as safety equipment and skills improved and eventually climbs rated at above 5.9 on the <a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">Yosemite Decimal System</a> difficulty scale were established on Grand Teton. The classic climb following the route first pioneered by Owen, known as the <a href="Owen-Spalding%20route">Owen-Spalding route</a>, is rated at 5.4 due a combination of concerns beyond the gradient alone. <a href="Rock%20climbing">Rock climbing</a> and <a href="bouldering">bouldering</a> had become popular in the park by the mid 20th century. In the late 1950s, gymnast <a href="John%20Gill%20%28climber%29">John Gill</a> came to the park and started climbing large boulders near <a href="Jenny%20Lake">Jenny Lake</a>. Gill approached climbing from a gymnastics perspective and while in the Tetons became the first known climber in history to use gymnastic chalk to improve handholds and to keep hands dry while climbing. During the latter decades of the 20th century, extremely difficult cliffs were explored including some in Death Canyon, and by the mid-1990s, 800 different climbing routes had been documented for the various peaks and canyon cliffs.

Grand Teton National Park is one of the ten most visited national parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75 million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Department of the Interior</a> and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the <a href="U.S.%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a>, the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>, the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">Bureau of Reclamation</a>, and also, in consequence of <a href="Jackson%20Hole%20Airport">Jackson Hole Airport</a>'s presence in the park, the <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a>. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within an American national park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest <a href="Noise%20mitigation">noise abatement</a> regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property <a href="inholding">inholding</a>s, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, 10 million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.

Grand Teton National Park is located in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of Wyoming. To the north the park is bordered by the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, which is administered by Grand Teton National Park. The scenic highway with the same name passes from the southern boundary of Grand Teton National Park to West Thumb in Yellowstone National Park. Grand Teton National Park covers approximately , while the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway includes . Most of the Jackson Hole valley and virtually all the major mountain peaks of the Teton Range are within the park. The <a href="Jedediah%20Smith%20Wilderness">Jedediah Smith Wilderness</a> of <a href="Caribou-Targhee%20National%20Forest">Caribou-Targhee National Forest</a> lies along the western boundary and includes the western slopes of the Teton Range. To the northeast and east lie the <a href="Teton%20Wilderness">Teton Wilderness</a> and <a href="Gros%20Ventre%20Wilderness">Gros Ventre Wilderness</a> of <a href="Bridger-Teton%20National%20Forest">Bridger-Teton National Forest</a>. The National Elk Refuge is to the southeast, and migrating herds of elk winter there. Privately owned land borders the park to the south and southwest. Grand Teton National Park, along with Yellowstone National Park, surrounding National Forests and related protected areas constitute the () <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a>. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem spans across portions of three states and is one of the largest intact <a href="Middle%20latitudes">mid-latitude</a> ecosystems remaining on Earth. By road, Grand Teton National Park is from <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a> and from <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>.

The youngest mountain range in the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, the Teton Range began forming between 6 and 9 million years ago. It runs roughly north to south and rises from the floor of Jackson Hole without any <a href="foothill">foothill</a>s along a by 7- to 9-mile-wide (11 to 14 km) active <a href="fault-block%20mountain">fault-block mountain</a> front. The range tilts westward, rising abruptly above Jackson Hole valley which lies to the east but more gradually into <a href="Pierre%27s%20Hole">Teton Valley</a> to the west. A series of <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s along the <a href="Teton%20Fault">Teton Fault</a> slowly displaced the western side of the fault upward and the eastern side of the fault downward at an average of of displacement every 300–400 years. Most of the displacement of the fault occurred in the last 2 million years. While the fault has experienced up to 7.5-<a href="Mercalli%20intensity%20scale">earthquake magnitude</a> events since it formed, it has been relatively quiescent during historical periods, with only a few 5.0-magnitude or greater earthquakes known to have occurred since 1850.

In addition to Grand Teton, another nine peaks are over above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>. Eight of these peaks between <a href="Avalanche%20Canyon">Avalanche</a> and <a href="Cascade%20Canyon">Cascade Canyon</a>s make up the often-photographed <a href="Cathedral%20Group">Cathedral Group</a>. The most prominent peak north of Cascade Canyon is the monolithic <a href="Mount%20Moran">Mount Moran</a> () which rises above Jackson Lake. To the north of Mount Moran, the range eventually merges into the high altitude <a href="Yellowstone%20Plateau">Yellowstone Plateau</a>. South of the central Cathedral Group the Teton Range tapers off near Teton Pass and blends into the <a href="Snake%20River%20Range">Snake River Range</a>.

West to east trending canyons provide easier access by foot into the heart of the range as no vehicular roads traverse the range except at Teton Pass, which is south of the park. Carved by a combination of glacier activity as well as by numerous streams, the canyons are at their lowest point along the eastern margin of the range at Jackson Hole. Flowing from higher to lower elevations, the glaciers created more than a dozen <a href="U-shaped%20valley">U-shaped valley</a>s throughout the range. Cascade Canyon is sandwiched between Mount Owen and <a href="Teewinot%20Mountain">Teewinot Mountain</a> to the south and <a href="Symmetry%20Spire">Symmetry Spire</a> to the north and is situated immediately west of Jenny Lake. North to south, <a href="Webb%20Canyon">Webb</a>, <a href="Moran%20Canyon%20%28Wyoming%29">Moran</a>, <a href="Paintbrush%20Canyon">Paintbrush</a>, Cascade, <a href="Death%20Canyon">Death</a> and <a href="Granite%20Canyon">Granite Canyon</a>s slice through Teton Range.

Jackson Hole is a long by 6- to 13-mile-wide (10 to 21 km) <a href="graben">graben</a> valley with an average elevation of , its lowest point is near the southern park boundary at . The valley sits east of the Teton Range and is vertically displaced downward , making the Teton Fault and its parallel twin on the east side of the valley normal faults with the Jackson Hole block being the hanging wall and the Teton Mountain block being the footwall. Grand Teton National Park contains the major part of both blocks. Erosion of the range provided sediment in the valley so the topographic relief is only . Jackson Hole is comparatively flat, with only a modest increase in altitude south to north; however, a few isolated <a href="butte">butte</a>s such as <a href="Blacktail%20Butte">Blacktail Butte</a> and hills including <a href="Signal%20Mountain%20%28Wyoming%29">Signal Mountain</a> dot the valley floor. In addition to a few outcroppings, the <a href="Snake%20River">Snake River</a> has eroded <a href="Terrace%20%28geology%29">terraces</a> into Jackson Hole. Southeast of Jackson Lake, glacial depressions known as <a href="Kettle%20%28landform%29">kettles</a> are numerous. The kettles were formed when ice situated under gravel outwash from <a href="ice%20sheet">ice sheet</a>s melted as the glaciers retreated.

Most of the lakes in the park were formed by glaciers and the largest of these lakes are located at the base of the Teton Range. In the northern section of the park lies Jackson Lake, the largest lake in the park at in length, wide and deep. Though Jackson Lake is natural, the Jackson Lake Dam was constructed at its outlet before the creation of the park and the lake level was raised almost consequently. East of the <a href="Jackson%20Lake%20Lodge">Jackson Lake Lodge</a> lies <a href="Emma%20Matilda%20Lake">Emma Matilda</a> and <a href="Two%20Ocean%20Lake">Two Ocean Lake</a>s. South of Jackson Lake, <a href="Leigh%20Lake">Leigh</a>, <a href="Jenny%20Lake">Jenny</a>, <a href="Bradley%20Lake">Bradley</a>, <a href="Taggart%20Lake">Taggart</a> and <a href="Phelps%20Lake%20%28Wyoming%29">Phelps Lake</a>s rest at the outlets of the canyons which lead into the Teton Range. Within the Teton Range, small alpine lakes in <a href="cirque%20%28landform%29">cirque</a>s are common, and there are more than 100 scattered throughout the high country. <a href="Lake%20Solitude%20%28Wyoming%29">Lake Solitude</a>, located at an elevation of , is in a cirque at the head of the North Fork of Cascade Canyon. Other high altitude lakes can be found at over in elevation and a few, such as <a href="Icefloe%20Lake">Icefloe Lake</a>, remain ice clogged for much of the year. The park is not noted for large waterfalls; however, <a href="Hidden%20Falls%20%28Teton%20County%2C%20Wyoming%29">Hidden Falls</a> just west of Jenny Lake is easy to reach after a short hike.

From its headwaters on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows north to south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park just west of the Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include <a href="Pacific%20Creek%20%28Teton%20County%2C%20Wyoming%29">Pacific Creek</a> and <a href="Buffalo%20Fork%20%28Wyoming%29">Buffalo Fork</a> near <a href="Moran%2C%20Wyoming">Moran</a> and the <a href="Gros%20Ventre%20River">Gros Ventre River</a> at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates <a href="Braided%20river">braids</a> and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.

The major peaks of the Teton Range were carved into their current shapes by long vanished <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s. Commencing 250,000–150,000 years ago, the Tetons went through several periods of <a href="glacial%20period">glaciation</a> with some areas of Jackson Hole covered by glaciers thick. This heavy glaciation is unrelated to the uplift of the range itself and is instead part of a period of global cooling known as the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">Quaternary glaciation</a>. Beginning with the Buffalo Glaciation and followed by the <a href="Bull%20Lake%20glaciation">Bull Lake</a> and then the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">Pinedale glaciation</a>, which ended roughly 15,000 years ago, the landscape was greatly impacted by glacial activity. During the Pinedale glaciation, the landscape visible today was created as glaciers from the Yellowstone Plateau flowed south and formed Jackson Lake, while smaller glaciers descending from the Teton Range pushed rock <a href="moraines">moraines</a> out from the canyons and left behind lakes near the base of the mountains. The peaks themselves were carved into <a href="Pyramidal%20peak">horns</a> and <a href="ar%C3%AAte">arête</a>s and the canyons were transformed from water-eroded V-shapes to glacier-carved U-shaped valleys. Approximately a dozen glaciers currently exist in the park, but they are not ancient as they were all reestablished sometime between 1400 and 1850 AD during the <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a>. Of these more recent glaciers, the largest is <a href="Teton%20Glacier">Teton Glacier</a>, which sits below the northeast face of Grand Teton. Teton Glacier is long and wide, and nearly surrounded by the tallest summits in the range. Teton Glacier is also the best studied glacier in the range, and researchers concluded in 2005 that the glacier could disappear in 30 to 75 years. West of the Cathedral Group near <a href="Hurricane%20Pass">Hurricane Pass</a>, <a href="Schoolroom%20Glacier">Schoolroom Glacier</a> is tiny but has well defined terminal and lateral moraines, a small <a href="proglacial%20lake">proglacial lake</a> and other typical glacier features in close proximity to each other.

Grand Teton National Park has some of the most ancient rocks found in any American national park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12 million years old, though even older rocks are believed to exist in the park. Formed during the <a href="Archean">Archean Eon</a> (4 to 2.5 billion years ago), these <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic</a> rocks include <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a>, <a href="schist">schist</a> and <a href="amphibolite">amphibolite</a>s. Metamorphic rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545 million years ago, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by <a href="Igneous%20rock">igneous</a> <a href="granite">granitic</a> rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. <a href="Magma">Magma</a> intrusions of <a href="diabase">diabase</a> rocks 765 million years ago left <a href="Dike%20%28geology%29">dikes</a> that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and <a href="pegmatite">pegmatite</a> intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss. <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> volcanic and <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary</a> deposits, as well as <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> glacial deposits.

By the close of the Precambrian, the region was intermittently submerged under shallow seas, and for 500 million years various types of sedimentary rocks were formed. During the <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> (542 to 251 million years ago) <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="shale">shale</a>, <a href="limestone">limestone</a> and <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a> were deposited. Though most of these sedimentary rocks have since eroded away from the central Teton Range, they are still evident on the northern, southern and western flanks of the range. One notable exception is the sandstone Flathead Formation which continues to cap Mount Moran. Sedimentary layering of rocks in <a href="Alaska%20Basin">Alaska Basin</a>, which is on the western border of Grand Teton National Park, chronicles a 120-million-year period of sedimentary deposition. <a href="Fossil">Fossil</a>s found in the sedimentary rocks in the park include <a href="algae">algae</a>, <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s and <a href="trilobite">trilobite</a>s. Sedimentary deposition continued during the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> (250–66 million years ago) and the <a href="coal">coal</a> seams found in the sedimentary rock strata indicate the region was densely forested during that era. Numerous coal seams of in thickness are interspersed with <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a>, <a href="claystone">claystone</a> and other sedimentary rocks. During the late <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, a <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> arc west of the region deposited fine grained ash that later formed into <a href="bentonite">bentonite</a>, an important mineral resource.

From the end of the Mesozoic to present, the region went through a series of uplifts and erosional sequences. Commencing 66 million years ago the <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">Laramide orogeny</a> was a period of mountain-building and erosion in western <a href="North%20America">North America</a> that created the ancestral Rocky Mountains. This cycle of uplift and erosion left behind one of the most complete non-marine <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> rock sequences found in North America. <a href="Conglomerate%20%28geology%29">Conglomerate</a> rocks composed of <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a> and interspersed with <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a> and sandstones were deposited during erosion from a now vanished mountain range that existed to the northwest of the current Teton Range. These deposits also have trace quantities of <a href="gold">gold</a> and <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>. During the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> and <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, <a href="volcanic%20eruption">volcanic eruption</a>s from the ancestral <a href="Absaroka%20Range">Absaroka Range</a> buried the region under various volcanic deposits. <a href="Sedimentary%20basin">Sedimentary basin</a>s developed in the region due to drop faulting, creating an ancestral Jackson Hole and by the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> (10 million years ago), an ancestral Jackson Lake known as Teewinot Lake. During the <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a>, <a href="mass%20wasting">landslides</a>, erosion and glacial activity deposited soils and rock debris throughout the Snake River valley of Jackson Hole and left behind terminal moraines which impound the current lakes. The most recent example of rapid alteration to the landscape occurred in 1925 just east of the park, when the <a href="Gros%20Ventre%20landslide">Gros Ventre landslide</a> was triggered by spring melt from a heavy snowpack as well as heavy rain.

Grand Teton National Park and the surrounding region host over 1,000 species of <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a>s. With an altitude variance of over , the park has a number of different ecological zones including <a href="alpine%20tundra">alpine tundra</a>, the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains%20subalpine%20zone">Rocky Mountains subalpine zone</a> where <a href="spruce-fir%20forests">spruce-fir forests</a> are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with <a href="sagebrush">sagebrush</a> plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, <a href="wetlands">wetlands</a> near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a> incidence, <a href="avalanche">avalanche</a>s and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an <a href="ecotone">ecotone</a>.

The range of altitude in Grand Teton National Park impacts the types of plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a>, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of <a href="grass">grass</a>, <a href="wildflower">wildflower</a>, <a href="moss">moss</a> and <a href="lichen">lichen</a> are found. In the <a href="subalpine">subalpine</a> region from the tree line to the base of the mountains, <a href="whitebark%20pine">whitebark pine</a>, <a href="limber%20pine">limber pine</a>, <a href="Abies%20lasiocarpa">subalpine fir</a>, and <a href="Picea%20engelmannii">Engelmann spruce</a> are dominant. In the valley floor, <a href="lodgepole%20pine">lodgepole pine</a> is most common but <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20Douglas-fir">Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir</a>, and <a href="Picea%20pungens">blue spruce</a> inhabit drier areas, while <a href="Populus%20tremuloides">aspen</a>, <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aigeiros">cottonwood</a>, <a href="alder">alder</a>, and <a href="willow">willow</a> are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.

While the flora of Grand Teton National Park is generally healthy, the whitebark pine, and to a lesser degree the lodgepole pine, are considered at risk. In the case of the whitebark pine, an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> known as <a href="Cronartium%20ribicola">white pine blister rust</a> weakens the tree, making it more susceptible to destruction from <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> <a href="mountain%20pine%20beetle">mountain pine beetle</a>s. Whitebark pines generally thrive at elevations above and produce large seeds that are high in fat content and an important food source for various species such as the <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>, <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a> and <a href="Clark%27s%20nutcracker">Clark's nutcracker</a>. The species is considered to be a <a href="Keystone%20species">keystone</a> and a foundation species; keystone in that its ""ecological role (is) disproportionately large relative to its abundance"" and foundation in that it has a paramount role that ""defines ecosystem structure, function, and process"". Whitebark pine has generally had a lower incidence of blister rust infection throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem than in other regions such as <a href="Glacier%20National%20Park%20%28U.S.%29">Glacier National Park</a> and the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>. The incidence of blister rust on whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park is slightly lower than in Grand Teton. Though blister rust is not in itself the cause of increased mortality, its weakening effect on trees allows native pine beetles to more easily infest the trees, increasing mortality. While general practice in national parks is to allow nature to take its course, the alarming trend of increased disease and mortality of the vital whitebark pine trees has sparked a collaborative effort amongst various government entities to intervene to protect the species.
Sixty-one species of mammals have been recorded in Grand Teton National Park. This includes the <a href="gray%20wolf">gray wolf</a>, which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand Teton National Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there. The re-establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park. In addition to gray wolves, another 17 species of <a href="Carnivora">carnivores</a> reside within Grand Teton National Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>. Relatively common sightings of <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">river otter</a>, <a href="American%20marten">marten</a> and <a href="American%20badger">badger</a> and occasional sightings of <a href="North%20American%20cougar">cougar</a>, <a href="Canada%20lynx">lynx</a> and <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a> are reported annually. A number of rodent species exist including <a href="yellow-bellied%20marmot">yellow-bellied marmot</a>, <a href="least%20chipmunk">least chipmunk</a>, <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>, <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beaver</a>, <a href="Uinta%20ground%20squirrel">Uinta ground squirrel</a>, <a href="American%20pika">pika</a>, <a href="snowshoe%20hare">snowshoe hare</a>, <a href="North%20American%20porcupine">porcupine</a>, and six species of bats.

Of the larger mammals the most common are elk, which exist in the thousands. Their migration route between the National Elk Refuge and Yellowstone National Park is through Grand Teton National Park, so while easily seen anytime of the year, they are most numerous in the spring and fall. Other <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s in the park include moose, <a href="American%20bison">bison</a>, and <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a>--the fastest land mammal in the western hemisphere. The park's <a href="moose">moose</a> tend to stay near waterways and wetlands. Between 100–125 bighorn sheep dwell in the alpine and rocky zones of the peaks.

Over 300 species of birds have been sighted in the park including the <a href="calliope%20hummingbird">calliope hummingbird</a>, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as <a href="trumpeter%20swan">trumpeter swan</a>s, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including <a href="blue-winged%20teal">blue-winged teal</a>, <a href="common%20merganser">common merganser</a>, <a href="American%20wigeon">American wigeon</a> and the colorful but reclusive <a href="harlequin%20duck">harlequin duck</a> which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both <a href="Bald%20eagle">bald</a> and <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s and other birds of prey such as the <a href="osprey">osprey</a>, <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a>, <a href="American%20kestrel">American kestrel</a> and occasional sightings of <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a> have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a>, though the <a href="boreal%20owl">boreal owl</a> and <a href="great%20grey%20owl">great grey owl</a> are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious <a href="black-billed%20magpie">black-billed magpie</a> frequents campgrounds while <a href="Steller%27s%20jay">Steller's jay</a> and Clark's nutcracker are found in the backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for <a href="sage%20grouse">sage grouse</a>, <a href="Brewer%27s%20sparrow">Brewer's sparrow</a> and <a href="sage%20thrasher">sage thrasher</a>s, while the wetlands are frequented by <a href="great%20blue%20heron">great blue heron</a>, <a href="American%20white%20pelican">American white pelican</a>, <a href="sandhill%20crane">sandhill crane</a> and on rare occasions it's <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> relative, the <a href="whooping%20crane">whooping crane</a>.

The <a href="Snake%20River%20fine-spotted%20cutthroat%20trout">Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout</a> (or "Snake River cutthroat trout") is the only native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only subspecies of <a href="cutthroat%20trout">cutthroat trout</a> that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers have not been able to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the <a href="Yellowstone%20cutthroat%20trout">Yellowstone cutthroat trout</a>, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> and <a href="lake%20trout">lake trout</a> were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the <a href="mountain%20whitefish">mountain whitefish</a>, <a href="longnose%20dace">longnose dace</a>, <a href="mountain%20sucker">mountain sucker</a> and non-native species include the <a href="Utah%20chub">Utah chub</a> and <a href="Arctic%20grayling">Arctic grayling</a>.

Only four species of reptiles are documented in the park: three species of snakes which are the <a href="garter%20snake">wandering garter snake</a>, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and <a href="rubber%20boa">rubber boa</a>, as well as one lizard species, the northern <a href="sagebrush%20lizard">sagebrush lizard</a>, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the <a href="Columbia%20spotted%20frog">Columbia spotted frog</a>, <a href="boreal%20chorus%20frog">boreal chorus frog</a>, <a href="tiger%20salamander">tiger salamander</a> and the increasingly rare <a href="boreal%20toad">boreal toad</a> and <a href="northern%20leopard%20frog">northern leopard frog</a>. A sixth amphibian species, the <a href="American%20bullfrog">bullfrog</a>, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of <a href="Army%20cutworm">Army cutworm moth</a>s die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000 kcal/day.

Grand Teton National Park permits hunting of elk in an effort to keep the populations of that species regulated. This provision was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some national parks in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in American national parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2089">U.S. Route 89</a>. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.

The role of wildfire is an important one for plant and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the <a href="Yellowstone%20fires%20of%201988">Yellowstone fires of 1988</a> had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded that the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with a better understanding of the role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.

Grand Teton National Park has a semi-arid climate with the wettest months between November and January, mostly in the form of snow. The park averages of snow in the mountains and in the valley annually. In January, the daily temperature range averages between during the day to at night. During the month of July, the daily temperature range is . The record high is and the record low is . Temperatures above the valley in the mountains during the summer average cooler for every of altitude gained, so high altitude passes may remain snow-covered until mid-July. Thunderstorms are common during the summer, especially over the mountains; by contrast, no <a href="tornado">tornado</a>s have ever been reported within the park. The <a href="Fujita%20scale">F4</a> <a href="Teton-Yellowstone%20tornado">Teton-Yellowstone tornado</a> was a high altitude tornado which touched down northeast of the park on the border of the Teton Wilderness of Bridger-Teton National Forest and Yellowstone National Park.

Grand Teton National Park is more than air distance from any major urban or industrial area, and localized human activities have generally had a very low environmental impact on the surrounding region. However, levels of <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> have been trending slightly upwards due to deposition from rain and snow that is believed to originate from regional agricultural activities. Additionally, there has also been a slight increase in <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> and pesticides that have been detected in snow and some alpine lakes. Ozone and haze may be impacting overall visibility levels. Grand Teton National Park, in partnership with other agencies, erected the first air quality monitoring station in the park in 2011. The station is designed to check for various pollutants as well as ozone levels and weather.

A 2005 study of the water of Jackson, Jenny and Taggart Lakes indicated that all three of these lakes had virtually pristine water quality. Of the three lakes, only on Taggart Lake are motorized boats prohibited, yet little difference in water quality was detected in the three lakes. In a study published in 2002, the Snake River was found to have better overall water quality than other river systems in Wyoming, and low levels of pollution from <a href="wiktionary%3Aanthropogenic">anthropogenic</a> sources.

Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountain and rock climbers partly because the mountains are easily accessible by road. Trails are well marked and routes to the summits of most peaks are long established, and for the experienced and fit, most peaks can be climbed in one day. The highest maintained trails climb from the floor of Jackson Hole over to <a href="mountain%20pass">mountain pass</a>es that are sometimes called saddles or divides. From these passes, the climbs follow routes that require varying skill levels. Climbers do not need a permit but are encouraged to voluntarily register their climbing plans with the National Park Service and inform associates of their itinerary. Any climb requiring an overnight stay in the backcountry does require a permit. Climbers are essentially on their own to determine their own skill levels and are encouraged to not take unnecessary risks. The Exum Mountain Guides, which is considered one of the finest mountaineering guide services in the U.S., as well as the Jackson Hole Mountain Guides, offer instruction and climbing escorts for those who are less experienced or unfamiliar with various routes.

An average of 4,000 climbers per year make an attempt to summit Grand Teton and most ascend up <a href="Garnet%20Canyon">Garnet Canyon</a> to a mountain pass called the Lower Saddle, which is between Grand Teton and Middle Teton. From the Lower Saddle, climbers often follow the <a href="Owen-Spalding%20route">Owen-Spalding</a> or <a href="Upper%20Exum%20Ridge%20Route">Exum Ridge</a> routes to the top of Grand Teton though there are 38 distinct routes to the summit. The <a href="North%20face%20%28Grand%20Teton%29">north face</a> route to the summit of Grand Teton is a world renowned climb involving a dozen distinct <a href="Pitch%20%28ascent/descent%29">pitches</a> and is rated at <a href="Grade%20%28climbing%29">grade</a> 5.8 in difficulty for the vertical ascent. On a connecting ridge and just north of Grand Teton lies Mount Owen, and though lower in altitude, this peak is considered more difficult to ascend. Middle Teton is another popular climb that is most easily summited from a saddle between it and South Teton. Well north of Grand Teton lies Mount Moran, which is further from trailheads and more difficult to access and ascend. The <a href="Direct%20South%20Buttress%20%28Mount%20Moran%29">Direct South Buttress</a> of Mount Moran provides a vertical mile of climbing that was considered the most difficult climb in the U.S. when first accomplished in 1953. Other popular climbing destinations include <a href="Buck%20Mountain%20%28Wyoming%29">Buck Mountain</a>, Symmetry Spire, <a href="Mount%20Saint%20John">Mount Saint John</a>, <a href="Mount%20Wister">Mount Wister</a>, Teewinot Mountain and <a href="Nez%20Perce%20Peak">Nez Perce Peak</a> and each mountain has at least six established routes to their summits.

Grand Teton National Park has five front-country vehicular access campgrounds. The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds, and each has 350 campsites which can accommodate large <a href="recreational%20vehicle">recreational vehicle</a>s. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86 campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for recreational vehicles are at the concessionaire managed 112 campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late spring to late fall, primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.

All campsites accessible only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites and they are available by permit only, but camping is allowed in most of these backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved <a href="Bear-resistant%20food%20storage%20container">bear-resistant container</a>. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved <a href="bear%20spray">bear spray</a> to elude aggressive bears.

The park has of hiking trails, ranging in difficulty from easy to strenuous. The easiest hiking trails are located in the valley, where the altitude changes are generally minimal. In the vicinity of Colter Bay Village, the <a href="Hermitage%20Point%20Trail">Hermitage Point Trail</a> is long and considered easy. Several other trails link Hermitage Point with <a href="Emma%20Matilda%20Lake%20Trail">Emma Matilda Lake</a> and <a href="Two%20Ocean%20Lake%20Trail">Two Ocean Lake Trail</a>s, also considered to be relatively easy hikes in the Jackson Lake Lodge area. Other easy hikes include the <a href="Valley%20Trail%20%28Grand%20Teton%20National%20Park%29">Valley Trail</a> which runs from <a href="Trapper%20Lake%20%28Teton%20County%2C%20Wyoming%29">Trapper Lake</a> in the north to the south park boundary near Teton Village and the <a href="Jenny%20Lake%20Trail">Jenny Lake Trail</a> which circles the lake. Ranging from moderate to strenuous in difficulty, trails leading into the canyons are rated based on distance and more importantly on the amount of elevation change. The greatest elevation change is found on the <a href="Paintbrush%20Canyon%20Trail">Paintbrush Canyon</a>, <a href="Alaska%20Basin%20Trail">Alaska Basin</a> and <a href="Garnet%20Canyon%20Trail">Garnet Canyon Trail</a>s, where elevation increases of over are typical. Horses and pack animals are permitted on almost all trails in the park; however, there are only five designated backcountry camping locations for pack animals and these campsites are far from the high mountain passes. Bicycles are limited to vehicle roadways only and the park has widened some roads to provide a safer biking experience. A paved multi-use pathway opened in 2009 and provides non-motorized biking access from the town of Jackson to South Jenny Lake.

Grand Teton National Park allows boating on all the lakes in Jackson Hole, but motorized boats can only be used on Jackson and Jenny Lakes. While there is no maximum horsepower limit on Jackson Lake (though there is a noise restriction), Jenny Lake is restricted to 10 horsepower. Only non-motorized boats are permitted on Bearpaw, Bradley, Emma Matilda, Leigh, Phelps, String, Taggart and Two Ocean Lakes. There are four designated boat launches located on Jackson Lake and one on Jenny Lake. Additionally, sailboats, windsurfers and water skiing are only allowed on Jackson Lake and no jet skis are permitted on any of the park waterways. All boats are required to comply with various safety regulations including personal flotation devices for each passenger. Only non-motorized watercraft are permitted on the Snake River. All other waterways in the park are off limits to boating, and this includes all alpine lakes and tributary streams of the Snake River.

In 2010, Grand Teton National Park started requiring all boats to display an Aquatic Invasive Species decal issued by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department or a Yellowstone National Park boat permit. In an effort to keep the park waterways free of various invasive species such as the <a href="Zebra%20mussel">Zebra mussel</a> and <a href="Myxobolus%20cerebralis">whirling disease</a>, boaters are expected to abide by certain regulations including displaying a self-certification of compliance on the dashboard of any vehicle attached to an empty boat trailer.

Grand Teton National Park fisheries are managed by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department and a Wyoming state fishing license is required to fish all waterways in Grand Teton National Park. The creel limit for trout is restricted to six per day, including no more than three cutthroat trout with none longer than , while the maximum length of other trout species may not exceed , except those taken from Jackson Lake, where the maximum allowable length is . There are also restrictions as to the seasonal accessibility to certain areas as well as the types of bait and <a href="fishing%20tackle">fishing tackle</a> permitted.

Visitors are allowed to <a href="snowshoe">snowshoe</a> and do <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country skiing</a> and are not restricted to trails. The Teton Park Road between the Taggart Lake trailhead to Signal Mountain Campground is closed to vehicular traffic during the winter and this section of the road is groomed for skiing and snowshoeing traffic. The park service offers guided snowshoe tours daily from the main headquarters located in Moose, Wyoming. Overnight camping is allowed in the winter in the backcountry with a permit and visitors should inquire about avalanche dangers.

The only location in Grand Teton National Park where <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a>s are permitted is on Jackson Lake. The National Park Service requires that all snowmobiles use "Best Available Technology" (BAT) and lists various models of snowmobiles that are permitted, all of which are deemed to provide the least amount of air pollution and maximize noise abatement. All snowmobiles must be less than 10 years old and have odometer readings of less than . Additionally, snowmobile use is for the purposes of accessing <a href="ice%20fishing">ice fishing</a> locations only. Snowmobile access was permitted between Moran Junction and <a href="Flagg%20Ranch">Flagg Ranch</a> adjacent to the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway so that travelers using the Continental Divide Snowmobile Trail could traverse between Bridger-Teton National Forest and Yellowstone National Park. However, in 2009, winter use planners closed this since unguided snowmobile access into Yellowstone National Park was also discontinued.

The <a href="Craig%20Thomas%20Discovery%20and%20Visitor%20Center">Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center</a> adjacent to the park headquarters at Moose, Wyoming, is open year-round. Opened in 2007 to replace an old, inadequate visitor center, the facility is named for the late <a href="U.S.%20Senator">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="Craig%20L.%20Thomas">Craig Thomas</a> and designed by acclaimed architect, <a href="Bohlin%20Cywinski%20Jackson">Bohlin Cywinski Jackson</a>. It was financed with a combination of federal grants and private donations. An adjoining 154-seat auditorium was opened to the public in April 2011. To the north at <a href="Colter%20Bay%20Village">Colter Bay Village</a> on Jackson Lake, the Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum is open from the beginning of May to the early October. The Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum has housed the David T. Vernon Indian Arts Exhibit since 1972. The Colter Bay Visitor Center was built in 1956 and was determined in 2005 to be substandard for the proper care and display of the Indian arts collection. During the winter of 2011–2012, a $150,000 renovation project was completed at the center and a portion of the arts collection was made available for viewing when the center opened for the season in May 2012.

South of Moose on the <a href="Moose%E2%80%93Wilson%20Road">Moose–Wilson Road</a>, the <a href="Laurance%20S.%20Rockefeller%20Preserve">Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve</a> Center is located on land that was privately owned by <a href="Laurance%20S.%20Rockefeller">Laurance S. Rockefeller</a> and is situated on Phelps Lake. Donated to Grand Teton National Park and opened to the public in 2008, the property was once part of the JY Ranch, the first dude ranch in Jackson Hole. At Jenny Lake, the Jenny Lake Visitor Center is open from mid-May to mid-September. This visitor center is within the <a href="Jenny%20Lake%20Ranger%20Station%20Historic%20District">Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District</a> and is the same structure photographer <a href="Harrison%20R.%20Crandall">Harrison Crandall</a> had constructed as an art studio in the 1920s.
Contracted through the National Park Service, various <a href="Concession%20%28contract%29">concessionaire</a> entities manage lodging facilities inside the park. The largest such facility is the Jackson Lake Lodge, which is managed by the Grand Teton Lodge Company. Located near Jackson Lake Dam, the Jackson Lake Lodge has a total of 385 rooms, meeting facilities, a retail shop and a restaurant. The Grand Teton Lodge Company also manages the <a href="Jenny%20Lake%20Lodge">Jenny Lake Lodge</a>, which consists of cabins and a restaurant and Colter Bay Village, which has cabins, a restaurant, a grocery store, a laundry and a marina. South of Jackson Lake Dam, the <a href="Signal%20Mountain%20Lodge">Signal Mountain Lodge</a> is managed by <a href="Forever%20Resorts">Forever Resorts</a> and provides cabins, a marina, a gas station and a restaurant. The <a href="American%20Alpine%20Club">American Alpine Club</a> has <a href="hostel">hostel</a> dormitory style accommodations primarily reserved for mountain climbers at the <a href="Double%20Diamond%20Dude%20Ranch%20Dining%20Hall">Grand Teton Climber's Ranch</a>. Adjacent to the Snake River in Moose, Wyoming, Dornan's is an inholding on private land which has year-round cabin accommodations and related facilities. Lodging is also available at the Triangle X Ranch, another private inholding in the park and the last remaining dude ranch within park boundaries.

Opeth

Opeth is a Swedish <a href="progressive%20metal">progressive metal</a>-<a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> band from <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, formed in 1989. The group has been through several personnel changes, including the replacement of every single original member. Lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter <a href="Mikael%20%C3%85kerfeldt">Mikael Åkerfeldt</a> has remained Opeth's primary driving force since the departure of original vocalist <a href="David%20Isberg">David Isberg</a> in 1992. Opeth has consistently incorporated <a href="progressive%20metal">progressive</a>, <a href="folk%20music">folk</a>, <a href="blues">blues</a>, <a href="classical%20music">classical</a>, and <a href="jazz">jazz</a> influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a>, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamic</a> shifts, as well as both <a href="death%20growls">death growls</a> and clean vocals. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of <a href="Mellotron">Mellotron</a>s in their work. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of "<a href="Blackwater%20Park">Blackwater Park</a>", they have led several major world tours.

Opeth has released twelve studio albums, three live DVDs, three live albums (two that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album "<a href="Orchid%20%28album%29">Orchid</a>" in 1995. Although their eighth studio album, "<a href="Ghost%20Reveries">Ghost Reveries</a>", was quite popular in the United States, Opeth did not experience major American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album, "<a href="Watershed%20%28Opeth%20album%29">Watershed</a>", which peaked at No. 23 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release. As of November 2009, Opeth has sold over 1.5 million copies of their albums and DVDs worldwide, including 300,000 collective <a href="SoundScan">SoundScan</a>s of their albums "<a href="Blackwater%20Park">Blackwater Park</a>", "<a href="Damnation%20%28album%29">Damnation</a>", and "<a href="Deliverance%20%28Opeth%20album%29">Deliverance</a>" in the United States.

Opeth was formed as a <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a> band in 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden, by lead vocalist <a href="David%20Isberg">David Isberg</a>. Isberg asked former Eruption band member <a href="Mikael%20%C3%85kerfeldt">Mikael Åkerfeldt</a>, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word "Opet", taken from the <a href="Wilbur%20Smith">Wilbur Smith</a> novel "<a href="The%20Sunbird">The Sunbird</a>". In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n city in South Africa translated as "City of the Moon".

Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer <a href="Anders%20Nordin">Anders Nordin</a>, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist <a href="Johan%20De%20Farfalla">Johan De Farfalla</a>. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend <a href="Peter%20Lindgren%20%28musician%29">Peter Lindgren</a> took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing "creative differences".

Following Isberg's departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the <a href="blast%20beat">blast beat</a>s and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a>s and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with <a href="Candlelight%20Records">Candlelight Records</a> in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member De Farfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he went on to join on a full-time basis following the release of Opeth's debut album, "Orchid", in 1995.

Opeth recorded its debut album, "<a href="Orchid%20%28album%29">Orchid</a>", with producer <a href="Dan%20Swan%C3%B6">Dan Swanö</a> in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. "Orchid" tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.

After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named "<a href="Morningrise">Morningrise</a>", and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute "Black Rose Immortal". Opeth toured the UK in support of "Morningrise", followed by a 26-date <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n tour with <a href="Cradle%20of%20Filth">Cradle of Filth</a>. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of <a href="Century%20Media%20Records">Century Media Records</a>, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.

In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former "Eternal" members, drummer <a href="Martin%20Lopez">Martín López</a> (formerly of <a href="Amon%20Amarth">Amon Amarth</a>) and bassist <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20M%C3%A9ndez">Martín Méndez</a>, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>'s "Remember Tomorrow", which was included on the album "".

With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer <a href="Fredrik%20Nordstr%C3%B6m">Fredrik Nordström</a>, at <a href="Studio%20Fredman">Studio Fredman</a> in August 1997. Although Opeth had Méndez, due to time constraints Åkerfeldt played bass on the album. "<a href="My%20Arms%2C%20Your%20Hearse">My Arms, Your Hearse</a>" was released to critical acclaim on August 18, 1998.

In 1999, the ownership of Candlelight Records changed hands, with owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett leaving the company. Opeth signed with UK label <a href="Peaceville%20Records">Peaceville Records</a> in Europe, which was distributed by <a href="Music%20for%20Nations">Music for Nations</a>. Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio. Delays with the album's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and "<a href="Still%20Life%20%28Opeth%20album%29">Still Life</a>" was released on October 18, 1999. Due to problems with the band's new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. "Still Life" was the first album recorded with Méndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band's logo. Allmusic called "Still Life" a "formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies." As explained by Åkerfeldt, "Still Life" is a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>: "The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith as the rest of the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old 'babe.' The big bosses of the town know that he's back... A lot of bad things start happening."

Following a few live dates in Europe, Opeth returned to <a href="Studio%20Fredman">Studio Fredman</a> to begin work on its next album, with <a href="Porcupine%20Tree">Porcupine Tree</a>'s <a href="Steven%20Wilson">Steven Wilson</a> producing. The band sought to recreate the recording experience of "Still Life", and again entered the studio with minimal rehearsals, and no lyrics written. "This time it was tough," Åkerfeldt said, "I feel pleasantly blown away by the immense result, though. It was indeed worth the effort." Wilson also pushed the band to expand its sound, incorporating new sounds and production techniques. "Steve guided us into the realms of 'strange' noises for guitars and voice", Åkerfeldt said.

Opeth released its fifth studio album, "<a href="Blackwater%20Park">Blackwater Park</a>", on February 21, 2001. AllMusic has stated that the album "keeps with Opeth's tradition by transcending the limits of death/black metal and repeatedly shattering the foundations of conventional songwriting". In support of "Blackwater Park", Opeth embarked on its first world tour, headlined Europe for the first time, and made an appearance at the 2001 <a href="Wacken%20Open%20Air">Wacken Open Air</a> festival in Germany, playing to a crowd of 60,000.

Opeth returned to Sweden after touring in support of "Blackwater Park", and began writing for the next album. At first, Åkerfeldt had trouble putting together new material: "I wanted to write something heavier than we'd ever done, still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn't want to go to waste." <a href="Jonas%20Renkse">Jonas Renkse</a> of <a href="Katatonia">Katatonia</a>, a long-time friend of Åkerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums—one heavy and one soft.

Excited at the prospect, Åkerfeldt agreed without consulting his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates liked the idea of recording two separate albums, Åkerfeldt had to convince the label: "I had to lie somewhat ... saying that we could do this recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album." With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, Åkerfeldt said the recording process was "the toughest test of our history." After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, "<a href="Deliverance%20%28Opeth%20album%29">Deliverance</a>", with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. ""Deliverance" was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever," Åkerfeldt claimed, that Sneap "is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording."

"Deliverance" was released on November 4, 2002, and debuted at number 19 on the US Top Independent Albums chart, marking the band's first US chart appearance. AllMusic stated, ""Deliverance" is altogether more subtle than any of its predecessors, approaching listeners with haunting nuances and masterful dynamics rather than overwhelming them with sheer mass and complexity."

Opeth performed a one-off concert in Stockholm, then returned to the UK to finish recording vocals for the second of the two albums, "<a href="Damnation%20%28album%29">Damnation</a>", at Steven Wilson's No Man's Land Studios. Although Åkerfeldt believed the band could not finish both albums, Opeth completed "Deliverance" and "Damnation" in just seven weeks of studio time, which was the same amount spent on "Blackwater Park" alone. "Damnation" was released on April 14, 2003, and garnered the band its first appearance on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> at number 192. The album also won the 2003 Swedish <a href="Grammy">Grammy</a> Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. On January 1, 2016, Opeth re-released both "Deliverance" and "Damnation" in one package, containing CD and DVD versions, along with new mixing.

The band embarked on its biggest tour yet, playing nearly 200 shows in 2003 and 2004. Opeth performed three special shows in Europe with two song lists each—one acoustic set and one heavy set. The band recorded its first DVD, "<a href="Lamentations%20%28Live%20at%20Shepherd%27s%20Bush%20Empire%202003%29">Lamentations (Live at Shepherd's Bush Empire 2003)</a>", at <a href="Shepherd%27s%20Bush%20Empire">Shepherd's Bush Empire</a> in London, England. The DVD features a two-hour performance, including the entire "Damnation" album, several songs from "Deliverance" and "Blackwater Park", and a one-hour documentary about the recording of "Deliverance" and "Damnation". "Lamentations" was certified <a href="Canadian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Gold</a> in Canada.

Opeth was scheduled to perform in <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. Opeth's tour manager distributed 6,000 tickets for the concert, but before the band left for Jordan, drummer Lopez called Åkerfeldt stating he was having an <a href="anxiety%20attack">anxiety attack</a> and could not perform, forcing the band to cancel the show. In early 2004, Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour. Opeth decided against cancelling the remainder of the tour, with Lopez's drum technician filling in for two concerts. Lopez promised that he would return to the tour as soon as he could, but two shows later Opeth asked <a href="Strapping%20Young%20Lad">Strapping Young Lad</a> drummer <a href="Gene%20Hoglan">Gene Hoglan</a> to fill in. Lopez returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the "Deliverance" and "Damnation" tour. <a href="Per%20Wiberg">Per Wiberg</a> also joined the band on tour to perform keyboards, after more than a year on tour.

Opeth returned home in 2004 to start writing new material for its eighth album, and by the end of the year, they had finished writing it. Opeth's European label, Music for Nations, closed its doors in 2005, and after negotiations with various labels, the band signed with <a href="Roadrunner%20Records">Roadrunner Records</a>. Åkerfeldt said the primary reason for signing with Roadrunner was the label's wide distribution, ensuring the album would be available at larger-chain retailers. When news leaked that the band was signed to Roadrunner, who predominantly worked with trend-oriented rock and metal, some fans accused the band of selling out. "To be honest," Åkerfeldt said, "that's such an insult after 15 years as a band and 8 records. I can't believe we haven't earned each and every Opeth fan's credibility after all these years. I mean, our songs are 10 minutes long!" The band rehearsed for three weeks before entering the studio, the first time the band rehearsed since the 1998 album, "My Arms, Your Hearse". During rehearsal, keyboardist Wiberg joined Opeth as a full-time member. Opeth recorded at Fascination Street Studios in <a href="%C3%96rebro%2C%20Sweden">Örebro, Sweden</a>, from March 18 to June 1, 2005, and released the resulting "<a href="Ghost%20Reveries">Ghost Reveries</a>" on August 30, 2005, to critical acclaim and commercial success. The album debuted at number 64 in the US, and number nine in Sweden, higher than any previous Opeth release. Keith Bergman of <a href="Blabbermouth.net">Blabbermouth.net</a> gave the album ten out of ten, one of only 21 albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site. Rod Smith of <a href="Decibel%20Magazine">"Decibel" magazine</a> called "Ghost Reveries" "achingly beautiful, sometimes unabashedly brutal, often a combination of both".

On May 12, 2006, Martin Lopez announced that he had officially parted ways with Opeth due to health problems, and was replaced by <a href="Martin%20Axenrot">Martin Axenrot</a>. Opeth toured on the main stage of <a href="Gigantour">Gigantour</a> in 2006, alongside <a href="Megadeth">Megadeth</a>. "Ghost Reveries" was re-released on October 31, 2006, with a bonus <a href="cover%20version">cover song</a> (<a href="Deep%20Purple">Deep Purple</a>'s "Soldier of Fortune"), a DVD featuring a <a href="5.1%20surround%20sound">5.1 surround sound</a> mix of the album and a documentary on the making of the record. A recording of Opeth's live performance at the <a href="Roundhouse%20%28venue%29">Camden Roundhouse</a>, in London, on November 9, 2006, was released as the double <a href="live%20album">live album</a> "<a href="The%20Roundhouse%20Tapes">The Roundhouse Tapes</a>", which topped the Finnish DVD chart.

On May 17, 2007, Peter Lindgren announced he would be leaving Opeth after 16 years. "The decision has been the toughest I've ever made but it is the right one to make at this point in my life," Lindgren said. "I feel that I simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry." Ex-<a href="Arch%20Enemy">Arch Enemy</a> guitarist <a href="Fredrik%20%C3%85kesson">Fredrik Åkesson</a> replaced Lindgren, as Åkerfeldt explained "Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. We all get along great as we've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth."

Opeth entered Fascination Street Studios in November 2007 to record their ninth studio album, with Åkerfeldt producing. By January 2008, Opeth had recorded 13 songs, including three <a href="cover%20version">cover songs</a>. The finished album, "<a href="Watershed%20%28Opeth%20album%29">Watershed</a>", features seven tracks, with cover songs used as bonus tracks on different versions of the album. "Watershed" was released on June 3, 2008. Åkerfeldt described the songs on the album as "a bit more energetic". Opeth toured in support of "Watershed", including headlining the UK Defenders of the Faith tour with <a href="Arch%20Enemy">Arch Enemy</a>, an appearance at <a href="Wacken%20Open%20Air">Wacken Open Air</a>, and the Progressive Nation tour with headliner <a href="Dream%20Theater">Dream Theater</a>. "Watershed" was Opeth's highest-charting album to date, debuting at number 23 on the US "Billboard" 200, on the Australian <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA album charts</a> at number seven and at number one on <a href="Finland">Finland</a>'s official album chart. Opeth went on a worldwide tour in support of "Watershed". From September to October, the band toured North America backed by <a href="High%20on%20Fire">High on Fire</a>, <a href="Baroness%20%28band%29">Baroness</a>, and <a href="Nachtmystium">Nachtmystium</a>. They returned to tour Europe for the rest of the year with <a href="Cynic%20%28band%29">Cynic</a> and <a href="The%20Ocean%20Collective">The Ocean</a>.

In 2010, Opeth wrote and recorded the new track, "The Throat of Winter", which appeared on the digital EP soundtrack of the video game, "<a href="God%20of%20War%20III">God of War III</a>". Åkerfeldt described the song as "odd" and "not very metal." To celebrate their 20th anniversary, Opeth performed a six-show, worldwide tour called "Evolution XX: An Opeth Anthology", from March 30 through April 9, 2010. "<a href="Blackwater%20Park">Blackwater Park</a>" was performed in its entirety, along with several songs never before performed. The concert of April 5, 2010, at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in London, England was filmed for a DVD and live album package titled "<a href="In%20Live%20Concert%20at%20the%20Royal%20Albert%20Hall">In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall</a>". The set was released on September 21, 2010, in 2-DVD and 2-DVD/3-CD configurations. For the DVD the concert was split into two sets. The first set consists of the entire "Blackwater Park" album, while the second set contains one song from every album excluding "Blackwater Park", in chronological order representing the twenty years of "evolution" in their music. Åkerfeldt stated, "I can't believe it, but, fuck, we're celebrating 20 years. I've been in this band ever since I was 16. It's insane." A special edition of "Blackwater Park" was released in March 2010 to coincide with the tour.

In September 2010, Mikael Åkerfeldt stated that he was writing for a new Opeth album. The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on January 31, 2011, at the Atlantis/Metronome studios in Stockholm, once again with <a href="Jens%20Bogren">Jens Bogren</a> (engineering) and <a href="Steven%20Wilson">Steven Wilson</a> from Porcupine Tree as co-producer.

Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011, Opeth announced that Per Wiberg was relieved of his duties in the band.
In the press statement, Mikael Åkerfeldt explained the decision, saying, "Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this came as no surprise to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could say it was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that."

Opeth's tenth album, "<a href="Heritage%20%28Opeth%20album%29">Heritage</a>", was released on September 14, 2011, to generally favorable reviews. The album sold 19,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the "Billboard 200" chart. "Heritage" debuted at number four in the band's native country of Sweden.

"Heritage" became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more <a href="progressive%20metal">progressive</a> style than previous albums from the band, something that Åkerfeldt had been wanting to do for some time.

The first two songs Åkerfeldt wrote for "Heritage" were in the style of "<a href="Watershed%20%28Opeth%20album%29">Watershed</a>". After hearing the songs for the first time, <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20M%C3%A9ndez">Martín Méndez</a> told Åkerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for "Heritage", Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old. In a review for <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>, Thom Jurek called "Heritage" the band's most adventurous album, describing the songs as "drenched in instrumental interludes, knotty key and chord changes, shifting time signatures, clean vocals, and a keyboard-heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons, Rhodes pianos, and Hammond organs".

Opeth supported "Heritage" with a tour that would last for over 200 tour dates. The tour was the band's first with new keyboardist, <a href="Joakim%20Svalberg">Joakim Svalberg</a>, who played on the opening track of the album. During the tour, Opeth played with bands such as <a href="Katatonia">Katatonia</a>, <a href="Pain%20of%20Salvation">Pain of Salvation</a>, <a href="Mastodon%20%28band%29">Mastodon</a>, <a href="Ghost%20%28Swedish%20band%29">Ghost</a> and <a href="Anathema%20%28band%29">Anathema</a> all over the world in countries such as the United States, Europe, Turkey, India, Japan, Greece, Israel, Latin America and Sweden. The tour concluded with "Melloboat 2013".

On August 26, 2014, Opeth released its eleventh studio album, titled "<a href="Pale%20Communion">Pale Communion</a>". Åkerfeldt began working on new material as far back as August 2012. In January 2014 he stated, "We've been looking at [tracking the next album at] <a href="Rockfield%20Studios">Rockfield Studios</a> in Wales where <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a> recorded "<a href="Bohemian%20Rhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>", but we haven't made a decision yet, but it will be an expensive album. There's a lot going on, lots of string arrangements that we haven't had in the past." Despite fearing that the band's new musical direction would split Opeth's fanbase, when asked if it will it be heavier or softer than "Heritage", Åkerfeldt said, "Maybe a little bit heavier, not death metal heavy, but hard rock/heavy metal heavy. There's also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars, but also more sinister-sounding riffs." Åkerfeldt also produced the new album which will include <a href="string%20instrument">string instrument</a>ation, something that he became interested in doing when working on "<a href="Storm%20Corrosion%20%28album%29">Storm Corrosion</a>". The band members in Opeth felt rejuvenated after creating "Heritage" which resulted in closer relationships between them.

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" reviewed "Pale Communion" positively, calling it "strange, intricate prog-metal genius" somewhat flawed by Åkerfeldt's indulgent vocal styling. The album saw Opeth's highest chart positions in the history of the band with "Pale Communion" debuting at number 19 in the US, number 3 in Sweden, and number 14 in the United Kingdom. It sold 13,000 copies in its first week of release in the US.

"Pale Communion" was supported with more touring from Opeth. In 2015, Opeth played several concerts to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band. At these special shows, the band was doing two sets. The first set is 2005's "<a href="Ghost%20Reveries">Ghost Reveries</a>" as a ten-year anniversary celebration of the album. The second set spanned the rest of the band's career, celebrating their 25th anniversary. Åkerfeldt expressed excitement for the concerts.

On June 15, 2016, Nuclear Blast Entertainment announced the signing of Opeth. Three days later, on June 18, Opeth released a 30-second teaser for their new album, "<a href="Sorceress%20%28Opeth%20album%29">Sorceress</a>". A month later, on July 18, the band confirmed the album would be released on September 30, in addition to revealing the artwork and track list. Mikael Åkerfeldt described it as, "A fine little record. My favorite in our discography right now. Of course. That's how it should be, right? It's both fresh and old, both progressive and rehashed. Heavy and calm. Just the way we like it." The album was the first project under Moderbolaget Records, a joint venture between Opeth and Nuclear Blast. Moderbolaget means "the parent company" in Swedish.

On July 25, 2016, in the build up towards the album release, the band posted the first Sorceress: Studio Report on their YouTube channel. In the behind-the-scenes studio tour, it is confirmed that the band had returned to Rockfield Studios where they previously recorded "Pale Communion". At the end of the video, there is a 20-second excerpt of a track believed to be from the album featuring heavily down-tuned guitars. On August 1, 2016, the band released a lyric video for the title-track 'Sorceress' on their YouTube channel. On September 4, 2016, Opeth released a lyric video for the second single titled 'Will O the Wisp,' again through their YouTube channel and website. Opeth's video for "Era" was nominated for "Video of the Year" at the 2017 <a href="Prog%20%28magazine%29">Progressive Music Awards</a>, where they ultimately won "International Band of the Year".

On October 2, 2017, Åkerfeldt said he has been thinking about doing something "twisted" and different for the next studio album, which could be released by mid-to-late 2019. On November 20, 2017, guitarist <a href="Fredrik%20%C3%85kesson">Fredrik Åkesson</a> stated that the band will not have any gigs in the upcoming months, until the 2018 summer festivals. During this break the band will focus on writing songs for the new album.. On July 11, 2018, during an interview with FaceCulture, Åkesson said "I've recorded a lot of solos so far. And Mikael [Åkerfeldt] has almost already written 12 songs for the new album, so we have more material than enough for an album".

As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> bands <a href="King%20Crimson">King Crimson</a>, <a href="Yes%20%28band%29">Yes</a>, <a href="Genesis%20%28band%29">Genesis</a>, <a href="Camel%20%28band%29">Camel</a>, <a href="Premiata%20Forneria%20Marconi">P.F.M.</a>, <a href="Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a>, and <a href="Gracious%21">Gracious</a>, and by heavy metal bands such as <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>, <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>, <a href="Death%20%28metal%20band%29">Death</a>, <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, <a href="Deep%20Purple">Deep Purple</a>, <a href="Celtic%20Frost">Celtic Frost</a>, <a href="King%20Diamond">King Diamond</a>, <a href="Morbid%20Angel">Morbid Angel</a>, <a href="Voivod%20%28band%29">Voivod</a>, and, most importantly, <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a>. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's "<a href="Sad%20Wings%20of%20Destiny">Sad Wings of Destiny</a>" (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings "Here Come the Tears" from Judas Priest's third album "<a href="Sin%20After%20Sin">Sin After Sin</a>" (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.

Opeth's distinct sound mixes <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a> with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's "epic, progressive death metal style". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating "the likes of folk, <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="blues">blues</a>, '70s rock, <a href="gothic%20rock">goth</a> and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style." In his review of Opeth's 2001 album "<a href="Blackwater%20Park">Blackwater Park</a>", AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, "Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, <a href="stoner%20rock">stoner rock</a> grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment." Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music:

I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.

More recently, Opeth have abandoned their death metal sound resulting in a mellower progressive rock sound. When talking about "<a href="Heritage%20%28Opeth%20album%29">Heritage</a>", guitarist <a href="Fredrik%20%C3%85kesson">Fredrik Åkesson</a> stated:

In the beginning it took me a little while to get used to the new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done "Heritage". I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think "Heritage" is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.

Vocally, Åkerfeldt shifts between traditional <a href="Death%20growl">death metal vocals</a> for heavy sections, and clean, sometimes whispered or soft-spoken vocals over mellower passages. While his death growls were dominant on early releases, later efforts incorporate more clean vocals, with "Damnation", "Heritage", "Pale Communion" and "Sorceress" featuring only clean singing. Rivadavia noted that "Åkerfeldt's vocals run the gamut from bowel-churning grunts to melodies of chilling beauty—depending on each movement section's mood."

Some artists and bands have cited Opeth as an influence, among which are <a href="Mayan%20%28band%29">Mayan</a> (a project of <a href="Mark%20Jansen">Mark Jansen</a> from <a href="Epica%20%28band%29">Epica</a>), <a href="Luc%20Lemay">Luc Lemay</a> of <a href="Gorguts">Gorguts</a>, <a href="Soen">Soen</a> (a band of former Opeth drummer Martin Lopez), Tor Oddmund Suhrke of <a href="Leprous">Leprous</a>, <a href="Disillusion%20%28band%29">Disillusion</a>, <a href="Caligula%27s%20Horse%20%28band%29">Caligula's Horse</a>, <a href="Klimt%201918">Klimt 1918</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Droste">Daniel Droste</a> of <a href="Ahab%20%28band%29">Ahab</a>, <a href="Becoming%20the%20Archetype">Becoming the Archetype</a>, <a href="Nucleus%20Torn">Nucleus Torn</a>, Alex Vynogradoff of <a href="Kauan">Kauan</a>, <a href="Wastefall">Wastefall</a>, Eric Guenther of <a href="The%20Contortionist">The Contortionist</a>, <a href="Thomas%20MacLean">Thomas MacLean</a> and <a href="To-Mera">To-Mera</a>, <a href="The%20Man-Eating%20Tree">The Man-Eating Tree</a>, <a href="Knight%20Area">Knight Area</a>, <a href="District%20Unknown">District Unknown</a>, <a href="Nahemah%20%28band%29">Nahemah</a>, Vladimir Agafonkin of <a href="Obiymy%20Doschu">Obiymy Doschu</a>, <a href="Schizoid%20Lloyd">Schizoid Lloyd</a>, Maxime Côté of <a href="Catuvolcus%20%28band%29">Catuvolcus</a>, and <a href="Bilocate">Bilocate</a>.

Dark Angel (2000 TV series)

Dark Angel is an American <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> television series that premiered on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on October 3, 2000. Created by <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> and <a href="Charles%20H.%20Eglee">Charles H. Eglee</a>, it starred <a href="Jessica%20Alba">Jessica Alba</a> in her <a href="breakthrough%20role">breakthrough role</a>. Set in 2019, the series chronicles the life of <a href="Max%20Guevara">Max Guevara</a> (Alba), a <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetically enhanced</a> super-soldier who escapes from a covert military facility as a child. In a <a href="post-apocalyptic">post-apocalyptic</a> <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, she tries to lead a normal life while eluding capture by government agents and searching for her brothers and sisters scattered in the aftermath of their escape. "Dark Angel" was the first and only series produced by the company Cameron/Eglee Productions, and was filmed in Vancouver at <a href="Lions%20Gate%20Studios">Lions Gate Studios</a>.

The high-budget <a href="Television%20pilot">pilot episode</a> marked Cameron's television debut and was heavily promoted by Fox, reaching 17.4 million viewers. The first season, which was shown on Tuesday nights in the U.S., received mainly positive reviews and won several awards, including the <a href="People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">People's Choice Award</a> for Favorite New TV Drama. Alba's portrayal of Max also received mostly positive reviews and several awards. For the second season, the show was moved to the less desirable air time of <a href="Friday%20night%20death%20slot">Friday night</a> and received some criticism for new plot elements. It suffered from a drop in ratings, averaging 6 million viewers per episode, and was <a href="cancellation%20%28television%29">canceled</a>.

A series of novels continued the storyline, and a <a href="Dark%20Angel%20%28video%20game%29">video game adaptation</a> was also released. "Dark Angel" is considered to have <a href="Gothic%20fiction">gothic</a> and <a href="Women%27s%20empowerment">female empowerment</a> themes; Max followed a long line of strong female characters in Cameron's work, including <a href="Sarah%20Connor%20%28Terminator%29">Sarah Connor</a> and <a href="Ellen%20Ripley">Ellen Ripley</a>. "Dark Angel" is considered to be part of a wave of shows in the late 1990s and early 2000s that feature strong female characters, alongside "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>", "", and "<a href="La%20Femme%20Nikita">La Femme Nikita</a>."

In 2009, a genetically enhanced nine-year-old female <a href="supersoldier">supersoldier</a> designated as X5-452 (<a href="Geneva%20Locke">Geneva Locke</a>) escapes along with eleven others from a secret U.S. government institution codenamed Manticore where they were born, raised, and trained to be soldiers and <a href="Assassination">assassins</a>. On June 1, 2009, months after X5-452's escape, <a href="terrorist">terrorist</a>s detonate an <a href="Nuclear%20electromagnetic%20pulse">electromagnetic pulse</a> weapon in <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">the atmosphere</a> over the U.S., which destroys the vast majority of <a href="computer">computer</a> and <a href="communication">communication</a> systems, throwing the country into chaos.

Ten years later in 2019, the now 19-year-old X5-452 (<a href="Jessica%20Alba">Jessica Alba</a>), who calls herself Max Guevara, struggles to search for her Manticore brothers and sisters. In the recovering United States which is now barely more than a <a href="developing%20country">developing country</a> she tries to live a relatively normal life and evade capture by Manticore, who wishes to recover their lost asset.
<a href="List%20of%20Dark%20Angel%20characters">Logan Cale</a> (<a href="Michael%20Weatherly">Michael Weatherly</a>), an underground cyber-journalist with the alias Eyes Only, attempts to recruit her to help fight corruption in the post-Pulse world. She initially refuses but accepts after Cale is rendered a <a href="Paraplegia">paraplegic</a> attempting the assignment he was recruiting her for. A romantic interest buds between the two. While assisting Cale, Max also makes a living as a <a href="bicycle%20messenger">bicycle messenger</a> at Jam Pony, a <a href="courier">courier</a> company, along with her friends Original Cindy (<a href="Valarie%20Rae%20Miller">Valarie Rae Miller</a>), Herbal Thought (<a href="Alimi%20Ballard">Alimi Ballard</a>), and Sketchy (<a href="Richard%20Gunn%20%28actor%29">Richard Gunn</a>). Other X5s are periodically introduced, most significantly the unit leader Zack (<a href="William%20Gregory%20Lee">William Gregory Lee</a>). The Manticore hunt for the escaped X5s is led by Colonel Donald Lydecker (<a href="John%20Savage%20%28actor%29">John Savage</a>). Near the end of the season, Lydecker is betrayed by his superior, the even more ruthless Elizabeth Renfro (<a href="Nana%20Visitor">Nana Visitor</a>), and he defects from Manticore. He aids Max and Zack in an assault on Manticore headquarters. Max is badly wounded and captured. Zack, who has also been captured, commits suicide to provide Max with his heart, as she needs an X5 <a href="Heart%20transplantation">heart transplant</a> to survive.

Cale exposes Manticore to the world. Renfro decides to burn the facility to cover up the evidence and is killed in the process. Aided by Joshua (<a href="Kevin%20Durand">Kevin Durand</a>), a transgenic with <a href="Canidae">canine</a> DNA, Max escapes the facility and frees the other transgenics including <a href="Alec%20McDowell">Alec</a> (<a href="Jensen%20Ackles">Jensen Ackles</a>), a fellow X5, who later joins Jam Pony. When Max is reunited with Cale he immediately becomes ill and almost dies. Max discovers that Manticore has infected her with a virus specifically designed to kill Cale, and the two must avoid all physical contact to keep him alive. Max learns that Joshua was the first transgenic created by Sandeman, Manticore's founder. Over the course of the season, it is revealed that a millennia-old breeding cult has bred their own super-soldiers who rival the Manticore-produced transgenics. Ames White (<a href="Martin%20Cummins">Martin Cummins</a>), a government agent tasked with eliminating the freed transgenics, is revealed to be a member of the cult. When a strange message written in Max's genetic code makes an appearance on her skin it is revealed that Sandeman is a renegade from the breeding cult and Ames White is his son. White is still loyal to the cult and hates his father's transgenic creations with a passion. Believing that Max is a threat to the breeding cult's plans they attempt to kill her, but she escapes to Terminal City, an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding. When the police begin to surround Terminal City Max convinces the other transgenics to stand their ground rather than run. The series ends with the military surrounding Terminal City as the residents raise their newly designed flag from one of the buildings, and wait for a possible invasion.

The first season introduced Jessica Alba as the main character <a href="Max%20Guevara">Max Guevara</a> (X5-452), a genetically enhanced transgenic super-soldier who escaped from a government facility named Manticore. She works as a bike messenger for the courier company Jam Pony during the day and as a cat burglar at night. Michael Weatherly played Logan Cale, the show's second most prominent character. Cale is a wealthy cyber-journalist and vigilante who operates under the alias Eyes Only. He recruits Max to assist with his campaign against corruption and crime in return for helping her find information on her fellow Manticore escapees. Main roles were given to several of the couriers at Jam Pony, including Valarie Rae Miller as Cynthia "Original Cindy" McEachin, Richard Gunn as Calvin "Sketchy" Theodore, and Alimi Ballard as Herbal Thought. <a href="J.%20C.%20MacKenzie">J. C. MacKenzie</a> played Reagan "Normal" Ronald, the company's boss, and <a href="Jennifer%20Blanc">Jennifer Blanc</a> played Kendra Maibaum, Max's first roommate, and John Savage played the main antagonist, Col. Donald Lydecker, who is trying to recapture Max and the other Manticore escapees.

The Lydecker character is written out of the series early in the second season, and Herbal Thought and Kendra Maibaum do not appear at all. Season two introduced Kevin Durand as Joshua, an experimental creature from Manticore who has distinct canine facial features. It also introduces Jensen Ackles as Alec McDowell (X5-494), an X5 who has a romantic interest in Max, and <a href="Ashley%20Scott">Ashley Scott</a> as Asha Barlow, a resistance fighter who has a romantic interest in Cale. Martin Cummins portrayed the season's main antagonist Ames White, a <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a> agent tasked with destroying the Manticore escapees.

Following his success with the film "<a href="Titanic%20%281997%20film%29">Titanic</a>", director <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> teamed up with <a href="Charles%20H.%20Eglee">Charles H. Eglee</a> with whom he had previously worked on projects including "". The two formed a production company, Cameron/Eglee Productions, and began working on ideas for a television series. They considered several options, including a family drama, before deciding on the idea of "Dark Angel". Cameron said they began with the idea that Max would be a genetic construct who "looked normal on the outside but was different on the cellular, genetic level. We explore what that could mean." Cameron was influenced by the <a href="manga">manga</a> "<a href="Battle%20Angel%20Alita">Battle Angel Alita</a>", which he was originally intending to after completing "Dark Angel".

"Dark Angel" would be the first and only work by Cameron/Eglee Productions. Max followed a long line of strong female characters in Cameron's work, including <a href="Sarah%20Connor%20%28Terminator%29">Sarah Connor</a> and <a href="Ellen%20Ripley">Ellen Ripley</a>. Cameron said "it's a win/win situation" as "women respond to characters who appear strong and capable" and young male audiences "want to see girls kick ass". Later they decided to set the series in a post-social collapse world, saying that the hysteria surrounding <a href="Year%202000%20problem">Y2K</a> served as inspiration; in the series, an <a href="electromagnetic%20pulse">electromagnetic pulse</a> previously destroyed every computer in the United States. <a href="Working%20title">Working title</a>s for the series included "Experimental Girl" and "Maximum Girl". The project marked Cameron's television debut; he worked mainly as a writer and executive producer for the series.

More than a thousand young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying "she had her head down, she was reading out of the script ... she didn't present herself all that well. But there was something about the way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but kept coming back to Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backward, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.

The two-hour premiere episode cost up to $10 million to produce, and Cameron reportedly "brought the pilot in on time and on budget". Subsequent episodes had a considerably smaller budget. Fox spent heavily on the promotional campaign for the premiere, paying for theatrical trailers, billboards, and <a href="guerilla%20marketing">guerilla marketing</a>. Cameron took a "very basic view" of the show's chance of success, saying: "If it flies, it flies. If it doesn't, it doesn't ... If people connect with it, which I hope they will, fine. If we don't find an audience, we deserve to be off the air. It's that simple." Eglee admitted the series had been "routinely over budget" in the first season, and feared that this would be a factor in whether or not the show was renewed for a second season, though Cameron downplayed these concerns.

Fox "just barely" renewed the series for a second season. The budget for episodes in season two was $1.3 million each. After the intended director of the final episode did not work out, Cameron decided to step in and fill the position. He did this partially for the experience but also to show the network the potential for a third season. It was his first experience directing a TV drama.

The producers were initially told a third season had been approved, but two days later Fox informed them that the series had been canceled. 

"Dark Angel" was set in Seattle, and filmed in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, at <a href="Lions%20Gate%20Studios">Lions Gate Studios</a>. Other filming locations included the <a href="Vancouver%20Art%20Gallery">Vancouver Art Gallery</a>, as well as <a href="Buntzen%20Lake">Buntzen Lake</a> and <a href="Riverview%20Hospital%20%28Coquitlam%29">Riverview Hospital</a>, also in British Columbia.

In the DVD commentary for "Freak Nation", the series finale, Charles H. Eglee explained what had been planned for season three. The intention was to bring together the storylines of seasons one ("Manticore") and two ("Breeding Cult") and reveal the mythology of "Dark Angel". The season would reveal that thousands of years ago, Earth passed through a comet's tail which deposited viral material that killed 97% of the human race. The breeding cult preserved the survivors' genetic immunity so that when the comet returned, only members of the cult would survive. Sandeman, a cult member, and Max's creator betrayed the cult and decided to give this genetic immunity to the rest of humanity through Max, who would be the savior of the human race. There were multiple ideas on how to spread Max's immunity, including an air burst that would disperse the antibody through the atmosphere, or attaching the immunity to a <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a> virus (Eglee detailed how a scene would show Original Cindy sneezing as part of the beginning of the immunity spread). This storyline is expanded upon in the final "Dark Angel" novel "After the Dark" though when the comet returns nobody falls ill, and it is believed that the cult simply had a false prediction.

The first season premiered in the United States on Tuesday, October 3, 2000, from 9:00 pm until 11:00 pm. Fox had to obtain agreements from its affiliates to broadcast past 10:00 pm, as most of them air local news programs at this time. In subsequent weeks the show aired from 9:00 pm till 10:00 pm Tuesdays. During its first season, the show was preempted on several occasions, including by the <a href="2000%20World%20Series">2000 World Series</a>, the <a href="Billboard%20Music%20Awards">Billboard Music Awards</a> and coverage of the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">presidential election</a>. The frequent preemptions became a running joke on the set. "Dark Angel's" scheduled air time put it in direct competition with "<a href="Angel%20%281999%20TV%20series%29">Angel</a>" on <a href="The%20WB">The WB</a>. Critics debated which of the similarly named shows would dominate the time-slot. Jonathon Storm from "<a href="Philadelphia%20Media%20Network">Philadelphia Media Network</a>" believed that "Dark Angel" would prove victorious, while Brad Adgate, a research director at "Horizon Media", predicted that "Dark Angel" would only initially take the lead in the ratings, as "Angel's" strong fanbase would prevail in the long run. Brad Turrell, executive vice-president of Network Communication for the "WB" conceded that the heavy promotion for "Dark Angel" would give it higher initial ratings at first but believed that as "Angel" was a "better show" it would not be affected long-term. Concerned that there might be confusion between the two shows, the "WB" took out a full page ad in "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>", which read "There is only ONE. <a href="David%20Boreanaz">David Boreanaz</a> is ANGEL." "Angel" won the time slot when Fox moved the broadcast time of "Dark Angel" to 8:00 pm on Fridays for its second season, where it preceded the new series "<a href="Pasadena%20%28TV%20series%29">Pasadena</a>".

The final episode of the series aired on May 3, 2002, as a special 90-minute episode. "Dark Angel" has been syndicated on <a href="Syfy">Syfy</a> and the <a href="El%20Rey%20Network">El Rey Network</a> in the United States and on <a href="E4%20%28channel%29">E4</a> and the <a href="Horror%20Channel">Horror Channel</a> in the UK.

The <a href="film%20score">score</a> for the "Dark Angel" pilot was composed and conducted by <a href="Joel%20McNeely">Joel McNeely</a>. The pilot score track "Bicycle Ride" was used in the end credits for the duration of the series. The pilot score was released in full as part of the original publicity press kit, titled "Dark Angel: Complete Score from the Dark Angel Pilot". The 37-track CD was for promotional use only and not for resale. McNeely returned to score the entire series, making frequent use of "grumbling <a href="timpani">timpani</a> rolls, bass drum beats and shrill brass and violin crescendos that familiarly sketch the action arcs of the narrative." Traditional orchestral elements are integrated with innovative electronic sounds and female vocals to create a sense of Max's "otherworldliness", "haunting wind chimes, pseudo-Orientalist refrains and extenuated high-pitched eerie sounds" evoke Max's super-human abilities, and "driving hip hop bass beats with heavy percussive effects [and] high-pitched feedback and reverberation" convey Max's struggles with violence and her memories of Manticore. The theme song for the series was composed by <a href="Chuck%20D">Chuck D</a> and <a href="Gary%20G-Wiz">Gary G-Wiz</a>. Both McNeely and G-Wiz cited "Dark Angel" as an opportunity to push sonic boundaries; G-Wiz stated that Eglee and music supervisor Randy Gerston kept calling him and telling him to make the theme song "crazier". McNeely said scoring the series was "like the difference between jazz and classical music. I'm a jazz player, so "Dark Angel" is as free form and as weird as we want to get."

A soundtrack album consisting of hip hop and R&B songs was released on April 23, 2002, through <a href="Artemis%20Records">Artemis Records</a>. Eglee explained that he and Cameron began with the idea that they could do a "hip hop youth ensemble thing", noting that "hip hop had become the dominant influence in the country [and] in the world" and that they saw an opportunity to give the future of "Dark Angel" the soundtrack of contemporary American popular culture. In the soundtrack's liner notes, Eglee writes:Reminiscent of another time and place ... that part of the Bronx in the late 1970s known as <a href="Fort%20Apache%20%28hostile%20place%29">Fort Apache</a>: a place that for <a href="White%20Americans">white America</a>, defined lack and limitation, violence and hopelessness. What white Americans couldn't see or hear then was the beautiful thing being birthed there, which, years later, would come to be known as Hip Hop. ... This album remembers the foundations of Hip Hop as it contemplates its future. Randy Gerston said that because of the near future setting of the series, he avoided any major hit songs as these would not sound futuristic. This gave them the opportunity to discover new talent instead. The album features predominately female hip hop and <a href="neo%20soul">neo soul</a> artists whose lyrics typically "focus on the expression of female agency and power – particularly with regard to sexuality." It peaked at No. 50 on the <a href="Top%20Independent%20Albums">Top Independent Albums</a> chart. Jason Birchmeier of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> gave the soundtrack three out of five stars. He noted the lack of major artists on the album and commented that it "seems to be a female-orientated soundtrack, perhaps because of the show's female lead character". Birchmeier said many of the songs were "quite impressive" and that it "exceeds your expectations for a television show soundtrack".

"Dark Angel" is considered to be in the <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> genre. Writing in "Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture", Lorna Jowett considered "Dark Angel" to be a "hybrid of science fiction, <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic</a>, and <a href="Action%20fiction">action</a>" which incorporated forms and themes from all three genres. Jowett compared "Dark Angel" to the Gothic novel "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>", saying that Max's genetic engineering makes her a "postmodern Frankenstein's monster, blurring boundaries between human and monster". Kathleen McConnell in "Gothic Studies" also compared Max's unconventional conception to Frankenstein's monster, and cited several other Gothic themes in the series. She states that Max fits the model of a Gothic heroine who "ostensibly appear[s] to be conforming to their accepted role within the <a href="patriarchy">patriarchy</a> but who actually subvert the father's power at every possible occasion." In her book "Post-feminist Impasses in Popular Heroine Television", Alison Horbury theorizes that "Dark Angel", along with the shows "<a href="Alias%20%28TV%20series%29">Alias</a>", "<a href="La%20Femme%20Nikita">La Femme Nikita</a>", and "<a href="Dollhouse%20%28TV%20series%29">Dollhouse</a>" have themes of abduction, physical and symbolic <a href="rape">rape</a>, motherlessness, and the discovery of a sister.

Several academics have considered "Dark Angel" to be part of a wave of shows in the late 90s and early 2000s including "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>", "", and "La Femme Nikita" that feature strong female characters. Writing in "Science Fiction Film & Television", Clarice Butkus noted Max has been considered to be a "distinctly millennial post-<a href="Third-wave%20feminism">third-wave feminist</a> warrior. She also felt that Max's relationship and dialogue with Original Cindy, an <a href="African%20American">African American</a> lesbian, conveyed <a href="Women%27s%20empowerment">female empowerment</a>. For example, Cindy encourages Max not to feel guilt over her sexual behaviour and instead to embrace a traditionally masculine approach to sex. McConnell and Jowett also cited Max as an example of female empowerment; Jowett considered Max to be the "usual postmodern, <a href="postfeminism">postfeminist</a> representation of the female action hero with [at least] a reversal or [at most] a mixture of traditional gender traits."

Butkus stated that "Dark Angel" repeatedly paid homage to the film "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>". Lydecker, the "flawed antagonist" of "Dark Angel" is said to be a transposition of <a href="Rick%20Deckard">Deckard</a>, the "flawed hero" of "Blade Runner". Alec McDowell/X5-494's love interest is named Rachel, believed to be a reference to the <a href="replicant">replicant</a> <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Rachael">Rachael</a>, though in "Dark Angel" it is McDowell and not Rachel who is bio-engineered. His flashbacks of this traumatic relationship use piano music similar to that used in "Blade Runner" to denote memories and a desire for former times. Alec's genetic memory enhancements enable him, with only a few hours practice, to play a detailed piano piece by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a>, the composer originally scripted for the scene in "Blade Runner" where Rachael inexplicably finds herself able to play the piano; both characters are considered to be pre-programmed by state forces to master superhuman skills.

Initial reaction to the series and Max's character was mostly positive, with favorable reviews in "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>". Hal Boedeker of the "<a href="Orlando%20Sentinel">Orlando Sentinel</a>" said: "Television's newest warrior woman possesses skills worthy of <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>, <a href="Xena">Xena</a>, <a href="Emma%20Peel">Emma Peel</a>, and <a href="Wonder%20Woman">Wonder Woman</a>." <a href="Howard%20Rosenberg">Howard Rosenberg</a> said: "If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy, the highly arresting Max would be wiping out the entire planet." However <a href="Joyce%20Millman">Joyce Millman</a> said Max was "little more than lips and ass" and considered the series to be an expensive <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a> music video. "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" ran a negative review of the Pilot episode in October 2000, though in December they listed Alba's portrayal of Max as among the "breakthrough" performances of 2000.

The first episode was behind only "" as the most watched new show of the week, albeit in a week with fewer new shows because of the presidential debate coverage. Fox chose to debut "Dark Angel" instead of airing the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20debates%2C%202000%23First%20Presidential%20Debate%20%E2%80%94%20October%203">first presidential debate</a>, a move which TV analyst Marc Berman praised, saying: "The people who watch the debates aren't the people who'll tune into "Dark Angel" anyway", though he predicted that the premiere's high ratings would not hold up as the show competed against more varied competition in subsequent weeks. It was the tenth most popular show overall that week, attracting 17.4 million viewers. Cameron said he did not know if the broadcast time change for the second season would have a positive or negative effect on the show's ratings, though R. D. Heldenfels of the "<a href="Sun%20Journal%20%28Lewiston%29">Sun Journal</a>" noted the <a href="Friday%20night%20death%20slot">poor ratings of Friday night television</a>, especially the low viewing rates among 18 to 24-year-olds, the age-group that "Dark Angel" was most popular with. The new time slot saw a ratings drop; for the 2001–02 season "Dark Angel" averaged 6 million viewers, ranking number 114 in the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>.

Commenting on the release of the second season, Cynthia Fuchs of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" said the first season of "Dark Angel" was one of the "few straight-up successes, a ratings hit among the coveted 'youth' demographic." She praised the series but clarified: "I'm not getting carried away: Jim Cameron is not going to be making revolutionary art anytime soon." Michael Sauter of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave the first season a B+ and spoke highly of Alba, saying that "for a while [she was] TV's hottest kick-butt heroine". Elka Karl of <a href="Common%20Sense%20Media">Common Sense Media</a> gave the entire series 3 out of 5 stars, saying: "While the dialogue sometimes falls flat, overall the show is well-scripted and well acted, and Alba does an excellent job of carrying the series. Dark Angel isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it is compelling television that teen sci-fi fans will enjoy." While praising the first season, Randy Dankievitch of "<a href="TVOvermind">TVOvermind</a>" labelled the second season "silly", criticizing "dumb stories" like Max's dream episode "Boo", the virus that prevents Logan and Max having physical contact, and the various half-animal Manticore experiments that are revealed.

Writing in his book "The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television", John Kenneth Muir said it was necessary for Cameron to set "Dark Angel" in the future because the prosperity of the U.S. in 2000 "offered little possibility for crime, squalor and other societal problems". While criticizing certain plot elements in the second season as contributing to the show's downfall, Muir said that larger factors in ratings dropping were the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, the <a href="Enron%20scandal">Enron scandal</a>, and the depletion of the U.S. government's surplus, which changed "Dark Angel's" "futuristic vision of recession in a Third-World America" from an interesting, far-fetched premise to a "depressing reminder that things could still get worse".

In 2004, Max was ranked number 17 on "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>"s list of the 25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends, and in 2012, Dave Golder of <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> ranked her number 49 on his list of the 100 sexiest women in sci-fi. In 2009, <a href="AfterEllen">AfterEllen</a> ranked Original Cindy number 6 on their list of the Top 11 Lesbian/<a href="Bisexuality">Bi</a> Sidekicks. In 2015, Kayti Burt of "<a href="Den%20of%20Geek">Den of Geek</a>" included "Dark Angel" at the top of her list of "10 Sci-Fi Shows That Don't Get Enough Love". In 2016, it was recognized that "Dark Angel" was the first American television series to feature an openly transgender actress playing a transgender character. In the season one episode "Out", transgender actress Jessica Crockett portrayed "Louise", a young woman on a date with Normal.

The 2007 film "<a href="Hitman%20%282007%20film%29">Hitman</a>" re-used footage of Max and other Manticore children in training from "Dark Angel". It was used to portray the Hitman protagonist <a href="Agent%2047">Agent 47</a>, a cloned assassin who, like the Manticore children, has a barcode on the back of his head.

In its first season "Dark Angel" won the Favorite Television New Dramatic Series award at the <a href="27th%20People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">27th People's Choice Awards</a>, and was nominated for Best Television by the <a href="International%20Horror%20Guild%20Award">International Horror Guild Award</a>s. The production team was nominated for the Excellence in Production Design Award by the <a href="Art%20Directors%20Guild">Art Directors Guild</a>. Editor Stephen Mark won Best Edited Motion Picture for Commercial Television at the <a href="American%20Cinema%20Editors%23Eddie%20Award">Eddie Awards</a> for the pilot episode, and the pilot was also nominated for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Special%20Visual%20Effects">Outstanding Special Visual Effects</a> for the <a href="53rd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">53rd Primetime Emmy Awards</a> and "Best Visual Effects: Dramatic Series" by the <a href="Leo%20Awards">Leo Awards</a>.

Jessica Alba won Best Actress on Television at the <a href="27th%20Saturn%20Awards">27th Saturn Awards</a>, Breakout Star of the Year at the <a href="TV%20Guide%20Award">TV Guide Award</a>s, Outstanding Actress in a New Television Series at the <a href="ALMA%20Award">ALMA Award</a>s, and Choice Actress at the <a href="2001%20Teen%20Choice%20Awards">2001 Teen Choice Awards</a>. She also received nominations for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Television%20Series%20Drama">Best Actress – Television Series Drama</a> for the <a href="58th%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards">58th Golden Globe Awards</a> and Best Performance in a TV Drama Series – Leading Young Actress for the <a href="22nd%20Young%20Artist%20Awards">22nd Young Artist Awards</a>.

"Dark Angel" was nominated for fewer awards in its second season. It was nominated for Choice Drama/Action Adventure for the <a href="2002%20Teen%20Choice%20Awards">2002 Teen Choice Awards</a>, where Alba was also nominated for Choice Actress, Drama. Alba was also nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Television Series for the ALMA Awards. At the Leo Awards the episode "Boo" received a nomination for Best Visual Effects: Dramatic Series, and David Geddes won Best Cinematography: Dramatic Series for the episode "Two".

<a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20Home%20Entertainment">20th Century Fox Home Entertainment</a> released seasons 1 and 2 of "Dark Angel" on DVD in <a href="DVD%20region%20code">region 1</a> (R1), as well as a dual-coded region 2 and 4 (R2/4) set in 2003, as six-disc sets packaged in cardboard sleeves containing three DVD cases each of two discs. Season 1 was released in R2/4 in February and R1 in May, and season 2 was released in R2/4 in June and R1 in October.

The R1 releases contain several special features, including four episodes with optional commentary in each season, <a href="blooper">blooper</a>s, deleted scenes, and <a href="featurette">featurette</a>s. The R2/4 releases contain no commentaries and fewer other special features, but the episodes are presented in anamorphic widescreen, while R1 releases are fullscreen. Adam Tyner of "<a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a>" gave the R1 first season three out of five stars for audio and video, and three and a half stars for special features. Shannon Nutt of "DVD Talk" gave the R1 second season three stars out of five for audio and video, and two and a half stars for extras, stating: "it appears [to have] a decent number of features, but then you discover the length of each one and really feel short-changed by Fox". She also noted the episode's commentary was mainly by writers and producers, and did not feature James Cameron or any of the actors.

Both seasons were re-released in R1 on June 5, 2007, with slim packaging consisting of one plastic case containing all six discs (which were unchanged in content and cosmetics).

A <a href="Dark%20Angel%20%28video%20game%29">video game of the same name</a> based on the series was developed by <a href="Radical%20Entertainment">Radical Entertainment</a>, published by <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra Entertainment</a> and released for <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> on November 18, 2002, and later on <a href="Xbox">Xbox</a>. Alba and Weatherly voiced their respective characters in the game. Development of the game started before the series was cancelled, and the game was met with mixed to negative reception upon release. Brett Todd of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> gave the game 3.8 out of 10, saying: "Although it's impossible to say whether or not the developers' morale was affected by the cancellation of the series, this third-person action adventure plays like it was cranked out to fulfill a contract" and concluded "the development of this game probably should have been cancelled at the same time as the television series". Duke Ferris from <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> gave the game a 'D+', saying that while fans of "Dark Angel" would enjoy it as it "mirrors an episode of the show almost exactly", anybody else was likely to find it boring.

Three original <a href="novels">novels</a> written by <a href="Max%20Allan%20Collins">Max Allan Collins</a> expand upon the "Dark Angel" television series, with two picking up directly where the series ended, and another serving as a prequel. A companion book, "Dark Angel: The Eyes Only Dossier", was written by D.A. Stern.

The companion book, "Dark Angel: The Eyes Only Dossier", begins with a letter written by Logan Cale during the stand-off at Terminal City. It is addressed to Detective Matt Sung, a recurring character from the series who aides Logan, instructing him that the package he is sending him contains documents pertaining to the four most critical Eyes Only investigations. If he is killed by the potential invasion of Terminal City, Logan wants Sung to carry on the investigations. The rest of the book contains the documents relating to the four investigations.

Edward III of England

Edward III (13 November 1312 – 21 June 1377) was <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a> and <a href="Lord%20of%20Ireland">Lord of Ireland</a> from January 1327 until his death; he is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, <a href="Edward%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Edward II</a>. Edward III transformed the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of 50 years was the second longest in <a href="medieval%20England">medieval England</a> (after that of his great-grandfather <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a>) and saw vital developments in legislation and government, in particular the evolution of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">English parliament</a>, as well as the ravages of the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>.

Edward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was <a href="deposition%20%28politics%29">deposed</a> by his mother, <a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Isabella of France</a>, and her lover <a href="Roger%20Mortimer%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20March">Roger Mortimer</a>. At age seventeen he led a successful <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> against Mortimer, the <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> he declared himself <a href="English%20claim%20to%20the%20French%20throne">rightful heir to the French throne</a> in 1337. This started what became known as the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. Following some initial setbacks, this <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War%20%281337-1360%29">first phase</a> of the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Crécy</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Poitiers%20%281356%29">Poitiers</a> led to the highly favourable <a href="Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%A9tigny">Treaty of Brétigny</a>, in which England made territorial gains, and Edward renounced his claim to the French throne. This phase would become known as the Edwardian War. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.

Edward III was a temperamental man but capable of unusual clemency. He was in many ways a conventional king whose main interest was warfare. Admired in his own time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later <a href="Whig%20historians">Whig historians</a> such as <a href="William%20Stubbs">William Stubbs</a>. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.

Edward was born at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> on 13 November 1312, and was often referred to as Edward of Windsor in his early years. The reign of his father, <a href="Edward%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Edward II</a>, was a particularly problematic period of English history. One source of contention was the king's inactivity, and repeated failure, in the ongoing <a href="First%20War%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">war with Scotland</a>. Another controversial issue was the king's exclusive <a href="patronage">patronage</a> of a small group of royal <a href="favourite">favourite</a>s. The birth of a male heir in 1312 temporarily improved Edward II's position in relation to the baronial opposition. To bolster further the independent prestige of the young prince, the king had him created <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earl of Chester</a> at only twelve days of age.

In 1325, Edward II was faced with a demand from his brother-in-law, <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20France">Charles IV of France</a>, to perform <a href="homage%20%28feudal%29">homage</a> for the English <a href="Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine">Duchy of Aquitaine</a>. Edward was reluctant to leave the country, as discontent was once again brewing domestically, particularly over his relationship with the favourite <a href="Hugh%20Despenser%20the%20Younger">Hugh Despenser the Younger</a>. Instead, he had his son Edward created Duke of Aquitaine in his place and sent him to France to perform the homage. The young Edward was accompanied by his mother <a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Isabella</a>, who was the sister of King Charles, and was meant to negotiate a peace treaty with the French. While in France, Isabella conspired with the exiled <a href="Roger%20Mortimer%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20March">Roger Mortimer</a> to have Edward deposed. To build up diplomatic and military support for the venture, Isabella had her son engaged to the twelve-year-old <a href="Philippa%20of%20Hainault">Philippa of Hainault</a>. An <a href="Invasion%20of%20England%20%281326%29">invasion of England</a> was launched and Edward II's forces deserted him completely. Isabella and Mortimer summoned a <a href="Parliament%20of%201327">parliament</a>, the king was forced to relinquish the throne to his son, who was proclaimed king in London on 25 January 1327. The new king was crowned as Edward III at Westminster Abbey on 1 February at the age of 14.

It was not long before the new reign also met with other problems caused by the central position at court of Roger Mortimer, who was now the "de facto" ruler of England. Mortimer used his power to acquire noble estates and titles, and his unpopularity grew with the humiliating defeat by the Scots at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stanhope%20Park">Battle of Stanhope Park</a> and the ensuing <a href="Treaty%20of%20Edinburgh%E2%80%93Northampton">Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton</a>, signed with the Scots in 1328. Also the young king came into conflict with his guardian. Mortimer knew his position in relation to the king was precarious and subjected Edward to disrespect. The tension increased after Edward and Philippa, who had married at <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a> on 24 January 1328, <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">had a son</a> on 15 June 1330. Eventually, Edward decided to take direct action against Mortimer. Aided by his close companion <a href="William%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">William Montagu</a> and a small number of other trusted men, Edward took Mortimer by surprise at <a href="Nottingham%20Castle">Nottingham Castle</a> on 19 October 1330. Mortimer was executed and Edward III's personal reign began.

Edward III was not content with the peace agreement made in his name, but the renewal of the war with Scotland originated in private, rather than royal initiative. A group of English <a href="magnate">magnate</a>s known as The Disinherited, who had lost land in Scotland by the peace accord, staged an <a href="Second%20War%20of%20Scottish%20Independence%23The%20repelled%20invasion%20of%20Edward%20Balliol%20-%201332">invasion of Scotland</a> and won a great victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dupplin%20Moor">Battle of Dupplin Moor</a> in 1332. They attempted to install <a href="Edward%20Balliol">Edward Balliol</a> as king of Scotland in <a href="David%20II%20of%20Scotland">David II</a>'s place, but Balliol was soon expelled and was forced to seek the help of Edward III. The English king responded by <a href="Capture%20of%20Berwick%20%281333%29">laying siege to</a> the important border town of <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick</a> and defeated a large relieving army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Halidon%20Hill">Battle of Halidon Hill</a>. Edward reinstated Balliol on the throne and received a substantial amount of land in southern Scotland. These victories proved hard to sustain, as forces loyal to David II gradually regained control of the country. In 1338, Edward was forced to agree to a truce with the Scots.

One reason for the change of strategy towards Scotland was a growing concern for the relationship between England and France. As long as Scotland and France were in <a href="Auld%20Alliance">an alliance</a>, the English were faced with the prospect of fighting a war on two fronts. The French carried out raids on English coastal towns, leading to rumours in England of a full-scale French invasion. In 1337, <a href="Philip%20VI%20of%20France">Philip VI</a> confiscated the English king's <a href="Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine">Duchy of Aquitaine</a> and the county of <a href="Ponthieu">Ponthieu</a>. Instead of seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict by paying homage to the French king, as his father had done, Edward responded by <a href="English%20claims%20to%20the%20French%20throne">laying claim</a> to the French crown as the grandson of <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20France">Philip IV</a>. The French rejected this based on the precedents for agnatic succession set in 1316 and 1322. Instead, they upheld the rights of Philip IV's nephew, King Philip VI (an agnatic descendant of the <a href="Capetian%20dynasty">House of France</a>), thereby setting the stage for the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a> (<a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England%23Ancestry">see family tree below</a>). In the early stages of the war, Edward's strategy was to build alliances with other Continental princes. In 1338, <a href="Louis%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Louis IV</a> named Edward vicar-general of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and promised his support. As late as 1373, the <a href="Anglo-Portuguese%20Treaty%20of%201373">Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373</a> established an <a href="Anglo-Portuguese%20Alliance">Anglo-Portuguese Alliance</a>. These measures produced few results; the only major military victory in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sluys">Sluys</a> on 24 June 1340, which secured English control of the <a href="English%20Channel">Channel</a>.

Meanwhile, the fiscal pressure on the kingdom caused by Edward's expensive alliances led to discontent at home. The regency council at home was frustrated by the mounting national debt, while the king and his commanders on the Continent were angered by the failure of the government in England to provide sufficient funds. To deal with the situation, Edward himself returned to England, arriving in London unannounced on 30 November 1340. Finding the affairs of the realm in disorder, he purged the royal administration of a great number of ministers and judges. These measures did not bring domestic stability, and a stand-off ensued between the king and <a href="John%20de%20Stratford">John de Stratford</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, during which Stratford's relatives <a href="Robert%20Stratford">Robert Stratford</a> Bishop of Chichester and <a href="Henry%20de%20Stratford">Henry de Stratford</a> were temporarily stripped of title and imprisoned respectively. Stratford claimed that Edward had violated the laws of the land by arresting royal officers. A certain level of conciliation was reached at the parliament of April 1341. Here Edward was forced to accept severe limitations to his financial and administrative freedom, in return for a grant of taxation. Yet in October the same year, the king repudiated this statute and Archbishop Stratford was politically ostracised. The extraordinary circumstances of the April parliament had forced the king into submission, but under normal circumstances the powers of the king in medieval England were virtually unlimited, a fact that Edward was able to exploit.

Historian <a href="Nicholas%20Rodger">Nicholas Rodger</a> called Edward III's claim to be the "Sovereign of the Seas" into question, arguing there was hardly any <a href="History%20of%20the%20Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> before the reign of <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a> (1413–22). Despite Rodger's view, <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a> had already developed a royal fleet of <a href="galley">galley</a>s and had attempted to establish an administration for these ships and ones which were arrested (privately owned ships pulled into royal/national service). <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a>, his successor, continued this work. Notwithstanding the fact that he, along with his predecessor, had hoped to develop a strong and efficient naval administration, their endeavours produced one that was informal and mostly ad hoc. A formal naval administration emerged during Edward's reign which was composed of lay administrators and headed by William de Clewre, Matthew de Torksey, and John de Haytfield successively with them being titled "Clerk of the King's Ships". Sir <a href="Robert%20de%20Crull">Robert de Crull</a> was the last to fill this position during Edward III's reign and would have the longest tenure in this position. It was during his tenure that Edward's naval administration would become a base for what evolved during the reigns of successors such as <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>'s "Council of Marine" and "Navy Board" and <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>'s "Board of Admiralty". Rodger also argues that for much of the fourteenth century, the French had the upper hand, apart from Sluys in 1340 and, perhaps, off Winchelsea in 1350. Yet, the French never invaded England and France's <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">King John II</a> died in captivity in England. There was a need for an English navy to play a role in this and to handle other matters, such as the insurrection of the Anglo-Irish lords and acts of piracy.

By the early 1340s, it was clear that Edward's policy of alliances was too costly, and yielded too few results. The following years saw more direct involvement by English armies, including in the <a href="Breton%20War%20of%20Succession">Breton War of Succession</a>, but these interventions also proved fruitless at first. Edward defaulted on <a href="Florence">Florentine</a> loans of 1,365,000 <a href="florin">florin</a>s, resulting in the ruin of the lenders.

A major change came in July 1346, when Edward staged a major offensive, sailing for <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> with a force of 15,000 men. His army <a href="Battle%20of%20Caen%20%281346%29">sacked</a> the city of <a href="Caen">Caen</a>, and marched across northern France, to meet up with English forces in <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a>. It was not Edward's initial intention to engage the French army, but at <a href="Cr%C3%A9cy-en-Ponthieu">Crécy</a>, just north of the <a href="Somme%20%28river%29">Somme</a>, he found favourable terrain and decided to fight a pursuing army led by Philip VI. On 26 August, the English army defeated a far larger French army in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Battle of Crécy</a>. Shortly after this, on 17 October, an English army defeated and captured King David II of Scotland at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Neville%27s%20Cross">Battle of Neville's Cross</a>. With his northern borders secured, Edward felt free to continue his major offensive against France, <a href="Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281346%29">laying siege</a> to the town of <a href="Calais">Calais</a>. The operation was the greatest English venture of the Hundred Years' War, involving an army of 35,000 men. The siege started on 4 September 1346, and lasted until the town surrendered on 3 August 1347.

After the fall of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the <a href="Black%20Death%20in%20England">Black Death</a> struck England with full force, killing a third or more of the country's population. This loss of manpower led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Labourers">Ordinance of Labourers</a> in 1349, followed by the <a href="Statute%20of%20Labourers%20of%201351">Statute of Labourers</a> in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as <a href="Lord%20High%20Treasurer">Treasurer</a> <a href="William%20Edington">William Edington</a> and <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Chief Justice</a> <a href="William%20de%20Shareshull">William de Shareshull</a>.

It was not until the mid-1350s that military operations on the Continent were resumed on a large scale. In 1356, Edward's eldest son, <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward, the Black Prince</a>, won an important victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poitiers%20%281356%29">Battle of Poitiers</a>. The greatly outnumbered English forces not only routed the French, but captured the French king, <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II</a> and his youngest son, <a href="Philip%20the%20Bold">Philip</a>. After a succession of victories, the English held great possessions in France, the French king was in English custody, and the French central government had almost totally collapsed. There has been a historical debate as to whether Edward's claim to the French crown originally was genuine, or if it was simply a political ploy meant to put pressure on the French government. Regardless of the original intent, the stated claim now seemed to be within reach. Yet a campaign in 1359, meant to complete the undertaking, was inconclusive. In 1360, therefore, Edward accepted the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%A9tigny">Treaty of Brétigny</a>, whereby he renounced his claims to the French throne, but secured his extended French possessions in full sovereignty.

While Edward's early reign had been energetic and successful, his later years were marked by <a href="inertia">inertia</a>, military failure and political strife. The day-to-day affairs of the state had less appeal to Edward than military campaigning, so during the 1360s Edward increasingly relied on the help of his subordinates, in particular <a href="William%20of%20Wykeham">William Wykeham</a>. A relative upstart, Wykeham was made <a href="Lord%20Privy%20Seal">Keeper of the Privy Seal</a> in 1363 and <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Chancellor</a> in 1367, though due to political difficulties connected with his inexperience, the Parliament forced him to resign the chancellorship in 1371. Compounding Edward's difficulties were the deaths of his most trusted men, some from the 1361–62 recurrence of the plague. <a href="William%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">William Montague, Earl of Salisbury</a>, Edward's companion in the 1330 coup, died as early as 1344. <a href="William%20de%20Clinton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">William de Clinton</a>, who had also been with the king at Nottingham, died in 1354. One of the earls created in 1337, <a href="William%20de%20Bohun%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northampton">William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton</a>, died in 1360, and the next year <a href="Henry%20of%20Grosmont%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Henry of Grosmont</a>, perhaps the greatest of Edward's captains, succumbed to what was probably plague. Their deaths left the majority of the magnates younger and more naturally aligned to the princes than to the king himself.

Increasingly, Edward began to rely on his sons for the leadership of military operations. The king's second son, <a href="Lionel%20of%20Antwerp%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">Lionel of Antwerp</a>, attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous <a href="Hiberno-Norman">Anglo-Irish</a> lords in Ireland. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive <a href="Statutes%20of%20Kilkenny">Statutes of Kilkenny</a> in 1366. In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Brétigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8 April 1364 <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II</a> died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to raise his own ransom at home. He was followed by the vigorous <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V</a>, who enlisted the help of the capable <a href="Constable%20of%20France">Constable</a> <a href="Bertrand%20du%20Guesclin">Bertrand du Guesclin</a>. In 1369, the French war started anew, and Edward's younger son <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">John of Gaunt</a> was given the responsibility of a military campaign. The effort failed, and with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375, the great English possessions in France were reduced to only the coastal towns of <a href="Calais">Calais</a>, <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, and <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>.

Military failure abroad, and the associated fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent at home. The problems came to a head in the parliament of 1376, the so-called <a href="Good%20Parliament">Good Parliament</a>. The parliament was called to grant taxation, but the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">House of Commons</a> took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Chamberlain</a> <a href="William%20Latimer%2C%204th%20Baron%20Latimer">William Latimer</a> and <a href="Lord%20Steward">Steward of the Household</a> <a href="John%20Neville%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Neville%20de%20Raby">John Neville</a> were dismissed from their positions. Edward's mistress, <a href="Alice%20Perrers">Alice Perrers</a>, who was seen to hold far too much power over the ageing king, was banished from court. Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and <a href="Edmund%20Mortimer%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20March">Edmund de Mortimer, Earl of March</a>, was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government. Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of parliament, but at its <a href="Bad%20Parliament">next convocation</a>, in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.

Edward did not have much to do with any of this; after around 1375 he played a limited role in the government of the realm. Around 29 September 1376 he fell ill with a large <a href="abscess">abscess</a>. After a brief period of recovery in February 1377, the king died of a stroke at Sheen on 21 June. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">King Richard II</a>, son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince himself had died on 8 June 1376.

The middle years of Edward's reign were a period of significant legislative activity. Perhaps the best-known piece of legislation was the <a href="Statute%20of%20Labourers%20of%201351">Statute of Labourers of 1351</a>, which addressed the labour shortage problem caused by the <a href="Black%20Death%20in%20England">Black Death</a>. The statute fixed wages at their pre-plague level and checked peasant mobility by asserting that lords had first claim on their men's services. In spite of concerted efforts to uphold the statute, it eventually failed due to competition among landowners for labour. The law has been described as an attempt "to legislate against the law of <a href="supply%20and%20demand">supply and demand</a>", which made it doomed to fail. Nevertheless, the labour shortage had created a community of interest between the smaller landowners of the House of Commons and the greater landowners of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. The resulting measures angered the peasants, leading to the <a href="English%20peasants%27%20revolt%20of%201381">Peasants' Revolt</a> of 1381.

The reign of Edward III coincided with the so-called <a href="Avignon%20Papacy">Babylonian Captivity</a> of the papacy at <a href="Avignon">Avignon</a>. During the wars with France, opposition emerged in England against perceived injustices by a papacy largely controlled by the French crown. Papal taxation of the English Church was suspected to be financing the nation's enemies, while the practice of provisions – the Pope providing benefices for clerics – caused resentment in the English population. The statutes of <a href="Statute%20of%20Provisors">Provisors</a> and <a href="Praemunire">Praemunire</a>, of 1350 and 1353 respectively, aimed to amend this by banning papal benefices, as well as limiting the power of the papal court over English subjects. The statutes did not sever the ties between the king and the Pope, who were equally dependent upon each other.

Other legislation of importance includes the <a href="Treason%20Act%201351">Treason Act 1351</a>. It was precisely the harmony of the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime. Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning the <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justices of the Peace</a>. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices had been given the power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of <a href="felony">felony</a>. With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.

<a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> as a representative institution was already well established by the time of Edward III, but the reign was nevertheless central to its development. During this period, membership in the English <a href="baron">baron</a>age, formerly a somewhat indistinct group, became restricted to those who received a personal <a href="Hereditary%20peer%23Writs%20of%20summons">summons</a> to parliament. This happened as parliament gradually developed into a <a href="Bicameralism">bicameral</a> institution, composed of a <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> and a <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">House of Commons</a>. Yet it was not in the upper, but in the lower house that the greatest changes took place, with the expanding political role of the Commons. Informative is the <a href="Good%20Parliament">Good Parliament</a>, where the Commons for the first time – albeit with noble support – were responsible for precipitating a political crisis. In the process, both the procedure of <a href="impeachment">impeachment</a> and the office of the <a href="List%20of%20Speakers%20of%20the%20English%20House%20of%20Commons">Speaker</a> were created. Even though the political gains were of only temporary duration, this parliament represented a watershed in English political history.

The political influence of the Commons originally lay in their right to grant taxes. The financial demands of the Hundred Years' War were enormous, and the king and his ministers tried different methods of covering the expenses. The king had a steady income from <a href="Crown%20Estate">crown lands</a>, and could also take up substantial loans from Italian and domestic financiers. To finance warfare on Edward III's scale, the king had to resort to taxation of his subjects. Taxation took two primary forms: <a href="Tax">levy</a> and customs. The levy was a grant of a proportion of all moveable property, normally a tenth for towns and a fifteenth for farmland. This could produce large sums of money, but each such levy had to be approved by parliament, and the king had to prove the necessity. The customs therefore provided a welcome supplement, as a steady and reliable source of income. An "ancient duty" on the export of wool had existed since 1275. <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a> had tried to introduce an additional duty on wool, but this unpopular "<a href="maltolt">maltolt</a>", or "unjust exaction", was soon abandoned. Then, from 1336 onwards, a series of schemes aimed at increasing royal revenues from wool export were introduced. After some initial problems and discontent, it was agreed through the <a href="Statute%20of%20the%20Staple">Ordinance of the Staple</a> of 1353 that the new customs should be approved by parliament, though in reality they became permanent.

Through the steady taxation of Edward III's reign, parliament – and in particular the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to be just, the king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present <a href="petition">petition</a>s for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.

Central to Edward III's policy was reliance on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration. While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage, Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects. Both Edward I and Edward II had been limited in their policy towards the nobility, allowing the creation of few new peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III's reign. The young king reversed this trend when, in 1337, as a preparation for the imminent war, he created six new <a href="earl">earl</a>s on the same day. At the same time, Edward expanded the ranks of the peerage upwards, by introducing the new title of <a href="duke">duke</a> for close relatives of the king. Furthermore, Edward bolstered the sense of community within this group by the creation of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, probably in 1348. A plan from 1344 to revive the <a href="Round%20Table%20%28Camelot%29">Round Table</a> of <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a> never came to fruition, but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter. Edward's wartime experiences during the Crécy campaign (1346–7) seem to have been a determining factor in his abandonment of the Round Table project. It has been argued that the total warfare tactics employed by the English at Crécy in 1346 were contrary to Arthurian ideals and made Arthur a problematic paradigm for Edward III, especially at the time of the institution of the Garter. There are no formal references to King Arthur and the Round Table in the surviving early fifteenth-century copies of the Statutes of the Garter, but the Garter Feast of 1358 did involve a round table game. Thus there was some overlap between the projected Round Table fellowship and the actualized Order of the Garter. <a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a> tells of how the young <a href="Joan%20of%20Kent">Joan of Kent</a>, Countess of Salisbury – allegedly the king's favourite at the time – accidentally dropped her <a href="garter%20%28stockings%29">garter</a> at a ball at Calais. King Edward responded to the ensuing ridicule of the crowd by tying the garter around his own knee with the words "<a href="honi%20soit%20qui%20mal%20y%20pense">honi soit qui mal y pense</a>" – shame on him who thinks ill of it.

This reinforcement of the aristocracy must be seen in conjunction with the war in France, as must the emerging sense of national identity. Just as the war with Scotland had done, the fear of a French invasion helped strengthen a sense of national unity, and nationalise the aristocracy that had been largely Anglo-Norman since the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest</a>. Since the time of Edward I, popular myth suggested that the French planned to extinguish the English language, and as his grandfather had done, Edward III made the most of this scare. As a result, the English language experienced a strong revival; in 1362, a <a href="Statute%20of%20Pleading">Statute of Pleading</a> ordered the English language to be used in law courts, and the year after, Parliament was for the first time opened in English. At the same time, the vernacular saw a revival as a literary language, through the works of <a href="William%20Langland">William Langland</a>, <a href="John%20Gower">John Gower</a> and especially "<a href="The%20Canterbury%20Tales">The Canterbury Tales</a>" by <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>. Yet the extent of this <a href="Anglicisation">Anglicisation</a> must not be exaggerated. The statute of 1362 was in fact written in the French language and had little immediate effect, and parliament was opened in that language as late as 1377. The Order of the Garter, though a distinctly English institution, included also foreign members such as <a href="John%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">John IV, Duke of Brittany</a> and Sir <a href="Robert%20de%20Namur">Robert of Namur</a>. Edward III – himself bilingual – viewed himself as legitimate king of both England and France, and could not show preferential treatment for one part of his domains over another.

Edward III enjoyed unprecedented popularity in his own lifetime, and even the troubles of his later reign were never blamed directly on the king himself. Edward's contemporary <a href="Jean%20Froissart">Jean Froissart</a> wrote in his <a href="Froissart%27s%20Chronicles">"Chronicles"</a> that "His like had not been seen since the days of King Arthur". This view persisted for a while but, with time, the image of the king changed. The <a href="Whig%20history">Whig</a> historians of a later age preferred constitutional reform to foreign conquest and accused Edward of ignoring his responsibilities to his own nation. In the words of <a href="William%20Stubbs">Bishop Stubbs</a>:

Influential as Stubbs was, it was long before this view was challenged. In a 1960 article, titled "Edward III and the Historians", <a href="May%20McKisack">May McKisack</a> pointed out the <a href="Teleology">teleological</a> nature of Stubbs' judgement. A medieval king could not be expected to work towards some future ideal of a parliamentary monarchy as if it were good in itself; rather, his role was a pragmatic one—to maintain order and solve problems as they arose. At this, Edward III excelled. Edward had also been accused of endowing his younger sons too liberally and thereby promoting dynastic strife culminating in the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>. This claim was rejected by <a href="K.B.%20McFarlane">K.B. McFarlane</a>, who argued that this was not only the common policy of the age, but also the best. Later biographers of the king such as Mark Ormrod and <a href="Ian%20Mortimer%20%28historian%29">Ian Mortimer</a> have followed this historiographical trend. The older negative view has not completely disappeared; as recently as 2001, <a href="Norman%20Cantor">Norman Cantor</a> described Edward III as an "avaricious and sadistic thug" and a "destructive and merciless force."

From what is known of Edward's character, he could be impulsive and temperamental, as was seen by his actions against Stratford and the ministers in 1340/41. At the same time, he was well known for his clemency; Mortimer's <a href="Roger%20de%20Mortimer%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20March">grandson</a> was not only absolved, but came to play an important part in the French wars, and was eventually made a Knight of the Garter. Both in his religious views and his interests, Edward was a conventional man. His favourite pursuit was the art of war and, in this, he conformed to the medieval notion of good kingship. As a warrior he was so successful that one modern military historian has described him as the greatest general in English history. He seems to have been unusually devoted to his wife, <a href="Philippa%20of%20Hainault">Queen Philippa</a>. Much has been made of Edward's sexual licentiousness, but there is no evidence of any infidelity on the king's part before <a href="Alice%20Perrers">Alice Perrers</a> became his lover, and by that time the queen was already terminally ill. This devotion extended to the rest of the family as well; in contrast to so many of his predecessors, Edward never experienced opposition from any of his five adult sons.

Edward's claim on the French throne was based on his descent from King <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20France">Philip IV of France</a>, through his mother <a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Isabella</a>.

George II of Great Britain

George II (George Augustus; ; 30 October / 9 November 1683 – 25 October 1760) was <a href="King%20of%20Great%20Britain">King of Great Britain</a> and <a href="King%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, Duke of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Brunswick-Lüneburg</a> (<a href="Electorate%20of%20Hanover">Hanover</a>) and a <a href="prince-elector">prince-elector</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> from 11 June 1727 (<a href="Old%20Style%20and%20New%20Style%20dates">O.S.</a>) until his death in 1760.

George was the last <a href="List%20of%20British%20monarchs">British monarch</a> born outside Great Britain: he was born and brought up in <a href="northern%20Germany">northern Germany</a>. His grandmother, <a href="Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Sophia of Hanover</a>, became second in line to the British throne after about 50 Catholics higher in line were excluded by the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a> and the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">Acts of Union 1707</a>, which restricted the succession to Protestants. After the deaths of Sophia and <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Anne, Queen of Great Britain</a>, in 1714, his father <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a>, Elector of Hanover, inherited the British throne. In the first years of his father's reign as king, George was associated with opposition politicians, until they rejoined the governing party in 1720.

As king from 1727, George exercised little control over British domestic policy, which was largely controlled by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a>. As elector, he spent twelve summers in Hanover, where he had more direct control over government policy. He had a difficult relationship with his eldest son, <a href="Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Frederick</a>, who supported the parliamentary opposition. During the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a>, George participated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dettingen">Battle of Dettingen</a> in 1743, and thus became the last British monarch to lead an army in battle. In 1745, supporters of the Catholic claimant to the British throne, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a> ("The Old Pretender"), led by James's son <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Stuart">Charles Edward Stuart</a> ("The Young Pretender" or "Bonnie Prince Charlie"), attempted and failed to depose George in the <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201745">last of the Jacobite rebellions</a>. Frederick died unexpectedly in 1751, nine years before his father, so George II was ultimately succeeded by his grandson, <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a>.

For two centuries after George II's death, history tended to view him with disdain, concentrating on his mistresses, short temper, and boorishness. Since then, most scholars have reassessed his legacy and conclude that he held and exercised influence in foreign policy and military appointments.

George was born in the city of <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a> in Germany, and was the son of George Louis, Hereditary Prince of <a href="Electorate%20of%20Hanover">Brunswick-Lüneburg</a> (later King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I of Great Britain</a>), and his wife, <a href="Sophia%20Dorothea%20of%20Celle">Sophia Dorothea of Celle</a>. His sister, <a href="Sophia%20Dorothea%20of%20Hanover">Sophia Dorothea</a>, was born when he was three years old. Both of George's parents committed adultery, and in 1694 their marriage was dissolved on the pretext that Sophia had abandoned her husband. She was confined to <a href="Ahlden%20House">Ahlden House</a> and denied access to her two children, who probably never saw their mother again.

George spoke only French, the language of diplomacy and the court, until the age of four, after which he was taught German by one of his tutors, Johann Hilmar Holstein. In addition to French and German, he was also schooled in English and Italian, and studied genealogy, military history, and battle tactics with particular diligence.

George's <a href="Cousin%23Cousin%20chart">second cousin once removed</a>, <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>, ascended the thrones of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> in 1702. She had no surviving children, and by the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">English Parliament</a> designated Anne's closest Protestant <a href="Consanguinity">blood relations</a>, George's grandmother <a href="Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Sophia</a> and her descendants, as Anne's heirs in England and Ireland. Consequently, after his grandmother and father, George was third in line to succeed Anne in two of her three realms. He was naturalized as an English subject in 1705 by the <a href="Sophia%20Naturalization%20Act%201705">Sophia Naturalization Act</a>, and in 1706, he was made a <a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Garter">Knight of the Garter</a> and created <a href="Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Duke and Marquess of Cambridge</a>, Earl of Milford Haven, Viscount Northallerton, and Baron Tewkesbury in the <a href="Peerage%20of%20England">Peerage of England</a>. England and Scotland <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">united in 1707</a> to form the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>, and jointly accepted the succession as laid down by the English Act of Settlement.

George's father did not want his son to enter into a loveless arranged marriage as he had, and wanted him to have the opportunity of meeting his bride before any formal arrangements were made. Negotiations from 1702 for the hand of Princess <a href="Hedvig%20Sophia%20of%20Sweden">Hedvig Sophia of Sweden</a>, Dowager Duchess and regent of <a href="Holstein-Gottorp">Holstein-Gottorp</a>, came to nothing. In June 1705, under the false name of "Monsieur de Busch", George visited the <a href="Principality%20of%20Ansbach">Ansbach</a> court at their summer residence in Triesdorf to investigate "incognito" a marriage prospect: <a href="Caroline%20of%20Ansbach">Caroline of Ansbach</a>, the former ward of his aunt <a href="Sophia%20Charlotte%20of%20Hanover">Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia</a>. The English envoy to Hanover, <a href="Edmund%20Poley">Edmund Poley</a>, reported that George was so taken by "the good character he had of her that he would not think of anybody else". A marriage contract was concluded by the end of July. On 22 August / 2 September 1705 Caroline arrived in Hanover for her wedding, which was held the same evening in the chapel at <a href="Herrenhausen%20Gardens">Herrenhausen</a>.

George was keen to participate in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">war against France</a> in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, but his father refused permission for him to join the army in an active role until he had a son and heir. In early 1707, George's hopes were fulfilled when Caroline gave birth to a son, <a href="Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Frederick</a>. In July, Caroline fell seriously ill with <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, and George caught the infection after staying by her side devotedly during her illness. They both recovered. In 1708, George participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Oudenarde">Battle of Oudenarde</a> in the vanguard of the Hanoverian cavalry; his horse and a colonel immediately beside him were killed, but George survived unharmed. The British commander, <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Marlborough</a>, wrote that George "distinguished himself extremely, charging at the head of and animating by his example [the Hanoverian] troops, who played a good part in this happy victory". Between 1709 and 1713, George and Caroline had three more children, all girls: <a href="Anne%2C%20Princess%20Royal%20and%20Princess%20of%20Orange">Anne</a>, <a href="Princess%20Amelia%20of%20Great%20Britain">Amelia</a>, and <a href="Princess%20Caroline%20of%20Great%20Britain">Caroline</a>.

By 1714, Queen Anne's health had declined, and <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">British Whigs</a>, politicians who supported the Hanoverian succession, thought it prudent for one of the Hanoverians to live in England, to safeguard the Protestant succession on Anne's death. As George was a <a href="peer%20of%20the%20realm">peer of the realm</a> (as Duke of Cambridge), it was suggested that he be summoned to Parliament to sit in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. Both Anne and George's father refused to support the plan, although George, Caroline, and Sophia were all in favour. George did not go. Within the year, both Sophia and Anne were dead, and George's father was king.

George and his father sailed for England from <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> on 16/27 September 1714 and arrived at <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> two days later. The following day, they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession. George was given the title of <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>. Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with their daughters, while Frederick remained in Hanover to be brought up by private tutors. London was like nothing George had seen before; it was 50 times larger than Hanover, and the crowd was estimated at up to one and a half million spectators. George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English, and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English.

In July 1716, the king returned to Hanover for six months, and George was given limited powers, as "Guardian and Lieutenant of the Realm", to govern in his father's absence. He made a <a href="royal%20progress">royal progress</a> through <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a>, <a href="Havant">Havant</a>, <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, and <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a> in southern England. Spectators were allowed to see him dine in public at <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court Palace</a>. An attempt on his life at <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane Theatre</a>, in which one person was shot dead before the assailant was brought under control, boosted his high public profile.

His father distrusted or was jealous of George's popularity, which contributed to the development of a poor relationship between them. The birth in 1717 of George's second son, <a href="Prince%20George%20William%20of%20Great%20Britain">Prince George William</a>, proved to be a catalyst for a family quarrel; the king, supposedly following custom, appointed the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>, the <a href="Thomas%20Pelham-Holles%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Newcastle">Duke of Newcastle</a>, as one of the <a href="baptism">baptism</a>al sponsors of the child. The king was angered when George, who disliked Newcastle, verbally insulted the duke at the christening, which the duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. George and Caroline were temporarily confined to their apartments on the order of the king, who subsequently banished his son from <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>, the king's residence. The Prince and Princess of Wales left court, but their children remained in the care of the king.

George and Caroline missed their children, and were desperate to see them. On one occasion, they secretly visited the palace without the approval of the king; Caroline fainted and George "cried like a child". The king partially relented and permitted them to visit once a week, though he later allowed Caroline unconditional access. The following February, George William died, with his father by his side.

Banned from the palace and shunned by his own father, the Prince of Wales was identified for the next several years with opposition to <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a>'s policies, which included measures designed to increase religious freedom in Great Britain and expand Hanover's German territories at the expense of Sweden. His new London residence, <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester House</a>, became a frequent meeting place for his father's political opponents, including <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Walpole">Sir Robert Walpole</a> and <a href="Charles%20Townshend%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Townshend">Viscount Townshend</a>, who had left the government in 1717.

The king visited Hanover again from May to November 1719. Instead of appointing George to the guardianship, he established a regency council. In 1720, Walpole encouraged the king and his son to reconcile, for the sake of public unity, which they did half-heartedly. Walpole and Townshend returned to political office, and rejoined the ministry. George was soon disillusioned with the terms of the reconciliation; his three daughters who were in the care of the king were not returned and he was still barred from becoming regent during the king's absences. He came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the rapprochement as part of a scheme to regain power. Over the next few years, Caroline and he lived quietly, avoiding overt political activity. They had three more children: <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cumberland">William</a>, <a href="Princess%20Mary%20of%20Great%20Britain">Mary</a>, and <a href="Louise%20of%20Great%20Britain">Louisa</a>, who were brought up at Leicester House and <a href="Richmond%2C%20London">Richmond Lodge</a>, George's summer residence.

In 1721, the economic disaster of the <a href="South%20Sea%20Bubble">South Sea Bubble</a> allowed Walpole to rise to the pinnacle of government. Walpole and his <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the <a href="Tory">Tories</a> would not support the succession laid down in the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement</a>. The power of the Whigs was so great that the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.

George I died on 11/22 June 1727 during one of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from bringing criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed that George II hid the will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.

George II was crowned at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on 11/22 October 1727. The composer <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a> was commissioned to write four new anthems for the coronation, including "<a href="Zadok%20the%20Priest">Zadok the Priest</a>".

It was widely believed that George would dismiss Walpole, who had distressed him by joining his father's government, and replace him with <a href="Spencer%20Compton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Wilmington">Sir Spencer Compton</a>. George asked Compton, rather than Walpole, to write his first speech as king for him, but Compton asked Walpole to draft it. Caroline advised George to retain Walpole, who continued to gain royal favour by securing a generous <a href="civil%20list">civil list</a> (a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king's official expenditure) of £800,000. Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George had little choice but to retain him or risk ministerial instability. Compton was ennobled as Lord Wilmington the following year.

Walpole directed domestic policy, and after the resignation of his brother-in-law Townshend in 1730 also controlled George's foreign policy. Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain, and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior ministers who made the major decisions. Although the king was eager for war in Europe, his ministers were more cautious. The <a href="Anglo-Spanish%20War%20%281727%E2%80%931729%29">Anglo-Spanish War</a> was brought to an end, and George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Polish%20Succession">War of the Polish Succession</a> on the side of the German states. In April 1733, Walpole withdrew an unpopular <a href="excise">excise</a> bill that had gathered strong opposition, including from within his own party. George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill's opponents from their <a href="Court%20%28royal%29%23Court%20officials">court offices</a>.

George II's relationship with his son and heir apparent, <a href="Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Frederick, Prince of Wales</a>, worsened during the 1730s. Frederick had been left behind in Germany when his parents came to England, and they had not met for 14 years. In 1728, he was brought to England, and swiftly became a figurehead of the political opposition. When George visited Hanover in the summers of 1729, 1732 and 1735, he left his wife to chair the regency council in Britain rather than his son. Meanwhile, rivalry between George II and his brother-in-law and first cousin <a href="Frederick%20William%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William I of Prussia</a> led to tension along the Prussian–Hanoverian border, which eventually culminated in the mobilization of troops in the border zone and suggestions of a duel between the two kings. Negotiations for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter <a href="Wilhelmine%20of%20Prussia%2C%20Margravine%20of%20Brandenburg-Bayreuth">Wilhelmine</a> dragged on for years but neither side would make the concessions demanded by the other, and the idea was shelved. Instead, the prince married <a href="Princess%20Augusta%20of%20Saxe-Gotha">Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha</a> in April 1736.

In May 1736, George returned to Hanover, which resulted in unpopularity in England; a satirical notice was even pinned to the gates of St James's Palace decrying his absence. "Lost or strayed out of this house", it read, "a man who has left a wife and six children <a href="Poor%20rate">on the parish</a>." The king made plans to return in the face of inclement December weather; when his ship was caught in a storm, gossip swept London that he had drowned. Eventually, in January 1737, he arrived back in England. Immediately he fell ill, with <a href="haemorrhoids">piles</a> and a fever, and withdrew to his bed. The Prince of Wales put it about that the king was dying, with the result that George insisted on getting up and attending a social event to disprove the gossip-mongers.

When the Prince of Wales applied to Parliament for an increase in his allowance, an open quarrel broke out. The king, who had a reputation for meanness, offered a private settlement, which Frederick rejected. Parliament voted against the measure, but George reluctantly increased his son's allowance on the advice of Walpole. Further friction between them followed when Frederick excluded the king and queen from the birth of his daughter in July 1737 by bundling his wife, who was in labour, into a coach and driving off in the middle of the night. George banished him and his family from the royal court, much like the punishment his own father had brought upon him with the exception that he allowed Frederick to retain custody of his children.

Soon afterwards, George's wife Caroline died on 20 November 1737 (O.S.). He was deeply affected by her death, and to the surprise of many displayed "a tenderness of which the world thought him before utterly incapable". On her deathbed she told her sobbing husband to remarry, to which he replied, "Non, j'aurai des maîtresses!" (French for "No, I shall have mistresses!"). It was common knowledge that George had already had mistresses during his marriage, and he had kept Caroline informed about them. <a href="Henrietta%20Howard%2C%20Countess%20of%20Suffolk">Henrietta Howard</a>, later Countess of Suffolk, had moved to Hanover with her husband during the reign of Queen Anne, and she had been one of Caroline's <a href="Woman%20of%20the%20Bedchamber">women of the bedchamber</a>. She was his mistress from before the accession of George I until November 1734. She was followed by <a href="Amalie%20von%20Wallmoden%2C%20Countess%20of%20Yarmouth">Amalie von Wallmoden</a>, later Countess of Yarmouth, whose son, <a href="Johann%20Ludwig%20von%20Wallmoden">Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden</a>, may have been fathered by George. Johann Ludwig was born while Amalie was still married to her husband, and George did not acknowledge him publicly as his own son.

Against Walpole's wishes, but to George's delight, Britain reopened hostilities with Spain in 1739. Britain's conflict with Spain, the <a href="War%20of%20Jenkins%27%20Ear">War of Jenkins' Ear</a>, became part of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a> when a major European dispute broke out upon the death of <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor%20Charles%20VI">Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI</a> in 1740. At issue was the right of Charles's daughter, <a href="Maria%20Theresa">Maria Theresa</a>, to succeed to his Austrian dominions. George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover, where he was more able to intervene directly in European diplomatic affairs in his capacity as elector.

Prince Frederick campaigned actively for the opposition in the <a href="British%20general%20election%2C%201741">British general election of 1741</a>, and Walpole was unable to secure a stable majority. Walpole attempted to buy off the prince with the promise of an increased allowance and offered to pay off his debts, but Frederick refused. With his support eroded, Walpole retired in 1742 after over 20 years in office. He was replaced by <a href="Spencer%20Compton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Wilmington">Spencer Compton, Lord Wilmington</a>, whom George had originally considered for the premiership in 1727. Lord Wilmington, however, was a figurehead; actual power was held by others, such as <a href="John%20Carteret%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Granville">Lord Carteret</a>, George's favourite minister after Walpole. When Wilmington died in 1743, <a href="Henry%20Pelham">Henry Pelham</a> took his place at the head of the government.
The pro-war faction was led by Carteret, who claimed that French power would increase if Maria Theresa failed to succeed to the Austrian throne. George agreed to send 12,000 hired Hessian and Danish mercenaries to Europe, ostensibly to support Maria Theresa. Without conferring with his British ministers, George stationed them in Hanover to prevent enemy French troops from marching into the electorate. The British army had not fought in a major European war in over 20 years, and the government had badly neglected its upkeep. George had pushed for greater professionalism in the ranks, and promotion by merit rather than by <a href="sale%20of%20commissions">sale of commissions</a>, but without much success. An allied force of Austrian, British, Dutch, Hanoverian and Hessian troops engaged the French at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dettingen">Battle of Dettingen</a> on 16/27 June 1743. George personally accompanied them, leading them to victory, thus becoming the last British monarch to lead troops into battle. Though his actions in the battle were admired, the war became unpopular with the British public, who felt that the king and Carteret were subordinating British interests to Hanoverian ones. Carteret lost support, and to George's dismay resigned in 1744.

Tension grew between the Pelham ministry and George, as he continued to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other ministers to include <a href="William%20Pitt%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chatham">William Pitt the Elder</a> in the Cabinet, which would have broadened the government's support base. The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian. In February 1746, Pelham and his followers resigned. George asked <a href="William%20Pulteney%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Bath">Lord Bath</a> and Carteret to <a href="Short-lived%20ministry">form an administration</a>, but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.

George's French opponents encouraged <a href="Jacobite%20risings">rebellion by the Jacobites</a>, the supporters of the Roman Catholic claimant to the British throne, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a>, often known as the Old Pretender. Stuart was the son of <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, who had been deposed in 1688 and replaced by his Protestant relations. Two prior rebellions in <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201715">1715</a> and <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201719">1719</a> had failed. In July 1745, the Old Pretender's son, <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Stuart">Charles Edward Stuart</a>, popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed in Scotland, where support for his cause was highest. George, who was summering in Hanover, returned to London at the end of August. The Jacobites defeated British forces in September at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Prestonpans">Battle of Prestonpans</a>, and then moved south into England. The Jacobites failed to gain further support, and the French reneged on a promise of help. Losing morale, the Jacobites retreated back into Scotland. On 16/27 April 1746, Charles faced George's military-minded son <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cumberland">Prince William, Duke of Cumberland</a>, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Culloden">Battle of Culloden</a>, the last pitched battle fought on British soil. The ravaged Jacobite troops were routed by the government army. Charles escaped to France, but many of his supporters were caught and executed. Jacobitism was all but crushed; no further serious attempt was made at restoring the <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">House of Stuart</a>. The War of the Austrian Succession continued until 1748, when Maria Theresa was recognized as Archduchess of Austria. The peace was celebrated by a fête in <a href="Green%20Park%2C%20London">Green Park, London</a>, for which Handel composed "<a href="Music%20for%20the%20Royal%20Fireworks">Music for the Royal Fireworks</a>".

In the <a href="British%20general%20election%2C%201747">general election of 1747</a>, the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a>. When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince George</a>, became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the <a href="Princess%20Augusta%20of%20Saxe-Gotha">Dowager Princess of Wales</a> and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death. The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover. After the death of his daughter Louisa at the end of the year, George lamented, "This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son – but I am glad of it ... Now [Louisa] is gone. I know I did not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers."

In 1754, Pelham died, to be succeeded by his elder brother, the <a href="Thomas%20Pelham-Holles%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Newcastle">Duke of Newcastle</a>. Hostility between France and Britain, particularly over the <a href="colonization%20of%20North%20America">colonization of North America</a>, continued. Fearing a French invasion of Hanover, George aligned himself with Prussia (ruled by his nephew, <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a>), the enemy of Austria. Russia and France allied with their former enemy Austria. A French <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20St%20Philip%20%281756%29">invasion of the British-held island of Minorca</a> led to the outbreak of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> in 1756. Public disquiet over British failures at the start of the conflict led to the resignation of Newcastle and the appointment of the <a href="William%20Cavendish%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire">Duke of Devonshire</a> as prime minister and <a href="William%20Pitt%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chatham">William Pitt the Elder</a> as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Southern%20Department">Secretary of State for the Southern Department</a>. In April the following year, George dismissed Pitt, in an attempt to construct an administration more to his liking. Over the succeeding three months attempts to form another stable ministerial combination failed. In June, <a href="James%20Waldegrave%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Waldegrave">James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave</a>, held the seals of office for only four days. By the start of July, Pitt was recalled, and the Duke of Newcastle returned as prime minister. As Secretary of State, Pitt guided policy relating to the war. Great Britain, Hanover and Prussia and their allies <a href="Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Hesse-Kassel</a> and <a href="Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a> were pitted against other European powers, including France, Austria, Russia, Sweden and <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>. The war involved multiple theatres from Europe to North America and India, where British dominance increased with the victories of <a href="Robert%20Clive">Robert Clive</a> over French forces and their allies at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arcot">Battle of Arcot</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Plassey">Battle of Plassey</a>.

George's son, the Duke of Cumberland, commanded the king's troops in northern Germany. In 1757, <a href="Invasion%20of%20Hanover%20%281757%29">Hanover was invaded</a> and George gave Cumberland full powers to conclude a separate peace. By September, however, he was furious at <a href="Convention%20of%20Klosterzeven">Cumberland's negotiated settlement</a>, which he felt greatly favoured the French. George said his son had "ruined me and disgraced himself". Cumberland, by his own choice, resigned his military offices, and George revoked the peace deal on the grounds that the French had infringed it by disarming Hessian troops after the ceasefire.

In the "<a href="Annus%20Mirabilis%20of%201759">annus mirabilis</a>" of 1759 British forces <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Plains%20of%20Abraham">captured Quebec</a> and <a href="Invasion%20of%20Guadeloupe%20%281759%29">Guadeloupe</a>. A French <a href="Planned%20French%20Invasion%20of%20Britain%20%281759%29">plan to invade Britain</a> was defeated following naval battles at <a href="Battle%20of%20Lagos">Lagos</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Quiberon%20Bay">Quiberon Bay</a>, and a resumed French advance on Hanover was halted by a joint British–Hanoverian force at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Minden">Battle of Minden</a>.

By October 1760, George II was blind in one eye and <a href="hard%20of%20hearing">hard of hearing</a>. On the morning of 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00 am, drank a cup of hot chocolate, and went to his <a href="close%20stool">close stool</a>, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash and entered the room to find the king on the floor; his physician, <a href="Frank%20Nicholls">Frank Nicholls</a>, recorded that he "appeared to have just come from his necessary-stool, and as if going to open his <a href="escritoire">escritoire</a>".

The king was lifted into his bed, and <a href="Princess%20Amelia%20of%20Great%20Britain">Princess Amelia</a> was sent for; before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A <a href="post-mortem">post-mortem</a> revealed that the king had died as the result of a <a href="thoracic%20aortic%20dissection">thoracic aortic dissection</a>.

George II was succeeded by his grandson <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a>, and was buried on 11 November in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. He left instructions for the sides of his and his wife's coffins to be removed so that their remains could mingle. He is the most recent monarch to be buried in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

George donated the royal library to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> in 1757, four years after the museum's foundation. He had no interest in reading, or in the arts and sciences, and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards. In 1737, he founded the <a href="Georg%20August%20University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">Georg August University of Göttingen</a>, the first university in the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Hanover">Electorate of Hanover</a>, and visited it in 1748. The <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> <a href="359%20Georgia">359 Georgia</a> was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of <a href="University%20of%20Dublin">Trinity College, Dublin</a>, between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's College in New York City, which later became <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>. The <a href="province%20of%20Georgia">province of Georgia</a>, founded by royal charter in 1732, was named after him.

During George II's reign British interests expanded throughout the world, the Jacobite challenge to the Hanoverian dynasty was extinguished, and the power of ministers and Parliament in Britain became well-established. Nevertheless, in the memoirs of contemporaries such as <a href="John%20Hervey%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Hervey">Lord Hervey</a> and <a href="Horace%20Walpole">Horace Walpole</a>, George is depicted as a weak buffoon, governed by his wife and ministers. Biographies of George written during the nineteenth and first part of the twentieth century relied on these biased accounts. Since the last quarter of the twentieth century, scholarly analysis of surviving correspondence has indicated that George was not as ineffective as previously thought. Letters from ministers are annotated by George with pertinent remarks and demonstrate that he had a grasp of and interest in foreign policy in particular. He was often able to prevent the appointment of ministers or commanders he disliked, or sideline them into lesser offices. This academic reassessment of George II, however, has not totally eliminated the popular perception of him as a "faintly ludicrous king". His parsimony, for example, may have opened him to ridicule, but his biographers observe that parsimony is preferable to extravagance. <a href="James%20Caulfeild%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Charlemont">Lord Charlemont</a> excused George's short temper by explaining that sincerity of feeling is better than deception, "His temper was warm and impetuous, but he was good-natured and sincere. Unskilled in the royal talent of dissimulation, he always was what he appeared to be. He might offend, but he never deceived." <a href="James%20Waldegrave%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Waldegrave">Lord Waldegrave</a> wrote, "I am thoroughly convinced that hereafter, when time shall have wore away those specks and blemishes which sully the brightest characters, and from which no man is totally exempt, he will be numbered amongst those patriot kings, under whose government the people have enjoyed the greatest happiness". George may not have played a strong role in history, but he was influential at times and he upheld constitutional government. <a href="Elizabeth%20Montagu">Elizabeth Montagu</a> said of him, "With him our laws and liberties were safe, he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his people and the respect of foreign governments; and a certain steadiness of character made him of great consequence in these unsettled times ... His character would not afford subject for epic poetry, but will look well in the sober page of history."

In Britain:

George II's full style was "George the Second, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, <a href="English%20claim%20to%20the%20French%20throne">France</a> and Ireland, <a href="Fidei%20defensor">Defender of the Faith</a>, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Archtreasurer and Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire".

When George became <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> in 1714, he was granted the <a href="Royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal arms</a> with an <a href="inescutcheon">inescutcheon</a> of <a href="gules">gules</a> plain in the Hanoverian quarter <a href="Cadency%20labels%20of%20the%20British%20royal%20family">differenced overall by a label</a> of three points <a href="argent">argent</a>. The crest included the single arched <a href="coronet">coronet</a> of his rank. As king, he used the <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain%23Arms">royal arms as used by his father</a> undifferenced.

Caroline's ten pregnancies resulted in eight live births. One of their children died in infancy, and seven lived to adulthood.

Richard II of England

Richard II (6 January 1367 – c. 14 February 1400), also known as Richard of Bordeaux, was <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a> from 1377 until he was <a href="Deposition%20%28politics%29">deposed</a> in 1399. Richard, a son of <a href="Edward%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward the Black Prince</a>, was born in <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> during the reign of his grandfather, <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>. His father was Prince of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a>. Richard was the younger brother of <a href="Edward%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme">Edward of Angoulême</a>, upon whose death Richard, at three years of age, became second in line to the throne after his father. Upon the death of Richard's father prior to the death of Edward III, Richard, by <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, became the <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> to the throne. With Edward III's death the following year, Richard succeeded to the throne at the age of ten.

During Richard's first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of councils. Most of <a href="History%20of%20the%20British%20peerage%23Feudal%20origins">the aristocracy</a> preferred this to a <a href="regent">regency</a> led by the king's uncle, <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>, yet Gaunt remained highly influential. <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> then faced various problems, including the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">ongoing war against France</a> (which was <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War%20%281369%E2%80%9389%29">not going well for the English</a>), border conflicts with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, and economic difficulties related to the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>. A major challenge of the reign was the <a href="Peasants%27%20Revolt">Peasants' Revolt</a> in 1381, and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis. In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the <a href="Lords%20Appellant">Lords Appellant</a>. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents.

In 1397, Richard took his revenge on the Appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard's "tyranny". In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the king disinherited Gaunt's son, <a href="Henry%20of%20Bolingbroke">Henry of Bolingbroke</a>, who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Although he initially claimed that his goal was only to reclaim his patrimony, it soon became clear that Henry intended to claim the throne for himself. Meeting little resistance, Bolingbroke deposed Richard and had himself crowned as <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">King Henry IV</a>. Richard died in captivity in February 1400; he is thought to have been starved to death, although questions remain regarding his final fate.

Richard was said to have been tall, good-looking and intelligent. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a> that Edward III had started. He was a firm believer in the <a href="royal%20prerogative">royal prerogative</a>, which led him to restrain the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private <a href="retinue">retinue</a> for military protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.

Richard's posthumous reputation has been shaped to a large extent by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, whose play "<a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>" portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a <a href="personality%20disorder">personality disorder</a>, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unrealistic or even entirely unprecedented, the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.

Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward, the Black Prince</a>, and <a href="Joan%20of%20Kent">Joan of Kent</a>. Edward, <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>, particularly in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poitiers">Battle of Poitiers</a> in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.
Joan of Kent had been at the centre of a marriage dispute between <a href="Thomas%20Holland%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Kent">Thomas Holland, Earl of Kent</a>, and <a href="William%20Montacute%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury</a>, from which Holland emerged victorious. Less than a year after Holland's death in 1360, Joan married Prince Edward. Since Joan was a granddaughter of <a href="King%20Edward%20I">King Edward I</a> and a first cousin of her father-in-law, King Edward III, the marriage required <a href="Dispensation%20%28canon%20law%29%23Matrimonial%20dispensation">papal approval</a>.

Richard was born at the Archbishop's Palace, <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, in the English principality of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine%23Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Aquitaine</a>, on 6 January 1367. According to contemporary sources, three kings"the King of <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Castille</a>, the King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Navarre">Navarre</a> and the King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a>"were present at his birth. This anecdote, and the fact that his birth fell on the feast of <a href="Epiphany%20%28holiday%29">Epiphany</a>, was later used in the religious imagery of the <a href="Wilton%20Diptych">Wilton Diptych</a>, where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the <a href="Virgin%20and%20Child">Virgin and Child</a>. His elder brother Edward of Angoulême died near his sixth birthday in 1371, and Richard became his father's heir. The Black Prince finally succumbed to his long illness in June 1376. The <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">Commons</a> in <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">parliament</a> genuinely feared that Richard's uncle, <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>, would <a href="usurp">usurp</a> the throne. For this reason, the prince was quickly invested with the <a href="princedom%20of%20Wales">princedom of Wales</a> and his father's other titles.

On 21 June the next year, Richard's grandfather <a href="Edward%20III">Edward III</a>, who was for some years frail and decrepit, also died, after 50 years as England's monarch. This resulted in the 10-year-old Richard succeeding to the throne, being <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">crowned king</a> on 16 July 1377 at Westminster Abbey. Again, fears of John of Gaunt's ambitions influenced political decisions, and a regency led by the King's uncles was avoided. Instead, the king was nominally to exercise kingship with the help of a series of "continual councils", from which John of Gaunt was excluded. Gaunt, together with his younger brother <a href="Thomas%20of%20Woodstock%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham</a>, still held great informal influence over the business of government, but the king's councillors and friends, particularly Sir <a href="Simon%20de%20Burley">Simon de Burley</a> and <a href="Robert%20de%20Vere%2C%20Duke%20of%20Ireland">Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland</a>, increasingly gained control of royal affairs. In a matter of three years, these councillors earned the mistrust of the Commons to the point that the councils were discontinued in 1380. Contributing to discontent was an increasingly heavy burden of <a href="Taxation%20in%20medieval%20England">taxation</a> levied through three <a href="tax%20per%20head">poll taxes</a> between 1377 and 1381 that were spent on unsuccessful military expeditions on the continent. By 1381, there was a deep-felt resentment against the governing classes in the lower levels of English society.

Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the <a href="Peasants%27%20Revolt">Peasants' Revolt</a>, the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the <a href="Black%20Death%20in%20England">Black Death</a> and <a href="Second%20plague%20pandemic">subsequent outbreaks</a> of the plague. The rebellion started in <a href="Kent">Kent</a> and <a href="Essex">Essex</a> in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at <a href="Blackheath%2C%20London">Blackheath</a> near London under the leaders <a href="Wat%20Tyler">Wat Tyler</a>, <a href="John%20Ball%20%28priest%29">John Ball</a>, and <a href="Jack%20Straw%20%28rebel%20leader%29">Jack Straw</a>. John of Gaunt's <a href="Savoy%20Palace">Savoy Palace</a> was burnt down. The <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Simon%20Sudbury">Simon Sudbury</a>, who was also <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, and the king's <a href="Lord%20High%20Treasurer">Lord High Treasurer</a>, <a href="Robert%20Hales">Robert Hales</a>, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of <a href="serfdom">serfdom</a>. The king, sheltered within the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.

It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations. The king set out by the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower. The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at <a href="Mile%20End">Mile End</a>. The king agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings. Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at <a href="Smithfield%2C%20London">Smithfield</a> and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and <a href="William%20Walworth">William Walworth</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20the%20City%20of%20London">mayor of London</a>, pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him. The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying "I am your captain, follow me!", he led the mob away from the scene. Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.

The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at <a href="Billericay">Billericay</a>, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolutist</a> attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.

It is only with the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the <a href="chronicle">annals</a>. One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry <a href="Anne%20of%20Bohemia">Anne of Bohemia</a>, daughter of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> (<a href="King%20of%20Bohemia">King of Bohemia</a> <a href="Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles IV</a>) and his wife <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Pomerania">Elisabeth of Pomerania</a>, on 20 January 1382. The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the <a href="Western%20Schism">Western Schism</a>, Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against <a href="France%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">France</a> in the ongoing <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.

<a href="Michael%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Suffolk">Michael de la Pole</a> had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age. De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">chancellor</a> in 1383, and created him <a href="Earl%20of%20Suffolk">Earl of Suffolk</a> two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member of the close circle around the king was <a href="Robert%20de%20Vere%2C%20Duke%20of%20Ireland">Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford</a>, who in this period emerged as the king's <a href="favourite">favourite</a>. Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of <a href="Duke%20of%20Ireland">Duke of Ireland</a> in 1386. The chronicler <a href="Thomas%20Walsingham">Thomas Walsingham</a> suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.

Tensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions. Instead, a so-called <a href="crusade">crusade</a> led by <a href="Henry%20le%20Despenser">Henry le Despenser</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a>, was dispatched, which failed miserably. Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>. In 1385, the king himself led a <a href="English%20invasion%20of%20Scotland%20%281385%29">punitive expedition to the north</a>, but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle. Meanwhile, only an uprising in <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a> prevented a French invasion of southern England. The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and John of Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a> in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person. With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckinghamwho had by now been created Duke of Gloucesterand <a href="Richard%20FitzAlan%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel</a>.

The threat of a French invasion did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386. At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Polein his capacity of chancellorrequested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm. Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed. The parliament (later known as the <a href="Wonderful%20Parliament">Wonderful Parliament</a>) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel. The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a <a href="scullery%20maid">scullion</a> from his kitchen at parliament's request. Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go. A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.

Richard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative, and from February to November 1387 went on a "gyration" (tour) of the country to muster support for his cause. By installing de Vere as <a href="Justice%20of%20Chester">Justice of Chester</a>, he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>. He also secured a legal ruling from <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Robert%20Tresilian">Robert Tresilian</a> that parliament's conduct had been unlawful and treasonable.

On his return to London, the king was confronted by Thomas of Woodstock (now Duke of Gloucester), Arundel and <a href="Thomas%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2012th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick</a>, who brought an appeal of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, Tresilian, and two other loyalists: the mayor of London, <a href="Nicholas%20Brembre">Nicholas Brembre</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Neville">Alexander Neville</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>. Richard stalled the negotiations to gain time, as he was expecting de Vere to arrive from Cheshire with military reinforcements. The three earls then joined forces with <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby</a> (Gaunt's son, later King <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV</a>), and <a href="Thomas%20de%20Mowbray%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham</a>the group known to history as the <a href="Lords%20Appellant">Lords Appellant</a>. On 20 December 1387 they intercepted de Vere at <a href="Battle%20of%20Radcot%20Bridge">Radcot Bridge</a>, where he and his forces were routed and he was obliged to flee the country.

Richard now had no choice but to comply with the appellants' demands; Brembre and Tresilian were condemned and executed, while de Vere and de la Polewho had by now also left the countrywere sentenced to death "in absentia" at the <a href="Merciless%20Parliament">Merciless Parliament</a> in February 1388. The proceedings went further, and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley. The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king.

Richard gradually re-established royal authority in the months after the deliberations of the Merciless Parliament. The aggressive foreign policy of the Lords Appellant failed when their efforts to build a wide, anti-French coalition came to nothing, and the north of England fell victim to a <a href="Battle%20of%20Otterburn">Scottish incursion</a>. Richard was now over twenty-one years old and could with confidence claim the right to govern in his own name. Furthermore, John of Gaunt returned to England in 1389 and settled his differences with the king, after which the old statesman acted as a moderating influence on English politics. Richard assumed full control of the government on 3 May 1389, claiming that the difficulties of the past years had been due solely to bad councillors. He outlined a foreign policy that reversed the actions of the appellants by seeking peace and reconciliation with France, and promised to lessen the burden of taxation on the people significantly. Richard ruled peacefully for the next eight years, having reconciled with his former adversaries. Still, later events would show that he had not forgotten the indignities he perceived. In particular, the execution of his former teacher Sir Simon de Burley was an insult not easily forgotten.

With national stability secured, Richard began negotiating a permanent peace with France. A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded the territory of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a> possessed by the English crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay <a href="homage%20%28medieval%29">homage</a> to the King of Francea condition that proved unacceptable to the English public. Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years. As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry <a href="Isabella%20of%20Valois">Isabella</a>, daughter of <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI of France</a>, when she came of age. There were some misgivings about the betrothal, in particular because the princess was then only six years old, and thus would not be able to produce an heir to the throne of England for many years.

Although Richard sought peace with France, he took a different approach to the situation in Ireland. The English <a href="Lordship%20of%20Ireland">lordships in Ireland</a> were in danger of being overrun, and the <a href="Hiberno-Norman">Anglo-Irish</a> lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It was one of the most successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.

The period that historians refer to as the "tyranny" of Richard II began towards the end of the 1390s. The king had Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick arrested in July 1397. The timing of these arrests and Richard's motivation are not entirely clear. Although one chronicle suggested that a plot was being planned against the king, there is no evidence that this was the case. It is more likely that Richard had simply come to feel strong enough to safely retaliate against these three men for their role in events of 1386–88 and eliminate them as threats to his power. Arundel was the first of the three to be brought to trial, at the parliament of September 1397. After a heated quarrel with the king, he was condemned and executed. Gloucester was being held prisoner by the Earl of Nottingham at Calais while awaiting his trial. As the time for the trial drew near, Nottingham brought news that Gloucester was dead. It is thought likely that the king had ordered him to be killed to avoid the disgrace of executing a prince of the blood. Warwick was also condemned to death, but his life was spared and his sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Arundel's brother <a href="Thomas%20Arundel">Thomas Arundel</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was exiled for life. Richard then took his persecution of adversaries to the localities. While recruiting <a href="retinue">retainers</a> for himself in various counties, he prosecuted local men who had been loyal to the appellants. The fines levied on these men brought great revenues to the crown, although contemporary chroniclers raised questions about the legality of the proceedings.

These actions were made possible primarily through the collusion of John of Gaunt, but with the support of a large group of other magnates, many of whom were rewarded with new titles, who were disparagingly referred to as Richard's "duketti". These included the former Appellants <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby</a>, who was made <a href="Duke%20of%20Hereford">Duke of Hereford</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20de%20Mowbray%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham</a>, who was created <a href="Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a>. Also among them were <a href="John%20Holland%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Exeter">John</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Holland%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Surrey">Thomas Holland</a>, the king's half-brother and nephew, who were promoted from earls of <a href="Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">Huntingdon</a> and <a href="Earl%20of%20Kent">Kent</a> to dukes of <a href="Duke%20of%20Exeter">Exeter</a> and <a href="Duke%20of%20Surrey">Surrey</a> respectively; the Duke of York's son <a href="Edward%20of%20Norwich%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20York">Edward, Earl of Rutland</a>, who received Gloucester's French title of <a href="Duke%20of%20Aumale">Duke of Aumale</a>; Gaunt's son <a href="John%20Beaufort%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Somerset">John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset</a>, who was made <a href="Marquess%20of%20Somerset">Marquess of Somerset</a> and <a href="Marquess%20of%20Dorset">Marquess of Dorset</a>; <a href="John%20Montacute%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">John Montacute, Earl of Salisbury</a>; and <a href="Thomas%20le%20Despenser%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Lord Thomas le Despenser</a>, who became <a href="Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Earl of Gloucester</a>. With the forfeited lands of the convicted appellants, the king could reward these men with lands suited to their new ranks.

A threat to Richard's authority still existed, however, in the form of the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">House of Lancaster</a>, represented by John of Gaunt and his son Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford. The House of Lancaster not only possessed greater wealth than any other family in England, they were of royal descent and, as such, likely candidates to succeed the childless Richard. Discord broke out in the inner circles of court in December 1397, when Bolingbroke and <a href="Thomas%20de%20Mowbray%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Mowbray</a> became embroiled in a quarrel. According to Bolingbroke, Mowbray had claimed that the two, as former Lords Appellant, were next in line for royal retribution. Mowbray vehemently denied these charges, as such a claim would have amounted to treason. A parliamentary committee decided that the two should settle the matter by battle, but at the last moment Richard exiled the two dukes instead: Mowbray for life, Bolingbroke for ten years. On 3 February 1399, John of Gaunt died. Rather than allowing Bolingbroke to succeed, Richard extended the term of his exile to life and expropriated his properties. The king felt safe from Bolingbroke, who was residing in Paris, since the French had little interest in any challenge to Richard and his peace policy. Richard left the country in May for another expedition in Ireland.

In 1398 Richard summoned a packed Parliament to Shrewsbury—known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury—which declared all the acts of the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally be put on the king. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.

In June 1399, <a href="Louis%20I%20de%20Valois%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Louis, Duke of Orléans</a>, gained control of the court of the insane <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI of France</a>. The policy of "rapprochement" with the English crown did not suit Louis's political ambitions, and for this reason he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England. With a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at <a href="Ravenspur">Ravenspur</a> in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399. Men from all over the country soon rallied around the duke. Meeting with <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland</a>, who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere. The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south. <a href="Edmund%20of%20Langley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20York">Edmund of Langley, Duke of York</a>, who was acting as Keeper of the Realm, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July. He made his way to <a href="Conwy%20Castle">Conwy</a>, where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations. On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at <a href="Flint%20Castle">Flint Castle</a>, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> on 1 September.

Henry was by now fully determined to take the throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was <a href="Edmund%20Mortimer%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20March">Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March</a>, who was descended from <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>'s third son, the second to survive to adulthood, <a href="Lionel%20of%20Antwerp%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">Lionel of Antwerp</a>. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct "male" line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.

According to the official record (read by Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, during an assembly of <a href="House%20of%20Lords%23History">lords</a> and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the "Traison et Mort Chronicle" suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, demanded to see his <a href="Isabella%20of%20Valois">wife</a> and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused to do anything without parliamentary approval.

When parliament met to discuss Richard's fate, the <a href="John%20Trevor%20%28died%201410%29">bishop of St Asaph</a> read thirty-three articles of deposition that were unanimously accepted by lords and commons. On 1 October 1399, Richard II was formally deposed and on 13 October, the feast day of <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, was crowned <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV of England</a>. Henry had previously agreed to let Richard live after his abdication. This all changed when it was revealed that the earls of Huntingdon, Kent and Salisbury and Lord Despenser, and possibly also the Earl of Rutlandall now demoted from the ranks they had been given by Richardwere planning to murder the new king and restore Richard in the <a href="Epiphany%20Rising">Epiphany Rising</a>. Although averted, the plot highlighted the danger of allowing Richard to live. He is thought to have starved to death in captivity on or around 14 February 1400, although there is some question over the date and manner of his death. His body was taken south from Pontefract and displayed in the <a href="old%20St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">old St Paul's Cathedral</a> on 17 February before burial in <a href="King%27s%20Langley%20Priory">King's Langley Priory</a> on 6 March.

Rumours that Richard was still alive persisted, but never gained much credence in England; in Scotland, however, a man identified as Richard came into the hands of <a href="Robert%20Stewart%2C%20Duke%20of%20Albany">Regent Albany</a>, lodged in <a href="Stirling%20Castle">Stirling Castle</a>, and serving as the notionaland perhaps reluctantfigurehead of various anti-Lancastrian and <a href="Lollard">Lollard</a> intrigues in England. Henry IV's government dismissed him as an impostor, and several sources from both sides of the Border suggest the man had a mental illness, one also describing him as a "beggar" by the time of his death in 1419, but he was buried as a king in the local <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> friary in Stirling. Meanwhile, in 1413, <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a>in an effort both to atone for his father's act of murder and to silence the rumours of Richard's survivalhad decided to have the body at King's Langley moved to its final resting place in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. Here Richard himself had prepared an elaborate tomb, where the remains of his wife Anne were already entombed.

In the last years of Richard's reign, and particularly in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397, the king enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country, a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England. In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge, one that differed sharply from that of earlier times. A new form of address developed; where the king previously had been addressed simply as "<a href="highness">highness</a>", now "royal <a href="majesty">majesty</a>", or "high majesty" were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the king. The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard's two wives, but also the court that the Black Prince had maintained while residing in Aquitaine.

Richard's approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the <a href="Royal%20Prerogative">royal prerogative</a>, the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the <a href="Peasants%27%20Revolt">Peasants' Revolt</a>s and then by the <a href="Lords%20Appellant">Lords Appellant</a>. Richard rejected the approach his grandfather, <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>, had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains. In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of power in the hands of the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France. At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them <a href="livery">livery</a> <a href="heraldic%20badge">badges</a> with his <a href="White%20Hart">White Hart</a>, which are also worn by the angels in the Wilton Diptych (right). He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.

As part of Richard's programme of asserting his authority, he also tried to cultivate the royal image. Unlike any other English king before him, he had himself portrayed in <a href="panel%20painting">panel painting</a>s of elevated majesty, of which two survive: the over life-size <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> portrait of the king (c. 1390, see top of page), and the <a href="Wilton%20Diptych">Wilton Diptych</a> (1394–99), a portable work probably intended to accompany Richard on his Irish campaign. It is one of the few surviving English examples of the courtly <a href="International%20Gothic">International Gothic</a> style of painting that was developed in the courts of the Continent, especially Prague and Paris. Richard's expenditure on jewellery, rich textiles and metalwork was far higher than on paintings, but as with his <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s, there are hardly any surviving works that can be connected with him, except for a crown, "one of the finest achievements of the Gothic goldsmith", that probably belonged to Anne.

Among Richard's grandest projects in the field of architecture was <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a>, which was extensively rebuilt during his reign, perhaps spurred on by the completion in 1391 of John of Gaunt's magnificent hall at <a href="Kenilworth%20Castle">Kenilworth Castle</a>. Fifteen life-size statues of kings were placed in niches on the walls, and the <a href="hammer-beam">hammer-beam</a> roof by the royal carpenter <a href="Hugh%20Herland">Hugh Herland</a>, "the greatest creation of medieval timber architecture", allowed the original three <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> aisles to be replaced with a single huge open space, with a dais at the end for Richard to sit in solitary state. The rebuilding had been begun by <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> in 1245, but had by Richard's time been dormant for over a century.

The court's patronage of literature is especially important, because this was the period in which the English language took shape as a <a href="Middle%20English%20literature%23Late%20period">literary language</a>. There is little evidence to tie Richard directly to patronage of <a href="English%20poetry%23The%20Anglo-Norman%20period%20and%20the%20Later%20Middle%20Ages">poetry</a>, but it was nevertheless within his court that this culture was allowed to thrive. The greatest poet of the age, <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>, served the king as a diplomat, a customs official and a clerk of <a href="Office%20of%20Works">The King's Works</a> while producing some of his best-known work. Chaucer was also in the service of John of Gaunt, and wrote "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20the%20Duchess">The Book of the Duchess</a>" as a eulogy to Gaunt's wife <a href="Blanche%20of%20Lancaster">Blanche</a>. Chaucer's colleague and friend <a href="John%20Gower">John Gower</a> wrote his "<a href="Confessio%20Amantis">Confessio Amantis</a>" on a direct commission from Richard, although he later grew disenchanted with the king.

Contemporary writers, even those less sympathetic to the king, agreed that Richard was a "most beautiful king", though with a "face which was white, rounded and feminine", implying he lacked manliness. He was athletic and tall; when his tomb was opened in 1871 he was found to be six feet tall. He was also intelligent and well read, and when agitated he had a tendency to stammer. While the Westminster Abbey portrait probably shows a good similarity of the king, the Wilton Diptych portrays the king as significantly younger than he was at the time; it must be assumed that he had a beard by this point. Religiously, he was orthodox, and particularly towards the end of his reign he became a strong opponent of the <a href="Lollardy">Lollard</a> heresy. He was particularly devoted to the cult of Edward the Confessor, and around 1395 he had his own <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> <a href="impalement%20%28heraldry%29">impaled</a> with the <a href="attributed%20arms">mythical arms</a> of the Confessor. Though not a warrior king like his grandfather, Richard nevertheless enjoyed <a href="tournament%20%28medieval%29">tournaments</a>, as well as hunting.

The popular view of Richard has more than anything been influenced by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s play about the king, "<a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>". Shakespeare's Richard was a cruel, vindictive and irresponsible king, who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power. Writing a work of fiction, however, Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions. Shakespeare based his play on works by writers such as <a href="Edward%20Hall">Edward Hall</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Daniel">Samuel Daniel</a>, who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as <a href="Thomas%20Walsingham">Thomas Walsingham</a>. Hall and Daniel were part of <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor</a> historiography, which was highly unsympathetic to Richard. The Tudor orthodoxy, reinforced by Shakespeare, saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard's misrule that did not end until <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>'s accession in 1485. The idea that Richard was to blame for the later-15th century <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> was prevalent as late as the 19th century, but came to be challenged in the 20th. Some recent historians prefer to look at the Wars of the Roses in isolation from the reign of Richard II.

Richard's mental state has been a major issue of historical debate since the first academic historians started treating the subject in the 19th century. One of the first modern historians to deal with Richard II as a king and as a person was Bishop <a href="William%20Stubbs">Stubbs</a>. Stubbs argued that towards the end of his reign, Richard's mind "was losing its balance altogether". Historian <a href="Anthony%20Steel%20%28historian%29">Anthony Steel</a>, who wrote a full-scale biography of the king in 1941, took a psychiatric approach to the issue, and concluded that the king had <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. This was challenged by <a href="Vivian%20Hunter%20Galbraith">V. H. Galbraith</a>, who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis, a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period, such as <a href="Anthony%20Goodman%20%28historian%29">Anthony Goodman</a> and <a href="Anthony%20Tuck">Anthony Tuck</a>. <a href="Nigel%20Saul">Nigel Saul</a>, who wrote the most recent academic biography on Richard II, concedes thateven though there is no basis for assuming the king had a mental illnesshe showed clear signs of a <a href="Narcissistic%20personality%20disorder">narcissistic personality</a>, and towards the end of his reign "Richard's grasp on reality was becoming weaker".

One of the primary historiographical questions surrounding Richard concerns his political agenda and the reasons for its failure. His kingship was thought to contain elements of the early modern <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarchy</a> as exemplified by the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a>. More recently, Richard's concept of kingship has been seen by some as not so different from that of his antecedents, and that it was exactly by staying within the framework of traditional monarchy that he was able to achieve as much as he did. Yet his actions were too extreme, and too abrupt. For one, the absence of war was meant to reduce the burden of taxation, and so help Richard's popularity with the Commons in parliament. However, this promise was never fulfilled, as the cost of the royal retinue, the opulence of court and Richard's lavish patronage of his favourites proved as expensive as war had been, without offering commensurate benefits. As for his policy of military retaining, this was later emulated by <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a> and <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>, but Richard's exclusive reliance on the county of Cheshire hurt his support from the rest of the country. As <a href="Simon%20Walker%20%28historian%29">Simon Walker</a> concludes: "What he sought was, in contemporary terms, neither unjustified nor unattainable; it was the manner of his seeking that betrayed him."


a. John of Gaunt's brother <a href="Edmund%20of%20Langley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20York">Edmund of Langley</a> was only one year younger, but it has been suggested that this prince was of "limited ability", and he took less part in government than Gaunt did.<br>
b. It has been speculated that the whole incident surrounding the killing of Wat Tyler was in fact planned in advance by the council, in order to end the rebellion.<br>
c. While both England and the Empire supported <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VI">Pope Urban VI</a> in Rome, the French sided with the <a href="Avignon%20Papacy">Avignon Papacy</a> of <a href="Antipope%20Clement%20VII">Clement VII</a>.<br>
d. This "appeal"which would give its name to the <a href="Lords%20Appellant">Lords Appellant</a>was not an appeal in the modern sense of an application to a higher authority. In medieval <a href="common%20law">common law</a> the appeal was criminal charge, often one of treason.<br>

Henry III of England

Henry III (1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a>, <a href="Lord%20of%20Ireland">Lord of Ireland</a>, and <a href="Duke%20of%20Aquitaine">Duke of Aquitaine</a> from 1216 until his death. The son of <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a> and <a href="Isabella%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme">Isabella of Angoulême</a>, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the <a href="First%20Barons%27%20War">First Barons' War</a>. Cardinal <a href="Guala%20Bicchieri">Guala</a> declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by <a href="William%20Marshal%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">William Marshal</a>, defeated the rebels at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Lincoln%20%281217%29">Lincoln</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Sandwich%20%281217%29">Sandwich</a> in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the <a href="Magna%20Carta%23The%20Great%20Charter%201225">Great Charter of 1225</a>, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by <a href="Hubert%20de%20Burgh%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Kent">Hubert de Burgh</a> and then <a href="Peter%20des%20Roches">Peter des Roches</a>, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the <a href="Angevin%20Empire">provinces of France</a> that had once belonged to his father, but <a href="English%20invasion%20of%20France%20%281230%29">the invasion</a> was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, <a href="Richard%20Marshal%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Richard</a>, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by <a href="Catholic%20Church">the Church</a>.

Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite <a href="Castles%20in%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%23Palace-fortresses">palaces and castles</a>. He married <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Provence">Eleanor of Provence</a>, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his <a href="piety">piety</a>, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, whom he adopted as his <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a>. He extracted huge sums of money from the <a href="Jews%20in%20England">Jews in England</a>, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the <a href="Statute%20of%20Jewry">Statute of Jewry</a>, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he <a href="Saintonge%20War">invaded Poitou</a> in 1242, leading to the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Taillebourg">Battle of Taillebourg</a>. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Henry supported his brother <a href="Richard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Richard</a> in his bid to become <a href="King%20of%20the%20Romans">King of the Romans</a> in 1256, but was unable to place his own son <a href="Edmund%20Crouchback">Edmund</a> on the throne of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Sicily</a>, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on <a href="crusade">crusade</a> to the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a>.

By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his <a href="Poitiers">Poitevin</a> half-brothers, the <a href="Lusignan%20dynasty">Lusignans</a>, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the <a href="Provisions%20of%20Oxford">Provisions of Oxford</a>. Henry and the baronial government enacted a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281259%29">peace with France</a> in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for <a href="King%20Louis%20IX">King Louis IX</a> recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.

In 1263, one of the more radical barons, <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Simon de Montfort</a>, seized power, resulting in the <a href="Second%20Barons%27%20War">Second Barons' War</a>. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Lewes">Battle of Lewes</a> occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward</a>, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Evesham">Battle of Evesham</a> the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the <a href="Dictum%20of%20Kenilworth">Dictum of Kenilworth</a>. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some <a href="miracle">miracle</a>s were declared after his death; however, he was not <a href="Canonization">canonised</a>.

Henry was born in <a href="Winchester%20Castle">Winchester Castle</a> on 1 October 1207. He was the eldest son of <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a> and <a href="Isabella%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme">Isabella of Angoulême</a>. Little is known of Henry's early life. He was initially looked after by a <a href="wet%20nurse">wet nurse</a> called Ellen in the south of England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had close ties to his mother. Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters – <a href="Richard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Richard</a>, <a href="Joan%20of%20England%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scotland">Joan</a>, <a href="Isabella%20of%20England">Isabella</a> and <a href="Eleanor%20of%20England%2C%20Countess%20of%20Leicester">Eleanor</a> – and various older illegitimate siblings. In 1212 his education was entrusted to <a href="Peter%20des%20Roches">Peter des Roches</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>; under his direction, Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.

Little is known about Henry's appearance; he was probably around tall, and accounts recorded after his death suggested that he had a strong build, with a drooping eyelid. Henry grew up to occasionally show flashes of a fierce temper, but mostly, as historian <a href="David%20Carpenter%20%28historian%29">David Carpenter</a> describes, he had an "amiable, easy-going, and sympathetic" personality. He was unaffected and honest, and showed his emotions readily, easily being moved to tears by religious sermons.

At the start of the 13th century, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> formed part of the <a href="Angevin%20Empire">Angevin Empire</a> spreading across Western Europe. Henry was named after his grandfather, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>, who had built up this vast network of lands stretching from Scotland and Wales, through England, across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> to the territories of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Normandy">Normandy</a>, <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Brittany</a>, <a href="Maine%20%28province%29">Maine</a> and <a href="County%20of%20Anjou">Anjou</a> in north-west France, onto <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a> and <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a> in the south-west. For many years the French Crown was relatively weak, enabling first Henry II, and then his sons <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard</a> and John, to dominate France.

In 1204, John lost Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou to <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II of France</a>, leaving English power on the continent limited to Gascony and Poitou. John raised taxes to pay for military campaigns to regain his lands, but unrest grew among many of the English barons; John sought new allies by declaring England a <a href="Papacy">Papal</a> <a href="fiefdom">fiefdom</a>, owing allegiance to the Pope. In 1215, John and the rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty, the "<a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>". The treaty would have limited potential abuses of royal power, demobilised the rebel armies and set up a power-sharing arrangement, but in practice neither side complied with its conditions. John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the "Magna Carta" and the <a href="First%20Barons%27%20War">First Barons' War</a> erupted, with the rebel barons aided by Philip's son, the future <a href="Louis%20VIII%20of%20France">Louis VIII</a>, who claimed the English throne for himself. The war soon settled into a stalemate, with neither side able to claim victory. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry as his heir.

Henry was staying safely at <a href="Corfe%20Castle">Corfe Castle</a> in Dorset with his mother when King John died. On his deathbed, John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of <a href="William%20Marshal%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">William Marshal</a>, one of the most famous knights in England. The loyalist leaders decided to crown Henry immediately to reinforce his claim to the throne. William knighted the boy, and Cardinal <a href="Guala%20Bicchieri">Guala Bicchieri</a>, the <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a> to England, then oversaw his coronation at <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">Gloucester Cathedral</a> on 28 October. In the absence of the archbishops of <a href="Stephen%20Langton">Canterbury</a> or <a href="Walter%20de%20Gray">York</a>, he was anointed by the bishops of <a href="Sylvester%20of%20Worcester">Worcester</a> and <a href="Simon%20of%20Apulia">Exeter</a>, and crowned by Peter des Roches. The royal crown had been either lost or sold during the civil war, so instead the ceremony used a simple gold <a href="Corolla%20%28chaplet%29">corolla</a> belonging to Queen Isabella.

The young King inherited a difficult situation, with over half of England occupied by the rebels and most of his father's continental possessions still in French hands. He had substantial support from Guala who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels. Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy, starting with the coronation itself, where Henry gave <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">homage</a> to the Papacy, recognising the Pope as his feudal lord. <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20III">Pope Honorius III</a> declared that Henry was the Pope's <a href="vassal">vassal</a> and <a href="Ward%20%28law%29">ward</a>, and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom. As an additional measure, Henry took the cross, declaring himself a <a href="Crusades">crusader</a> and so entitled to special protection from Rome.

Two senior nobles stood out as candidates to head Henry's regency government. The first was William, who, although elderly, was renowned for his personal loyalty and could help support the war with his own men and material. The second was <a href="Ranulf%20de%20Blondeville%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Ranulf de Blondeville</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earl of Chester</a> and one of the most powerful loyalist barons. William diplomatically waited until both Guala and Ranulf had requested him to take up the post before assuming power. William then appointed des Roches to be Henry's guardian, freeing himself up to lead the military effort.

The war was not going well for the loyalists and the new regency government considered retreating to Ireland. Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it difficult to make further progress. Despite Louis controlling <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, he could not be crowned king because the <a href="Christianity%20in%20England">English Church</a> and the Papacy backed Henry. John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country. In a bid to take advantage of this, Henry encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the "Magna Carta", albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy. The move was not successful and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.

In February, Louis set sail for France to gather reinforcements. In his absence, arguments broke out between Louis's French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's war against the rebels was a religious crusade. This resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement, and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry's favour. Louis returned at the end of April and reinvigorated his campaign, splitting his forces into two groups, sending one north to besiege <a href="Lincoln%20Castle">Lincoln Castle</a> and keeping one in the south to capture <a href="Dover%20Castle">Dover Castle</a>. When he learnt that Louis had divided his army, William Marshal gambled on defeating the rebels in a single battle. William marched north and attacked <a href="Lincoln%2C%20England">Lincoln</a> on 20 May; entering through a side gate, he <a href="Battle%20of%20Lincoln%20%281217%29">took the city</a> in a sequence of fierce street battles and sacked the buildings. Large numbers of senior rebels were captured, and historian David Carpenter considers the battle to be "one of the most decisive in English history".
In the aftermath of Lincoln, the loyalist campaign stalled and only recommenced in late June when the victors had arranged the ransoming of their prisoners. Meanwhile, support for Louis's campaign was diminishing in France and he concluded that the war in England was lost. The French prince negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which he would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a> would be lifted and Henry's government would promise to enforce the "Magna Carta". The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion. In the absence of a settlement, Louis remained in London with his remaining forces.

On 24 August 1217, a French fleet arrived off the coast of <a href="Sandwich%2C%20Kent">Sandwich</a>, bringing Louis soldiers, <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s and fresh supplies. <a href="Hubert%20de%20Burgh%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Kent">Hubert de Burgh</a>, Henry's <a href="justiciar">justiciar</a>, set sail to intercept it, resulting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sandwich%20%281217%29">Battle of Sandwich</a>. De Burgh's fleet scattered the French and captured their flagship, commanded by <a href="Eustace%20the%20Monk">Eustace the Monk</a>, who was promptly executed. When the news reached Louis, he entered into fresh peace negotiations. 

Henry, Isabella, Louis, Guala and William came to agreement on the final <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lambeth">Treaty of Lambeth</a>, also known as the Treaty of Kingston, on the 12 and 13 September. The treaty was similar to the first peace offer, but excluded the rebel clergy, whose lands and appointments remained forfeit. Louis accepted a gift of £6,666 to speed his departure from England, and promised to try to persuade King Philip to return Henry's lands in France. Louis left England as agreed and joined the <a href="Albigensian%20Crusade">Albigensian Crusade</a> in the south of France.

With the end of the civil war, Henry's government faced the task of rebuilding royal authority across large parts of the country. By the end of 1217, many former rebels were routinely ignoring instructions from the centre, and even Henry's loyalist supporters jealously maintained their independent control over royal castles. Illegally constructed fortifications, called <a href="adulterine%20castle">adulterine castle</a>s, had sprung up across much of the country. The network of county <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a>s had collapsed, and with it the ability to raise taxes and collect royal revenues. The powerful Welsh <a href="Llywelyn%20the%20Great">Prince Llywelyn</a> posed a major threat in Wales and along the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh Marches</a>.

Despite his success in winning the war, William had far less success in restoring royal power following the peace. In part, this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons that they would be rewarded. William attempted to enforce the traditional rights of the Crown to approve marriages and wardships, but with little success. Nonetheless, William was able to reconstitute the royal bench of judges and reopen the royal <a href="exchequer">exchequer</a>. The government issued the <a href="Charter%20of%20the%20Forest">Charter of the Forest</a>, which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests. The regency and Llywelyn came to agreement on the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Worcester">Treaty of Worcester</a> in 1218, but its generous terms – Llywelyn became effectively Henry's justiciar across Wales – underlined the weakness of the English Crown.
Henry's mother was unable to establish a role for herself in the regency government and she returned to France in 1217, marrying <a href="Hugh%20X%20of%20Lusignan">Hugh de Lusignan</a>, a powerful Poitevin noble. William Marshal fell ill and died in April 1219. The replacement government was formed around a grouping of three senior ministers: <a href="Pandulf%20Verraccio">Pandulf</a>, the replacement Papal legate; Peter des Roches; and Hubert de Burgh, a former justiciar. The three were appointed by a great council of the nobility at Oxford, and their government came to depend on these councils for authority. Hubert and des Roches were political rivals, with Hubert supported by a network of English barons, and des Roches backed by nobles from the royal territories in Poitou and <a href="Touraine">Touraine</a>. Hubert moved decisively against des Roches in 1221, accusing him of treason and removing him as the King's guardian; the Bishop left England for the crusades. Pandulf was recalled by Rome the same year, leaving Hubert as the dominant force in Henry's government.

Initially the new government had little success, but in 1220, the fortunes of Henry's government began to improve. The Pope allowed Henry to be crowned for a second time, using a new set of royal regalia. The fresh coronation was intended to affirm the authority of the King; Henry promised to restore the powers of the Crown, and the barons swore that they would give back the royal castles and pay their debts to the Crown, on the threat of excommunication. Hubert, accompanied by Henry, moved into Wales to suppress Llywelyn in 1223, and in England his forces steadily reclaimed Henry's castles. The effort against the remaining recalcitrant barons came to a head in 1224 with the siege of <a href="Bedford%20Castle">Bedford Castle</a>, which Henry and Hubert besieged for eight weeks; when it finally fell, almost all of the garrison were executed.

Meanwhile, Louis VIII of France allied himself with Hugh de Lusignan and invaded first Poitou and then Gascony. Henry's army in Poitou was under-resourced and lacked support from the Poitevin barons, many of whom had felt abandoned during the years of Henry's minority; as a result, the province quickly fell. It became clear that Gascony would also fall unless reinforcements were sent from England. In early 1225 a great council approved a tax of £40,000 to dispatch an army, which quickly retook Gascony. In exchange for agreeing to support Henry, the barons demanded that the King reissue the "Magna Carta" and the Charter of the Forest. This time the King declared that the charters were issued of his own "spontaneous and free will" and confirmed them with the royal seal, giving the new <a href="Magna%20Carta%23The%20Great%20Charter%201225">Great Charter</a> and the Charter of the Forest of 1225 much more authority than any previous versions. The barons anticipated that the King would act in accordance with these definitive charters, subject to the law and moderated by the advice of the nobility.

Henry assumed formal control of his government in January 1227, although some contemporaries argued that he was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday the following year. The King richly rewarded Hubert de Burgh for his service during his minority years, making him the <a href="Earl%20of%20Kent">Earl of Kent</a> and giving him extensive lands across England and Wales. Despite coming of age, Henry remained heavily influenced by his advisers for the first few years of his rule and retained Hubert as his justiciar to run the government, granting him the position for life.

The fate of Henry's family lands in France still remained uncertain. Reclaiming these lands was extremely important to Henry, who used terms such as "reclaiming his inheritance", "restoring his rights" and "defending his legal claims" to the territories in diplomatic correspondence. The French kings had an increasing financial, and thus military, advantage over Henry. Even under John, the French Crown had enjoyed a considerable, although not overwhelming, advantage in resources, but since then, the balance had shifted further, with the ordinary annual income of the French kings almost doubling between 1204 and 1221.

Louis VIII died in 1226, leaving his 12-year-old son, <a href="Louis%20IX">Louis IX</a>, to inherit the throne, supported by a regency government. The young French King was in a much weaker position than his father, and faced opposition from many of the French nobility who still maintained their ties to England, leading to a sequence of revolts across the country. Against this background, in late 1228 a group of potential Norman and Angevin rebels called upon Henry to invade and reclaim his inheritance, and <a href="Peter%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Peter de Dreux</a>, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Brittany">Duke of Brittany</a>, openly revolted against Louis and gave his homage to Henry.

Henry's preparations for an invasion progressed slowly, and when he finally arrived in Brittany with an army in May 1230, the campaign did not go well. Possibly on the advice of Hubert, the King decided to avoid battle with the French by not invading Normandy and instead marching south into Poitou, where he campaigned ineffectually over the summer, before finally progressing safely onto Gascony. He made a truce with Louis until 1234 and returned to England having achieved nothing; historian Huw Ridgeway describes the expedition as a "costly fiasco".

Henry's chief minister, Hubert de Burgh fell from power in 1232. His old rival, Peter des Roches, returned to England from the crusades in August 1231 and allied himself with Hubert's growing number of political opponents. He put the case to Henry that the Justiciar had squandered royal money and lands, and was responsible for a series of riots against foreign clerics. Hubert took sanctuary in <a href="Merton%20College%20Chapel">Merton College Chapel</a>, but Henry had him arrested and imprisoned in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. Des Roches took over the King's government, backed by the Poitevin baronial faction in England, who saw this as a chance to take back the lands which they had lost to Hubert's followers in the previous decades.

Des Roches used his new authority to begin stripping his opponents of their estates, circumventing the courts and legal process. Complaints from powerful barons such as William Marshal's son <a href="Richard%20Marshal%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Richard</a> grew, and they argued that Henry was failing to protect their legal rights as described in the 1225 charters. A fresh civil war broke out between des Roches and Richard's followers. Des Roches sent armies into Richard's lands in Ireland and <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a>. In response, Richard allied himself with Prince Llywelyn, and his own supporters rose up in rebellion in England. Henry was unable to gain a clear military advantage and became concerned that Louis of France might seize the opportunity to invade Brittany – where the truce was about to expire – while he was distracted at home.

<a href="Edmund%20Rich">Edmund Rich</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, intervened in 1234 and held several great councils, advising Henry to accept the dismissal of des Roches. Henry agreed to make peace, but, before the negotiations were completed, Richard died of wounds suffered in battle, leaving his younger brother <a href="Gilbert%20Marshal%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Gilbert</a> to inherit his lands. The final settlement was confirmed in May, and Henry was widely praised for his humility in submitting to the slightly embarrassing peace. Meanwhile, the truce with France in Brittany finally expired, and Henry's ally Duke Peter came under fresh military pressure. Henry could only send a small force of soldiers to assist, and Brittany fell to Louis in November. For the next 24 years, Henry ruled the kingdom personally, rather than through senior ministers.

Royal government in England had traditionally centred on several great offices of state, filled by powerful, independent members of the baronage. Henry abandoned this policy, leaving the post of justiciar vacant and turning the position of <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">chancellor</a> into a more junior role. A small royal council was formed but its role was ill-defined; appointments, patronage, and policy were decided personally by Henry and his immediate advisers, rather than through the larger councils that had marked his early years. The changes made it much harder for those outside Henry's inner circle to influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances, particularly against the King's friends.

Henry believed that kings should rule England in a dignified manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual. He thought that his predecessors had allowed the status of the Crown to decline, and sought to correct this during his reign. The events of the civil war in Henry's youth deeply affected the King, and he adopted <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> as his <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a>, hoping to emulate the way in which the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> King had brought peace to England and reunited his people in order and harmony. Henry tried to use his royal authority leniently, hoping to appease the more hostile barons and maintain peace in England.

As a result, despite a symbolic emphasis on royal power, Henry's rule was relatively circumscribed and constitutional. He generally acted within the terms of the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters over the course of his rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.

The term "<a href="Parliament%20of%20England">parliament</a>" first appeared in the 1230s and 1240s to describe large gatherings of the royal court, and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout Henry's reign. They were used to agree upon the raising of taxes which, in the 13th century, were single, one-off levies, typically on <a href="movable%20property">movable property</a>, intended to support the King's normal revenues for particular projects. During Henry's reign, the counties began to send regular delegations to these parliaments, and came to represent a broader cross-section of the community than simply the major barons.

Despite the various charters, the provision of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions, the problem would simply be ignored. The royal <a href="Eyre%20%28legal%20term%29">eyres</a>, courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. 

The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry's reign. They were now often lesser men appointed by the exchequer, rather than coming from important local families, and they focused on generating revenue for the King. Their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among the lower classes. Unlike his father, Henry did not exploit the large debts that the barons frequently owed to the Crown, and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him.

The royal court was formed round Henry's trusted friends, such as <a href="Richard%20de%20Clare%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Richard de Clare</a>, the brothers <a href="Hugh%20Bigod%20%28Justiciar%29">Hugh</a> and <a href="Roger%20Bigod%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Roger Bigod</a> and <a href="Humphrey%20de%20Bohun%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">Humphrey de Bohun</a> and Henry's brother, Richard. Henry wanted to use his court to unite his English and continental subjects, and it included <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Simon de Montfort</a>, originally a French knight who had married Henry's sister Eleanor and become the <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Earl of Leicester</a>, in addition to the later influxes of Henry's <a href="County%20of%20Savoy">Savoyard</a> and <a href="County%20of%20La%20Marche">Lusignan</a> relatives. The court followed European styles and traditions, and was heavily influenced by Henry's Angevin family traditions: French was the spoken language, it had close links to the royal courts of France, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>, the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Sicily</a>, and Henry sponsored the same writers as the other European rulers.

Henry travelled less than previous kings, seeking a tranquil, more sedate life and staying at each of his palaces for prolonged periods before moving on. Possibly as a result, he focused more attention on his palaces and houses; Henry was, according to architectural historian <a href="John%20Goodall%20%28author%29">John Goodall</a>, "the most obsessive patron of art and architecture ever to have occupied the throne of England". Henry extended the royal complex at <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Westminster</a> in London, one of his favourite homes, rebuilding the palace and the abbey at a cost of almost £55,000. He spent more time in Westminster than any of his predecessors, shaping the formation of England's capital city.

He spent £58,000 on his royal castles, carrying out major works at the Tower of London, Lincoln and Dover. Both the military defences and the internal accommodation of these castles were significantly improved. At <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor</a>, a huge overhaul of the castle produced a lavish palace complex, whose style and detail inspired many subsequent designs in England and Wales. The Tower of London was extended to form a concentric fortress with extensive living quarters, although Henry primarily used the castle as a secure retreat in the event of war or civil strife. Henry also kept a <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a> at the Tower, a tradition begun by his father, and his exotic specimens included an elephant, a leopard and a camel.

Henry reformed the <a href="History%20of%20the%20English%20penny%20%281154%E2%80%931485%29">system of silver coins</a> in England in 1247, replacing the older <a href="Short%20cross%20penny">Short Cross</a> silver pennies with a new <a href="Long%20cross%20penny">Long Cross</a> design. Due to the initial costs of the transition, Henry required the financial help of his brother Richard to undertake this reform, but the recoinage occurred quickly and efficiently. Between 1243 and 1258, the King assembled two great <a href="hoard">hoard</a>s, or stockpiles, of gold. In 1257, Henry needed to spend the second of these hoards urgently and, rather than selling the gold quickly and depressing its value, Henry decided to introduce gold pennies into England, following the popular trend in Italy. The gold pennies resembled the <a href="History%20of%20the%20English%20penny%20%28c.%20600%20%E2%80%93%201066%29%23Edgar%E2%80%99s%20reform%2C%20c.%20973%20and%20the%20late%20Anglo-Saxon%20coinage">gold coins</a> issued by Edward the Confessor, but the overvalued currency attracted complaints from the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> and was ultimately abandoned.

Henry was known for his public demonstrations of <a href="piety">piety</a>, and appears to have been genuinely devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a> at least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have <a href="foot%20washing">washed the feet</a> of <a href="leper">leper</a>s. Henry regularly went on <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>s, particularly to the abbeys of <a href="Bromholm%20Priory">Bromholm</a>, <a href="St%20Albans%20Abbey">St Albans</a> and <a href="Walsingham%20Priory">Walsingham Priory</a>, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.

Henry shared many of his religious views with Louis of France, and the two men appear to have been slightly competitive in their piety. Towards the end of his reign, Henry may have taken up the practice of curing sufferers of <a href="Tuberculous%20cervical%20lymphadenitis">scrofula</a>, often called "the King's evil", by <a href="royal%20touch">touching them</a>, possibly emulating Louis, who also took up the practice. Louis had a famous collection of <a href="Relics%20associated%20with%20Jesus">Passion Relics</a> which he stored at <a href="Sainte-Chapelle">Sainte-Chapelle</a>, and paraded the <a href="True%20Cross">Holy Cross</a> through Paris in 1241; Henry took possession of the <a href="relic%20of%20the%20Holy%20Blood">relic of the Holy Blood</a> in 1247, marching it through Westminster to be installed in Westminster Abbey, which he promoted as an alternative to the Sainte-Chapelle.

Henry was particularly supportive of the <a href="mendicant%20orders">mendicant orders</a>; his <a href="confessor">confessor</a>s were drawn from the <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican Friars</a>, and he built mendicant houses in <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>, <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> and <a href="York">York</a>, helping to find valuable space for new buildings in what were already crowded towns and cities. He supported the <a href="Military%20order%20%28society%29">military crusading orders</a>, and became a patron of the <a href="Teutonic%20Order">Teutonic Order</a> in 1235. The emerging universities of <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> also received royal attention: Henry reinforced and regulated their powers, and encouraged scholars to migrate from <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Paris</a> to teach at them. A <a href="University%20of%20Northampton%20%2813th%20century%29">rival institution at Northampton</a> was declared by the King to be a mere school and not a true university.

The support given to Henry by the Papacy during his early years had a lasting influence on his attitude towards Rome, and he defended the mother church diligently throughout his reign. Rome in the 13th century was at once both the centre of the Europe-wide Church, and a political power in central Italy, threatened militarily by the Holy Roman Empire. During Henry's reign, the Papacy developed a strong, central bureaucracy, supported by benefices granted to absent churchmen working in Rome. Tensions grew between this practice and the needs of local parishioners, exemplified by the dispute between <a href="Robert%20Grosseteste">Robert Grosseteste</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, and the Papacy in 1250. 

Although the Scottish Church became more independent of England during the period, the Papal Legates helped Henry continue to apply influence over its activities at a distance. Pope <a href="Innocent%20IV">Innocent IV</a>'s attempts to raise funds began to face opposition from within the English Church during Henry's reign. In 1240, the Papal emissary's collection of taxes to pay for the Papacy's war with <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II</a> resulted in protests, ultimately overcome with the help of Henry and the Pope, and in the 1250s Henry's crusading <a href="tithe">tithe</a>s faced similar resistance.

The <a href="Jews">Jews</a> of England were considered the property of the Crown, and they had traditionally been used as a source of <a href="Economy%20of%20England%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages%23Jewish%20contribution%20to%20the%20English%20economy">cheap loans and easy taxation</a>, in exchange for royal protection against <a href="antisemitism%23Persecutions%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">antisemitism</a>. The Jews had suffered considerable oppression during the First Barons' War, but during Henry's early years the community had flourished and became one of the most prosperous in Europe. This was primarily the result of the stance taken by the regency government, which took a range of measures to protect the Jews and encourage lending. This was driven by financial self-interest, as they stood to profit considerably from a strong Jewish community in England. Their policy ran counter to the instructions being sent from the Pope, who had laid out strong anti-Jewish measures at the <a href="Fourth%20Lateran%20Council">Fourth Lateran Council</a> in 1215; William Marshal continued with his policy despite complaints from the Church.

In 1239 Henry introduced different policies, possibly trying to imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned and forced to pay fines equivalent to a third of their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially. The financial pressure Henry placed on the Jews caused them to force repayment of loans, fuelling anti-Jewish resentment. A particular grievance among smaller landowners such as knights was the sale of Jewish bonds, which were bought and used by richer Barons and members of Henry's royal circle as a means to acquire lands of lesser landholders, through payment defaults.

Henry had built the "<a href="Domus%20Conversorum">Domus Conversorum</a>" in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239. As many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s in large part due to their deteriorating economic conditions. Many anti-Jewish stories involving <a href="Blood%20libel">tales of child sacrifice</a> circulated in the 1230s–50s, including the account of "<a href="Little%20Saint%20Hugh%20of%20Lincoln">Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln</a>" in 1255. The event is considered particularly significant, as the first such accusation endorsed by the Crown. Henry intervened to order the execution of Copin, who had confessed to the murder in return for his life, and removed 91 Jews to the Tower of London. 18 were executed, and their property expropriated by the Crown. At the time, the Jews were mortgaged to Richard of Cornwall, who intervened to release the Jews that were not executed, probably also with the backing of Dominican or Franciscan friars.

Henry passed the <a href="Statute%20of%20Jewry">Statute of Jewry</a> in 1253, which attempted to stop the construction of synagogues and enforce the wearing of <a href="Jewish%20badge">Jewish badge</a>s, in line with existing Church pronouncements; it remains unclear to what extent the King actually implemented the statute. By 1258, Henry's Jewish policies were regarded as confused and were increasingly unpopular amongst the barons. Taken together, Henry's policies up to 1258 of excessive Jewish taxation, anti-Jewish legislation and propaganda caused a very important and negative change.

Henry investigated a range of potential marriage partners in his youth, but they all proved unsuitable for reasons of European and domestic politics. In 1236 he finally married <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Provence">Eleanor of Provence</a>, the daughter of <a href="Ramon%20Berenguer%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Provence">Raymond-Berengar</a>, the <a href="Count%20of%20Provence">Count of Provence</a>, and <a href="Beatrice%20of%20Savoy">Beatrice of Savoy</a>. Eleanor was well-mannered, cultured and articulate, but the primary reason for the marriage was political, as Henry stood to create a valuable set of alliances with the rulers of the south and south-east of France. Over the coming years, Eleanor emerged as a hard-headed, firm politician. Historians Margaret Howell and David Carpenter describe her as being "more combative" and "far tougher and more determined" than her husband.

The marriage contract was confirmed in 1235 and Eleanor travelled to England to meet Henry for the first time. The pair were married at <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> in January 1236, and Eleanor was crowned queen at Westminster shortly afterwards in a lavish ceremony planned by Henry. There was a substantial age gap between the couple – Henry was 28, Eleanor only 12 – but historian Margaret Howell observes that the King "was generous and warm-hearted and prepared to lavish care and affection on his wife". Henry gave Eleanor extensive gifts and paid personal attention to establishing and equipping her household. He also brought her fully into his religious life, including involving her in his devotion to Edward the Confessor.

Despite initial concerns that the Queen might be barren, Henry and Eleanor had five children together. In 1239 Eleanor gave birth to their first child, <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward</a>, named after the Confessor. Henry was overjoyed and held huge celebrations, giving lavishly to the Church and to the poor to encourage God to protect his young son. Their first daughter, <a href="Margaret%20of%20England">Margaret</a>, named after <a href="Margaret%20of%20Provence">Eleanor's sister</a>, followed in 1240, her birth also accompanied by celebrations and donations to the poor. Henry's third child, <a href="Beatrice%20of%20England">Beatrice</a>, was named after his mother-in-law, and born in 1242 during a <a href="Saintonge%20War">campaign in Poitou</a>. 

Their fourth child, <a href="Edmund%20Crouchback">Edmund</a>, arrived in 1245 and was named after <a href="Edmund%20the%20Martyr">the 9th-century saint</a>. Concerned about Eleanor's health, Henry donated large amounts of money to the Church throughout the pregnancy. A third daughter, <a href="Katherine%20of%20England">Katherine</a>, was born in 1253 but soon fell ill, possibly the result of a <a href="Degenerative%20disease">degenerative disorder</a> such as <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a>, and was unable to speak. She died in 1257 and Henry was distraught. Henry's children spent most of their childhood at Windsor Castle and he appears to have been extremely attached to them, rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family.

After Eleanor's marriage, many of her Savoyard relatives joined her in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from <a href="Savoy">Savoy</a>, <a href="Burgundy">Burgundy</a> and <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, including Eleanor's uncles: <a href="Boniface%20of%20Savoy%20%28bishop%29">Boniface</a> became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and <a href="William%20of%20Savoy">William</a> became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages for many of them into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.

In 1241, the barons in Poitou, including Henry's step-father Hugh de Lusignan, rebelled against the rule of Louis of France. The rebels had counted on aid from Henry, but he lacked domestic support and was slow to mobilise an army, not arriving in France until the next summer. Henry's campaign was hesitant and was further undermined by Hugh switching sides and returning to support Louis. On 20 May Henry's army was <a href="Battle%20of%20Taillebourg">surrounded by the French</a> at <a href="Taillebourg%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Taillebourg</a>. Henry's brother Richard persuaded the French to delay their attack and the King took the opportunity to escape to Bordeaux. 

Simon de Montfort, who fought a successful rearguard action during the withdrawal, was furious with the King's incompetence and told Henry that he should be locked up like the 10th-century Carolingian king <a href="Charles%20the%20Simple">Charles the Simple</a>. The Poitou rebellion collapsed and Henry entered into a fresh five-year truce. His campaign had been a disastrous failure and had cost over £80,000.

In the aftermath of the revolt, French power extended throughout Poitou, threatening the interests of the Lusignan family. In 1247 Henry encouraged his relatives to travel to England, where they were rewarded with large estates, largely at the expense of the English barons. More Poitevins followed, until around 100 had settled in England, around two-thirds of them being granted substantial incomes worth £66 or more by Henry. Henry encouraged some to help him on the continent; others acted as mercenaries and diplomatic agents, or fought on Henry's behalf in European campaigns. Many were given estates along the contested Welsh Marches, or in Ireland, where they protected the frontiers. For Henry, the community was an important symbol of his hopes to one day reconquer Poitou and the rest of his French lands, and many of the Lusignans became close friends with his son Edward.

The presence of Henry's extended family in England proved controversial. Concerns were raised by contemporary chroniclers – especially in works of Roger de Wendover and Matthew Paris – about the number of foreigners in England and historian Martin Aurell notes the xenophobic overtones of their commentary. The term "Poitevins" became loosely applied to this grouping, although many came from Anjou and other parts of France, and by the 1250s there was a fierce rivalry between the relatively well established Savoyards and the newly arrived Poitevins. The Lusignans began to break the law with impunity, pursuing personal grievances against other barons and the Savoyards, and Henry took little or no action to restrain them. By 1258, the general dislike of the Poitevins had turned into hatred, with Simon de Montfort one of their strongest critics.

Henry's position in Wales was strengthened during the first two decades of his personal rule. Following the death of Llywelyn the Great in 1240, Henry's power in Wales expanded. Three military campaigns were carried out in the 1240s, new castles were constructed and the royal lands in the <a href="County%20of%20Chester">County of Chester</a> were expanded, increasing Henry's dominance over the Welsh princes. <a href="Dafydd%20ap%20Llywelyn">Dafydd</a>, Llywelyn's son, resisted the incursions, but died in 1246, and Henry confirmed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Woodstock">Treaty of Woodstock</a> the following year with <a href="Owain%20Goch%20ap%20Gruffydd">Owain</a> and <a href="Llywelyn%20ap%20Gruffudd">Llywelyn ap Gruffudd</a>, Llywelyn the Great's grandsons, under which they ceded land to the King but retained the heart of their princedom in <a href="Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a>. 

In South Wales, Henry gradually extended his authority across the region, but the campaigns were not pursued with vigour and the King did little to stop the Marcher territories along the border becoming increasingly independent of the Crown. In 1256, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd rebelled against Henry and widespread violence spread across Wales. Henry promised a swift military response but did not carry through on his threats.

Ireland was important to Henry, both as a source of royal revenue – an average of £1,150 was sent from Ireland to the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters. The major landowners looked eastwards towards Henry's court for political leadership, and many also possessed estates in Wales and England. The 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among the barons, enabling Henry to redistribute Irish lands to his supporters. 

In the 1250s, the King gave out numerous grants of land along the frontier in Ireland to his supporters, creating a buffer zone against the <a href="Irish%20people">native Irish</a>. The local <a href="List%20of%20High%20Kings%20of%20Ireland">Irish kings</a> began to suffer increased harassment as English power increased across the region. These lands were in many cases unprofitable for the barons to hold and English power reached its zenith under Henry for the medieval period. In 1254, Henry granted Ireland to his son, Edward, on condition that it would never be separated from the Crown.

Henry maintained peace with Scotland during his reign, where he was the feudal lord of <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Scotland">Alexander II</a>. Henry assumed that he had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought up the issue of his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments, but he lacked the inclination or the resources to do much more. Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat. Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20York">Treaty of York</a> in 1237, Henry had a secure northern frontier. Henry knighted <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">Alexander III</a> before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship. Henry had Alexander and Margaret rescued from <a href="Edinburgh%20Castle">Edinburgh Castle</a> when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage Alexander's government during the rest of his minority years.

Henry had no further opportunities to reconquer his possessions in France after the collapse of his military campaign at the <a href="battle%20of%20Taillebourg">battle of Taillebourg</a>. Henry's resources were quite inadequate in comparison to those of the French Crown, and by the end of the 1240s it was clear that King Louis had become the preeminent power across France. Henry instead adopted what historian <a href="Michael%20Clanchy">Michael Clanchy</a> has described as a "European strategy", attempting to regain his lands in France through diplomacy rather than force, building alliances with other states prepared to put military pressure on the French King. In particular, Henry cultivated <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick II</a>, hoping he would turn against Louis or allow his nobility to join Henry's campaigns. In the process, Henry's attention became increasingly focused on European politics and events rather than domestic affairs.

Crusading was a popular cause in the 13th century, and in 1248 Louis joined the ill-fated <a href="Seventh%20Crusade">Seventh Crusade</a>, having first made a fresh truce with England and received assurances from the Pope that he would protect his lands against any attack by Henry. Henry might have joined this crusade himself, but the rivalry between the two kings made this impossible and, after Louis's defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Al%20Mansurah">Battle of Al Mansurah</a> in 1250, Henry instead announced that he would be undertaking his own crusade to the Levant. The King began to make arrangements for passage with friendly rulers around the Levant, imposing efficiency savings on the royal household and arranging for ships and transport: he appeared almost over-eager to take part. Henry's plans reflected his strong religious beliefs, but they also stood to give him additional international credibility when arguing for the return of his possessions in France.

Henry's crusade never departed, as he was forced to deal with problems in Gascony, where the harsh policies of the King's lieutenant, Simon de Montfort, had provoked a violent uprising in 1252, which was supported by King <a href="Alfonso%20X%20of%20Castile">Alfonso X</a> of neighbouring Castile. The English court was split over the problem: Simon and Eleanor argued that the Gascons were to blame for the crisis, while Henry, backed by the Lusignans, blamed Simon's misjudgment. Henry and Eleanor quarrelled over the issue and were not reconciled until the following year. Forced to intervene personally, Henry carried out an effective, if expensive, campaign with the help of the Lusignans and stabilised the province. Alfonso signed a treaty of alliance in 1254, and Gascony was given to Henry's son Edward, who married Alfonso's half-sister Eleanor, delivering a long-lasting peace with Castile.

On the way back from Gascony, Henry met with Louis for the first time in an arrangement brokered by their wives, and the two kings became close friends. The Gascon campaign cost more than £200,000 and used up all the money intended for Henry's crusade, leaving him heavily in debt and reliant on loans from his brother Richard and the Lusignans.

Henry did not give up on his hopes for a crusade, but became increasingly absorbed in a bid to acquire the wealthy <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Kingdom of Sicily</a> for his son Edmund. Sicily had been controlled by Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire, for many years a rival of Pope Innocent IV. On Frederick's death in 1250, Innocent started to look for a new ruler, one more amenable to the Papacy. Henry saw Sicily as both a valuable prize for his son and as an excellent base for his crusading plans in the east. With minimal consultation within his court, Henry came to an agreement with the Pope in 1254 that Edmund should be the next king. Innocent urged Henry to send Edmund with an army to reclaim Sicily from Frederick's son <a href="Manfred%2C%20King%20of%20Sicily">Manfred</a>, offering to contribute to the expenses of the campaign.

Innocent was succeeded by <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20IV">Alexander IV</a>, who was facing increasing military pressure from the Empire. He could no longer afford to pay Henry's expenses, instead demanding that Henry compensate the Papacy for the £90,000 spent on the war so far. This was a huge sum, and Henry turned to parliament for help in 1255, only to be rebuffed. Further attempts followed, but by 1257 only partial parliamentary assistance had been offered. 

Alexander grew increasingly unhappy about Henry's procrastinations and in 1258 sent an envoy to England, threatening to excommunicate Henry if he did not first pay his debts to the Papacy and then send the promised army to Sicily. Parliament again refused to assist the King in raising this money. Instead Henry turned to extorting money from the senior clergy, who were forced to sign blank charters, promising to pay effectively unlimited sums of money in support of the King's efforts, raising around £40,000. The English Church felt the money was wasted, vanishing into the long-running war in Italy.

Meanwhile, Henry attempted to influence the outcomes of the elections in the Holy Roman Empire, which would appoint a new <a href="King%20of%20the%20Romans">King of the Romans</a>. When the more prominent German candidates failed to gain traction, Henry began to back his brother Richard's candidature, giving donations to his potential supporters in the Empire. Richard was elected in 1256 with expectations of possibly being crowned the Holy Roman Emperor, but continued to play a major role in English politics. His election faced a mixed response in England; Richard was believed to provide moderate, sensible counsel and his presence was missed by the English barons, but he also faced criticism, probably incorrectly, for funding his German campaign at England's expense. Although Henry now had increased support in the Empire for a potential alliance against Louis of France, the two kings were now moving towards potentially settling their disputes peacefully; for Henry, a peace treaty could allow him to focus on Sicily and his crusade.

In 1258, Henry faced a revolt among the English barons. Anger had grown about the way the King's officials were raising funds, the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy, resentment of abuse of purchased Jewish loans, even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland. 

Henry was also critically short of money. Although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy. Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes. To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed. Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems.

The discontent finally erupted in April, when seven of the major English and Savoyard barons – Simon de Montfort, Roger and Hugh Bigod, <a href="John%20Fitzgeoffrey">John Fitzgeoffrey</a>, <a href="Peter%20de%20Montfort">Peter de Montfort</a>, Peter de Savoy and Richard de Clare – secretly formed an alliance to expel the Lusignans from court, a move probably quietly supported by the Queen. On 30 April, Roger Bigod marched into Westminster in the middle of the King's parliament, backed by his co-conspirators, and carried out a coup d'état. Henry, fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned, agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen, half chosen by the King and half by the barons. His own nominees to the council drew heavily on the hated Lusignans.

The pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a fresh parliament met in June, passing a set of measures known as the <a href="Provisions%20of%20Oxford">Provisions of Oxford</a>, which Henry swore to uphold. These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then had the power to appoint England's justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triannual parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons. The elected council included representatives of the Savoyard faction but no Poitevins, and the new government immediately took steps to exile the leading Lusignans and to seize key castles across the country.

The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident. De Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown; others, such as Hugh Bigod, promoted only moderate change, while the conservative barons, such as de Clare, expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King's powers. Henry's son, Edward, initially opposed the revolution, but then allied himself with de Montfort, helping him to pass the radical <a href="Provisions%20of%20Westminster">Provisions of Westminster</a> in 1259, which introduced further limits on the major barons and local royal officials.

Over the next four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England, and power swung back and forth between the different factions. One of the priorities for the new regime was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, at the end of 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281259%29">peace treaty</a> with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government. Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.

When de Montfort returned to England, Henry, supported by Eleanor, remained in Paris where he seized the opportunity to reassert royal authority and began to issue royal orders independently of the barons. Henry finally returned to retake power in England in April 1260, where conflict was brewing between de Clare's forces and those of de Montfort and Edward. Henry's brother Richard mediated between the parties and averted a military confrontation; Edward was reconciled with his father and de Montfort was put on trial for his actions against the King. Henry was unable to maintain his grip on power, and in October a coalition headed by de Montfort, de Clare and Edward briefly seized back control; within months their baronial council had collapsed into chaos as well.

Henry continued to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with <a href="Pope%20Urban%20IV">Pope Urban IV</a>, hoping to be absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford. In June 1261, the King announced that Rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter-coup with the support of Edward. He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles. The baronial opposition, led by de Montfort and de Clare, were temporarily reunited in their opposition to Henry's actions, convening their own parliament, independent of the King, and establishing a rival system of local government across England. Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army. Facing the threat of open civil war, the barons backed down: de Clare switched sides once again, de Montfort left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed.

Henry's government relied primarily on Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters, and it proved short-lived. He attempted to settle the crisis permanently by forcing the barons to agree to the Treaty of Kingston. This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise. Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy. He had done nothing significant to deal with the concerns over Baronial and royal abuse of Jewish debts. Henry's government was weakened by the death of de Clare, as his heir, Gilbert, sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them as legitimate. By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war.

De Montfort returned to England in April 1263 and convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue a renewed anti-Poitevin agenda. Revolt broke out shortly afterwards in the Welsh Marches and, by October, England faced a likely civil war between Henry, backed by Edward, Bigod and the conservative barons, and de Montfort, de Clare and the radicals. The rebels leveraged concern among knights over abuse of Jewish loans, who feared losing their lands, a problem Henry had done much to create and nothing to solve. In each case following, the rebels employed violence and killings in a deliberate attempt to destroy the records of their debts to Jewish lenders. 

De Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt, where 500 Jews died. Henry and Eleanor were trapped in the Tower of London by the rebels. The Queen attempted to escape up the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> to join Edward's army at Windsor, but was forced to retreat by the London crowds. De Montfort took the pair prisoner, and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry's name, the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own, trusted men. 

De Montfort's coalition began to quickly fragment, Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England. Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute, as had been laid out in the Treaty of Kingston; de Montfort was initially hostile to this idea, but, as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well. Henry went to Paris in person, accompanied by de Montfort's representatives. Initially de Montfort's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the <a href="Mise%20of%20Amiens">Mise of Amiens</a>, condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford. Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons, but was also influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope. Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements, Henry returned to England in February 1264, where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision.

The <a href="Second%20Barons%27%20War">Second Barons' War</a> finally broke out in April 1264, when Henry led an army into de Montfort's territories in the Midlands, and then advanced south-east to re-occupy the important route to France. Becoming desperate, de Montfort marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lewes">Battle of Lewes</a> on 14 May. Despite their numerical superiority, Henry's forces were overwhelmed. His brother Richard was captured, and Henry and Edward retreated to the local priory and surrendered the following day. Henry was forced to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the Provisions of Oxford, leaving him, as historian Adrian Jobson describes, "little more than a figurehead". With Henry's power diminished, de Montfort cancelled many debts and interest owed to Jews, including those held by his baronial supporters.

De Montfort was unable to consolidate his victory and widespread disorder persisted across the country. In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England with the support of Louis, while Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army. Edward pursued de Montfort's forces through the Marches, before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then turning once more on the rebel leader himself. De Montfort, accompanied by the captive Henry, was unable to retreat and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Evesham">Battle of Evesham</a> ensued. 

Edward was triumphant and de Montfort's corpse was mutilated by the victors. Henry, who was wearing borrowed armour, was almost killed by Edward's forces during the fighting before they recognised the King and escorted him to safety. In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on, with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth, which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266. They continued targeting Jews and their debt records. The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up, and the final rebels, holed up in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Ely">Isle of Ely</a>, surrendered in July 1267, marking the end of the war.

Henry quickly took revenge on his enemies after the Battle of Evesham. He immediately ordered the <a href="Sequestration%20%28law%29">sequestration</a> of all the rebel lands, triggering a wave of chaotic looting across the country. Henry initially rejected any calls for moderation, but in October 1266 he was persuaded by the Papal Legate, <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20V">Ottobuono de' Fieschi</a>, to issue a less draconian policy, called the <a href="Dictum%20of%20Kenilworth">Dictum of Kenilworth</a>, which allowed for the return of the rebels' lands, in exchange for the payment of harsh fines. The <a href="Statute%20of%20Marlborough">Statute of Marlborough</a> followed in November 1267, which effectively reissued much of the Provisions of Westminster, placing limitations on the powers of local royal officials and the major barons, but without restricting central royal authority. Most of the exiled Poitevins began to return to England after the war. In September 1267 Henry made the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Montgomery">Treaty of Montgomery</a> with Llywelyn, recognising him as the Prince of Wales and giving substantial land concessions.

In the final years of his reign, Henry was increasingly infirm and focused on securing peace within the kingdom and his own religious devotions. Edward became the Steward of England and began to play a more prominent role in government. Henry's finances were in a precarious state as a result of the war, and when Edward decided to join the crusades in 1268 it became clear that fresh taxes were necessary. Henry was concerned that Edward's absence might encourage further revolts, but was swayed by his son to negotiate with multiple parliaments over the next two years to raise the money. 

Although Henry had initially reversed de Montfort's anti-Jewish policies, including attempting to restore the debts owed to Jews where these could be proven, he faced pressure from parliament to introduced restrictions on Jewish bonds, particularly their sale to Christians, in the final years of his reign in return for financing. Henry continued to invest in Westminster Abbey, which became a replacement for the Angevin mausoleum at <a href="Fontevraud%20Abbey">Fontevraud Abbey</a>, and in 1269 he oversaw a grand ceremony to rebury Edward the Confessor in a lavish new shrine, personally helping to carry the body to its new resting place.

Edward left for the <a href="Eighth%20Crusade">Eighth Crusade</a>, led by Louis of France, in 1270, but Henry became increasingly ill; concerns about a fresh rebellion grew and the next year the King wrote to his son asking him to return to England, but Edward did not turn back. Henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself, but he never regained his full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272, Henry died in Westminster, probably with Eleanor in attendance. He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.

At his request, Henry was buried in Westminster Abbey in front of the church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor. A few years later, work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current location in Westminster Abbey. His <a href="gilding">gilt</a>-<a href="brass">brass</a> funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by <a href="William%20Torell">William Torell</a>; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">naturalistic</a> in style, but it is probably not a close likeness of Henry himself.

Eleanor probably hoped that Henry would be recognised as a saint, as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled the shrine of a saint, complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics. When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry's long beard remained well preserved, which at the time was considered to be an indication of saintly purity. Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories. The reports ceased, and Henry was never <a href="Canonization">canonised</a>. In 1292 Henry's heart was removed from his tomb and reburied at Fontevraud Abbey with the bodies of his Angevin family.

The first histories of Henry's reign emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries, relying primarily on the accounts of medieval chroniclers, in particular writings of <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a>. These early historians, including Archbishop <a href="Matthew%20Parker">Matthew Parker</a>, were influenced by contemporary concerns about the roles of the Church and state, and examined the changing nature of kingship under Henry, the emergence of English nationalism during the period and what they perceived to be the malign influence of the Papacy. During the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, historians also drew parallels between Henry's experiences and those of the deposed <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>.

By the 19th century, Victorian scholars such as <a href="William%20Stubbs">William Stubbs</a>, James Ramsay, and <a href="William%20Hunt%20%28priest%29">William Hunt</a> sought to understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as <a href="Kate%20Norgate">Kate Norgate</a>'s 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.

After 1900, the financial and official records from Henry's reign began to become accessible to historians, including the <a href="pipe%20rolls">pipe rolls</a>, court records, correspondence and records of administration of the royal forests. <a href="Thomas%20Frederick%20Tout">Thomas Tout</a> made extensive use of these new sources in the 1920s, and post-war historians brought a particular focus on the finances of Henry's government, highlighting his fiscal difficulties. This wave of research culminated in Sir <a href="F.%20M.%20Powicke">Maurice Powicke</a>'s two major biographical works on Henry, published in 1948 and 1953, which formed the established history of the King for the next three decades.

Henry's reign did not receive much attention from historians for many years after the 1950s: no substantial biographies of Henry were written after Powicke's, and the historian John Beeler observed in the 1970s that the coverage of Henry's reign by military historians remained particularly thin. At the end of the 20th century, there was a renewed interest in 13th-century English history, resulting in the publication of various specialist works on aspects of Henry's reign, including government finance and the period of Henry's minority. Current historiography notes both Henry's positive and negative qualities: historian <a href="David%20Carpenter%20%28historian%29">David Carpenter</a> judges Henry to have been a decent man, who failed as a ruler because of his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform, a theme echoed by Huw Ridgeway, who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court, but who considers him to have been "essentially a man of peace, kind and merciful".

The chronicler Matthew Paris depicted Henry's life in a series of illustrations, which he sketched and, in some cases, water-coloured, in the margins of the "<a href="Chronica%20majora">Chronica majora</a>". Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although Paris disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering.

Henry is a character in "<a href="Purgatorio">Purgatorio</a>", the second part of <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a>'s "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>" (completed in 1320). The king is depicted sitting alone in <a href="purgatory">purgatory</a>, to one side of other failed rulers: <a href="Rudolf%20I%20of%20Germany">Rudolf I of Germany</a>, <a href="Ottokar%20II%20of%20Bohemia">Ottokar II of Bohemia</a>, <a href="Philip%20III%20of%20France">Philip III of France</a> and <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20Navarre">Henry I of Navarre</a>, as well as <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Naples">Charles I of Naples</a> and <a href="Peter%20III%20of%20Aragon">Peter III of Aragon</a>. Dante's symbolic intent in depicting Henry sitting separately is unclear; possible explanations include it being a reference to England not being part of the Holy Roman Empire and/or it indicating that Dante had a favourable opinion of Henry, due to his unusual piety.

The plays of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> do not feature Henry as a significant character (unlike many other medieval kings), and within modern popular culture, Henry III has a minimal presence and has not been a prominent subject of films, theatre or television.

Henry and Eleanor had five children:


Henry had no illegitimate children.

Demosthenes

Demosthenes (; "Dēmosthénēs"; ; 384 – 12 October 322 BC) was a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> <a href="Politician">statesman</a> and <a href="orator">orator</a> of <a href="History%20of%20Athens">ancient Athens</a>. His <a href="Public%20speaking">orations</a> constitute a significant expression of contemporary Athenian intellectual prowess and provide an insight into the <a href="politics">politics</a> and culture of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> during the 4th century BC. Demosthenes learned <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a> by studying the <a href="Speech%20%28public%20address%29">speeches</a> of previous great orators. He delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of 20, in which he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance. For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer (<a href="Logographer%20%28legal%29">logographer</a>) and a <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20law">lawyer</a>, writing speeches for use in private <a href="Lawsuit">legal suits</a>.

Demosthenes grew interested in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354 BC he gave his first public political speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedon</a>'s expansion. He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southward by conquering all the other Greek states.

After Philip's death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising against the new king of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonia</a>, <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor in this region, <a href="Antipater">Antipater</a>, sent his men to track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by <a href="Archias%20of%20Thurii">Archias of Thurii</a>, Antipater's confidant.

The "Alexandrian Canon" compiled by <a href="Aristophanes%20of%20Byzantium">Aristophanes of Byzantium</a> and <a href="Aristarchus%20of%20Samothrace">Aristarchus of Samothrace</a> recognised Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest <a href="Attic%20orators">Attic orators</a> and logographers. <a href="Longinus%20%28literature%29">Longinus</a> likened Demosthenes to a blazing thunderbolt, and argued that he "perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech, living passions, copiousness, readiness, speed". <a href="Quintilian">Quintilian</a> extolled him as "lex orandi" ("the standard of oratory"), and <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> said about him that "inter omnis unus excellat" ("he stands alone among all the orators"), and he also acclaimed him as "the perfect orator" who lacked nothing.

Demosthenes was born in 384 BC, during the last year of the 98th <a href="Olympiad">Olympiad</a> or the first year of the 99th Olympiad. His father—also named Demosthenes—who belonged to the local tribe, Pandionis, and lived in the <a href="deme">deme</a> of <a href="Paeania">Paeania</a> in the Athenian countryside, was a wealthy sword-maker. <a href="Aeschines">Aeschines</a>, Demosthenes' greatest political rival, maintained that his mother Kleoboule was a <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>n by blood—an allegation disputed by some modern scholars. Demosthenes was orphaned at the age of seven. Although his father provided well for him, his legal guardians, Aphobus, Demophon and Therippides, mishandled his inheritance.

Demosthenes started to learn rhetoric because he wished to take his guardians to court and because he was of "delicate physique" and couldn't receive gymnastic education which was customary. In Parallel Lives Plutarch states that Demosthenes built an underground study where he practiced speaking and shaving one half of his head so that he could not go out in public. Plutarch also states that he had “an <a href="Speech%20impediment">inarticulate and stammering pronunciation</a>” that he got rid of by speaking with pebbles in his mouth and by repeating verses when running or out of breath. He also practiced speaking in front of a large mirror.

As soon as Demosthenes came of age in 366 BC, he demanded they render an account of their management. According to Demosthenes, the account revealed the misappropriation of his property. Although his father left an estate of nearly fourteen <a href="Attic%20talent">talents</a>, (equivalent to about 220 years of a labourer's income at standard wages, or 11 million dollars in terms of median US annual incomes) Demosthenes asserted his guardians had left nothing "except the house, and fourteen slaves and thirty silver minae" (30 minae = ½ talent). At the age of 20 Demosthenes sued his trustees in order to recover his patrimony and delivered five orations: three "Against Aphobus" during 363 and 362 BC and two "Against Onetor" during 362 and 361 BC. The courts fixed Demosthenes' damages at ten talents. When all the trials came to an end, he only succeeded in retrieving a portion of his inheritance.

According to <a href="Pseudo-Plutarch">Pseudo-Plutarch</a>, Demosthenes was married once. The only information about his wife, whose name is unknown, is that she was the daughter of Heliodorus, a prominent citizen. Demosthenes also had a daughter, "the only one who ever called him father", according to Aeschines in a trenchant remark. His daughter died young and unmarried a few days before Philip II's death.

In his speeches, Aeschines uses <a href="Pederasty%20in%20ancient%20Greece">pederastic</a> relations of Demosthenes as a means to attack him. In the case of Aristion, a youth from <a href="Plataea">Plataea</a> who lived for a long time in Demosthenes' house, Aeschines mocks the "scandalous" and "improper" relation. In another speech, Aeschines brings up the pederastic relation of his opponent with a boy called Cnosion. The slander that Demosthenes' wife also slept with the boy suggests that the relationship was contemporary with his marriage. Aeschines claims that Demosthenes made money out of young rich men, such as Aristarchus, the son of Moschus, whom he allegedly deceived with the pretence that he could make him a great orator. Apparently, while still under Demosthenes' tutelage, Aristarchus killed and mutilated a certain Nicodemus of Aphidna. Aeschines accused Demosthenes of complicity in the murder, pointing out that Nicodemus had once pressed a lawsuit accusing Demosthenes of desertion. He also accused Demosthenes of having been such a bad "<a href="Pederasty%20in%20ancient%20Greece%23Terminology">erastes</a>" to Aristarchus so as not even to deserve the name. His crime, according to Aeschines, was to have betrayed his "eromenos" by pillaging his estate, allegedly pretending to be in love with the youth so as to get his hands on the boy's inheritance. Nevertheless, the story of Demosthenes' relations with Aristarchus is still regarded as more than doubtful, and no other pupil of Demosthenes is known by name.

Between his coming of age in 366 BC and the trials that took place in 364 BC, Demosthenes and his guardians negotiated acrimoniously but were unable to reach an agreement, for neither side was willing to make concessions. At the same time, Demosthenes prepared himself for the trials and improved his oratory skill. According to a story repeated by <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, when Demosthenes was an adolescent, his curiosity was noticed by the orator <a href="Callistratus%20of%20Aphidnae">Callistratus</a>, who was then at the height of his reputation, having just won a case of considerable importance. According to <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, a German <a href="philology">philologist</a> and <a href="philosophy">philosopher</a>, and <a href="Constantine%20Paparrigopoulos">Constantine Paparrigopoulos</a>, a major modern Greek <a href="historian">historian</a>, Demosthenes was a student of <a href="Isocrates">Isocrates</a>; according to <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>, <a href="Quintillian">Quintillian</a> and the Roman biographer Hermippus, he was a student of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>. <a href="Lucian">Lucian</a>, a Roman-Syrian rhetorician and <a href="satire">satirist</a>, lists the philosophers <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> and <a href="Xenocrates">Xenocrates</a> among his teachers. These claims are nowadays disputed. According to Plutarch, Demosthenes employed <a href="Isaeus">Isaeus</a> as his master in rhetoric, even though Isocrates was then teaching this subject, either because he could not pay Isocrates the prescribed fee or because Demosthenes believed Isaeus's style better suited a vigorous and astute orator such as himself . <a href="Ernst%20Curtius">Curtius</a>, a German <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a> and historian, likened the relation between Isaeus and Demosthenes to "an intellectual armed alliance".

It has also been said that Demosthenes paid Isaeus 10,000 <a href="drachma">drachma</a>e (somewhat over 1.5 talents) on the condition that Isaeus should withdraw from a school of rhetoric which he had opened, and should devote himself wholly to Demosthenes, his new pupil. Another version credits Isaeus with having taught Demosthenes without charge. According to <a href="Sir%20Richard%20C.%20Jebb">Sir Richard C. Jebb</a>, a British <a href="Classics">classical</a> <a href="scholar">scholar</a>, "the intercourse between Isaeus and Demosthenes as teacher and learner can scarcely have been either very intimate or of very long duration". <a href="Konstantinos%20Tsatsos">Konstantinos Tsatsos</a>, a Greek professor and <a href="academician">academician</a>, believes that Isaeus helped Demosthenes edit his initial judicial orations against his guardians. Demosthenes is also said to have admired the historian Thucydides. In the "Illiterate Book-Fancier," Lucian mentions eight beautiful copies of Thucydides made by Demosthenes, all in Demosthenes' own handwriting. These references hint at his respect for a historian he must have assiduously studied.

According to Plutarch, when Demosthenes first addressed himself to the people, he was derided for his strange and uncouth style, "which was cumbered with long sentences and tortured with formal arguments to a most harsh and disagreeable excess". Some citizens, however, discerned his talent. When he first left the <a href="Ecclesia%20%28ancient%20Athens%29">ecclesia</a> (the Athenian Assembly) disheartened, an old man named Eunomus encouraged him, saying his diction was very much like that of <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a>. Another time, after the ecclesia had refused to hear him and he was going home dejected, an actor named Satyrus followed him and entered into a friendly conversation with him.

As a boy Demosthenes had a <a href="speech%20impediment">speech impediment</a>: Plutarch refers to a weakness in his voice of "a perplexed and indistinct utterance and a shortness of breath, which, by breaking and disjointing his sentences much obscured the sense and meaning of what he spoke." There are problems in Plutarch's account, however, and it is probable that Demosthenes actually suffered <a href="Rhotacism%20%28speech%20impediment%29">rhotacism</a>, mispronouncing ρ (r) as λ (l). Aeschines taunted him and referred to him in his speeches by the nickname "Batalus", apparently invented by Demosthenes' pedagogues or by the little boys with whom he was playing and corresponding to the way in which a person with that variety of rhotacism would pronounce "<a href="Battaros%23History">Battaros</a>", the name of a legendary Libyan king who spoke quickly and in a disordered fashion. Demosthenes undertook a disciplined programme to overcome his weaknesses and improve his delivery, including diction, voice and gestures. According to one story, when he was asked to name the three most important elements in oratory, he replied "Delivery, delivery and delivery!" It is unknown whether such vignettes are factual accounts of events in Demosthenes' life or merely anecdotes used to illustrate his perseverance and determination.

To make his living, Demosthenes became a professional litigant, both as a "logographer", writing speeches for use in private legal suits, and advocate ("synegoros") speaking on another's behalf. He seems to have been able to manage any kind of case, adapting his skills to almost any client, including wealthy and powerful men. It is not unlikely that he became a teacher of rhetoric and that he brought pupils into court with him. However, though he probably continued writing speeches throughout his career, he stopped working as an advocate once he entered the political arena.
Judicial oratory had become a significant literary genre by the second half of the fifth century, as represented in the speeches of Demosthenes' predecessors, <a href="Antiphon%20%28person%29">Antiphon</a> and <a href="Andocides">Andocides</a>. Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system: evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a preliminary hearing and litigants could present it as they pleased within set speeches; however, witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by force or bribery), there was little cross-examination during the trial, there were no instructions to the jury from a judge, no conferencing between jurists before voting, the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members), cases depended largely on questions of probable motive, and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law—conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches.

Since Athenian politicians were often indicted by their opponents, there was not always a clear distinction between "private" and "public" cases, and thus a career as a logographer opened the way for Demosthenes to embark on his political career. An Athenian logographer could remain anonymous, which enabled him to serve personal interests, even if it prejudiced the client. It also left him open to allegations of malpractice. Thus for example Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients' arguments to their opponents; in particular, that he wrote a speech for Phormion (350 BC), a wealthy banker, and then communicated it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a <a href="capital%20punishment">capital charge</a> against Phormion. Plutarch much later supported this accusation, stating that Demosthenes "was thought to have acted dishonorably" and he also accused Demosthenes of writing speeches for both sides. It has often been argued that the deception, if there was one, involved a political "<a href="quid%20pro%20quo">quid pro quo</a>", whereby Apollodorus secretly pledged support for unpopular reforms that Demosthenes was pursuing in the greater, public interest (i.e. the diversion of <a href="Theorica">Theoric Funds</a> to military purposes).

Demosthenes was admitted to his deme as a citizen with full rights probably in 366 BC, and he soon demonstrated an interest in politics. In 363 and 359 BC, he assumed the office of the <a href="trierarch">trierarch</a>, being responsible for the outfitting and maintenance of a <a href="trireme">trireme</a>. He was among the first ever volunteer trierarchs in 357 BC, sharing the expenses of a ship called "Dawn", for which the public inscription still survives. In 348 BC, he became a <a href="choregos%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">choregos</a>, paying the expenses of a <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20theatre">theatrical production</a>.

Between 355 and 351 BC, Demosthenes continued practising law privately while he was becoming increasingly interested in public affairs. During this period, he wrote "<a href="Against%20Androtion">Against Androtion</a>" and "<a href="Against%20Leptines">Against Leptines</a>", two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions. In "<a href="Against%20Timocrates">Against Timocrates</a>" and "Against Aristocrates", he advocated eliminating corruption. All these speeches, which offer early glimpses of his general principles on foreign policy, such as the importance of the navy, of alliances and of national honour, are prosecutions ("<a href="graph%C4%93%20paran%C3%B3m%C5%8Dn">graphē paranómōn</a>") against individuals accused of illegally proposing legislative texts.

In Demosthenes' time, different political goals developed around personalities. Instead of electioneering, Athenian politicians used litigation and defamation to remove rivals from government processes. Often they indicted each other for breaches of the statute laws ("graphē paranómōn"), but accusations of bribery and corruption were ubiquitous in all cases, being part of the political dialogue. The orators often resorted to "character assassination" ("diabolē", "loidoria") tactics, both in the courts and in the Assembly. The rancorous and often hilariously exaggerated accusations, satirised by <a href="Old%20Comedy">Old Comedy</a>, were sustained by innuendo, inferences about motives, and a complete absence of proof; as J. H. Vince states "there was no room for chivalry in Athenian political life". Such rivalry enabled the "demos" or citizen-body to reign supreme as judge, jury and executioner. Demosthenes was to become fully engaged in this kind of litigation and he was also to be instrumental in developing the power of the <a href="Areopagus">Areopagus</a> to indict individuals for treason, invoked in the ecclesia by a process called "ἀπόφασις".

In 354 BC, Demosthenes delivered his first political oration, "On the Navy", in which he espoused moderation and proposed the reform of the "<a href="symmoria">symmoria</a>i" (boards) as a source of funding for the Athenian fleet. In 352 BC, he delivered "For the Megalopolitans" and, in 351 BC, "On the Liberty of the Rhodians." In both speeches he opposed <a href="Eubulus%20%28statesman%29">Eubulus</a>, the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period 355 to 342 BC. The latter was no pacifist but came to eschew a policy of aggressive interventionism in the internal affairs of the other Greek cities. Contrary to Eubulus's policy, Demosthenes called for an alliance with <a href="Megalopolis%2C%20Greece">Megalopolis</a> against <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> or <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>, and for supporting the democratic faction of the Rhodians in their internal strife. His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens's needs and interests through a more activist foreign policy, wherever opportunity might provide.

Although his early orations were unsuccessful and reveal a lack of real conviction and of coherent strategic and political prioritisation, Demosthenes established himself as an important political personality and broke with Eubulus's faction, a prominent member of which was Aeschines. He thus laid the foundations for his future political successes and for becoming the leader of his own "party" (the issue of whether the modern concept of political parties can be applied in the <a href="Athenian%20democracy">Athenian democracy</a> is hotly disputed among modern scholars).

Most of Demosthenes' major orations were directed against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357 BC, when Philip seized <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a> and <a href="Pydna">Pydna</a>, Athens had been formally at war with the <a href="ancient%20Macedonians">Macedonians</a>. In 352 BC, Demosthenes characterised Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; his speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years. A year later he criticised those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was as dangerous as the king of <a href="Persia">Persia</a>.

In 352 BC, Athenian troops successfully opposed Philip at <a href="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a>, but the Macedonian victory over the <a href="Phocians">Phocians</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crocus%20Field">Battle of Crocus Field</a> shook Demosthenes. In 351 BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to express his view concerning the most important foreign policy issue facing Athens at that time: the stance his city should take towards Philip. According to <a href="Jacqueline%20de%20Romilly">Jacqueline de Romilly</a>, a French philologist and member of the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20fran%C3%A7aise">Académie française</a>, the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes' stances a focus and a raison d'être (reason for existence). Demosthenes saw the king of Macedon as a menace to the autonomy of all Greek cities and yet he presented him as a monster of Athens's own creation; in the "First Philippic" he reprimanded his fellow citizens as follows: "Even if something happens to him, you will soon raise up a second Philip [...]".

The theme of the "<a href="First%20Philippic">First Philippic</a>" (351–350 BC) was preparedness and the reform of the theoric fund, a mainstay of Eubulus's policy. In his rousing call for resistance, Demosthenes asked his countrymen to take the necessary action and asserted that "for a free people there can be no greater compulsion than shame for their position". He thus provided for the first time a plan and specific recommendations for the strategy to be adopted against Philip in the north. Among other things, the plan called for the creation of a rapid-response force, to be created cheaply with each hoplite to be paid only ten <a href="drachmas">drachmas</a> per month (two <a href="obol%20%28coin%29">obols</a> per day), which was less than the average pay for unskilled labourers in Athensimplying that the hoplite was expected to make up the deficiency in pay by looting.
From this moment until 341 BC, all of Demosthenes' speeches referred to the same issue, the struggle against Philip. In 349 BC, Philip attacked <a href="Olynthus">Olynthus</a>, an ally of Athens. In the three "<a href="Olynthiacs">Olynthiacs</a>", Demosthenes criticised his compatriots for being idle and urged Athens to help Olynthus. He also insulted Philip by calling him a "barbarian". Despite Demosthenes' strong advocacy, the Athenians would not manage to prevent the falling of the city to the Macedonians. Almost simultaneously, probably on Eubulus's recommendation, they engaged in a war in <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> against Philip, which ended in stalemate.

In 348 BC a peculiar event occurred: <a href="Meidias">Meidias</a>, a wealthy Athenian, publicly slapped Demosthenes, who was at the time a choregos at the <a href="Dionysia">Greater Dionysia</a>, a large religious festival in honour of the god <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>. Meidias was a friend of Eubulus and supporter of the unsuccessful excursion in Euboea. He also was an old enemy of Demosthenes; in 361 BC he had broken violently into his house, with his brother Thrasylochus, to take possession of it.
Demosthenes decided to prosecute his wealthy opponent and wrote the judicial oration "Against Meidias". This speech gives valuable information about Athenian law at the time and especially about the Greek concept of <a href="Hubris">hybris</a> (aggravated assault), which was regarded as a crime not only against the city but against society as a whole. He stated that a democratic state perishes if the <a href="rule%20of%20law">rule of law</a> is undermined by wealthy and unscrupulous men, and that the citizens acquire power and authority in all state affairs due "to the strength of the laws". There is no consensus among scholars either on whether Demosthenes finally delivered "Against Meidias" or on the veracity of Aeschines' accusation that Demosthenes was bribed to drop the charges.

In 348 BC, Philip conquered Olynthus and razed it to the ground; then conquered the entire <a href="Chalkidiki">Chalcidice</a> and all the states of the Chalcidic federation that Olynthus had once led. After these Macedonian victories, Athens sued for peace with Macedon. Demosthenes was among those who favoured compromise. In 347 BC, an Athenian delegation, comprising Demosthenes, Aeschines and Philocrates, was officially sent to <a href="Pella">Pella</a> to negotiate a peace treaty. In his first encounter with Philip, Demosthenes is said to have collapsed from fright.

The ecclesia officially accepted Philip's harsh terms, including the renouncement of their claim to Amphipolis. However, when an Athenian delegation arrived at Pella to put Philip under oath, which was required to conclude the treaty, he was campaigning abroad. He expected that he would hold safely any Athenian possessions which he might seize before the ratification. Being very anxious about the delay, Demosthenes insisted that the embassy should travel to the place where they would find Philip and swear him in without delay. Despite his suggestions, the Athenian envoys, including himself and Aeschines, remained in Pella, until Philip successfully concluded his campaign in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>.

Philip swore to the treaty, but he delayed the departure of the Athenian envoys, who had yet to receive the oaths from Macedon's allies in <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> and elsewhere. Finally, peace was sworn at <a href="Pherae">Pherae</a>, where Philip accompanied the Athenian delegation, after he had completed his military preparations to move south. Demosthenes accused the other envoys of venality and of facilitating Philip's plans with their stance. Just after the conclusion of the Peace of Philocrates, Philip passed Thermopylae, and subdued <a href="Phocis">Phocis</a>; Athens made no move to support the Phocians. Supported by Thebes and Thessaly, Macedon took control of Phocis's votes in the <a href="Amphictyonic%20League">Amphictyonic League</a>, a Greek religious organisation formed to support the greater temples of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> and <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a>. Despite some reluctance on the part of the Athenian leaders, Athens finally accepted Philip's entry into the Council of the League. Demosthenes was among those who adopted a pragmatic approach, and recommended this stance in his oration "<a href="On%20the%20Peace">On the Peace</a>". For Edmund M. Burke, this speech landmarks a moment of maturation in Demosthenes' career: after Philip's successful campaign in 346 BC, the Athenian statesman realised that, if he was to lead his city against the Macedonians, he had "to adjust his voice, to become less partisan in tone".

In 344 BC Demosthenes travelled to the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>, in order to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon's influence, but his efforts were generally unsuccessful. Most of the Peloponnesians saw Philip as the guarantor of their freedom and sent a joint embassy to Athens to express their grievances against Demosthenes' activities. In response, Demosthenes delivered the "<a href="Second%20Philippic">Second Philippic</a>", a vehement attack against Philip. In 343 BC Demosthenes delivered "<a href="On%20the%20False%20Embassy">On the False Embassy</a>" against Aeschines, who was facing a charge of high treason. Nonetheless, Aeschines was acquitted by the narrow margin of thirty votes by a jury which may have numbered as many as 1,501.

In 343 BC, Macedonian forces were conducting campaigns in <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a> and, in 342 BC, Philip campaigned in Thrace. He also negotiated with the Athenians an amendment to the Peace of Philocrates. When the Macedonian army approached <a href="Thracian%20Chersonese">Chersonese</a> (now known as the <a href="Gallipoli%20Peninsula">Gallipoli Peninsula</a>), an Athenian general named <a href="Diopeithes">Diopeithes</a> ravaged the maritime district of Thrace, thereby inciting Philip's rage. Because of this turbulence, the Athenian Assembly convened. Demosthenes delivered "<a href="On%20the%20Chersonese">On the Chersonese</a>" and convinced the Athenians not to recall Diopeithes. Also in 342 BC, he delivered the "<a href="Third%20Philippic">Third Philippic</a>", which is considered to be the best of his political orations. Using all the power of his eloquence, he demanded resolute action against Philip and called for a burst of energy from the Athenian people. He told them that it would be "better to die a thousand times than pay court to Philip". Demosthenes now dominated Athenian politics and was able to considerably weaken the pro-Macedonian faction of Aeschines.

In 341 BC Demosthenes was sent to <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a>, where he sought to renew its alliance with Athens. Thanks to Demosthenes' diplomatic manoeuvres, <a href="Abydos%2C%20Hellespont">Abydos</a> also entered into an alliance with Athens. These developments worried Philip and increased his anger at Demosthenes. The Assembly, however, laid aside Philip's grievances against Demosthenes' conduct and denounced the peace treaty; so doing, in effect, amounted to an official declaration of war. In 339 BC Philip made his last and most effective bid to conquer southern Greece, assisted by Aeschines' stance in the Amphictyonic Council. During a meeting of the Council, Philip accused the <a href="Amfissa">Amfissian</a> <a href="Locrians">Locrians</a> of intruding on consecrated ground. The presiding officer of the Council, a Thessalian named Cottyphus, proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians. Aeschines agreed with this proposition and maintained that the Athenians should participate in the Congress. Demosthenes however reversed Aeschines' initiatives and Athens finally abstained. After the failure of a first military excursion against the Locrians, the summer session of the Amphictyonic Council gave command of the league's forces to Philip and asked him to lead a second excursion. Philip decided to act at once; in the winter of 339–338 BC, he passed through Thermopylae, entered Amfissa and defeated the Locrians. After this significant victory, Philip swiftly entered Phocis in 338 BC. He then turned south-east down the <a href="Cephissus%20%28Athenian%20plain%29">Cephissus</a> valley, seized <a href="Elateia">Elateia</a>, and restored the fortifications of the city.

At the same time, Athens orchestrated the creation of an alliance with Euboea, <a href="Megara">Megara</a>, <a href="Achaea">Achaea</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a>, <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a> and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes's allegiance. Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes's control of Boeotia was recognised, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.

While the Athenians and the Thebans were preparing themselves for war, Philip made a final attempt to appease his enemies, proposing in vain a new peace treaty. After a few trivial encounters between the two sides, which resulted in minor Athenian victories, Philip drew the <a href="Phalanx%20formation">phalanx</a> of the Athenian and Theban confederates into a plain near <a href="Chaeronea">Chaeronea</a>, where he defeated them. Demosthenes fought as a mere <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a>. Such was Philip's hatred for Demosthenes that, according to <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a>, the king after his victory sneered at the misfortunes of the Athenian statesman. However, the Athenian orator and statesman <a href="Demades">Demades</a> is said to have remarked: "O King, when Fortune has cast you in the role of <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, are you not ashamed to act the part of <a href="Thersites">Thersites</a>? [an obscene soldier of the Greek army during the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>]" Stung by these words, Philip immediately altered his demeanour.

After Chaeronea, Philip inflicted a harsh punishment upon Thebes, but made peace with Athens on very lenient terms. Demosthenes encouraged the fortification of Athens and was chosen by the ecclesia to deliver the <a href="Demosthenes%27%20Funeral%20Oration">Funeral Oration</a>. In 337 BC, Philip created the <a href="League%20of%20Corinth">League of Corinth</a>, a confederation of Greek states under his leadership, and returned to Pella. In 336 BC, Philip was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter, <a href="Cleopatra%20of%20Macedon">Cleopatra of Macedon</a>, to King <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Epirus">Alexander of Epirus</a>. The Macedonian army swiftly proclaimed <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander III of Macedon</a>, then twenty years old, as the new king of Macedon. Greek cities like Athens and Thebes saw in this change of leadership an opportunity to regain their full independence. Demosthenes celebrated Philip's assassination and played a leading part in his city's uprising. According to Aeschines, "it was but the seventh day after the death of his daughter, and though the ceremonies of mourning were not yet completed, he put a garland on his head and white raiment on his body, and there he stood making thank-offerings, violating all decency." Demosthenes also sent envoys to <a href="Attalus%20%28general%29">Attalus</a>, whom he considered to be an internal opponent of Alexander. Nonetheless, Alexander moved swiftly to Thebes, which submitted shortly after his appearance at its gates. When the Athenians learned that Alexander had moved quickly to Boeotia, they panicked and begged the new king of Macedon for mercy. Alexander admonished them but imposed no punishment.

In 335 BC Alexander felt free to engage the <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a> and the <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a>, but, while he was campaigning in the north, Demosthenes spread a rumour—even producing a bloodstained messenger—that Alexander and all of his expeditionary force had been slaughtered by the <a href="Triballi">Triballi</a>ans. The Thebans and the Athenians rebelled once again, financed by <a href="Darius%20III%20of%20Persia">Darius III of Persia</a>, and Demosthenes is said to have received about 300 talents on behalf of Athens and to have faced accusations of embezzlement. Alexander reacted immediately and razed Thebes to the ground. He did not attack Athens, but demanded the exile of all anti-Macedonian politicians, Demosthenes first of all. According to <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, a special Athenian embassy led by <a href="Phocion">Phocion</a>, an opponent of the anti-Macedonian faction, was able to persuade Alexander to relent.

Despite the unsuccessful ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336 BC, the orator Ctesiphon proposed that Athens honour Demosthenes for his services to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330 BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, "On the Crown," Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.

In 324 BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had entrusted huge treasures, absconded and sought refuge in Athens. The Assembly had initially refused to accept him, following Demosthenes's advice, but finally Harpalus entered Athens. He was imprisoned after a proposal of Demosthenes and Phocion, despite the dissent of <a href="Hypereides">Hypereides</a>, an anti-Macedonian statesman and former ally of Demosthenes. Additionally, the ecclesia decided to take control of Harpalus's money, which was entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes. When the committee counted the treasure, they found they only had half the money Harpalus had declared he possessed. Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit. When Harpalus escaped, the Areopagus conducted an inquiry and charged Demosthenes with mishandling twenty talents. During the trial, Hypereides argued that Demosthenes did not disclose the huge deficit, because he was bribed by Harpalus. Demosthenes was fined and imprisoned, but he soon escaped. It remains unclear whether the accusations against him were just or not. In any case, the Athenians soon repealed the sentence.

After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek independence from Macedon in what became known as the <a href="Lamian%20War">Lamian War</a>. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of <a href="Kalaureia">Kalaureia</a> (modern-day <a href="Poros">Poros</a>), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family. When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: "Now, as soon as you please you may commence the part of <a href="Creon">Creon</a> in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." After saying these words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died. Years after Demosthenes's suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honour him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the <a href="Prytaneum">Prytaneum</a>.

Plutarch lauds Demosthenes for not being of a fickle disposition. Rebutting historian <a href="Theopompus">Theopompus</a>, the biographer insists that for "the same party and post in politics which he held from the beginning, to these he kept constant to the end; and was so far from leaving them while he lived, that he chose rather to forsake his life than his purpose". On the other hand, <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a>, a Greek historian of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean world</a>, was highly critical of Demosthenes's policies. Polybius accused him of having launched unjustified verbal attacks on great men of other cities, branding them unjustly as traitors to the Greeks. The historian maintains that Demosthenes measured everything by the interests of his own city, imagining that all the Greeks ought to have their eyes fixed upon Athens. According to Polybius, the only thing the Athenians eventually got by their opposition to Philip was the defeat at Chaeronea. "And had it not been for the king's magnanimity and regard for his own reputation, their misfortunes would have gone even further, thanks to the policy of Demosthenes".

Paparrigopoulos extols Demosthenes's patriotism, but criticises him as being short-sighted. According to this critique, Demosthenes should have understood that the ancient Greek states could only survive unified under the leadership of Macedon. Therefore, Demosthenes is accused of misjudging events, opponents and opportunities and of being unable to foresee Philip's inevitable triumph. He is criticised for having overrated Athens's capacity to revive and challenge Macedon. His city had lost most of its Aegean allies, whereas Philip had consolidated his hold over <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> and was master of enormous mineral wealth. Chris Carey, a professor of Greek in <a href="University%20College%20London">UCL</a>, concludes that Demosthenes was a better orator and political operator than strategist. Nevertheless, the same scholar underscores that "pragmatists" like Aeschines or Phocion had no inspiring vision to rival that of Demosthenes. The orator asked the Athenians to choose that which is just and honourable, before their own safety and preservation. The people preferred Demosthenes's activism and even the bitter defeat at Chaeronea was regarded as a price worth paying in the attempt to retain freedom and influence. According to Professor of Greek Arthur Wallace Pickarde, success may be a poor criterion for judging the actions of people like Demosthenes, who were motivated by the ideal of political liberty. Athens was asked by Philip to sacrifice its freedom and its democracy, while Demosthenes longed for the city's brilliance. He endeavoured to revive its imperilled values and, thus, he became an "educator of the people" (in the words of <a href="Werner%20Jaeger">Werner Jaeger</a>).

The fact that Demosthenes fought at the battle of Chaeronea as a hoplite indicates that he lacked any military skills. According to historian <a href="Thomas%20Babington%20Macaulay%2C%201st%20Baron%20Macaulay">Thomas Babington Macaulay</a>, in his time the division between political and military offices was beginning to be strongly marked. Almost no politician, with the exception of Phocion, was at the same time an apt orator and a competent <a href="strategos">general</a>. Demosthenes dealt in policies and ideas, and war was not his business. This contrast between Demosthenes's intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of vigour, stamina, military skill and strategic vision is illustrated by the inscription his countrymen engraved on the base of his statue:

Had you for Greece been strong, as wise you were,
The Macedonian would not have conquered her.

In Demosthenes's initial judicial orations, the influence of both <a href="Lysias">Lysias</a> and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed. Most of his extant speeches for private cases—written early in his career—show glimpses of talent: a powerful intellectual drive, masterly selection (and omission) of facts, and a confident assertion of the justice of his case, all ensuring the dominance of his viewpoint over his rival. However, at this early stage of his career, his writing was not yet remarkable for its subtlety, verbal precision and variety of effects.

According to <a href="Dionysius%20of%20Halicarnassus">Dionysius of Halicarnassus</a>, a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, Demosthenes represented the final stage in the development of Attic prose. Both Dionysius and Cicero assert that Demosthenes brought together the best features of the basic types of style; he used the middle or normal type style ordinarily and applied the archaic type and the type of plain elegance where they were fitting. In each one of the three types he was better than its special masters. He is, therefore, regarded as a consummate orator, adept in the techniques of oratory, which are brought together in his work.

According to the classical scholar Harry Thurston Peck, Demosthenes "affects no learning; he aims at no elegance; he seeks no glaring ornaments; he rarely touches the heart with a soft or melting appeal, and when he does, it is only with an effect in which a third-rate speaker would have surpassed him. He had no wit, no humour, no vivacity, in our acceptance of these terms. The secret of his power is simple, for it lies essentially in the fact that his political principles were interwoven with his very spirit." In this judgement, Peck agrees with Jaeger, who said that the imminent political decision imbued Demosthenes's speech with a fascinating artistic power. From his part, George A. Kennedy believes that his political speeches in the ecclesia were to become "the artistic exposition of reasoned views".

Demosthenes was apt at combining abruptness with the extended period, brevity with breadth. Hence, his style harmonises with his fervent commitment. His language is simple and natural, never far-fetched or artificial. According to Jebb, Demosthenes was a true artist who could make his art obey him. For his part, Aeschines stigmatised his intensity, attributing to his rival strings of absurd and incoherent images. Dionysius stated that Demosthenes's only shortcoming is the lack of humour, although Quintilian regards this deficiency as a virtue. In a now lost letter, Cicero, though an admirer of the Athenian orator, claimed that occasionally Demosthenes "nods", and elsewhere Cicero also argued that, although he is pre-eminent, Demosthenes sometimes fails to satisfy his ears. The main criticism of Demosthenes's art, however, seems to have rested chiefly on his known reluctance to speak extempore; he often declined to comment on subjects he had not studied beforehand. However, he gave the most elaborate preparation to all his speeches and, therefore, his arguments were the products of careful study. He was also famous for his caustic wit.

Besides his style, Cicero also admired other aspects of Demosthenes's works, such as the good prose rhythm, and the way he structured and arranged the material in his orations. According to the Roman statesman, Demosthenes regarded "delivery" (gestures, voice etc.) as more important than style. Although he lacked Aeschines's charming voice and Demades's skill at improvisation, he made efficient use of his body to accentuate his words. Thus he managed to project his ideas and arguments much more forcefully. However, the use of physical gestures wasn't an integral or developed part of rhetorical training in his day. Moreover, his delivery was not accepted by everybody in antiquity: <a href="Demetrius%20Phalereus">Demetrius Phalereus</a> and the comedians ridiculed Demosthenes's "theatricality", whilst Aeschines regarded Leodamas of <a href="Acharnae">Acharnae</a> as superior to him.

Demosthenes relied heavily on the difference aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser in order to be persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.

Demosthenes tailored his style to be very audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, but the most important parts were clear and easily understood.

Demosthenes's fame has continued down the ages. Authors and scholars who flourished at <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>, such as Longinus and <a href="Caecilius%20of%20Calacte">Caecilius</a>, regarded his oratory as sublime. <a href="Satires%20of%20Juvenal">Juvenal</a> acclaimed him as "largus et exundans ingenii fons" (a large and overflowing fountain of genius), and he inspired Cicero's speeches against <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, also called the <a href="Philippicae">Philippics</a>. According to Professor of <a href="Classics">Classics</a> Cecil Wooten, Cicero ended his career by trying to imitate Demosthenes's political role. Plutarch drew attention in his "Life of Demosthenes" to the strong similarities between the personalities and careers of Demosthenes and Marcus Tullius Cicero:

The divine power seems originally to have designed Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities in their natural characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, and at the same time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.

During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, Demosthenes had a reputation for eloquence. He was read more than any other ancient orator; only Cicero offered any real competition. French author and lawyer <a href="Guillaume%20du%20Vair">Guillaume du Vair</a> praised his speeches for their artful arrangement and elegant style; <a href="John%20Jewel">John Jewel</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, and <a href="Jacques%20Amyot">Jacques Amyot</a>, a French Renaissance writer and translator, regarded Demosthenes as a great or even the "supreme" orator. For <a href="Thomas%20Wilson%20%28rhetorician%29">Thomas Wilson</a>, who first published translation of his speeches into English, Demosthenes was not only an eloquent orator, but, mainly, an authoritative statesman, "a source of wisdom".

In <a href="modern%20history">modern history</a>, orators such as <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> would <a href="imitation">mimic</a> Demosthenes's technique. His ideas and principles survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times. Hence, he constituted a source of inspiration for the authors of "<a href="The%20Federalist%20Papers">The Federalist Papers</a>" (a series of 85 essays arguing for the ratification of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>) and for the major orators of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. French Prime Minister <a href="Georges%20Clemenceau">Georges Clemenceau</a> was among those who idealised Demosthenes and wrote a book about him. For his part, Friedrich Nietzsche often composed his sentences according to the paradigms of Demosthenes, whose style he admired.

The "publication" and distribution of prose texts was common practice in Athens by the latter half of the fourth century BC and Demosthenes was among the Athenian politicians who set the trend, publishing many or even all of his orations. After his death, texts of his speeches survived in Athens (possibly forming part of the library of Cicero's friend, Atticus, though their fate is otherwise unknown), and in the <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>.

The Alexandrian texts were incorporated into the body of classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by the scholars of the <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic</a> period. From then until the fourth century AD, copies of Demosthenes's orations multiplied and they were in a relatively good position to survive the tense period from the sixth until the ninth century AD. In the end, sixty-one orations attributed to Demosthenes survived till the present day (some however are pseudonymous). <a href="Friedrich%20Blass">Friedrich Blass</a>, a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>s of the tenth and eleventh centuries AD.

Some of the speeches that comprise the "Demosthenic corpus" are known to have been written by other authors, though scholars differ over which speeches these are. Irrespective of their status, the speeches attributed to Demosthenes are often grouped in three genres first defined by Aristotle:

In addition to the speeches, there are fifty-six <a href="prologue">prologue</a>s (openings of speeches). They were collected for the Library of Alexandria by <a href="Callimachus">Callimachus</a>, who believed them genuine. Modern scholars are divided: some reject them, while others, such as Blass, believe they are authentic. Finally, six letters also survive under Demosthenes's name and their authorship too is hotly debated.


a. According to Edward Cohen, professor of Classics at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, Cleoboule was the daughter of a Scythian woman and of an Athenian father, Gylon, although other scholars insist on the genealogical purity of Demosthenes. There is an agreement among scholars that Cleoboule was a <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>n and not an Athenian citizen. Gylon had suffered banishment at the end of the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a> for allegedly betraying <a href="Nymphaion%20%28Crimea%29">Nymphaeum</a> in Crimaea. According to Aeschines, Gylon received as a gift from the <a href="Bosporan%20Kingdom">Bosporan</a> rulers a place called "the Gardens" in the colony of <a href="Kepoi">Kepoi</a> in present-day <a href="Russia">Russia</a> (located within two miles (3 km) of <a href="Phanagoria">Phanagoria</a>). Nevertheless, the accuracy of these allegations is disputed, since more than seventy years had elapsed between Gylon's possible treachery and Aeschines' speech, and, therefore, the orator could be confident that his audience would have no direct knowledge of events at Nymphaeum.

b. According to Tsatsos, the trials against the guardians lasted until Demosthenes was twenty four. Nietzsche reduces the time of the judicial disputes to five years.

c. According to the tenth century encyclopedia <a href="Suda">Suda</a>, Demosthenes studied with <a href="Eubulides%20of%20Miletus">Eubulides</a> and Plato. Cicero and Quintilian argue that Demosthenes was Plato's disciple. Tsatsos and the philologist <a href="Henri%20Weil">Henri Weil</a> believe that there is no indication that Demosthenes was a pupil of Plato or Isocrates. As far as Isaeus is concerned, according to Jebb "the school of Isaeus is nowhere else mentioned, nor is the name of any other pupil recorded". Peck believes that Demosthenes continued to study under Isaeus for the space of four years after he had reached his majority.

d. "Batalus" or "Batalos" meant "stammerer" in ancient Greek, but it was also the name of a flute-player (in ridicule of whom Antiphanes wrote a play) and of a songwriter. The word "batalus" was also used by the Athenians to describe the <a href="anus">anus</a>. In fact the word actually defining his speech defect was "Battalos", signifying someone with rhotacism, but it was crudely misrepresented as "Batalos" by the enemies of Demosthenes and by Plutarch's time the original word had already lost currency. Another nickname of Demosthenes was "Argas." According to Plutarch, this name was given him either for his savage and spiteful behaviour or for his disagreeable way of speaking. "Argas" was a poetical word for a snake, but also the name of a poet.

e. Both Tsatsos and Weil maintain that Demosthenes never abandoned the profession of the logographer, but, after delivering his first political orations, he wanted to be regarded as a statesman. According to James J. Murphy, Professor emeritus of Rhetoric and Communication at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis">University of California, Davis</a>, his lifelong career as a logographer continued even during his most intense involvement in the political struggle against Philip.

f. "Theorika" were allowances paid by the state to poor Athenians to enable them to watch dramatic festivals. According to Libanius, Eubulus passed a law making it difficult to divert public funds, including "theorika," for minor military operations. E. M. Burke argues that, if this was indeed a law of Eubulus, it would have served "as a means to check a too-aggressive and expensive interventionism [...] allowing for the controlled expenditures on other items, including construction for defense". Thus Burke believes that in the Eubulan period, the Theoric Fund was used not only as allowances for public entertainment but also for a variety of projects, including public works. As Burke also points out, in his later and more "mature" political career, Demosthenes no longer criticised "theorika"; in fact, in his "Fourth Philippic" (341–340 BC), he defended theoric spending.

g. In the "Third Olynthiac" and in the "Third Philippic", Demosthenes characterised Philip as a "barbarian", one of the various abusive terms applied by the orator to the king of Macedon. According to Konstantinos Tsatsos and <a href="Douglas%20M.%20MacDowell">Douglas M. MacDowell</a>, Demosthenes regarded as Greeks only those who had reached the cultural standards of south Greece and he did not take into consideration ethnological criteria. His contempt for Philip is forcefully expressed in the "Third Philippic" 31 in these terms: "...he is not only no Greek, nor related to the Greeks, but not even a barbarian from any place that can be named with honour, but a pestilent knave from Macedonia, whence it was never yet possible to buy a decent slave." The wording is even more telling in Greek, ending with an accumulation of plosive pi sounds: Nevertheless, Philip, in his letter to the council and people of Athens, mentioned by Demosthenes, places himself "with the rest of the Greeks".

h. Aeschines maintained that Demosthenes was bribed to drop his charges against Meidias in return for a payment of thirty <a href="mina%20%28unit%29">mnai</a>. Plutarch argued that Demosthenes accepted the bribe out of fear of Meidias's power. <a href="Philipp%20August%20B%C3%B6ckh">Philipp August Böckh</a> also accepted Aeschines's account for an out-of-court settlement, and concluded that the speech was never delivered. Böckh's position was soon endorsed by Arnold Schaefer and Blass. Weil agreed that Demosthenes never delivered "Against Meidias", but believed that he dropped the charges for political reasons. In 1956, <a href="Hartmut%20Erbse">Hartmut Erbse</a> partly challenged Böckh's conclusions, when he argued that "Against Meidias" was a finished speech that could have been delivered in court, but Erbse then sided with <a href="George%20Grote">George Grote</a>, by accepting that, after Demosthenes secured a judgment in his favour, he reached some kind of settlement with Meidias. <a href="Kenneth%20Dover">Kenneth Dover</a> also endorsed Aeschines's account, and argued that, although the speech was never delivered in court, Demosthenes put into circulation an attack on Meidias. Dover's arguments were refuted by Edward M. Harris, who concluded that, although we cannot be sure about the outcome of the trial, the speech was delivered in court, and that Aeschines' story was a lie.

i. According to Plutarch, Demosthenes deserted his colours and "did nothing honorable, nor was his performance answerable to his speeches".

j. Aeschines reproached Demosthenes for being silent as to the seventy talents of the king's gold which he allegedly seized and embezzled. Aeschines and <a href="Dinarchus">Dinarchus</a> also maintained that when the Arcadians offered their services for ten talents, Demosthenes refused to furnish the money to the Thebans, who were conducting the negotiations, and so the Arcadians sold out to the Macedonians.

k. The exact chronology of Harpalus's entrance into Athens and of all the related events remains a debated topic among modern scholars, who have proposed different, and sometimes conflicting, chronological schemes.

l. According to <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, Demosthenes himself and others had declared that the orator had taken no part of the money that Harpalus brought from Asia. He also narrates the following story: Shortly after Harpalus ran away from Athens, he was put to death by the servants who were attending him, though some assert that he was assassinated. The steward of his money fled to Rhodes, and was arrested by a Macedonian officer, <a href="Philoxenus%20%28general%29">Philoxenus</a>. Philoxenus proceeded to examine the slave, "until he learned everything about such as had allowed themselves to accept a bribe from Harpalus." He then sent a dispatch to Athens, in which he gave a list of the persons who had taken a bribe from Harpalus. "Demosthenes, however, he never mentioned at all, although Alexander held him in bitter hatred, and he himself had a private quarrel with him." On the other hand, Plutarch believes that Harpalus sent Demosthenes a cup with twenty talents and that "Demosthenes could not resist the temptation, but admitting the present, ... he surrendered himself up to the interest of Harpalus." Tsatsos defends Demosthenes's innocence, but Irkos Apostolidis underlines the problematic character of the primary sources on this issue—Hypereides and Dinarchus were at the time Demosthenes's political opponents and accusers—and states that, despite the rich bibliography on Harpalus's case, modern scholarship has not yet managed to reach a safe conclusion on whether Demosthenes was bribed or not.

m. Blass disputes the authorship of the following speeches: "Fourth Philippic", "Funeral Oration", "Erotic Essay," "Against Stephanus 2" and "Against Evergus and Mnesibulus", while Schaefer recognises as genuine only twenty-nine orations. Of Demosthenes's corpus political speeches, J. H. Vince singles out five as spurious: "On Halonnesus", "Fourth Philippic", "Answer to Philip's Letter", "On Organization" and "On the Treaty with Alexander".

n. In this discussion the work of Jonathan A. Goldstein, Professor of History and Classics at the <a href="University%20of%20Iowa">University of Iowa</a>, is regarded as paramount. Goldstein regards Demosthenes's letters as authentic apologetic letters that were addressed to the Athenian Assembly.

Xenu

Xenu (), also called Xemu, was, according to <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a> founder <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, the dictator of the "Galactic Confederacy" who 75 million years ago brought billions of his people to <a href="Earth">Earth</a> (then known as "Teegeeack") in <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">DC-8</a>-like spacecraft, stacked them around <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es, and killed them with <a href="Nuclear%20weapon">hydrogen bombs</a>. Official Scientology scriptures hold that the <a href="thetan">thetan</a>s (immortal spirits) of these aliens <a href="Body%20thetan">adhere</a> to humans, causing spiritual harm.

These events are known within Scientology as "Incident II", and the traumatic memories associated with them as "The Wall of Fire" or "R6 <a href="Implant%20%28Scientology%29">implant</a>". The narrative of Xenu is part of Scientologist teachings about extraterrestrial civilizations and alien interventions in earthly events, collectively described as "<a href="Space%20opera%20in%20Scientology%20scripture">space opera</a>" by Hubbard. Hubbard detailed the story in <a href="Operating%20Thetan">Operating Thetan</a> level III (OT III) in 1967, warning that the "R6 implant" (past trauma) was "calculated to kill (by <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, etc.) anyone who attempts to solve it".

Within the <a href="Church%20of%20Scientology">Church of Scientology</a>, the Xenu story is part of the church's secret "Advanced Technology", considered a sacred and <a href="esotericism">esoteric</a> teaching, which is normally only revealed to members who have completed a lengthy sequence of courses costing large amounts of money. The church avoids mention of Xenu in public statements and has gone to considerable effort to maintain the story's confidentiality, including <a href="Scientology%20controversy">legal action</a> on the grounds of <a href="copyright">copyright</a> and <a href="trade%20secret">trade secrecy</a>. Officials of the Church of Scientology widely deny or try to hide the Xenu story. Despite this, much material on Xenu has leaked to the public via court documents, copies of Hubbard's notes, and the <a href="Scientology%20versus%20the%20Internet">Internet</a>. In commentary on the impact of the Xenu text, academic scholars have discussed and analyzed the writings by Hubbard and their place within Scientology within the contexts of science fiction, <a href="UFO%20religion">UFO religion</a>s, <a href="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> and <a href="creation%20myth">creation myth</a>s.

The story of Xenu is covered in <a href="OT%20III">OT III</a>, part of Scientology's secret "Advanced Technology" doctrines taught only to advanced members who have undergone many hours of <a href="Auditing%20%28Scientology%29">auditing</a> and reached the state of <a href="Clear%20%28Scientology%29">Clear</a> followed by <a href="Operating%20Thetan">Operating Thetan</a> levels 1 and 2. It is described in more detail in the accompanying confidential "Assists" lecture of October 3, 1968, and is dramatized in "<a href="Revolt%20in%20the%20Stars">Revolt in the Stars</a>" (a screen-story – in the form of a novel – written by L. Ron Hubbard in 1977).

Hubbard wrote that Xenu was the ruler of a Galactic Confederacy 75 million years ago, which consisted of 26 stars and 76 planets including Earth, which was then known as "Teegeeack". The planets were overpopulated, containing an average population of 178 billion. The Galactic Confederacy's civilization was comparable to our own, with aliens "walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like the clothes they wear this very minute" and using cars, trains and boats looking exactly the same as those "circa 1950, 1960" on Earth.

Xenu was about to be deposed from power, so he devised a plot to eliminate the excess population from his dominions. With the assistance of <a href="psychiatry">psychiatrists</a>, he gathered billions of his citizens under the pretense of <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> inspections, then paralyzed them and froze them in a mixture of <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a> and <a href="ethylene%20glycol">glycol</a> to capture their souls. The kidnapped populace was loaded into spacecraft for transport to the site of extermination, the planet of Teegeeack (<a href="Earth">Earth</a>). The appearance of these spacecraft would later be subconsciously expressed in the design of the <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a>, the only difference being; "the DC8 had fans, propellers on it and the space plane didn't". When they had reached Teegeeack, the paralyzed citizens were off-loaded, and placed around the bases of volcanoes across the planet. <a href="Nuclear%20weapon%23Fusion%20bombs">Hydrogen bombs</a> were then lowered into the volcanoes and detonated simultaneously, killing all but a few aliens. Hubbard described the scene in his film script, "Revolt in the Stars":

The now-disembodied victims' souls, which Hubbard called "<a href="thetan">thetan</a>s", were blown into the air by the blast. They were captured by Xenu's forces using an "electronic ribbon" ("which also was a type of <a href="standing%20wave">standing wave</a>") and sucked into "vacuum zones" around the world. The hundreds of billions of captured thetans were taken to a type of cinema, where they were forced to watch a "<a href="3D%20film">three-D</a>, super colossal motion picture" for thirty-six days. This implanted what Hubbard termed "various misleading data"' (collectively termed the R6 <a href="implant%20%28Scientology%29">implant</a>) into the memories of the hapless thetans, "which has to do with God, the <a href="Devil">Devil</a>, <a href="Space%20opera%20in%20Scientology%20doctrine">space opera</a>, etcetera". This included all <a href="Major%20religious%20groups">world religions</a>; Hubbard specifically attributed Roman Catholicism and the image of the <a href="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</a> to the influence of Xenu. The two "implant stations" cited by Hubbard were said to have been located on Hawaii and <a href="Province%20of%20Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a> in the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>.

In addition to implanting new beliefs in the thetans, the images deprived them of their sense of <a href="Identity%20%28social%20science%29">personal identity</a>. When the thetans left the projection areas, they started to cluster together in groups of a few thousand, having lost the ability to differentiate between each other. Each cluster of thetans gathered into one of the few remaining bodies that survived the explosion. These became what are known as "<a href="body%20thetan">body thetan</a>s", which are said to be still clinging to and adversely affecting everyone except Scientologists who have performed the necessary steps to remove them.

A government faction known as the Loyal Officers finally overthrew Xenu and his renegades, and locked him away in "an electronic mountain trap" from which he has not escaped. Although the location of Xenu is sometimes said to be the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> on Earth, this is actually the location Hubbard gave elsewhere for an ancient "Martian report station". Teegeeack was subsequently abandoned by the Galactic Confederacy and remains a pariah "prison planet" to this day, although it has suffered repeatedly from incursions by alien "<a href="Alien%20invasion">Invader Forces</a>" since that time.

In 1988, the cost of learning these secrets from the Church of Scientology was <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>3,830, or US$6,500. This is in addition to the cost of the prior courses which are necessary to be eligible for OT III, which is often well over US$100,000 (roughly <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>60,000). Belief in Xenu and body thetans is a requirement for a Scientologist to progress further along the <a href="Bridge%20to%20Total%20Freedom">Bridge to Total Freedom</a>. Those who do not experience the benefits of the OT III course are expected to take it and pay for it again.

Within Scientology, the Xenu story is referred to as "The Wall of Fire" or "Incident II". Hubbard attached tremendous importance to it, saying that it constituted "the secrets of a disaster which resulted in the decay of life as we know it in this sector of the galaxy". The broad outlines of the story—that 75 million years ago a great catastrophe happened in this sector of the galaxy which caused profoundly negative effects for everyone since then—are told to lower-level Scientologists; but the details are kept strictly confidential, within Scientology.

The OT III document describes that Hubbard entered the Wall of Fire but emerged alive ("probably the only one ever to do so in 75,000,000 years"). He first publicly announced his "breakthrough" in "Ron's Journal 67" ("RJ67"), a taped lecture recorded on September 20, 1967, to be sent to all Scientologists. According to Hubbard, his research was achieved at the cost of a broken back, knee, and arm. OT III contains a warning that the R6 implant is "calculated to kill (by pneumonia etc.) anyone who attempts to solve it". Hubbard claimed that his "tech development"—i.e. his OT materials—had neutralized this threat, creating a safe path to redemption.

The Church of Scientology forbade individuals from reading the OT III Xenu <a href="cosmogony">cosmogony</a> without first having taken prerequisite courses. Scientologists warn that reading the Xenu story without proper authorization could cause pneumonia.

In "RJ67", Hubbard then alludes to the devastating effect of Xenu's genocide:
OT III also deals with "Incident I", set four <a href="1%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000">quadrillion</a> years ago. In "Incident I", the unsuspecting thetan was subjected to a loud snapping noise followed by a flood of luminescence, then saw a <a href="chariot">chariot</a> followed by a trumpeting <a href="cherub">cherub</a>. After a loud set of snaps, the thetan was overwhelmed by darkness. It is described that these traumatic memories alone separate thetans from their static (natural, godlike) state.

Hubbard uses the existence of body thetans to explain many of the physical and mental ailments of humanity which, he says, prevent people from achieving their highest spiritual levels. OT III tells the Scientologist to locate body thetans and release them from the effects of Incidents I and II. This is accomplished in solo auditing, where the Scientologist holds both cans of an <a href="E-meter">E-meter</a> in one hand and asks questions as an auditor. The Scientologist is directed to find a cluster of body thetans, address it <a href="telepathy">telepathically</a> as a cluster, and take first the cluster, then each individual member, through Incident II, then Incident I if needed. Hubbard warns that this is a painstaking procedure, and that OT levels IV to VII are necessary to continue dealing with one's body thetans.

The Church of Scientology has objected to the Xenu story being used to paint Scientology as science fiction fantasy (see <a href="Space%20opera%20in%20Scientology%20doctrine">Space opera in Scientology doctrine</a>). Hubbard's statements concerning the R6 implant have been a source of contention. Critics and some Christians state that Hubbard's statements regarding R6 prove that Scientology doctrine is incompatible with Christianity, despite the Church's statements to the contrary. In "Assists", Hubbard says:
Hubbard wrote OT III in late 1966 and early 1967 in North Africa while on his way to <a href="Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a> to join the "Enchanter", the first vessel of his private Scientology fleet (the "<a href="Sea%20Org">Sea Org</a>"). (OT III says "In December 1967 I knew someone had to take the plunge", but the material was publicised well before this.) He emphasized later that OT III was his own personal discovery.

Critics of Scientology have suggested that other factors may have been at work. In a letter of the time to his wife <a href="Mary%20Sue%20Hubbard">Mary Sue</a>, Hubbard said that, in order to assist his research, he was drinking alcohol and taking <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a>s and <a href="depressant">depressant</a>s ("I'm drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and greys"). His assistant at the time, Virginia Downsborough, said that she had to wean him off the diet of drugs to which he had become accustomed. Russell Miller posits in "<a href="Bare-faced%20Messiah">Bare-faced Messiah</a>" that it was important for Hubbard to be found in a debilitated condition, so as to present OT III as "a research accomplishment of immense magnitude".

Elements of the Xenu story appeared in Scientology before OT III. Hubbard's descriptions of extraterrestrial conflicts were put forward as early as 1950 in his book "Have You Lived Before This Life?", and were enthusiastically endorsed by Scientologists who documented their <a href="Reincarnation">past lives</a> on other planets.

The 1968 and subsequent reprints of "" have had covers depicting an exploding volcano, which is reportedly a reference to OT III. In a 1968 lecture, and in instructions to his marketing staff, Hubbard explained that these images would "key in" the submerged memories of Incident II and impel people to buy the books.
Since the 1980s, the volcano has also been depicted in <a href="Television%20advertisement">television commercials</a> advertising "Dianetics". Scientology's "<a href="Sea%20Org">Sea Org</a>", an elite group within the church that originated with Hubbard's personal staff aboard his fleet of ships, takes many of its symbols from the story of Xenu and OT III. It is explicitly intended to be a revival of the "Loyal Officers" who overthrew Xenu. Its logo, a wreath with 26 leaves, represents the 26 stars of Xenu's Galactic Confederacy. According to an official Scientology dictionary, "the Sea Org symbol, adopted and used as the symbol of a Galactic Confederacy far back in the history of this sector, derives much of its power and authority from that association".

In the Advanced Orgs in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and Los Angeles, Scientology staff were at one time ordered to wear all-white uniforms with silver boots, to mimic Xenu's Galactic Patrol as depicted on the cover of "". This was reportedly done on the basis of Hubbard's declaration in his Flag Order 652 that mankind would accept regulation from that group which had last betrayed it—hence the imitation of Xenu's henchmen. In Los Angeles, a nightwatch was ordered to watch for returning spaceships.

The name has been spelled both as "Xenu" and "Xemu". The Class VIII course material includes a three-page text, handwritten by Hubbard, headed "Data", in which the Xenu story is given in detail. Hubbard's indistinct handwriting makes either spelling possible, particularly as the use of the name on the first page of OT III is the only known example of the name in his handwriting. In the "Assists" lecture, Hubbard speaks of ""Xenu, ahhh, could be spelled X-E-M-U"" and clearly says "Xemu" several times on the recording. The treatment of "Revolt in the Stars"—which is typewritten—uses "Xenu" exclusively.

It is speculated that the name derives from <a href="Xemnu">Xemnu</a>, an extraterrestrial comic book villain who first appeared in the story "I Was a Slave of the Living Hulk!" in Journey into Mystery #62 (November 1960). He was created by <a href="Stan%20Lee">Stan Lee</a> and <a href="Jack%20Kirby">Jack Kirby</a>. Xemnu is a giant, hairy intergalactic criminal who escaped a prison planet, traveled to Earth, and hypnotized the entire human population. Upon Xemnu's defeat by electrician Joe Harper, Xemnu is imprisoned in a state of continual electric shock in orbit around the sun, and humanity is left with no memory of Xemnu's existence.

In its public statements, the Church of Scientology has been reluctant to allow any mention of Xenu. A passing mention by a trial judge in 1997 prompted the Church's lawyers to have the ruling <a href="Record%20sealing">sealed</a>, although this was reversed. In the relatively few instances in which it has acknowledged Xenu, Scientology has stated the story's true meaning can only be understood after years of study. They complain of critics using it to paint the religion as a science-fiction fantasy.

Senior members of the Church of Scientology have several times publicly denied or minimized the importance of the Xenu story, but others have affirmed its existence. In 1995, Scientology lawyer Earl Cooley hinted at the importance of Xenu in Scientology doctrine by stating that "thousands of articles are written about <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>, and they don't print the <a href="Coca-Cola%20formula">formula for Coca-Cola</a>". Scientology has many graduated levels through which one can progress. Many who remain at lower levels in the church are unaware of much of the Xenu story which is first revealed on <a href="Operating%20Thetan">Operating Thetan</a> level three, or "OT III". Because the information imparted to members is to be kept secret from others who have not attained that level, the member must publicly deny its existence when asked. OT III recipients must sign an agreement promising never to reveal its contents before they are given the <a href="Manila%20folder">manila envelope</a> containing the Xenu knowledge. It is knowledge so dangerous, members are told, that anyone learning this material before he is ready could become afflicted with pneumonia.

<a href="Religious%20Technology%20Center">Religious Technology Center</a> director Warren McShane testified in a 1995 court case that the Church of Scientology receives a significant amount of its revenue from fixed donations paid by Scientologists to study the OT materials. McShane said that Hubbard's work "may seem weird" to those that have not yet completed the prior levels of coursework in Scientology. McShane said the story had "never" been secret, although maintaining there were nevertheless <a href="trade%20secret">trade secret</a>s contained in OT III. McShane discussed the details of the story at some length and specifically attributed the authorship of the story to Hubbard.

When John Carmichael, the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, was asked about the Xenu story, he said, as reported in the September 9, 2007, edition of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>": "That's not what we believe". When asked directly about the Xenu story by <a href="Ted%20Koppel">Ted Koppel</a> on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>'s "<a href="Nightline%20%28US%20news%20program%29">Nightline</a>", Scientology leader <a href="David%20Miscavige">David Miscavige</a> said that he was taking things Hubbard said out of context. However, in a 2006 interview with "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", <a href="Mike%20Rinder">Mike Rinder</a>, the director of the church's <a href="Office%20of%20Special%20Affairs">Office of Special Affairs</a>, said that "It is not a "story", it is an auditing level", when asked about the validity of the Xenu story.

In a <a href="Scientology%20and%20Me">BBC "Panorama" programme</a> that aired on May 14, 2007, senior Scientologist <a href="Thomas%20W.%20Davis">Tommy Davis</a> interrupted when celebrity members were asked about Xenu, saying: "None of us know what you're talking about. It's loony. It's weird." In March 2009, Davis was interviewed by <a href="Investigative%20journalism">investigative journalist</a> Nathan Baca for <a href="KESQ-TV">KESQ-TV</a> and was again asked about the OT III texts. Davis told Baca "I'm familiar with the material", and called it "the confidential scriptures of the Church". In an interview on <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a> "<a href="Nightline%20%28U.S.%20news%20program%29">Nightline</a>", October 23, 2009, Davis walked off the set when <a href="Martin%20Bashir">Martin Bashir</a> asked him about Xenu. He told Bashir, "Martin, I am not going to discuss the disgusting perversions of Scientology beliefs that can be found now commonly on the internet and be put in the position of talking about things, talking about things that are so fundamentally offensive to Scientologists to discuss. ... It is in violation of my religious beliefs to talk about them." When Bashir repeated a question about Xenu, Davis pulled off his microphone and left the set.

In November 2009 the Church of Scientology's representative in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, Mike Ferris, was asked in a radio interview about Xenu. The radio host asked, "So what you're saying is, Xenu is a part of the religion, but something that you don't want to talk about". Ferris responded, "Sure". Ferris acknowledged that Xenu "is part of the esoterica of Scientology".

Despite the Church of Scientology's efforts to keep the story secret, details have been leaked over the years. OT III was first revealed in Robert Kaufman's 1972 book "", in which Kaufman detailed his own experiences of OT III. It was later described in a 1981 Clearwater "Sun" article, and came to greater public fame in a 1985 court case brought against Scientology by <a href="Lawrence%20Wollersheim">Lawrence Wollersheim</a>. The church failed to have the documents sealed and attempted to keep the case file checked out by a reader at all times, but the story was summarized in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" and detailed in <a href="William%20Poundstone">William Poundstone</a>'s "Bigger Secrets" (1986) from information presented in the Wollersheim case. In 1987, a book by <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard%20Jr.">L. Ron Hubbard Jr.</a>, "" quoted the first page of OT III and summarized the rest of its content.
Since then, news media have mentioned Xenu in coverage of Scientology or its celebrity proponents such as <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>. In 1987, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s investigative news series "<a href="Panorama%20%28TV%20series%29">Panorama</a>" aired a report titled "The Road to Total Freedom?" which featured an outline of the OT III story in cartoon form.

On December 24, 1994, the Xenu story was published on the Internet for the first time in a posting to the <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> <a href="newsgroup">newsgroup</a> <a href="alt.religion.scientology">alt.religion.scientology</a>, through an <a href="anonymous%20remailer">anonymous remailer</a>. This led to an <a href="Scientology%20versus%20the%20Internet">online battle between Church of Scientology lawyers and detractors</a>. Older versions of OT levels I to VII were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by <a href="Steven%20Fishman">Steven Fishman</a> on April 9, 1993, as part of "Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz". The text of this declaration and its exhibits, collectively known as the <a href="Fishman%20Affidavit">Fishman Affidavit</a>, were posted to the Internet newsgroup <a href="alt.religion.scientology">alt.religion.scientology</a> in August 1995 by <a href="Arnaldo%20Lerma">Arnie Lerma</a> and on the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a> by <a href="David%20S.%20Touretzky">David S. Touretzky</a>. This was a subject of great controversy and legal battles for several years. There was a <a href="copyright">copyright</a> raid on Lerma's house (leading to massive <a href="mirror%20website">mirroring</a> of the documents) and a suit against Dutch writer <a href="Karin%20Spaink">Karin Spaink</a>—the Church bringing suit on <a href="Copyright%20infringement">copyright violation</a> grounds for reproducing the source material, and also claiming rewordings would reveal a trade secret.

The Church of Scientology's attempts to keep Xenu secret have been cited in court findings against it. In September 2003, a Dutch court, in a ruling in the case against Karin Spaink, stated that one objective in keeping OT II and OT III secret was to wield power over members of the Church of Scientology and prevent discussion about its teachings and practices:

Despite his claims that premature revelation of the OT III story was lethal, L. Ron Hubbard wrote a screenplay version under the title "<a href="Revolt%20in%20the%20Stars">Revolt in the Stars</a>" in the 1970s. This revealed that Xenu had been assisted by beings named Chi ("the Galactic Minister of Police") and Chu ("the Executive President of the Galactic Interplanetary Bank"). It has not been officially published, although the <a href="film%20treatment">treatment</a> was circulated around Hollywood in the early 1980s. Unofficial copies of the screenplay circulate on the Internet.

On March 10, 2001, a user posted the text of OT3 to the online community <a href="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>. The site owners took down the comment after the Church of Scientology issued a legal notice under the <a href="Digital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>. Critics of the Church of Scientology have used public protests to spread the Xenu secret. This has included creating web sites with "xenu" in the <a href="domain%20name">domain name</a>, and displaying the name Xenu on banners, and protest signs.

Versions of the Xenu story have appeared in both television shows and stage productions. The <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> <a href="satire">satirical</a> musical "<a href="A%20Very%20Merry%20Unauthorized%20Children%27s%20Scientology%20Pageant">A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant</a>", first staged in 2003 and winner of an <a href="Obie%20Award">Obie Award</a> in 2004, featured children in alien costumes telling the story of Xenu.

The Xenu story was also satirized in a November 2005 episode of the <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> animated television series "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>" titled "<a href="Trapped%20in%20the%20Closet%20%28South%20Park%29">Trapped in the Closet</a>". The <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a>-nominated episode, which also lampooned Scientologists <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> and <a href="John%20Travolta">John Travolta</a> as <a href="closeted">closeted</a> homosexuals, depicted Xenu as a vaguely humanoid alien with tentacles for arms, in a sequence that had the words "This Is What Scientologists Actually Believe" superimposed on screen. The episode became the subject of controversy when musician <a href="Isaac%20Hayes">Isaac Hayes</a>, the voice of the character "<a href="Chef%20%28South%20Park%29">Chef</a>" and a Scientologist, quit the show in March 2006, just prior to the episode's first scheduled re-screening, citing "South Park"s "inappropriate ridicule" of his religion. Hayes' statement did not mention the episode in particular, but expressed his view that the show's habit of parodying religion was part of a "growing insensitivity toward personal spiritual beliefs" in the media that was also reflected in the <a href="Jyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy">Muhammad cartoons controversy</a>: "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins." Responding to Hayes' statement, "South Park" co-creator <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a> said his resignation had "nothing to do with intolerance and bigotry and everything to do with the fact that Isaac Hayes is a Scientologist and that we recently featured Scientology in an episode of South Park ... In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of <a href="Christians">Christians</a>, <a href="Muslims">Muslims</a>, <a href="Mormons">Mormons</a> and <a href="Jews">Jews</a>. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well." Comedy Central cancelled the repeat at short notice, choosing instead to screen two episodes featuring Hayes. A spokesman said that "in light of the events of earlier this week, we wanted to give Chef an appropriate tribute by airing two episodes he is most known for." It did eventually rebroadcast the episode on July 19, 2006. Stone and "South Park" co-creator <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> felt that Comedy Central's owners <a href="Viacom">Viacom</a> had cancelled the repeat because of the upcoming release of the Tom Cruise film "" by <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount</a>, another Viacom company: "I only know what we were told, that people involved with "MI3" wanted the episode off the air and that is why Comedy Central had to do it. I don't know why else it would have been pulled."

Writing in the book "<a href="Scientology%20%28James%20R.%20Lewis%20book%29">Scientology</a>" published by <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>, contributor <a href="Mikael%20Rothstein">Mikael Rothstein</a> observes that, "To my knowledge no real analysis of Scientology's Xenu myth has appeared in scholarly publications. The most sober and enlightening text about the Xenu myth is probably the article on Wikipedia (English version) and, even if brief, Andreas Grünschloss's piece on Scientology in Lewis (2000: 266–268)." Rothstein places the Xenu text by L. Ron Hubbard within the context of a <a href="creation%20myth">creation myth</a> within the Scientology methodology, and characterizes it as "one of Scientology's more important religious narratives, the text that apparently constitutes the basic (sometimes implicit) mythology of the movement, the "Xenu myth", which is basically a story of the origin of man on Earth and the human condition." Rothstein describes the phenomenon within a belief system inspired by science fiction, and notes that the "myth about Xenu, ... in the shape of a science fiction-inspired anthropogony, "explains" the basic Scientological claims about the human condition."

<a href="Andreas%20Gr%C3%BCnschlo%C3%9F">Andreas Grünschloß</a> analyzes the Xenu text in "The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements", within the context of a discussion on <a href="UFO%20religion">UFO religion</a>s. He characterizes the text as "Scientology's secret mythology (contained especially in the OT III teachings)". Grünschloß points out that L. Ron Hubbard, "also wrote a science fiction story called "Revolt in the Stars", where he displays this otherwise arcane story about the ancient ruler Xenu in the form of an ordinary science fiction novel". Grünschloß posits, "because of the connections between several motifs in Hubbard's novels and specific Scientology teachings, one might perceive Scientology as one of the rare instances where science fiction (or fantasy literature generally) is related to the successful formation of a new spiritual movement." Comparing the fusion between the two genres of Hubbard's science fiction writing and Scientology creation myth, Grünschloß writes, "Although the science fiction novels are of a different genre than other 'techno-logical' disclosures of Hubbard, they are highly appreciated by participants, and Hubbard's literary output in this realm (including the latest movie, "Battlefield Earth") is also well promoted by the organization." Writing in the book "UFO Religions" edited by <a href="Christopher%20Partridge">Christopher Partridge</a>, Grünschloß observes, "the enthusiasm for ufology and science fiction was cultivated in the formative phase of Scientology. Indeed, even the highly arcane story of the intergalactic ruler Xenu ... is related by Hubbard in the style of a simple science fiction novel".

Several authors have pointed out structural similarities between the Xenu story and the mythology of <a href="gnosticism">gnosticism</a>. James A. Herrick, writing about the Xenu text in "The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition", notes that "Hubbard's gnostic leanings are evident in his account of human origins ... In Hubbard, ideas first expressed in science fiction are seamlessly transformed into a worldwide religion with affinities to gnosticism." Mary Farrell Bednarowski, writing in "America's Alternative Religions", similarly states that the outline of the Xenu mythology is "not totally unfamiliar to the historian acquainted with ancient gnosticism", noting that many other religious traditions have the practice of reserving certain texts to high-level initiates. Nevertheless, she writes, the Xenu story arouses suspicion in the public about Scientology and adds fuel to "the claims that Hubbard's system is the product of his creativity as a science fiction writer rather than a theologian."

Authors Michael McDowell and Nathan Robert Brown discuss misconceptions about the Xenu text in their book "World Religions at Your Fingertips", and observe, "Probably the most controversial, misunderstood, and frequently misrepresented part of the Scientology religion has to do with a Scientology myth commonly referred to as the Legend of Xenu. While this story has now been undoubtedly proven a part of the religion (despite the fact that church representatives often deny its existence), the story's true role in Scientology is often misrepresented by its critics as proof that they 'believe in alien parasites.' While the story may indeed seem odd, this is simply not the case." The authors write that "The story is actually meant to be a working myth, illustrating the Scientology belief that humans were at one time spiritual beings, existing on infinite levels of intergalactic and interdimensional realities. At some point, the beings that we once were became trapped in physical reality (where we remain to this day). This is supposed to be the underlying message of the Xenu story, not that humans are "possessed by aliens". McDowell and Brown conclude that these inappropriate misconceptions about the Xenu text have had a negative impact, "Such harsh statements are the reason many Scientologists now become passionately offended at even the mention of Xenu by nonmembers."

<a href="Free%20speech">Free speech</a> lawyer <a href="Mike%20Godwin">Mike Godwin</a> analyzes actions by the Scientology organization to protect and keep secret the Xenu text, within a discussion in his book "<a href="Cyber%20Rights">Cyber Rights</a>" about the application of <a href="trade%20secret">trade secret</a> law on the Internet. Godwin explains, "trade secret law protects the information itself, not merely its particular expression. Trade secret law, unlike copyright, can protect ideas and facts directly." He puts forth the question, "But did the material really qualify as 'trade secrets'? Among the material the church has been trying to suppress is what might be called a 'genesis myth of Scientology': a story about a galactic despot named Xenu who decided 75 million years ago to kill a bunch of people by chaining them to volcanoes and dropping nuclear bombs on them." Godwin asks, "Does a 'church' normally have 'competitors' in the trade secret sense? If the Catholics got hold of the full facts about Xenu, does this mean they'll get more market share?" He comments on the ability of the Scientology organization to utilize such laws in order to contain its secret texts, "It seems likely, given what we know about the case now, that even a combination of copyright and trade secret law wouldn't accomplish what the church would like to accomplish: the total suppression of any dissemination of church documents or doctrines." The author concludes, "But the fact that the church was unlikely to gain any complete legal victories in its cases didn't mean that they wouldn't litigate. It's indisputable that the <a href="Strategic%20lawsuit%20against%20public%20participation">mere threat of litigation, or the costs of actual litigation</a>, may accomplish what the legal theories alone do not: the effective silencing of many critics of the church."

Anne, Queen of Great Britain

Anne (6 February 1665 – 1 August 1714) was the <a href="List%20of%20English%20monarchs">Queen of England</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Scottish%20monarchs">Scotland</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Irish%20monarchs">Ireland</a> between 8 March 1702 and 1 May 1707. On 1 May 1707, under the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">Acts of Union</a>, two of her realms, the kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, united as a single <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign state</a> known as <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>. She continued to reign as <a href="List%20of%20British%20monarchs">Queen of Great Britain</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> until her death in 1714.

Anne was born in the reign of her uncle <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>, who had no legitimate children. Her father, Charles's younger brother <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James</a>, was thus <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a> to the throne. His suspected <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> was unpopular in England, and on Charles's instructions Anne and her elder sister, <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a>, were raised as <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglicans</a>. On Charles's death in 1685, James succeeded to the throne, but just three years later he was deposed in the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688. Mary and her husband, the Dutch <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="William%20III%20of%20Orange">William III of Orange</a> (a cousin to Anne and Mary), became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.

During her reign, Anne favoured moderate <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory politicians</a>, who were more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents, the <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whigs</a>. The Whigs grew more powerful during the course of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, until 1710 when Anne dismissed many of them from office. Her close friendship with <a href="Sarah%20Churchill%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Marlborough">Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough</a>, turned sour as the result of political differences. The Duchess took revenge in an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs, which was widely accepted by historians until Anne was re-assessed in the late 20th century.

Anne was plagued by ill health throughout her life, and from her thirties, she grew increasingly ill and obese. Despite seventeen pregnancies by her husband, <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Denmark">Prince George of Denmark</a>, she died without surviving issue and was the last monarch of the <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">House of Stuart</a>. Under the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which excluded all Catholics, she was succeeded by her second cousin <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">House of Hanover</a>.

Anne was born at 11:39 p.m. on 6 February 1665 at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>, London, the fourth child and second daughter of the Duke of York (afterwards <a href="James%20II%20and%20VII">James II and VII</a>), and his first wife, <a href="Anne%20Hyde">Anne Hyde</a>. Her father was the younger brother of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">King Charles II</a>, who ruled the three kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, and her mother was the daughter of <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> <a href="Edward%20Hyde%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Clarendon">Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon</a>. At her <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> baptism in the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a> at St James's, her older sister, <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a>, was one of her godparents, along with the <a href="Anne%20Scott%2C%201st%20Duchess%20of%20Buccleuch">Duchess of Monmouth</a> and the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Gilbert%20Sheldon">Gilbert Sheldon</a>. The Duke and Duchess of York had eight children, but Anne and Mary were the only ones to survive into adulthood.

As a child, Anne suffered from an eye condition, which manifested as excessive watering known as "defluxion". For medical treatment, she was sent to France, where she lived with her paternal grandmother, <a href="Henrietta%20Maria%20of%20France">Henrietta Maria of France</a>, at the Château de Colombes near Paris. Following her grandmother's death in 1669, Anne lived with an aunt, <a href="Henrietta%20Anne%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Henrietta Anne, Duchess of Orléans</a>. On the sudden death of her aunt in 1670, Anne returned to England. Her mother died the following year.

As was traditional in the royal family, Anne and her sister were brought up separated from their father in their own establishment at <a href="Richmond%2C%20London">Richmond, London</a>. On the instructions of Charles II, they were raised as Protestants. Placed in the care of Colonel <a href="Edward%20Villiers%20%281620%E2%80%931689%29">Edward and Lady Frances Villiers</a>, their education was focused on the teachings of the Anglican church. <a href="Henry%20Compton%20%28bishop%29">Henry Compton</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>, was appointed as Anne's <a href="preceptor">preceptor</a>.

Around 1671, Anne first made the acquaintance of <a href="Sarah%20Jennings">Sarah Jennings</a>, who later became her close friend and one of her most influential advisors. Jennings married <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">John Churchill</a> (the future Duke of Marlborough) in about 1678. His sister, <a href="Arabella%20Churchill%20%28royal%20mistress%29">Arabella Churchill</a>, was the Duke of York's mistress, and he was to be Anne's most important general.

In 1673, the Duke of York's conversion to Catholicism became public, and he married a Catholic princess, <a href="Mary%20of%20Modena">Mary of Modena</a>, who was only six-and-a-half years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together, and the Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father.

In November 1677, Anne's elder sister, Mary, married their Dutch first cousin, <a href="William%20III%20of%20Orange">William III of Orange</a>, at St James's Palace, but Anne could not attend the wedding because she was confined to her room with <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. By the time she recovered, Mary had already left for her new life in the Netherlands. Lady Frances Villiers contracted the disease, and died. Anne's aunt <a href="Henrietta%20Hyde%2C%20Countess%20of%20Rochester">Lady Henrietta Hyde</a> (the wife of <a href="Laurence%20Hyde%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Rochester">Laurence Hyde</a>) was appointed as her new governess. A year later, Anne and her stepmother visited Mary in Holland for two weeks.

Anne's father and stepmother retired to Brussels in March 1679 in the wake of anti-Catholic hysteria fed by the <a href="Popish%20Plot">Popish Plot</a>, and Anne visited them from the end of August. In October, they returned to Britain, the Duke and Duchess to Scotland and Anne to England. She joined her father and stepmother at <a href="Holyrood%20Palace">Holyrood Palace</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> from July 1681 until May 1682. It was her last journey outside England.

Anne's second cousin <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George of Hanover</a> visited London for three months from December 1680, sparking rumours of a potential marriage between them. Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin <a href="Sophia%20Dorothea%20of%20Celle">Sophia Dorothea of Celle</a> as part of a scheme to unite the Hanoverian inheritance. Other rumours claimed she was courted by <a href="John%20Sheffield%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Normanby">Lord Mulgrave</a>, although he denied it. Nevertheless, as a result of the gossip, he was temporarily dismissed from court.

With George of Hanover out of contention as a potential suitor for Anne, King Charles looked elsewhere for an eligible prince who would be welcomed as a groom by his Protestant subjects but also acceptable to his Catholic ally, <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a>. The Danes were Protestant allies of the French, and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain the power of the Dutch. A marriage treaty between Anne and <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Denmark">Prince George of Denmark</a>, younger brother of <a href="Christian%20V%20of%20Denmark">King Christian V</a>, and Anne's second cousin once removed, was negotiated by Anne's uncle Laurence Hyde, who had been made Earl of Rochester, and the English <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Northern%20Department">Secretary of State for the Northern Department</a>, <a href="Robert%20Spencer%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Sunderland">Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland</a>. Anne's father consented to the marriage eagerly because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, William of Orange, who was naturally unhappy at the match.

Bishop Compton officiated at the wedding of Anne and George of Denmark on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal. Although it was an arranged marriage, they were faithful and devoted partners. They were given a set of buildings, known as <a href="Cockpit-in-Court">the Cockpit</a>, in the <a href="Palace%20of%20Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a> as their London residence, and Sarah Churchill was appointed one of Anne's <a href="Lady%20of%20the%20Bedchamber">ladies of the bedchamber</a>. Within months of the marriage, Anne was pregnant, but the baby was stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the <a href="spa%20town">spa town</a> of <a href="Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a>, and over the next two years, gave birth to two daughters in quick succession: Mary and Anne Sophia.

When Charles II died in 1685, Anne's father became king. To the consternation of the English people, James began to give Catholics military and administrative offices, in contravention of the <a href="Test%20Act">Test Act</a>s that were designed to prevent such appointments. Anne shared the general concern, and continued to attend Anglican services. As her sister Mary lived in the Netherlands, Anne and her family were the only members of the royal family attending Protestant religious services in England. When her father tried to get Anne to baptise her youngest daughter into the Catholic faith, Anne burst into tears. "The Church of Rome is wicked and dangerous", she wrote to her sister, "their ceremonies—most of them—plain downright idolatry." Anne became estranged from her father and stepmother, as James moved to weaken the Church of England's power.

In early 1687, within a matter of days, Anne miscarried, her husband caught smallpox, and their two young daughters died of the same infection. <a href="Rachel%20Russell%2C%20Lady%20Russell">Lady Rachel Russell</a> wrote that George and Anne had "taken [the deaths] very heavily ... Sometimes they wept, sometimes they mourned in words; then sat silent, hand in hand; he sick in bed, and she the carefullest nurse to him that can be imagined." Later that year, she suffered another stillbirth.

Public alarm at James's Catholicism increased when his wife, Mary of Modena, became pregnant for the first time since James's accession. In letters to her sister Mary, Anne raised suspicions that the Queen was faking her pregnancy in an attempt to introduce a false heir. She wrote, "they will stick at nothing, be it never so wicked, if it will promote their interest ... there may be foul play intended." Anne suffered another miscarriage in April 1688, and left London to recuperate in the spa town of <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>.

Anne's stepmother gave birth to a son, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward">James Francis Edward</a>, on 10 June 1688, and a Catholic succession became more likely. Anne was still at Bath, so she did not witness the birth, which fed the belief that the child was spurious. Anne may have left the capital deliberately to avoid being present, or because she was genuinely ill, but it is also possible that James desired the exclusion of all Protestants, including his daughter, from affairs of state. "I shall never now be satisfied", Anne wrote to her sister Mary, "whether the child be true or false. It may be it is our brother, but God only knows ... one cannot help having a thousand fears and melancholy thoughts, but whatever changes may happen you shall ever find me firm to my religion and faithfully yours."

To dispel rumours of a <a href="%3Awikt%3Asupposititious">supposititious</a> child, James had 40 witnesses to the birth attend a <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20England">Privy Council</a> meeting, but Anne claimed she could not attend because she was pregnant herself (which she was not) and then declined to read the depositions because it was "not necessary".

William of Orange invaded England on 5 November 1688 in an action, known as the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>, which ultimately deposed King James. Forbidden by James to pay Mary a projected visit in the spring of 1687, Anne corresponded with her and was aware of the plans to invade. On the advice of the Churchills, she refused to side with James after William landed and instead wrote to William on 18 November declaring her approval of his action. Churchill abandoned the unpopular King James on the 24th. Prince George followed suit that night, and in the evening of the following day James issued orders to place Sarah Churchill under house arrest at St James's Palace. Anne and Sarah fled from Whitehall by a back staircase, putting themselves under the care of Bishop Compton. They spent one night in his house, and subsequently arrived at <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> on 1 December. Two weeks later and escorted by a large company, Anne arrived at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, where she met Prince George in triumph. "God help me!", lamented James on discovering the desertion of his daughter on 26 November, "Even my children have forsaken me." On 19 December, Anne returned to London, where she was at once visited by William. James fled to France on the 23rd. Anne showed no concern at the news of her father's flight, and instead merely asked for her usual game of cards. She justified herself by saying that she "was used to play and never loved to do anything that looked like an affected constraint".

In January 1689, a <a href="Convention%20Parliament%20%281689%29">Convention Parliament</a> assembled in England and declared that James had effectively abdicated when he fled, and that the thrones of England and Ireland were therefore vacant. The <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament or Estates of Scotland</a> took similar action, and William and Mary were declared monarchs of all three realms. The <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights 1689</a> and <a href="Claim%20of%20Right%20Act%201689">Claim of Right Act 1689</a> settled the succession. Anne and her descendants were to be in the line of succession after William and Mary, and they were to be followed by any descendants of William by a future marriage. On 24 July 1689, Anne gave birth to a son, <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Prince William, Duke of Gloucester</a>, who, though ill, survived infancy. As King William and Queen Mary had no children, it looked as though Anne's son would eventually inherit the Crown.

Soon after their accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by granting him the <a href="Earldom%20of%20Marlborough">Earldom of Marlborough</a> and Prince George was made <a href="Duke%20of%20Cumberland">Duke of Cumberland</a>. Anne requested the use of <a href="Richmond%20Palace">Richmond Palace</a> and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused tension between the two sisters. Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an active capacity. The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction. From around this time, at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman, respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone. In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobites</a>, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at <a href="Syon%20House">Syon House</a>, the home of the <a href="Charles%20Seymour%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Duke of Somerset</a>. Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her. In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Later that year, Anne moved to <a href="Berkeley%20House%20%28London%29">Berkeley House</a> in <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.

When Mary died of smallpox in 1694, William continued to reign alone. Anne became his <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>, since any children he might have by another wife were assigned to a lower place in the line of succession, and the two reconciled publicly. He restored her previous honours, allowed her to reside in St James's Palace, and gave her Mary's jewels, but excluded her from government and refrained from appointing her regent during his absences abroad. Three months later, William restored Marlborough to his offices. With Anne's restoration at court, Berkeley House became a social centre for courtiers who had previously avoided contact with Anne and her husband.

According to James, Anne wrote to him in 1696 requesting his permission to succeed William, and thereafter promising to restore the Crown to James's line at a convenient opportunity; he declined to give his consent. She was probably trying to ensure her own succession by attempting to prevent a direct claim by James.

Anne's final pregnancy ended on 25 January 1700 with a stillbirth. She had been pregnant at least seventeen times over as many years, and had miscarried or given birth to stillborn children at least twelve times. Of her five liveborn children, four died before reaching the age of two. Anne suffered from bouts of "<a href="gout">gout</a>": pains in her limbs and eventually stomach and head, from at least 1698. Based on her foetal losses and physical symptoms, she may have had <a href="Systemic%20lupus%20erythematosus">disseminated lupus erythematosus</a>, or <a href="Hughes%20syndrome">Hughes syndrome</a>. Alternatively, <a href="pelvic%20inflammatory%20disease">pelvic inflammatory disease</a> could explain why the onset of her symptoms roughly coincided with her penultimate pregnancy. Other suggested causes of her failed pregnancies are <a href="listeriosis">listeriosis</a>, <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>, <a href="intrauterine%20growth%20retardation">intrauterine growth retardation</a>, and <a href="rhesus%20incompatibility">rhesus incompatibility</a>. Rhesus incompatibility, however, generally worsens with successive pregnancies, and so does not fit with the pattern of Anne's pregnancies, as her only son to survive infancy, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, was born after a series of stillbirths. Experts also rule out <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>, <a href="porphyria">porphyria</a> and pelvic deformation as incompatible with her medical history.

Anne's gout rendered her lame for much of her later life. Around the court, she was carried in a <a href="sedan%20chair">sedan chair</a>, or used a wheelchair. Around her estates, she used a one-horse <a href="chaise">chaise</a>, which she drove herself "furiously like <a href="Jehu">Jehu</a> and a mighty hunter like <a href="Nimrod">Nimrod</a>". She gained weight as a result of her sedentary lifestyle; in Sarah's words, "she grew exceeding gross and corpulent. There was something of majesty in her look, but mixed with a gloominess of soul". <a href="Sir%20John%20Clerk%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Clerk, 1st Baronet</a>, described her in 1706 

Anne's sole surviving child, the Duke of Gloucester, died at the age of eleven on 30 July 1700. She and her husband were "overwhelmed with grief". Anne ordered her household to observe a day of mourning every year on the anniversary of his death. With William childless and Gloucester dead, Anne was the only individual remaining in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. To address the succession crisis and preclude a Catholic restoration, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a> enacted the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which provided that, failing the issue of Anne and of William III by any future marriage, the Crown of England and Ireland would go to <a href="Sophia%2C%20Electress%20of%20Hanover">Sophia, Electress of Hanover</a>, and her Protestant descendants. Sophia was the granddaughter of <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James VI and I</a> through his daughter <a href="Elizabeth%20Stuart%2C%20Queen%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth</a>, who was the sister of Anne's grandfather <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. Over fifty Catholics with stronger claims were excluded from the line of succession. Anne's father died in September 1701. His widow, Anne's stepmother, the former queen, wrote to Anne to inform her that her father forgave her and to remind her of her promise to seek the restoration of his line. Anne, however, had already acquiesced to the new line of succession created by the Act of Settlement.

Anne became queen upon the death of King William III on 8 March 1702, and was immediately popular. In her first speech to the English Parliament, on 11 March, she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother-in-law and said, "As I know my heart to be entirely English, I can very sincerely assure you there is not anything you can expect or desire from me which I shall not be ready to do for the happiness and prosperity of England."

Soon after her accession, Anne appointed her husband <a href="Lord%20High%20Admiral%20of%20Great%20Britain">Lord High Admiral</a>, giving him nominal control of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Anne gave control of the army to Lord Marlborough, whom she appointed <a href="Captain-General">Captain-General</a>. Marlborough also received numerous honours from the Queen; he was created a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Knight of the Garter</a> and was elevated to the rank of duke. The Duchess of Marlborough was appointed <a href="Groom%20of%20the%20Stool">Groom of the Stool</a>, <a href="Mistress%20of%20the%20Robes">Mistress of the Robes</a>, and <a href="Keeper%20of%20the%20Privy%20Purse">Keeper of the Privy Purse</a>.

Anne was <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">crowned</a> on <a href="St%20George%27s%20Day">St George's Day</a>, 23 April 1702. Afflicted with gout, she was carried to <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> in an open sedan chair, with a low back to permit her train to flow out behind her. On 4 May, England became embroiled in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, in which England, Austria, and the Dutch Republic fought against France and <a href="Bourbon%20Spain">Bourbon Spain</a>. <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20Spain">Charles II of Spain</a> had died childless in 1700, and the succession was disputed by two claimants: the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburg</a> <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Archduke Charles of Austria</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a> <a href="Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anjou">Philip, Duke of Anjou</a>.

She took a lively interest in affairs of state, and was a patron of theatre, poetry and music. She subsidised <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a> with £200 a year. She sponsored high-quality medals as rewards for political or military achievements. They were produced at the Mint by <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> and <a href="John%20Croker%20%28engraver%29">John Croker</a>. She knighted Newton when she visited Cambridge in 1705.

While Ireland was subordinate to the English Crown and Wales formed part of the kingdom of England, Scotland remained an independent sovereign state with its own parliament and laws. The <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, passed by the English Parliament, applied in the kingdoms of England and Ireland but not Scotland, where a strong minority wished to preserve the Stuart dynasty and its right of inheritance to the throne. Anne had declared it "very necessary" to conclude a union of England and Scotland in her first speech to the English Parliament, and a joint Anglo-Scots commission met at her former residence, the Cockpit, to discuss terms in October 1702. The negotiations broke up in early February 1703 having failed to reach an agreement. The Estates of Scotland responded to the Act of Settlement by passing the <a href="Act%20of%20Security%201704">Act of Security</a>, which gave the Estates the power, if the Queen had no further children, to choose the next Scottish monarch from among the Protestant descendants of the royal line of Scotland. The individual chosen by the Estates could not be the same person who came to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants. At first, Anne withheld <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> to the act, but she granted it the following year when the Estates threatened to withhold supply, endangering Scottish support for England's wars.

In its turn, the English Parliament responded with the <a href="Alien%20Act%201705">Alien Act 1705</a>, which threatened to impose economic sanctions and declare Scottish subjects <a href="alien%20%28law%29">aliens</a> in England, unless Scotland either repealed the Act of Security or moved to unite with England. The Estates chose the latter option; the English Parliament agreed to repeal the Alien Act, and new commissioners were appointed by Queen Anne in early 1706 to negotiate the terms of a union. The articles of union approved by the commissioners were presented to Anne on 23 July 1706 and ratified by the Scottish and English Parliaments on 16 January and 6 March 1707, respectively. Under the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">Acts of Union</a>, England and Scotland were united into a single kingdom called Great Britain, with one parliament, on 1 May 1707. Anne, a consistent and ardent supporter of union despite opposition on both sides of the border, attended a thanksgiving service in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>. The Scot <a href="Sir%20John%20Clerk%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Clerk, 1st Baronet</a>, who also attended, wrote, "nobody on this occasion appeared more sincerely devout and thankful than the Queen herself".

Anne's reign was marked by the further development of a two-party system. In general, the <a href="Tory">Tories</a> were supportive of the <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican church</a> and favoured the landed interest of the country gentry, while the <a href="Whiggism">Whigs</a> were aligned with commercial interests and Protestant <a href="Dissenter">Dissenter</a>s. As a committed Anglican, Anne was inclined to favour the Tories. Her first ministry was predominantly Tory, and contained such <a href="High%20Tories">High Tories</a> as <a href="Daniel%20Finch%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Nottingham">Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham</a>, and her uncle <a href="Laurence%20Hyde%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Rochester">Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester</a>. It was headed by <a href="Lord%20Treasurer">Lord Treasurer</a> <a href="Sidney%20Godolphin%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Godolphin">Lord Godolphin</a> and Anne's favourite the <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a>, who were considered moderate Tories, along with the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, <a href="Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Mortimer">Robert Harley</a>.

Anne supported the <a href="Occasional%20Conformity%20Bill">Occasional Conformity Bill</a> of 1702, which was promoted by the Tories and opposed by the Whigs. The bill aimed to disqualify Protestant Dissenters from public office by closing a loophole in the <a href="Test%20Act">Test Act</a>s, legislation that restricted public office to Anglican <a href="conformist">conformist</a>s. The existing law permitted <a href="nonconformist">nonconformist</a>s to take office if they took Anglican <a href="Eucharist">communion</a> once a year. Anne's husband was placed in an unfortunate position when Anne forced him to vote for the bill, even though, being a <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>, he was an occasional conformist himself. The Whigs successfully blocked the bill for the duration of the parliamentary session. Anne reinstituted the traditional religious practice of <a href="touching%20for%20the%20king%27s%20evil">touching for the king's evil</a> that had been eschewed by William as papist superstition. After the <a href="Great%20Storm%20of%201703">Great Storm of 1703</a>, Anne declared a general fast to implore God "to pardon the crying sins of this nation which had drawn down this sad judgement". The Occasional Conformity Bill was revived in the wake of the storm, but Anne withheld support, fearing its reintroduction was a ruse to cause a political quarrel. Once again it failed. A third attempt to introduce the bill as an amendment to a <a href="money%20bill">money bill</a> in November 1704 was also thwarted.

The Whigs vigorously supported the War of the Spanish Succession and became even more influential after the Duke of Marlborough won a great victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Blenheim">Battle of Blenheim</a> in 1704. Many of the High Tories, who opposed British involvement in the land war against France, were removed from office. Godolphin, Marlborough, and Harley, who had replaced Nottingham as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Northern%20Department">Secretary of State for the Northern Department</a>, formed a ruling "triumvirate". They were forced to rely more and more on support from the Whigs, and particularly from the <a href="Whig%20Junto">Whig Junto</a>—Lords <a href="John%20Somers%2C%201st%20Baron%20Somers">Somers</a>, <a href="Charles%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a>, <a href="Edward%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Orford">Orford</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Wharton%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Wharton">Wharton</a> and <a href="Charles%20Spencer%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Sunderland">Sunderland</a>—whom Anne disliked. Sarah, the Duchess of Marlborough, incessantly badgered the Queen to appoint more Whigs and reduce the power of the Tories, whom she considered little better than Jacobites, and the Queen became increasingly discontented with her.

In 1706, Godolphin and the Marlboroughs forced Anne to accept Lord Sunderland, a Junto Whig and the Marlboroughs' son-in-law, as Harley's colleague as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Southern%20Department">Secretary of State for the Southern Department</a>. Although this strengthened the ministry's position in Parliament, it weakened the ministry's position with the Queen, as Anne became increasingly irritated with Godolphin and with her former favourite, the Duchess of Marlborough, for supporting Sunderland and other Whig candidates for vacant government and church positions. The Queen turned for private advice to Harley, who was uncomfortable with Marlborough and Godolphin's turn towards the Whigs. She also turned to <a href="Abigail%20Masham%2C%20Baroness%20Masham">Abigail Hill</a>, a <a href="woman%20of%20the%20bedchamber">woman of the bedchamber</a> whose influence grew as Anne's relationship with Sarah deteriorated. Abigail was related to both Harley and the Duchess, but was politically closer to Harley, and acted as an intermediary between him and the Queen.

The division within the ministry came to a head on 8 February 1708, when Godolphin and the Marlboroughs insisted that the Queen had to either dismiss Harley or do without their services. When the Queen seemed to hesitate, Marlborough and Godolphin refused to attend a cabinet meeting. Harley attempted to lead business without his former colleagues, and several of those present including the <a href="Charles%20Seymour%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Duke of Somerset</a> refused to participate until they returned. Her hand forced, the Queen dismissed Harley.

The following month, Anne's Catholic half-brother, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a>, attempted to land in Scotland with French assistance in an attempt to establish himself as king. Anne withheld royal assent from the <a href="Scottish%20Militia%20Bill%201708">Scottish Militia Bill 1708</a> in case the militia raised in Scotland was disloyal and sided with the Jacobites. She was the last British sovereign to veto a parliamentary bill, although her action was barely commented upon at the time. The invasion fleet never landed and was chased away by British ships commanded by <a href="George%20Byng%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Torrington">Sir George Byng</a>. As a result of the Jacobite invasion scare, support for the Tories fell and the Whigs were able to secure a majority in the <a href="British%20general%20election%2C%201708">British general election, 1708</a>.

The Duchess of Marlborough was angered when Abigail moved into rooms at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a> that Sarah considered her own, though she rarely if ever used them. In July 1708, she came to court with a bawdy poem written by a Whig propagandist, probably Arthur Maynwaring, that implied a <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> relationship between Anne and Abigail. The Duchess wrote to Anne telling her she had damaged her reputation by conceiving "a great passion for such a woman ... strange and unaccountable". Sarah thought Abigail had risen above her station, writing "I never thought her education was such as to make her fit company for a great queen. Many people have liked the humour of their chambermaids and have been very kind to them, but 'tis very uncommon to hold a private correspondence with them and put them upon the foot of a friend." While some modern commentators have concluded Anne was a lesbian, most have rejected this analysis. In the opinion of Anne's biographers, she considered Abigail nothing more than a trusted servant, and was a woman of strong traditional beliefs, who was devoted to her husband.

At a thanksgiving service for a victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Oudenarde">Battle of Oudenarde</a>, Anne did not wear the jewels that Sarah had selected for her. At the door of St Paul's Cathedral, they had an argument that culminated in Sarah offending the Queen by telling her to be quiet. Anne was dismayed. When Sarah forwarded an unrelated letter from her husband to Anne, with a covering note continuing the argument, Anne wrote back pointedly, "After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day of not answering you, I should not have troubled you with these lines, but to return the Duke of Marlborough's letter safe into your hands, and for the same reason do not say anything to that, nor to yours which enclosed it."

Anne was devastated by her husband's death in October 1708, and the event proved a turning point in her relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough. The Duchess arrived at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a> shortly before George died, and after his death insisted that Anne leave Kensington for St James's Palace against her wishes. Anne resented the Duchess's intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen's bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural "to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead".

The Whigs used George's death to their own advantage. The leadership of the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> was unpopular among the Whig leaders, who had blamed Prince George and his deputy <a href="George%20Churchill%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">George Churchill</a> (who was Marlborough's brother) for mismanagement of the navy. With Whigs now dominant in Parliament, and Anne distraught at the loss of her husband, they forced her to accept the Junto leaders Lords Somers and Wharton into the cabinet. Anne, however, insisted on carrying out the duties of Lord High Admiral herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of the Earl of Orford, another member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>. Anne appointed the moderate <a href="Thomas%20Herbert%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Earl of Pembroke</a>, on 29 November 1708. Pressure mounted on Pembroke, Godolphin and the Queen from the dissatisfied Junto Whigs, and Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.

Sarah continued to berate Anne for her friendship with Abigail, and in October 1709, Anne wrote to the Duke of Marlborough asking that his wife "leave off teasing & tormenting me & behave herself with the decency she ought both to her friend and Queen". On <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Maundy Thursday</a> 6 April 1710, Anne and Sarah saw each other for the last time. According to Sarah, the Queen was taciturn and formal, repeating the same phrases—"Whatever you have to say you may put in writing" and "You said you desired no answer, and I shall give you none"—over and over.

As the expensive <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> grew unpopular, so did the Whig administration. The <a href="impeachment">impeachment</a> of <a href="Henry%20Sacheverell">Henry Sacheverell</a>, a <a href="high%20church">high church</a> Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion. In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne's guards, and Secretary of State Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected. Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops. In line with Anne's views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentence—suspension of preaching for three years—was so light as to render the trial a mockery.

The Queen, increasingly disdainful of the Marlboroughs and her ministry, finally took the opportunity to dismiss Sunderland in June 1710. Godolphin followed in August. The Junto Whigs were removed from office, although Marlborough, for the moment, remained as commander of the army. In their place, she appointed a new ministry, headed by Harley, which began to seek peace with France. Unlike the Whigs, Harley and his ministry were ready to compromise by giving Spain to the Bourbon claimant, Philip of Anjou, in return for commercial concessions. In the <a href="British%20general%20election%2C%201710">parliamentary elections</a> that soon followed his appointment, Harley, aided by government patronage, secured a large Tory majority. In January 1711, Anne forced Sarah to resign her court offices, and Abigail took over as Keeper of the Privy Purse. Harley was stabbed by a disgruntled French refugee, the <a href="Antoine%20de%20Guiscard">Marquis de Guiscard</a>, in March, and Anne wept at the thought he would die. He recovered slowly. Godolphin's death from natural causes in September 1712 reduced Anne to tears; she blamed their estrangement on the Marlboroughs.

The elder brother of Archduke Charles, <a href="Emperor%20Joseph%20I">Emperor Joseph I</a>, died in April 1711 and Charles succeeded him in Austria, Hungary and the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. To give him also the Spanish throne was no longer in Britain's interests, but the proposed <a href="Peace%20of%20Utrecht">Peace of Utrecht</a> submitted to Parliament for ratification did not go as far as the Whigs wanted to curb Bourbon ambitions. In the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Great%20Britain">House of Commons</a>, the Tory majority was unassailable, but the same was not true in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. The Whigs secured the support of the Earl of Nottingham against the treaty by promising to support <a href="Occasional%20Conformity%20Act%201711">his Occasional Conformity bill</a>. Seeing a need for decisive action to erase the anti-peace majority in the House of Lords, and seeing no alternative, Anne reluctantly created twelve new peers, even though such a mass creation of peers was unprecedented. Abigail's husband, <a href="Samuel%20Masham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Masham">Samuel Masham</a>, was made a baron, although Anne protested to Harley that she "never had any design to make a great lady of [Abigail], and should lose a useful servant". On the same day, Marlborough was dismissed as commander of the army. The peace treaty was ratified and Britain's military involvement in the War of the Spanish Succession ended.

By signing the Treaty of Utrecht, King <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a> recognised the Hanoverian succession in Britain. Nevertheless, gossip that Anne and her ministers favoured the succession of her half-brother rather than the Hanoverians continued, despite Anne's denials in public and in private. The rumours were fed by her consistent refusals to permit any of the Hanoverians to visit or move to England, and by the intrigues of Harley and the Tory Secretary of State <a href="Henry%20St%20John%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Bolingbroke">Lord Bolingbroke</a>, who were in separate and secret discussions with her half-brother about a possible Stuart restoration until early 1714.

Anne was unable to walk between January and July 1713. At Christmas, she was feverish, and lay unconscious for hours, which led to rumours of her impending death. She recovered, but was seriously ill again in March. By July, Anne had lost confidence in Harley; his secretary recorded that Anne told the cabinet "that he neglected all business; that he was seldom to be understood; that when he did explain himself, she could not depend upon the truth of what he said; that he never came to her at the time she appointed; that he often came drunk; [and] last, to crown all, he behaved himself towards her with ill manner, indecency and disrespect." On 27 July 1714, during Parliament's summer <a href="Recess%20%28motion%29">recess</a>, she dismissed Harley as Lord Treasurer. Despite failing health, which her doctors blamed on the emotional strain of matters of state, she attended two late-night cabinet meetings that failed to determine Harley's successor. A third meeting was cancelled when she became too ill to attend. She was rendered unable to speak by a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> on 30 July 1714, the anniversary of Gloucester's death, and on the advice of the Privy Council handed the treasurer's staff of office to Whig grandee <a href="Charles%20Talbot%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Shrewsbury">Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury</a>. She died around 7:30 a.m. on 1 August 1714. <a href="John%20Arbuthnot">John Arbuthnot</a>, one of her doctors, thought her death was a release from a life of ill-health and tragedy; he wrote to <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>, "I believe sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than death was to her."

Anne was buried beside her husband and children in the <a href="Henry%20VII%20Chapel">Henry VII Chapel</a> on the South Aisle of Westminster Abbey on 24 August. The Electress Sophia had died on 28 May, two months before Anne, so the Electress's son, George, Elector of Hanover, inherited the British Crown pursuant to the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>. The possible Catholic claimants, including Anne's half-brother, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a>, were ignored. The Elector's accession was relatively stable: a <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20in%201715">Jacobite rising in 1715</a> failed. Marlborough was re-instated, and the Tory ministers were replaced by Whigs.

The Duchess of Marlborough "unduly disparaged" Anne in her memoirs, and her prejudiced recollections persuaded many early biographers that Anne was "a weak, irresolute woman beset by bedchamber quarrels and deciding high policy on the basis of personalities". The Duchess wrote of Anne:

Historians have since viewed Anne more favourably. In his biography of 1980, Edward Gregg presents the Queen as a woman of invincible stubbornness, who was the central figure of her age. Gregg's argument depicts her reign as: 

In the opinion of modern historians, traditional assessments of Anne as fat, constantly pregnant, under the influence of favourites, and lacking political astuteness or interest may derive from <a href="male%20chauvinism">male chauvinist</a> prejudices against women. Author David Green noted, "Hers was not, as used to be supposed, <a href="Petticoat%23Petticoats%20in%20popular%20culture">petticoat government</a>. She had considerable power; yet time and time again she had to capitulate." Gregg concluded that Anne was often able to impose her will, even though, as a woman in an age of male dominance and preoccupied by her health, her reign was marked by an increase in the influence of ministers and a decrease in the influence of the Crown. She attended more cabinet meetings than any of her predecessors or successors, and presided over an age of artistic, literary, scientific, economic and political advancement that was made possible by the stability and prosperity of her reign. In architecture, <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">Sir John Vanbrugh</a> constructed <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a> and <a href="Castle%20Howard">Castle Howard</a>. <a href="Queen%20Anne%20style%20architecture">Queen Anne-style architecture</a> and <a href="Queen%20Anne%20style%20furniture">Queen Anne-style furniture</a> were named after her. Writers such as <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a> and <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a> flourished. <a href="Henry%20Wise%20%28gardener%29">Henry Wise</a> laid out new gardens at Blenheim, Kensington, Windsor and St James's. The union of England and Scotland, which Anne had fervently supported, created Europe's largest free trade area. The political and diplomatic achievements of Anne's governments, and the absence of constitutional conflict between monarch and parliament during her reign, indicate that she chose ministers and exercised her prerogatives wisely.


The official style of Anne before 1707 was "Anne, by the Grace of God, Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, <a href="Fidei%20defensor">Defender of the Faith</a>, etc." After the union, her style was "Anne, by the Grace of God, Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc." In line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1800, Anne was styled "<a href="English%20claims%20to%20the%20French%20throne">Queen of France</a>", but did not actually reign in France.

As <a href="queen%20regnant">queen regnant</a>, Anne's coat of arms before the union were the Stuart <a href="Royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal arms</a>, in use since 1603: <a href="Quartering%20%28heraldry%29">Quarterly</a>; I and IV grandquarterly, <a href="Azure%20%28heraldry%29">Azure</a> three <a href="Fleur-de-lis">fleurs-de-lis</a> <a href="Or%20%28heraldry%29">Or</a> (for France) and <a href="Gules">Gules</a> three lions <a href="Attitude%20%28heraldry%29%23Passant">passant guardant</a> in <a href="Pale%20%28heraldry%29">pale</a> Or (<a href="Royal%20Arms%20of%20England">for England</a>); II, Or, a lion <a href="rampant">rampant</a> within a double <a href="tressure">tressure</a> flory-counter-flory Gules (<a href="Royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Scotland">for Scotland</a>); III, Azure, a harp Or stringed <a href="Argent">Argent</a> (<a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Ireland">for Ireland</a>). In 1702, Anne adopted the motto "semper eadem" ("always the same"), the same motto used by <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a>.
The Acts of Union declared that: "the Ensigns Armorial of the said United Kingdom be such as Her Majesty shall appoint". In 1707, the union was heraldically expressed by the <a href="Impalement%20%28heraldry%29">impalement</a>, or placing side-by-side in the same quarter, of the arms of England and Scotland, which had previously been in different quarters. The new arms were: Quarterly; I and IV, Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England) impaling Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); II, Azure, three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France); III, Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland). In Scotland, a separate form of arms was used on seals until the Act of Union.

William Tecumseh Sherman

William Tecumseh Sherman (February 8, 1820 – February 14, 1891) was an American soldier, businessman, educator, and author. He served as a <a href="General%20officer">general</a> in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> (1861–65), for which he received recognition for his outstanding command of <a href="military%20strategy">military strategy</a> as well as criticism for the harshness of the <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> policies he implemented in conducting <a href="total%20war">total war</a> against the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States</a>.

Sherman was born into a prominent political family. He graduated from the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> in 1840 and was stationed in California. He married <a href="Ellen%20Ewing%20Sherman">Ellen Ewing Sherman</a> and together they raised eight children. Sherman's wife and children were all devout <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholics</a>, while Sherman was originally a member of the faith but later left it. In 1859, he gained a position as superintendent of the <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Seminary%20of%20Learning%20%26amp%3B%20Military%20Academy">Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy</a>. Living in the South, Sherman grew to respect Southern culture and sympathize with the practice of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">Southern slavery</a>, although he opposed <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a>.

Sherman began his Civil War career serving with distinction in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a> before being transferred to the <a href="Western%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Western Theater</a>. He served in Kentucky in 1861, where he acted overly paranoid, exaggerating the presence of spies in the region and providing what seemed to be alarmingly high estimates of the number of troops needed to pacify Kentucky. He was granted leave, and fell into <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a>. Sherman returned to serve under General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> in the winter of 1862 during the battles of forts <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Henry">Henry</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Donelson">Donelson</a>. Before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>, Sherman commanded a division. Failing to make proper preparations for a Confederate offensive, his men were surprised and overrun. He later rallied his division and helped drive the Confederates back. Sherman later served in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Corinth">Siege of Corinth</a> and commanded the <a href="XV%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">XV Corps</a> during the <a href="Vicksburg%20Campaign">Vicksburg Campaign</a>, which led to the fall of the critical Confederate stronghold of <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg</a> on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. After Grant was promoted to command of all Western armies, Sherman took over the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Tennessee">Army of the Tennessee</a> and led it during the <a href="Chattanooga%20Campaign">Chattanooga Campaign</a>, which culminated with the routing of the Confederate armies in the state of <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>.

In 1864, Sherman succeeded Grant as the <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> commander in the <a href="Western%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">western theater</a> of the war. He proceeded to lead his troops to the <a href="Atlanta%20Campaign">capture</a> of the city of <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, a military success that contributed to the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">re-election</a> of <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Sherman's subsequent <a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">march through Georgia</a> and the <a href="Carolinas%20Campaign">Carolinas</a> further undermined the Confederacy's ability to continue fighting by destroying large amounts of supplies and demoralizing the Southern people. The tactics that he used during this march, though effective, remain a subject of controversy. He accepted the surrender of all the Confederate armies in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida in April 1865, after having been present at most major military engagements in the West. When Grant assumed the U.S. presidency in 1869, Sherman succeeded him as <a href="Commanding%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Commanding General of the Army</a>, in which capacity he served from 1869 until 1883. As such, he was responsible for the U.S. Army's engagement in the <a href="Indian%20Wars">Indian Wars</a> over the next 15 years. Sherman advocated total war against hostile Indians to force them back onto their reservations. He was skeptical of the <a href="Reconstruction%20era">Reconstruction era</a> policies of the federal government in the South. Sherman steadfastly refused to be drawn into politics and in 1875 published his "Memoirs", one of the best-known first-hand accounts of the Civil War. British military historian <a href="B.%20H.%20Liddell%20Hart">B. H. Liddell Hart</a> declared that Sherman was "the first modern general".

Sherman was born in 1820 in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Ohio">Lancaster</a>, Ohio, near the banks of the <a href="Hocking%20River">Hocking River</a>. His father, <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Sherman">Charles Robert Sherman</a>, a successful lawyer who sat on the <a href="Ohio%20Supreme%20Court">Ohio Supreme Court</a>, died unexpectedly in 1829. He left his widow, Mary Hoyt Sherman, with eleven children and no inheritance. After his father's death, the nine-year-old Sherman was raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney <a href="Thomas%20Ewing">Thomas Ewing, Sr.</a>, a prominent member of the <a href="United%20States%20Whig%20Party">Whig Party</a> who served as <a href="United%20States%20Senate">senator</a> from Ohio and as the first <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>. Sherman was distantly related to American founding father <a href="Roger%20Sherman">Roger Sherman</a> and grew to admire him.

Sherman's older brother <a href="Charles%20Taylor%20Sherman">Charles Taylor Sherman</a> became a federal judge. One of his younger brothers, <a href="John%20Sherman%20%28politician%29">John Sherman</a>, served as a U.S. senator and <a href="United%20States%20Cabinet">Cabinet</a> secretary. Another younger brother, <a href="Hoyt%20Sherman">Hoyt Sherman</a>, was a successful banker. Two of his foster brothers served as <a href="Major%20General%23United%20States">major generals</a> in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> during the Civil War: <a href="Hugh%20Boyle%20Ewing">Hugh Boyle Ewing</a>, later an ambassador and author, and <a href="Thomas%20Ewing%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Ewing, Jr.</a>, who would serve as <a href="defense%20attorney">defense attorney</a> in the military trials of the <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20assassination">Lincoln conspirators</a>. Sherman would marry his foster sister, <a href="Ellen%20Ewing%20Sherman">Ellen Boyle Ewing</a>, at age 30 and have eight children with her.

Sherman's unusual given name has always attracted considerable attention. Sherman reported that his middle name came from his father having "caught a fancy for the great chief of the <a href="Shawnee%20%28tribe%29">Shawnees</a>, '<a href="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>". Since an account in a 1932 biography about Sherman, it has often been reported that, as an infant, Sherman was named simply Tecumseh. According to these accounts, Sherman only acquired the name "William" at age nine or ten, after being taken into the Ewing household. His foster mother, Maria Willis Boyle (Maria Ewing), was of Irish ancestry and a devout <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a>. Sherman was raised in a Roman Catholic household, although he later left the church, citing the effect of the Civil War on his religious views. According to a story that may be myth, Sherman was baptized in the Ewing home by a <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> priest, who named him William for the saint's day: possibly June 25, the feast day of Saint <a href="William%20of%20Montevergine">William of Montevergine</a>. The story is contested, however. Sherman wrote in his "Memoirs" that his father named him William Tecumseh; Sherman was baptized by a <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> minister as an infant and given the name William at that time. As an adult, Sherman signed all his correspondence – including to his wife – "W.T. Sherman." His friends and family always called him "Cump."

Senator Ewing secured an appointment for the 16-year-old Sherman as a <a href="cadet">cadet</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point</a>, where he roomed and became good friends with another important future Civil War General, <a href="George%20H.%20Thomas">George H. Thomas</a>. While there Sherman excelled academically, but he treated the demerit system with indifference. Fellow cadet <a href="William%20Rosecrans">William Rosecrans</a> would later remember Sherman at West Point as "one of the brightest and most popular fellows" and "a bright-eyed, red-headed fellow, who was always prepared for a lark of any kind." About his time at West Point, Sherman says only the following in his "Memoirs":

Upon graduation in 1840, Sherman entered the army as a <a href="US%20Second%20Lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the 3rd U.S. Artillery and saw action in Florida in the <a href="Second%20Seminole%20War">Second Seminole War</a> against the <a href="Seminole%20%28tribe%29">Seminole</a> tribe. He was later stationed in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>. As the foster son of a prominent Whig politician, in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>, the popular Lt. Sherman moved within the upper circles of <a href="Old%20South">Old South</a> society.

While many of his colleagues saw action in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>, Sherman performed administrative duties in the captured territory of California. Along with fellow Lieutenants <a href="Henry%20Halleck">Henry Halleck</a> and <a href="Edward%20Ord">Edward Ord</a>, Sherman embarked from New York on the 198-day journey around Cape Horn aboard the converted sloop <a href="USS%20Lexington%20%281825%29">USS "Lexington"</a>. Due to the confined spaces aboard-ship, Sherman grew close to Halleck and Ord, and in his "Memoirs" references a hike with Halleck to the summit of <a href="Corcovado">Corcovado</a> overlooking <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> in <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, notable as the future spot of the "<a href="Christ%20the%20Redeemer%20%28statue%29">Cristo Redentor</a>" statue. Sherman and Ord reached the town of Yerba Buena, in California, two days before its name was changed to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. In 1848, Sherman accompanied the military governor of California, Col. <a href="Richard%20Barnes%20Mason">Richard Barnes Mason</a>, in the inspection that officially confirmed that gold had been discovered in the region, thus inaugurating the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>. Sherman, along with Ord, assisted in surveys for the sub-divisions of the town that would become <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento</a>.

Sherman earned a <a href="brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> promotion to <a href="captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">captain</a> for his "meritorious service", but his lack of a combat assignment discouraged him and may have contributed to his decision to resign his commission. He would eventually become one of the few high-ranking officers during the Civil War who had not fought in Mexico.

In 1850, Sherman was promoted to the substantive rank of Captain and married his foster sister, <a href="Ellen%20Ewing%20Sherman">Ellen Boyle Ewing</a>, four years younger, in a Washington ceremony attended by President <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> and other political luminaries. Thomas Ewing was serving as the Secretary of the Interior at the time.

Like her mother, <a href="Ellen%20Ewing%20Sherman">Ellen Ewing Sherman</a> was a devout Roman Catholic, and the Shermans' eight children were reared in that faith. In 1864, Ellen took up temporary residence in <a href="South%20Bend%2C%20Indiana">South Bend, Indiana</a>, to have her young family educated at the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a> and <a href="Saint%20Mary%27s%20College%20%28Indiana%29">St. Mary's College</a>. In 1874, with Sherman having become world-famous, their eldest child, Marie Ewing ("Minnie") Sherman, also had a politically prominent wedding, attended by President Ulysses S. Grant and commemorated by a generous gift from the <a href="Isma%27il%20Pasha">Khedive of Egypt</a>. (Eventually, one of Minnie's daughters married a grandson of Confederate general <a href="Lewis%20Addison%20Armistead">Lewis Addison Armistead</a>.) Another of the Sherman daughters, <a href="Eleanor%20Sherman%20Thackara">Eleanor</a>, was married to <a href="Alexander%20Montgomery%20Thackara">Alexander Montgomery Thackara</a> at General Sherman's home in Washington, D.C., on May 5, 1880. To Sherman's great displeasure and sorrow, his oldest surviving son, <a href="Thomas%20Ewing%20Sherman">Thomas Ewing Sherman</a>, joined the religious order of the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuits</a> in 1878 and was ordained as a priest in 1889.

In 1853, Sherman resigned his captaincy and became manager of the San Francisco branch of the St. Louis-based bank Lucas, Turner & Co. He returned to San Francisco at a time of great turmoil in the West. He survived two shipwrecks and floated through the <a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a> on the overturned hull of a foundering lumber schooner. Sherman suffered from stress-related <a href="asthma">asthma</a> because of the city's aggressive business culture. Late in life, regarding his time in a San Francisco experiencing a frenzy of real estate speculation, Sherman recalled: "I can handle a hundred thousand men in battle, and take the City of the Sun, but am afraid to manage a lot in the swamp of San Francisco." In 1856, during the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Vigilance%20Movement">vigilante period</a>, he served briefly as a <a href="Major%20General%23United%20States">major general</a> of the California <a href="militia">militia</a>.

Sherman's San Francisco branch closed in May 1857, and he relocated to New York on behalf of the same bank. When the bank failed during the financial <a href="Panic%20of%201857">Panic of 1857</a>, he closed the New York branch. In early 1858, he returned to California to wrap up the bank's affairs there. Later in 1858, he moved to <a href="Leavenworth%2C%20Kansas">Leavenworth</a>, Kansas, where he tried his hand at law practice and other ventures without much success.

In 1859, Sherman accepted a job as the first superintendent of the <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Seminary%20of%20Learning%20%26amp%3B%20Military%20Academy">Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy</a> in <a href="Pineville%2C%20Louisiana">Pineville, Louisiana</a>, a position he sought at the suggestion of Major <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">D. C. Buell</a> and secured because of General <a href="George%20Mason%20Graham">George Mason Graham</a>. He proved an effective and popular leader of the institution, which later became <a href="Louisiana%20State%20University">Louisiana State University</a> (LSU). <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Joseph%20Pannell%20Taylor">Joseph P. Taylor</a>, the brother of the late President <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, declared that "if you had hunted the whole army, from one end of it to the other, you could not have found a man in it more admirably suited for the position in every respect than Sherman."

Although his brother John was well known as an antislavery congressman, Sherman did not oppose slavery and was sympathetic to Southerners' defense of the institution. He opposed, however, any attempt at dissolving the Union. On hearing of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>'s <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">secession</a> from the United States, Sherman observed to a close friend, Professor <a href="David%20French%20Boyd">David F. Boyd</a> of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, an enthusiastic secessionist:

He thus very accurately described the four years of war to come.

In January 1861, as more Southern states were seceding from the Union, Sherman was required to accept receipt of arms surrendered to the State Militia by the U.S. Arsenal at <a href="Baton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana">Baton Rouge</a>, Louisiana. Instead of complying, he resigned his position as superintendent and returned to the North, declaring to the governor of Louisiana, "On no earthly account will I do any act or think any thought hostile ... to the ... United States."

Immediately following his departure from Louisiana, Sherman traveled to Washington, D.C., possibly in the hope of securing a position in the army, and met with Abraham Lincoln in the White House during inauguration week. Sherman expressed concern about the North's poor state of preparedness but found Lincoln unresponsive.

Thereafter, Sherman became president of the St. Louis Railroad, a <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> company, a position he would hold for only a few months. Thus, he was living in border-state Missouri as the secession crisis came to a climax. While trying to hold himself aloof from controversy, he observed firsthand the efforts of Congressman <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair%2C%20Jr.">Frank Blair</a>, who later served under Sherman, to hold Missouri in the Union. In early April, he declined an offer from the Lincoln administration to take a position in the War Department as a prelude to his becoming Assistant Secretary of War. After the bombardment of Fort Sumter, Sherman hesitated about committing to military service and ridiculed Lincoln's call for <a href="75%2C000%20three-month%20volunteers">75,000 three-month volunteers</a> to quell secession, reportedly saying: "Why, you might as well attempt to put out the flames of a burning house with a squirt-gun." However, in May, he offered himself for service in the regular army, and his brother (Senator John Sherman) and other connections maneuvered to get him a commission in the regular army. On June 3, he wrote that "I still think it is to be a long war – very long – much longer than any Politician thinks." He received a telegram summoning him to Washington on June 7.

Sherman was first commissioned as <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> of the <a href="13th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">13th U.S. Infantry Regiment</a>, effective May 14, 1861. This was a new regiment yet to be raised, and Sherman's first command was actually of a brigade of three-month volunteers, at the head of which he became one of the few Union officers to distinguish himself at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a> on July 21, 1861, where he was grazed by bullets in the knee and shoulder. The disastrous Union defeat at Bull Run led Sherman to question his own judgment as an officer and the capacities of his volunteer troops. President Lincoln, however, was impressed by Sherman while visiting the troops on July 23 and promoted him to <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> of volunteers (effective May 17, 1861, with seniority in rank to <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, his future commander). He was assigned to serve under <a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28Civil%20War%29">Robert Anderson</a> in the Department of the Cumberland in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>, Kentucky, and in October Sherman succeeded Anderson in command of the department. Sherman considered that his new assignment broke a promise from Lincoln that he would not be given such a prominent position.

Having succeeded Anderson at Louisville, Sherman now had principal military responsibility for Kentucky, a border state in which Confederate troops held Columbus and Bowling Green and were present near the Cumberland Gap. He became exceedingly pessimistic about the outlook for his command and he complained frequently to Washington, D.C. about shortages while providing exaggerated estimates of the strength of the rebel forces. Critical press reports appeared about him after an October visit to Louisville by the secretary of war, <a href="Simon%20Cameron">Simon Cameron</a>, and in early November 1861 Sherman insisted that he be relieved. He was promptly replaced by Brigadier General <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a> and transferred to <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a>, Missouri. In December, he was put on leave by Maj. Gen. <a href="Henry%20W.%20Halleck">Henry W. Halleck</a>, commander of the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Missouri">Department of the Missouri</a>, who considered him unfit for duty. Sherman went to Lancaster, Ohio, to recuperate. While he was at home, his wife Ellen wrote to his brother, Senator John Sherman, seeking advice. She complained of "that <a href="Melancholia%20%28temperament%29">melancholy</a> insanity to which your family is subject". Sherman later wrote that the concerns of command "broke me down", and he admitted contemplating <a href="suicide">suicide</a>. His problems were compounded when the "Cincinnati Commercial" described him as "insane".

By mid-December 1861 Sherman had recovered sufficiently to return to service under Halleck in the Department of the Missouri. (In March, Halleck's command was redesignated the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Mississippi">Department of the Mississippi</a> and enlarged to unify command in the West). Sherman's initial assignments were rear-echelon commands, first of an instructional barracks near St. Louis and then in command of the District of Cairo. Operating from <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah</a>, Kentucky, he provided logistical support for the operations of Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to capture <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a> (February 1862). Grant, the previous commander of the District of Cairo, had recently won a major victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Henry">Fort Henry</a> (February 6, 1862) and been given command of the ill-defined <a href="District%20of%20West%20Tennessee">District of West Tennessee</a>. Although Sherman was technically the senior officer at this time, he wrote to Grant, "I feel anxious about you as I know the great facilities [the Confederates] have of concentration by means of the River and R Road, but [I] have faith in you—Command me in any way."

After Grant captured Fort Donelson, Sherman got his wish to serve under Grant when he was assigned on March 1, 1862, to the <a href="Army%20of%20West%20Tennessee">Army of West Tennessee</a> as commander of the 5th <a href="division%20%28military%29">Division</a>. His first major test under Grant was at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>. The massive Confederate attack on the morning of April 6, 1862, took most of the senior Union commanders by surprise. Sherman had dismissed the intelligence reports received from militia officers, refusing to believe that Confederate General <a href="Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a> would leave his base at <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth</a>. He took no precautions beyond strengthening his picket lines, and refused to entrench, build <a href="abatis">abatis</a>, or push out reconnaissance patrols. At Shiloh, he may have wished to avoid appearing overly alarmed in order to escape the kind of criticism he had received in Kentucky. He had written to his wife that, if he took more precautions, "they'd call me crazy again".

Despite being caught unprepared by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout. Finding Grant at the end of the day sitting under an oak tree in the darkness and smoking a cigar, Sherman felt, in his words, "some wise and sudden instinct not to mention retreat". In what would become one of the most notable conversations of the war, Sherman said simply: "Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day, haven't we?" After a puff of his cigar, Grant replied calmly: "Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though." Sherman proved instrumental to the successful Union counterattack of April 7, 1862. At Shiloh, Sherman was wounded twice—in the hand and shoulder—and had three horses shot out from under him. His performance was praised by Grant and Halleck and after the battle, and he was promoted to <a href="Major%20General%23United%20States">major general</a> of volunteers, effective May 1, 1862.

Beginning in late April, a Union force of 100,000 moved slowly against <a href="Siege%20of%20Corinth">Corinth</a>, under Halleck's command with Grant relegated to second-in-command; Sherman commanded the division on the extreme right of the Union's right wing (under George H. Thomas). Shortly after the Union forces occupied Corinth on May 30, Sherman persuaded Grant not to leave his command, despite the serious difficulties he was having with Halleck. Sherman offered Grant an example from his own life, "Before the battle of Shiloh, I was cast down by a mere newspaper assertion of 'crazy', but that single battle gave me new life, and I'm now in high feather." He told Grant that, if he remained in the army, "some happy accident might restore you to favor and your true place". In July, Grant's situation improved when Halleck left for the East to become general-in-chief, and Sherman became the military governor of occupied Memphis.

The careers of both officers ascended considerably after that time. In Sherman's case, this was in part because he developed close personal ties to Grant during the two years they served together in the West. During the long and complicated campaign against Vicksburg, one newspaper complained that the "army was being ruined in mud-turtle expeditions, under the leadership of a drunkard [Grant], whose confidential adviser [Sherman] was a <a href="lunatic">lunatic</a>".

Sherman's military record in 1862–63 was mixed. In December 1862, forces under his command suffered a severe repulse at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickasaw%20Bayou">Battle of Chickasaw Bayou</a>, just north of <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg</a>, Mississippi. Soon after, his <a href="XV%20Corps%20%28ACW%29">XV Corps</a> was ordered to join Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20A.%20McClernand">John A. McClernand</a> in his successful assault on <a href="Battle%20of%20Arkansas%20Post">Arkansas Post</a>, generally regarded as a politically motivated distraction from the effort to capture Vicksburg. Before the <a href="Vicksburg%20Campaign">Vicksburg Campaign</a> in the spring of 1863, Sherman expressed serious reservations about the wisdom of Grant's unorthodox strategy, but he went on to perform well in that campaign under Grant's supervision.

The historian <a href="John%20D.%20Winters">John D. Winters</a> in "The Civil War in Louisiana" (1963) describes Sherman:

After the surrender of Vicksburg to the Union forces under Grant on July 4, 1863, Sherman was given the rank of brigadier general in the <a href="Regular%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">regular army</a>, in addition to his rank as a major general of volunteers. Sherman's family came from Ohio to visit his camp near Vicksburg; his nine-year-old son, Willie, the Little Sergeant, died from <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> contracted during the trip.

Command in the West was unified under Grant (<a href="Military%20Division%20of%20the%20Mississippi">Military Division of the Mississippi</a>), and Sherman succeeded Grant in command of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Tennessee">Army of the Tennessee</a>. Following the defeat of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Cumberland">Army of the Cumberland</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a> by Confederate General <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg's</a> <a href="Army%20of%20Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a>, the army was besieged in <a href="Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>. Sherman's troops were sent to relieve them. While traveling to Chattanooga, Sherman departed Memphis on a train that arrived at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Collierville">Battle of Collierville</a>, Tennessee, while the Union garrison there was under attack on October 11, 1863. General Sherman took command of the 550 men and successfully defended against an attack of 3,500 Confederate cavalry.

During the <a href="Chattanooga%20Campaign">Chattanooga Campaign</a> in November, under Grant's overall command, Sherman quickly took his assigned target of Billy Goat Hill at the north end of Missionary Ridge, only to discover that it was not part of the ridge at all, but rather a detached spur separated from the main spine by a rock-strewn ravine. When he attempted to attack the main spine at Tunnel Hill, his troops were repeatedly repulsed by <a href="Patrick%20Cleburne">Patrick Cleburne</a>'s heavy division, the best unit in Bragg's army. Sherman's efforts were assisted by <a href="George%20Henry%20Thomas">George Henry Thomas</a>'s army's successful assault on the center of the Confederate line, a movement originally intended as a diversion. Subsequently, Sherman led a column to relieve Union forces under <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a> thought to be in peril at <a href="Knoxville%20Campaign">Knoxville</a>. In February 1864, he led an expedition to <a href="Battle%20of%20Meridian">Meridian, Mississippi</a>, to disrupt Confederate infrastructure.

Despite this mixed record, Sherman enjoyed Grant's confidence and friendship. When Lincoln called Grant east in the spring of 1864 to take command of all the Union armies, Grant appointed Sherman (by then known to his soldiers as "Uncle Billy") to succeed him as head of the <a href="Military%20Division%20of%20the%20Mississippi">Military Division of the Mississippi</a>, which entailed command of Union troops in the <a href="Western%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Western Theater</a> of the war. As Grant took overall command of the armies of the United States, Sherman wrote to him outlining his strategy to bring the war to an end concluding that "if you can whip <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Lee</a> and I can march to the Atlantic I think ol' <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Uncle Abe</a> will give us twenty days leave to see the young folks."

Sherman proceeded to invade the state of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> with three armies: the 60,000-strong <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Cumberland">Army of the Cumberland</a> under <a href="George%20Henry%20Thomas">George Henry Thomas</a>, the 25,000-strong <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Tennessee">Army of the Tennessee</a> under <a href="James%20B.%20McPherson">James B. McPherson</a>, and the 13,000-strong <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Ohio">Army of the Ohio</a> under <a href="John%20M.%20Schofield">John M. Schofield</a>. He fought a lengthy campaign of <a href="Flanking%20maneuver">maneuver</a> through mountainous terrain against Confederate General <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a>, attempting a direct assault only at the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Kennesaw%20Mountain">Battle of Kennesaw Mountain</a>. In July, the cautious Johnston was replaced by the more aggressive <a href="John%20Bell%20Hood">John Bell Hood</a>, who played to Sherman's strength by challenging him to direct battles on open ground. Meanwhile, in August, Sherman "learned that I had been commissioned a major-general in the regular army, which was unexpected, and not desired until successful in the capture of Atlanta."

Sherman's <a href="Atlanta%20Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a> concluded successfully on September 2, 1864, with the capture of the city, which Hood had been forced to abandon. This success made Sherman a household name and helped ensure Lincoln's <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">presidential re-election</a> in November. In August, the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> had nominated as its candidate <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a>, the popular former Union army commander, and it had seemed likely that Lincoln would lose to McClellan. Lincoln's defeat could well have meant the victory of the Confederacy, as the Democratic Party platform called for peace negotiations based on the acknowledgment of the Confederacy's independence. Thus the capture of Atlanta, coming when it did, may have been Sherman's greatest contribution to the Union cause.

After ordering almost all civilians to leave the city in September, Sherman gave instructions that all military and government buildings in Atlanta be burned, although many private homes and shops were burned as well. This was to set a precedent for future behavior by his armies.

During September and October, Sherman and Hood played cat-and-mouse in north Georgia (and Alabama) as Hood threatened Sherman's communications to the north. Eventually, Sherman won approval from his superiors for a plan to cut loose from his communications and march south, having advised Grant that he could "make Georgia howl". This created the threat that Hood would move north into Tennessee. Trivializing that threat, Sherman reportedly said that he would "give [Hood] his rations" to go in that direction as "my business is down south". However, Sherman left forces under Maj. Gens. George H. Thomas and John M. Schofield to deal with Hood; their forces eventually smashed Hood's army in the battles of <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Franklin">Franklin</a> (November 30) and <a href="Battle%20of%20Nashville">Nashville</a> (December 15–16). Meanwhile, after the November elections, Sherman began a march with 62,000 men to the port of <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a>, Georgia, living off the land and causing, by his own estimate, more than $100 million in property damage. Sherman called this harsh tactic of material war "hard war," often seen as a species of <a href="total%20war">total war</a>. At the end of this campaign, known as Sherman's March to the Sea, his troops captured Savannah on December 21, 1864. Sherman then dispatched a famous message to Lincoln, offering him the city as a Christmas present.

Sherman's success in Georgia received ample coverage in the Northern press at a time when Grant seemed to be making little progress in his fight against Confederate General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>. A bill was introduced in Congress to promote Sherman to Grant's rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a>, probably with a view towards having him replace Grant as commander of the Union Army. Sherman wrote both to his brother, Senator John Sherman, and to General Grant vehemently repudiating any such promotion. According to a war-time account, it was around this time that Sherman made his memorable declaration of loyalty to Grant:

While in Savannah, Sherman learned from a newspaper that his infant son Charles Celestine had died during the <a href="Savannah%20Campaign">Savannah Campaign</a>; the general had never seen the child.

Grant then ordered Sherman to embark his army on steamers and join the Union forces confronting Lee in Virginia, but Sherman instead persuaded Grant to allow him to march north through <a href="Carolinas%20Campaign">the Carolinas</a>, destroying everything of military value along the way, as he had done in Georgia. He was particularly interested in targeting <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, the first state to <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">secede</a> from the Union, because of the effect that it would have on Southern morale. His army proceeded north through South Carolina against light resistance from the troops of Confederate General <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>. Upon hearing that Sherman's men were advancing on <a href="corduroy%20road">corduroy road</a>s through the <a href="Salkehatchie%20River">Salkehatchie</a> <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s at a rate of a dozen miles per day, Johnston "made up his mind that there had been no such army in existence since the days of <a href="Caesar%27s%20Rhine%20bridges">Julius Caesar</a>."

Sherman <a href="Capture%20of%20Columbia">captured the state capital</a> of <a href="Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina">Columbia</a>, South Carolina, on February 17, 1865. Fires began that night and by next morning most of the central city was destroyed. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were accidental, others a deliberate act of vengeance, and still others that the retreating Confederates burned bales of cotton on their way out of town.

Local Native American <a href="Lumbee">Lumbee</a> guides helped Sherman's army cross the <a href="Lumber%20River">Lumber River</a>, which was flooded by torrential rains, into <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. According to Sherman, the trek across the Lumber River, and through the swamps, <a href="pocosin">pocosin</a>s, and creeks of <a href="Robeson%20County">Robeson County</a> was "the damnedest marching I ever saw." Thereafter, his troops did little damage to the civilian infrastructure, as North Carolina, unlike its southern neighbor, was regarded by his men as a reluctant Confederate state, having been the second from last state to secede from the Union, before Tennessee. Sherman's final significant military engagement was a victory over Johnston's troops at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bentonville">Battle of Bentonville</a>, March 19–21. He soon rendezvoused at <a href="Goldsboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">Goldsborough, North Carolina</a>, with Union troops awaiting him there after the capture of Fort Fisher and Wilmington.

In late March, Sherman briefly left his forces and traveled to <a href="City%20Point%2C%20Virginia">City Point, Virginia</a> to consult with Grant. Lincoln happened to be at City Point at the same time, allowing the only three-way meetings of Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman during the war.

Following Lee's surrender to Grant at <a href="Appomattox%20Court%20House%20National%20Historical%20Park">Appomattox Court House</a> and the <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassination of President Lincoln</a>, Sherman met with Johnston in mid-April at <a href="Bennett%20Place">Bennett Place</a> in <a href="Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina">Durham</a>, North Carolina, to negotiate a Confederate surrender. At the insistence of Johnston and of Confederate President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, Sherman conditionally agreed to generous terms that dealt with both political and military issues. Sherman thought that those terms were consistent with the views Lincoln had expressed at City Point, but the general had not been given the authority, by General Grant, the newly installed President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, or the <a href="United%20States%20Cabinet">Cabinet</a>, to offer those terms.

The government in Washington, D.C., refused to approve Sherman's terms and the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, <a href="Edwin%20M.%20Stanton">Edwin M. Stanton</a>, denounced Sherman publicly, precipitating a long-lasting feud between the two men. Confusion over this issue lasted until April 26, 1865, when Johnston, ignoring instructions from President Davis, agreed to purely military terms and formally surrendered his army and all the Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida, in what was the largest single capitulation of the war. Sherman proceeded with 60,000 of his troops to Washington, D.C., where they marched in the <a href="Grand%20Review%20of%20the%20Armies">Grand Review of the Armies</a>, on May 24, 1865, and were then disbanded. Having become the second most important general in the Union army, he thus had come full circle to the city where he started his war-time service as colonel of a non-existent infantry regiment.

Sherman was not an <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> before the war and, like others of his time and background, he did not believe in "Negro equality". Before the war, Sherman at times even expressed some sympathy with the view of Southern whites that the black race was benefiting from slavery, although he opposed breaking up slave families and advocated teaching slaves to read and write. During the Civil War, Sherman declined to employ black troops in his armies.

Sherman's military campaigns of 1864 and 1865 freed many slaves, who greeted him "as a second <a href="Moses">Moses</a> or <a href="Aaron">Aaron</a>" and joined his marches through Georgia and the Carolinas by the tens of thousands. The fate of these refugees became a pressing military and political issue. Some abolitionists accused Sherman of doing little to alleviate the precarious living conditions of the freed slaves. To address this issue, on January 12, 1865, Sherman met in Savannah with Secretary of War Stanton and with twenty local black leaders. After Sherman's departure, Garrison Frazier, a <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> minister, declared in response to an inquiry about the feelings of the black community:

Four days later, Sherman issued his <a href="Sherman%27s%20Special%20Field%20Orders%2C%20No.%2015">Special Field Orders, No. 15</a>. The orders provided for the settlement of 40,000 freed slaves and black refugees on land expropriated from white landowners in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Sherman appointed Brig. Gen. <a href="Rufus%20Saxton">Rufus Saxton</a>, an abolitionist from <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> who had previously directed the recruitment of black soldiers, to implement that plan. Those orders, which became the basis of the claim that the Union government had promised freed slaves "<a href="40%20acres%20and%20a%20mule">40 acres and a mule</a>", were revoked later that year by President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>.

Although the context is often overlooked, and the quotation usually chopped off, one of Sherman's most famous statements about his hard-war views arose in part from the racial attitudes summarized above. In his "Memoirs", Sherman noted political pressures in 1864–1865 to encourage the escape of slaves, in part to avoid the possibility that "'able-bodied slaves will be called into the military service of the rebels.'" Sherman thought concentration on such policies would have delayed the "successful end" of the war and the "liberat[ion of] "all" slaves". He went on to summarize vividly his hard-war philosophy and to add, in effect, that he really did not want the help of liberated slaves in subduing the South:

Sherman's record as a <a href="Military%20tactics">tactician</a> was mixed, and his military legacy rests primarily on his command of <a href="Military%20logistics">logistics</a> and on his brilliance as a <a href="Military%20strategy">strategist</a>. The influential 20th-century British military historian and theorist <a href="B.%20H.%20Liddell%20Hart">B. H. Liddell Hart</a> ranked Sherman as one of the most important strategists in the annals of war, along with <a href="Scipio%20Africanus">Scipio Africanus</a>, <a href="Belisarius">Belisarius</a>, <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, <a href="T.%20E.%20Lawrence">T. E. Lawrence</a>, and <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>. Liddell Hart credited Sherman with mastery of <a href="maneuver%20warfare">maneuver warfare</a> (also known as the "indirect approach"), as demonstrated by his series of turning movements against Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign. Liddell Hart also stated that study of Sherman's campaigns had contributed significantly to his own "theory of strategy and tactics in <a href="Armoured%20warfare">mechanized warfare</a>", which had in turn influenced <a href="Heinz%20Guderian">Heinz Guderian</a>'s doctrine of "<a href="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a>" and Rommel's use of <a href="tank">tank</a>s during the Second World War. Another World War II-era student of Liddell Hart's writings about Sherman was <a href="George%20S.%20Patton">George S. Patton</a>, who "'spent a long vacation studying Sherman's campaigns on the ground in Georgia and the Carolinas, with the aid of [Liddell Hart's] book'" and later "'carried out his [bold] plans, in super-Sherman style'".

Sherman's greatest contribution to the war, the strategy of <a href="total%20war">total war</a>fare—endorsed by General Grant and President Lincoln—has been the subject of controversy. Sherman himself downplayed his role in conducting total war, often saying that he was simply carrying out orders as best he could in order to fulfill his part of Grant's master plan for ending the war.

Like Grant, Sherman was convinced that the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>'s strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be definitively crushed if the fighting were to end. Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest and employ <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion. He called this strategy "hard war".

Sherman's advance through Georgia and South Carolina was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. Although <a href="looting">looting</a> was officially forbidden, historians disagree on how well this regulation was enforced. Union soldiers who foraged from Southern homes became known as <a href="bummers">bummers</a>. The speed and efficiency of the destruction by Sherman's army was remarkable. The practice of heating rails and bending them around trees, leaving behind what came to be known as "<a href="Sherman%27s%20neckties">Sherman's neckties</a>," made repairs difficult. Accusations that civilians were targeted and <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s were committed on the march have made Sherman a controversial figure to this day, particularly in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">American South</a>.
The damage done by Sherman was almost entirely limited to the destruction of <a href="property">property</a>. Though exact figures are not available, the loss of civilian life appears to have been very small. Consuming supplies, wrecking infrastructure, and undermining morale were Sherman's stated goals, and several of his Southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it. For instance, <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>-born Major Henry Hitchcock, who served in Sherman's staff, declared that "it is a terrible thing to consume and destroy the sustenance of thousands of people," but if the scorched earth strategy served "to paralyze their husbands and fathers who are fighting ... it is mercy in the end".

The severity of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This appears to have been a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. <a href="Oliver%20Otis%20Howard">O. O. Howard</a>, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act." However, Sherman himself stated that "[i]f I had made up my mind to burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; but I did not do it ..." Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. <a href="Wade%20Hampton%20III">Wade Hampton III</a>, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina." Historian <a href="James%20M.%20McPherson">James M. McPherson</a> has concluded that:

In this general connection, it is also noteworthy that Sherman and his subordinates (particularly John A. Logan) took steps to protect Raleigh, North Carolina, from acts of revenge after the assassination of President Lincoln.

After the fall of Atlanta in 1864, Sherman ordered the city's evacuation. When the city council appealed to him to rescind that order, on the grounds that it would cause great hardship to women, children, the elderly, and others who bore no responsibility for the conduct of the war, Sherman sent a written response in which he sought to articulate his conviction that a lasting peace would be possible only if the Union were restored, and that he was therefore prepared to do all he could do to quash the rebellion:

Literary critic <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a> found in Sherman's "Memoirs" a fascinating and disturbing account of an "appetite for warfare" that "grows as it feeds on the South". Former U.S. Defense Secretary <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> refers equivocally to the statement that "war is cruelty and you cannot refine it" in both the book "Wilson's Ghost" and in his interview for the film "<a href="The%20Fog%20of%20War">The Fog of War</a>".

But when comparing Sherman's scorched-earth campaigns to the actions of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> (1899–1902)—another war in which civilians were targeted because of their central role in sustaining an armed resistance—South African historian Hermann Giliomee declares that it "looks as if Sherman struck a better balance than the British commanders between severity and restraint in taking actions proportional to legitimate needs". The admiration of scholars such as <a href="Victor%20Davis%20Hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a>, <a href="B.%20H.%20Liddell%20Hart">B. H. Liddell Hart</a>, Lloyd Lewis, and <a href="John%20F.%20Marszalek">John F. Marszalek</a> for General Sherman owes much to what they see as an approach to the exigencies of modern armed conflict that was both effective and principled.

In May 1865, after the major Confederate armies had surrendered, Sherman wrote in a personal letter:

In June 1865, two months after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, General Sherman received his first postwar command, originally called the Military Division of the Mississippi, later the <a href="Military%20Division%20of%20the%20Missouri">Military Division of the Missouri</a>, which came to comprise the territory between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Sherman's efforts in that position were focused on protecting the main wagon roads, such as the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon</a>, <a href="Bozeman%20Trail">Bozeman</a> and <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Trail">Santa Fe Trail</a>s. Tasked with guarding a vast territory with a limited force, Sherman was wary of the multitude of requests by territories and settlements for protection.

One of Sherman's main concerns in postwar commands was to protect the construction and operation of the railroads from attack by hostile Indians. Sherman's views on Indian matters were often strongly expressed. He regarded the railroads "as the most important element now in progress to facilitate the military interests of our Frontier". Hence, in 1867, he wrote to Grant that "we are not going to let a few thieving, ragged Indians check and stop the progress of [the railroads]." After the 1866 <a href="Fetterman%20Massacre%23Fetterman%20Massacre%20%28Battle%20of%20the%20Hundred%20Slain%29">Fetterman Massacre</a>, Sherman wrote Grant that "we must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children."

Despite this language, there was little large-scale military action taken against the Indians during the first three years of Sherman's tenure, as Sherman was willing to let the process of negotiations play out in order to buy time to procure more troops and allow the completion of the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific</a> and <a href="Kansas%20Pacific%20Railroad">Kansas Pacific Railroad</a>s. During his time as departmental commander, Sherman was a member of the <a href="Indian%20Peace%20Commission">Indian Peace Commission</a>. Though the commission was responsible for the negotiation of the <a href="Medicine%20Lodge%20Treaty">Medicine Lodge Treaty</a> and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Laramie%20%281868%29">Sioux Treaty of 1868</a>, Sherman was not particularly privy in either due to being called away to Washington during the negotiations of both. In one such instance, he was called to testify in the <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson</a>. However, Sherman was successful in negotiating other treaties, such as the removal of Navajos from the <a href="Bosque%20Redondo">Bosque Redondo</a> to traditional lands in Western New Mexico. When the Medicine Lodge Treaty was broken in 1868, Sherman authorized his subordinate in Missouri, <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, to conduct the Winter Campaign of 1868–69 (of which the <a href="Battle%20of%20Washita%20River">Battle of Washita River</a> was a part), where Sheridan used hard-war tactics similar to those he and Sherman had employed in the Civil War. Sherman was also involved with the <a href="trial%20of%20Satanta%20and%20Big%20Tree">trial of Satanta and Big Tree</a>: he ordered that the two chiefs should be tried as common criminals for their role in the <a href="Warren%20Wagon%20Train%20Raid">Warren Wagon Train Raid</a>, a raid that came dangerously close to killing Sherman himself.

On July 25, 1866, Congress created the rank of <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">General of the Army</a> for Grant and then promoted Sherman to <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a>. When Grant became <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">president</a> in 1869, Sherman was appointed <a href="Commanding%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Commanding General of the United States Army</a> and promoted to General of the Army. After the death of <a href="John%20Aaron%20Rawlins">John A. Rawlins</a>, Sherman also served for one month as interim <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>. His tenure as commanding general was marred by political difficulties, many of which stemmed from disagreements with Secretaries of War Rawlins and <a href="William%20W.%20Belknap">William W. Belknap</a>, whom Sherman felt had usurped too much of the Commanding General's powers, reducing him to a sinecure office. Sherman also clashed with Eastern humanitarians, who were critical of the Army's killing of Indians and had apparently found an ally in President Grant. To escape these difficulties, from 1874 to 1876, he moved his headquarters to <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a>, Missouri, returning to Washington only upon the appointment of <a href="Alphonso%20Taft">Alphonso Taft</a> as Secretary of War and the promise of more authority.

Much of Sherman's time as Commanding General was devoted to making the Western and Plains states safe for settlement through the continuation of the Indian Wars, which included three significant campaigns: the <a href="Modoc%20War">Modoc War</a>, the <a href="Great%20Sioux%20War%20of%201876">Great Sioux War of 1876</a>, and the <a href="Nez%20Perce%20War">Nez Perce War</a>. The displacement of Indians was facilitated by the growth of the railroad and the eradication of the buffalo. Sherman believed that the intentional eradication of the buffalo should be encouraged as a means of weakening Indian resistance to assimilation. He voiced this view in remarks to a joint session of the Texas legislature in 1875. However he never engaged in any program to actually eradicate the buffalo. During this time, Sherman reorganized frontier forts to reflect the shifting frontier.

After <a href="George%20Armstrong%20Custer">George Armstrong Custer</a>'s defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Little%20Bighorn">Battle of Little Bighorn</a>, Sherman wrote that "hostile savages like <a href="Sitting%20Bull">Sitting Bull</a> and his band of outlaw Sioux ... must feel the superior power of the Government." He further wrote that "during an assault, the soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age." Despite his harsh treatment of the warring tribes, Sherman spoke out against the unfair way speculators and government agents treated the natives within the <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservations</a>.

In 1875 Sherman published his memoirs in two volumes. According to critic <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a>, Sherman:

During the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">election of 1876</a>, Southern Democrats who supported <a href="Wade%20Hampton%20III">Wade Hampton</a> for governor used mob violence to attack and intimidate <a href="African%20American">African American</a> voters in Charleston, South Carolina. Republican Governor <a href="Daniel%20Henry%20Chamberlain">Daniel Chamberlain</a> appealed to President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> for military assistance. In October 1876, Grant, after issuing a proclamation, instructed Sherman to gather all available Atlantic region troops and dispatch them to South Carolina to stop the mob violence.

On June 19, 1879, Sherman delivered an address to the graduating class of the <a href="Michigan%20Military%20Academy">Michigan Military Academy</a>, in which he may have uttered the famous phrase "War Is Hell". On April 11, 1880, he addressed a crowd of more than 10,000 at Columbus, Ohio: "There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell." In 1945, <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">President Harry S. Truman</a> would say: "Sherman was wrong. I'm telling you I find peace is hell."

One of Sherman's significant contributions as head of the Army was the establishment of the Command School (now the <a href="Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College">Command and General Staff College</a>) at <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a> in 1881. Sherman stepped down as commanding general on November 1, 1883, and retired from the army on February 8, 1884.

He lived most of the rest of his life in New York City. He was devoted to the theater and to amateur painting and was much in demand as a colorful speaker at dinners and banquets, in which he indulged a fondness for quoting <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>. During this period, he stayed in contact with war veterans, and through them accepted honorary membership into the <a href="Phi%20Kappa%20Psi">Phi Kappa Psi</a> Fraternity and the <a href="The%20Irving%20Literary%20Society%20%28Cornell%20University%29">Irving Literary Society</a>. Sherman was proposed as a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidate for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201884">presidential election of 1884</a>, but declined as emphatically as possible, saying, "I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected." Such a categorical rejection of a candidacy is now referred to as a "<a href="Shermanesque%20statement">Shermanesque statement</a>".

In 1888 he joined the newly formed <a href="Boone%20and%20Crockett%20Club">Boone and Crockett Club</a>, a wildlife conservation organization founded by <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> and <a href="George%20Bird%20Grinnell">George Bird Grinnell</a>.

Sherman died of pneumonia in New York City at 1:50 PM on February 14, 1891, six days after his 71st birthday. President <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> sent a telegram to General Sherman's family and ordered all national flags to be flown at half mast. Harrison, in a message to the Senate and the House of Representatives, wrote that:

Sherman's birth family was Presbyterian and he was originally baptized as such. His foster family, including his future wife Ellen, were devout Catholics, and Sherman was re-baptized and later married in the Catholic rite. According to his son Thomas, who became a Catholic priest, Sherman attended the Catholic Church until the outbreak of the Civil War, but not thereafter. In 1888, Sherman wrote publicly that "my immediate family are strongly Catholic. I am "not" and cannot be." A memoirist reports that Sherman told him in 1887 that "my family is strongly Roman Catholic, but I am not."
On 19 February, a funeral service was held at his home, followed by a military procession. General <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>, the Confederate officer who had commanded the resistance to Sherman's troops in Georgia and the Carolinas, served as a <a href="pallbearer">pallbearer</a> in New York City. It was a bitterly cold day and a friend of Johnston, fearing that the general might become ill, asked him to put on his hat. Johnston famously replied: "If I were in [Sherman's] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat." Johnston did catch a serious cold and died one month later of pneumonia.

General Sherman's body was then transported to St. Louis, where another service was conducted on 21 February 1891 at a local Catholic church. His son, <a href="Thomas%20Ewing%20Sherman">Thomas Ewing Sherman</a>, a Jesuit priest, presided over his father's funeral mass. Sherman is buried in <a href="Calvary%20Cemetery%20%28St.%20Louis%29">Calvary Cemetery</a> in St. Louis.

Major monuments to Sherman include the gilded bronze <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman%20%28Saint-Gaudens%29">Sherman Memorial</a> (1902) by <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a> at the main entrance to <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a> in New York City, and the <a href="General%20William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman%20Monument">Sherman Monument</a> (1903) by <a href="Carl%20Rohl-Smith">Carl Rohl-Smith</a> near <a href="President%27s%20Park">President's Park</a> in Washington, D.C. The Sherman Monument (1900) in Muskegon, Michigan features a bronze statue by <a href="John%20Massey%20Rhind">John Massey Rhind</a>, and the Sherman Monument (1903) in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> features a smaller version of Saint-Gaudens's equestrian statue. Copies of Saint-Gaudens's "Bust of William Tecumseh Sherman" are in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, and elsewhere.

Other posthumous tributes include <a href="Sherman%20Circle">Sherman Circle</a> in the <a href="Petworth%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">Petworth</a> neighborhood of Washington, DC, the naming of the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> <a href="M4%20Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> <a href="tank">tank</a>, and the <a href="General%20Sherman%20%28tree%29">"General Sherman" Giant Sequoia tree</a>, the most massive documented single-trunk tree in the world.

In the years immediately after the war, Sherman's conservative politics was attractive to white Southerners. By the 1880s, however, Southern "<a href="Lost%20Cause%20of%20the%20Confederacy">Lost Cause</a>" writers began to demonize Sherman for his attacks on civilians in the "March". The magazine "<a href="Confederate%20Veteran">Confederate Veteran</a>", based in Nashville, gave Sherman more attention than anyone else, in part to enhance the visibility of the western theater. His devastation of railroads and plantations mattered less than the March's insult to southern dignity, especially its unprotected womanhood. Moody criticizes English historians Field Marshal Viscount Garnet Wolseley, Maj. Gen. John F. C. Fuller, and especially Capt. Basil H. Liddell Hart, who built up Sherman's reputation by exaggerating his "atrocities" and filtering his actions through their ideas about modern warfare.

By contrast Sherman was a popular hero in the North and well regarded by his soldiers. Military historians have paid special attention to his Atlanta campaign and the March to the Sea, generally giving him high marks as an innovative strategist and quick-witted tactician.

Around 1868, Sherman began to write a "private" recollection for his children about his life before the Civil War, identified now as his unpublished "Autobiography, 1828–1861". This manuscript is held by the <a href="Ohio%20Historical%20Society">Ohio Historical Society</a>. Much of the material in it would eventually be incorporated in revised form in his memoirs.

In 1875, ten years after the end of the Civil War, Sherman became one of the first Civil War generals to publish a memoir. His "Memoirs of General William T. Sherman. By Himself", published by <a href="D.%20Appleton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">D. Appleton & Co.</a>, in two volumes, began with the year 1846 (when the Mexican War began) and ended with a chapter about the "military lessons of the [civil] war" (1875 edition: <a href="https%3A//archive.org/details/memoirsgeneralw05shergoog">Volume I</a>;
<a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3D0C0OAAAAIAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA2%26amp%3Bdq%3DSherman%2BMemoirs%2B599455%23PPA1%2CM1">Volume II</a> ).
The memoirs were controversial, and sparked complaints from many quarters. Grant (serving as President when Sherman's memoirs first appeared) later remarked that others had told him that Sherman treated Grant unfairly but "when I finished the book, I found I approved every word; that ... it was a true book, an honorable book, creditable to Sherman, just to his companions—to myself particularly so—just such a book as I expected Sherman would write."

In 1886, after the publication of Grant's memoirs, Sherman produced a "second edition, revised and corrected" of his memoirs with Appleton. The new edition added a second preface, a chapter about his life up to 1846, a chapter concerning the post-war period (ending with his 1884 retirement from the army), several appendices, portraits, improved maps, and an index (1886 edition:
<a href="https%3A//archive.org/details/memoirsgeneralw06shergoog">Volume I</a>,
<a href="https%3A//archive.org/details/memoirsgeneralw10shergoog">Volume II</a>). For the most part, Sherman refused to revise his original text on the ground that "I disclaim the character of historian, but assume to be a witness on the stand before the great tribunal of history" and "any witness who may disagree with me should publish his own version of [the] facts in the truthful narration of which he is interested." However, Sherman did add the appendices, in which he published the views of some others.

Subsequently, Sherman shifted to the publishing house of Charles L. Webster & Co., the publisher of Grant's memoirs. The new publishing house brought out a "third edition, revised and corrected" in 1890. This difficult-to-find edition was substantively identical to the second (except for the probable omission of Sherman's short 1875 and 1886 prefaces).

After Sherman died in 1891, there were dueling new editions of his memoirs. His first publisher, Appleton, reissued the original (1875) edition with two new chapters about Sherman's later years added by the journalist <a href="Willis%20Fletcher%20Johnson">W. Fletcher Johnson</a> (1891 Johnson edition:
<a href="https%3A//archive.org/details/memoirsgenwilli00johngoog">Volume I</a>, <a href="https%3A//archive.org/details/memoirsgenwilli01johngoog">Volume II</a>). Meanwhile, Charles L. Webster & Co. issued a "fourth edition, revised, corrected, and complete" with the text of Sherman's second edition, a new chapter prepared under the auspices of the Sherman family bringing the general's life from his retirement to his death and funeral, and an appreciation by politician <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> (who was related to Sherman's wife). Unfortunately, this edition omits Sherman's prefaces to the 1875 and 1886 editions (1891 Blaine edition: <a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DNUk-sPRJPRoC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA5%26amp%3Bdq%3DMemoirs%2BSHerman%2Bfourth%2Bedition%23PPA1%2CM1">Volume I</a>,
<a href="https%3A//archive.org/details/memoirsgenwtshe01blaigoog">Volume II</a>).

In 1904 and 1913, Sherman's youngest son (Philemon Tecumseh Sherman) republished the memoirs, with Appleton (not Charles L. Webster & Co.). This was designated as a "second edition, revised and corrected". This edition contains Sherman's two prefaces, his 1886 text, and the materials added in the 1891 Blaine edition. Thus, this virtually invisible edition of Sherman's memoirs is actually the most comprehensive version.

There are many modern editions of Sherman's memoirs. The edition most useful for research purposes is the 1990 Library of America version, edited by Charles Royster. It contains the entire text of Sherman's 1886 edition, together with annotations, a note on the text, and a detailed chronology of Sherman's life. Missing from this edition is the useful biographical material contained in the 1891 Johnson and Blaine editions.

Many of Sherman's official war-time letters (and other items) appear in the <a href="http%3A//cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html">"Official Records of the War of the Rebellion"</a>. Some of these letters are rather personal in nature, rather than relating directly to operational activities of the army. There also are at least five published collections of Sherman correspondence:


The presentation of Sherman in popular culture is now discussed at book-length in "Sherman's March in Myth and Memory" (Rowman and Littlefield, 2008), by Edward Caudill and Paul Ashdown. Some of the artistic treatments of Sherman's march are the Civil War era song "<a href="Marching%20Through%20Georgia">Marching Through Georgia</a>" by <a href="Henry%20Clay%20Work">Henry Clay Work</a>; <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s poem <a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DHs0s_Cx2xlQC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA37%26amp%3Bdq%3DMelville%2BMarch%2Bto%2Bthe%2BSea%26amp%3Bsig%3DWAzeNpNKuA8yVNIzTAEx9BOPdAg">"The March to the Sea"</a>; <a href="Ross%20McElwee">Ross McElwee</a>'s film "<a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20%281986%20film%29">Sherman's March</a>"; and <a href="E.%20L.%20Doctorow">E. L. Doctorow</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20March%20%28novel%29">The March</a>".

Sherman is one of the few generals to have appeared on several different US postage stamp issues. The first stamp issue to honor him was released on March 21, 1893, a little more than two years after his death. The engraving was modeled after a taken by <a href="Napoleon%20Sarony">Napoleon Sarony</a> in 1888. The Post Office released a second and third Sherman issue of 1895, both almost identical to the first issue, with slight changes in the framework design and color. Sherman appeared again in the , a commemorative postage stamp jointly honoring Generals Sherman, <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Grant</a> and <a href="Philip%20H.%20Sheridan">Sheridan</a>. The last stamp issue to honor Sherman was released in 1995 and was a 32-cent stamp. With five different issues to his name, Sherman has featured more prominently in US postage than most US presidents.

Edward VII

Edward VII (Albert Edward; 9 November 1841 – 6 May 1910) was <a href="King%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> and <a href="Emperor%20of%20India">Emperor of India</a> from 22 January 1901 until his death in 1910.

The eldest son of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Prince%20Albert%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>, Edward was related to royalty throughout Europe. He was <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> to the British throne and held the title of <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> for longer than any of his predecessors. He was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha until before his marriage he renounced his right to the duchy, which then devolved to his younger brother <a href="Alfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Alfred</a>. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.

As king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the <a href="British%20Home%20Fleet">British Home Fleet</a> and the reorganisation of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> after the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">France</a>, for which he was popularly called "Peacemaker", but his relationship with his nephew, the <a href="German%20Emperor">German Emperor</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a>, was poor. The <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian era</a>, which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> propulsion and the rise of <a href="History%20of%20socialism%20in%20Great%20Britain">socialism</a>. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the <a href="Parliament%20Act%201911">Parliament Act 1911</a>, which restricted the power of the unelected <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>.

Edward was born at 10:48 in the morning on 9 November 1841 in <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>. He was the eldest son and second child of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and her husband <a href="Prince%20Albert%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>. He was christened "Albert Edward" at <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle</a>, on 25 January 1842. He was named Albert after his father and Edward after his maternal grandfather <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent%20and%20Strathearn">Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn</a>. He was known as "Bertie" to the royal family throughout his life.

As the eldest son of the British sovereign, he was automatically <a href="Duke%20of%20Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a> and <a href="Duke%20of%20Rothesay">Duke of Rothesay</a> at birth. As a son of Prince Albert, he also held the titles of <a href="Prince%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a> and <a href="Ernestine%20duchies">Duke of Saxony</a>. He was created <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> and <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earl of Chester</a> on 8 December 1841, <a href="Earl%20of%20Dublin">Earl of Dublin</a> on 10 September 1849 or 17 January 1850, a <a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Garter">Knight of the Garter</a> on 9 November 1858, and a <a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Thistle">Knight of the Thistle</a> on 24 May 1867. In 1863, he renounced his succession rights to the Duchy of <a href="Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a> in favour of his younger brother, <a href="Alfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Prince Alfred</a>.

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were determined that their eldest son should have an education that would prepare him to be a model <a href="constitutional%20monarch">constitutional monarch</a>. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Prince Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Victoria</a>, Edward did not excel in his studies. He tried to meet the expectations of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact—<a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner. After the completion of his secondary-level studies, his tutor was replaced by a personal governor, <a href="Robert%20Bruce%20%281813%E2%80%931862%29">Robert Bruce</a>.

After an educational trip to Rome, undertaken in the first few months of 1859, he spent the summer of that year studying at the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> under, among others, the chemist <a href="Lyon%20Playfair">Lyon Playfair</a>. In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>. Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying for the first time and performed satisfactorily in examinations. In 1861, he transferred to <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he was tutored in history by <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a>, <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Modern%20History%20%28Cambridge%29">Regius Professor of Modern History</a>. Kingsley's efforts brought forth the best academic performances of Edward's life, and Edward actually looked forward to his lectures.

In 1860, Edward undertook the first tour of North America by a Prince of Wales. His genial good humour and confident "<a href="wiktionary%3Abonhomie">bonhomie</a>" made the tour a great success. He inaugurated the <a href="Victoria%20Bridge%2C%20Montreal">Victoria Bridge, Montreal</a>, across the <a href="St%20Lawrence%20River">St Lawrence River</a>, and laid the cornerstone of <a href="Parliament%20Hill%2C%20Ottawa">Parliament Hill, Ottawa</a>. He watched <a href="Charles%20Blondin">Charles Blondin</a> traverse <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a> by highwire, and stayed for three days with President <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. Buchanan accompanied the Prince to <a href="Mount%20Vernon">Mount Vernon</a>, to pay his respects at the tomb of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>. Vast crowds greeted him everywhere. He met <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> and <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Sr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a>. Prayers for the royal family were said in <a href="Trinity%20Church%2C%20New%20York">Trinity Church, New York</a>, for the first time since 1776. The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.

Edward had hoped to pursue a career in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, but his mother vetoed an active military career. He had been gazetted colonel on 9 November 1858—to his disappointment, as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination. In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra of Denmark</a>, the eldest daughter of <a href="Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">Prince Christian of Denmark</a> and his wife <a href="Louise%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Louise</a>. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at <a href="Speyer">Speyer</a> on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Victoria</a>, who had married the <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">Crown Prince of Prussia</a> in 1858. Edward's elder sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Princess Alexandra at <a href="Neustrelitz">Strelitz</a> in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.

From this time, Edward gained a reputation as a playboy. Determined to get some army experience, Edward attended manoeuvres in Ireland, during which he spent three nights with an actress, <a href="Nellie%20Clifden">Nellie Clifden</a>, who was hidden in the camp by his fellow officers. Prince Albert, though ill, was appalled and visited Edward at <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> to issue a reprimand. Albert died in December 1861 just two weeks after the visit. Queen Victoria was inconsolable, wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life and blamed Edward for his father's death. At first, she regarded her son with distaste as frivolous, indiscreet and irresponsible. She wrote to her eldest daughter, "I never can, or shall, look at him without a shudder."

Once widowed, Queen Victoria effectively withdrew from public life. Shortly after Prince Albert's death, the queen arranged for Edward to embark on an extensive tour of the Middle East, visiting <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> and <a href="Istanbul">Constantinople</a>. The <a href="British%20Government">British Government</a> wanted Edward to secure the friendship of Egypt's ruler, <a href="Sa%27id%20of%20Egypt">Said Pasha</a>, to prevent French control of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> if the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> collapsed. It was the first <a href="royal%20tour">royal tour</a> on which an official photographer, <a href="Francis%20Bedford%20%28photographer%29">Francis Bedford</a>, was in attendance. As soon as Edward returned to Britain, preparations were made for his engagement, which was sealed at <a href="Laeken">Laeken</a> in Belgium on 9 September 1862. Edward married <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Princess Alexandra of Denmark</a> at <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle</a>, on 10 March 1863. He was 21; she was 18.

The couple established <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a> as their London residence and <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham House</a> in Norfolk as their country retreat. They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of <a href="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> and <a href="Holstein">Holstein</a>. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> took the opportunity to <a href="Second%20Schleswig%20War">invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein</a>. Queen Victoria was of two minds whether it was a suitable match given the political climate. After the marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.

Edward had mistresses throughout his married life. He socialised with actress <a href="Lillie%20Langtry">Lillie Langtry</a>; <a href="Lady%20Randolph%20Churchill">Lady Randolph Churchill</a>; <a href="Daisy%20Greville%2C%20Countess%20of%20Warwick">Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick</a>; actress <a href="Sarah%20Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>; noblewoman <a href="Lady%20Susan%20Vane-Tempest">Lady Susan Vane-Tempest</a>; singer <a href="Hortense%20Schneider">Hortense Schneider</a>; prostitute Giulia Beneni (known as "La Barucci"); wealthy humanitarian <a href="Agnes%20Keyser">Agnes Keyser</a>; and <a href="Alice%20Keppel">Alice Keppel</a>. At least fifty-five liaisons are conjectured. How far these relationships went is not always clear. Edward always strove to be discreet, but this did not prevent society gossip or press speculation. Keppel's great-granddaughter, <a href="Camilla%20Parker%20Bowles">Camilla Parker Bowles</a>, became the mistress and subsequent wife of <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>, Edward's great-great-grandson. It was rumoured that Camilla's grandmother, Sonia Keppel, was fathered by Edward, but she was "almost certainly" the daughter of <a href="George%20Keppel%20%28British%20Army%20officer%2C%20born%201865%29">George Keppel</a>, whom she resembled. Edward never acknowledged any illegitimate children. Alexandra was aware of his affairs, and seems to have accepted them.

In 1869, <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Mordaunt%2C%2010th%20Baronet">Sir Charles Mordaunt</a>, a British <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">Member of Parliament</a>, threatened to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, he did not do so but Edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.

During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward pioneered the idea of royal public appearances as we understand them today—for example, opening the <a href="Thames%20Embankment">Thames Embankment</a> in 1871, the <a href="Mersey%20Railway">Mersey Tunnel</a> in 1886, and <a href="Tower%20Bridge">Tower Bridge</a> in 1894—but his mother did not allow Edward an active role in the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals. He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the <a href="Schleswig-Holstein%20Question">Schleswig-Holstein Question</a> in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet <a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a>. <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> Prime Minister <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a> sent him papers secretly. From 1886, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Lord Rosebery</a> sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> papers were opened to him.

In 1870 republican sentiment in Britain was given a boost when the French Emperor, <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>, was defeated in the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> and the <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">French Third Republic</a> was declared. However, in the winter of 1871, a brush with death led to an improvement in both Edward's popularity with the public and his relationship with his mother. While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough, North Yorkshire</a>, Edward contracted <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests (<a href="George%20Stanhope%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Chesterfield">Lord Chesterfield</a>) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief. Public celebrations included the composition of <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a>'s <a href="Festival%20Te%20Deum">Festival Te Deum</a>. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.
On 26 September 1875, Edward set off for India on an extensive eight-month tour; on the way, he visited Malta, <a href="Brindisi">Brindisi</a> and Greece. His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour. In letters home, he complained of the treatment of the native Indians by the British officials: "Because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own, there is no reason why he should be treated as a brute." Consequently, <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20India">Secretary of State for India</a>, issued new guidance and at least one <a href="Resident%20%28title%29">resident</a> was removed from office. He returned to England on 11 May 1876, after stopping off at Portugal. At the end of the tour, Queen Victoria was given the title Empress of India by Parliament, in part as a result of the tour's success.

Edward was regarded worldwide as an arbiter of men's fashions. He made wearing <a href="Tweed%20%28cloth%29">tweed</a>, <a href="Homburg%20hat">Homburg hat</a>s and <a href="Norfolk%20jacket">Norfolk jacket</a>s fashionable, and popularised the wearing of black ties with dinner jackets, instead of <a href="white%20tie">white tie</a> and tails. He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs from side to side in preference to the now normal front and back creases, and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar, created for him by <a href="Charvet%20Place%20Vend%C3%B4me%23International%20recognition">Charvet</a>. A stickler for proper dress, he is said to have admonished Lord Salisbury for wearing the trousers of an Elder Brother of <a href="Trinity%20House">Trinity House</a> with a <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>lor's coat. Deep in an international crisis, Salisbury informed the Prince that it had been a dark morning, and that "my mind must have been occupied by some subject of less importance." The tradition of men not buttoning the bottom button of waistcoats is said to be linked to Edward, who supposedly left his undone because of his large girth. His waist measured 48 inches (122 cm) shortly before his coronation. He introduced the practice of eating roast beef and potatoes with horseradish sauce and <a href="yorkshire%20pudding">yorkshire pudding</a> on Sundays, a meal that remains a staple British favourite for <a href="Sunday%20lunch">Sunday lunch</a>. He was not a heavy drinker, though he did drink champagne and, occasionally, port.

Edward was a patron of the arts and sciences and helped found the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a>. He opened the college in 1883 with the words, "Class can no longer stand apart from class ... I claim for music that it produces that union of feeling which I much desire to promote." At the same time, he enjoyed gambling and country sports and was an enthusiastic hunter. He ordered all the clocks at Sandringham to run half an hour ahead to provide more daylight time for shooting. This so-called tradition of <a href="Sandringham%20Time">Sandringham Time</a> continued until 1936, when it was abolished by <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a>. He also laid out a golf course at Windsor. By the 1870s the future king had taken a keen interest in horseracing and steeplechasing. In 1896, his horse <a href="Persimmon%20%28horse%29">Persimmon</a> won both the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Derby Stakes</a> and the <a href="St%20Leger%20Stakes">St Leger Stakes</a>. In 1900, Persimmon's brother, <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee%20%28horse%29">Diamond Jubilee</a>, won five races (Derby, St Leger, <a href="2%2C000%20Guineas%20Stakes">2,000 Guineas Stakes</a>, <a href="Newmarket%20Stakes">Newmarket Stakes</a> and <a href="Eclipse%20Stakes">Eclipse Stakes</a>) and another of Edward's horses, Ambush II, won the <a href="Grand%20National">Grand National</a>.
In 1891 Edward was embroiled in the <a href="royal%20baccarat%20scandal">royal baccarat scandal</a>, when it was revealed he had played an illegal card game for money the previous year. The Prince was forced to appear as a witness in court for a second time when one of the participants unsuccessfully sued his fellow players for slander after being accused of cheating. In the same year Edward was involved in a personal conflict, when <a href="Lord%20Charles%20Beresford">Lord Charles Beresford</a> threatened to reveal details of Edward's private life to the press, as a protest against Edward interfering with Beresford's affair with <a href="Daisy%20Greville%2C%20Countess%20of%20Warwick">Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick</a>. The friendship between the two men was irreversibly damaged, and their bitterness would last for the remainder of their lives. Usually, Edward's outbursts of temper were short-lived, and "after he had let himself go ... [he would] smooth matters by being especially nice".

In late 1891, Edward's eldest son, <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Albert Victor</a>, was engaged to <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20Mary%20of%20Teck">Princess Victoria Mary of Teck</a>. Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia. Edward was grief-stricken. "To lose our eldest son", he wrote, "is one of those calamities one can never really get over". Edward told Queen Victoria, "[I would] have given my life for him, as I put no value on mine". Albert Victor was the second of Edward's children to die. In 1871, his youngest son, Alexander John, had died just 24 hours after being born. Edward had insisted on placing Alexander John in a coffin personally with "the tears rolling down his cheeks".

On his way to Denmark through Belgium on 4 April 1900, Edward was the victim of an attempted assassination when fifteen-year-old <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Sipido">Jean-Baptiste Sipido</a> shot at him in protest over the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>. Sipido, though obviously guilty, was acquitted by a Belgian court because he was underage. The perceived laxity of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the <a href="Congo%20Free%20State">Congo</a>, worsened the already poor relations between the United Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward's affability and popularity, as well as his use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.

When Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, Edward became King of the United Kingdom, Emperor of India and, in an innovation, King of the <a href="British%20Dominions">British Dominions</a>. He chose to reign under the name Edward VII, instead of Albert Edward—the name his mother had intended for him to use—declaring that he did not wish to "undervalue the name of Albert" and diminish the status of his father with whom the "name should stand alone". The numeral VII was occasionally omitted in Scotland, even by the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">national church</a>, in deference to protests that the previous Edwards were English kings who had "been excluded from Scotland by battle". <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a> recalled, "I was only a child when he succeeded Victoria in 1901, but I can testify to his extraordinary popularity. He was in fact the most popular king England had known since the earlier 1660s."

He donated his parents' house, <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, to the state and continued to live at Sandringham. He could afford to be magnanimous; his private secretary, Sir <a href="Francis%20Knollys%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Knollys">Francis Knollys</a>, claimed that he was the first heir to succeed to the throne in credit. Edward's finances had been ably managed by Sir <a href="Dighton%20Probyn">Dighton Probyn</a>, <a href="Comptroller%20of%20the%20Household">Comptroller of the Household</a>, and had benefited from advice from Edward's financier friends, some of whom were Jewish, such as <a href="Ernest%20Cassel">Ernest Cassel</a>, <a href="Maurice%20de%20Hirsch">Maurice de Hirsch</a> and the <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschild family</a>. At a time of widespread <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitism</a>, Edward attracted criticism for openly socialising with Jews.

<a href="Coronation%20of%20King%20Edward%20VII%20and%20Queen%20Alexandra">Edward's coronation</a> had originally been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, he was diagnosed with <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in <a href="anaesthesia">anaesthesia</a> and <a href="antisepsis">antisepsis</a> in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir <a href="Sir%20Frederick%20Treves%2C%201st%20Baronet">Frederick Treves</a>, with the support of <a href="Joseph%20Lister%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lister">Lord Lister</a>, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected <a href="abscess">abscess</a> through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which the King had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Temple">Frederick Temple</a>, who died only four months later.

Edward refurbished the royal palaces, reintroduced the traditional ceremonies, such as the <a href="State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a>, that his mother had forgone, and founded new <a href="Order%20%28honour%29">honours</a>, such as the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a>, to recognise contributions to the arts and sciences. In 1902, the Shah of Persia, <a href="Mozzafar-al-Din">Mozzafar-al-Din</a>, visited England expecting to receive the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>. Edward refused to bestow the honour on the Shah because the order was meant to be in his personal gift and the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a>, <a href="Henry%20Petty-Fitzmaurice%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Lansdowne">Lord Lansdowne</a>, had promised it without his consent. Edward also objected to inducting a Muslim into a Christian <a href="order%20of%20chivalry">order of chivalry</a>. His refusal threatened to damage British attempts to gain influence in Persia, but Edward resented his ministers' attempts to reduce the King's traditional powers. Eventually, he relented and Britain sent a special embassy to the Shah with a full Order of the Garter the following year.

As king, Edward's main interests lay in the fields of foreign affairs and naval and military matters. Fluent in French and German, he reinvented royal diplomacy by numerous state visits across Europe. He took annual holidays in <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a> and <a href="Mari%C3%A1nsk%C3%A9%20L%C3%A1zn%C4%9B">Marienbad</a>. One of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to France in May 1903 as the guest of President <a href="%C3%89mile%20Loubet">Émile Loubet</a>. Following a visit to <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> in Rome, this trip helped create the atmosphere for the Anglo-French <a href="Entente%20Cordiale">Entente Cordiale</a>, an agreement delineating British and French colonies in North Africa, and ruling out any future war between the two countries. The Entente was negotiated in 1904 between the French foreign minister, <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Delcass%C3%A9">Théophile Delcassé</a>, and the British foreign secretary, <a href="Henry%20Petty-Fitzmaurice%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Lansdowne">Lord Lansdowne</a>. It marked the end of centuries of Anglo-French rivalry and Britain's <a href="splendid%20isolation">splendid isolation</a> from Continental affairs, and attempted to counterbalance the growing dominance of the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> and its ally, <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>.

Edward was related to nearly every other European monarch, and came to be known as the "uncle of Europe". <a href="German%20Emperor%20Wilhelm%20II">German Emperor Wilhelm II</a> and <a href="Emperor%20Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Emperor Nicholas II of Russia</a> were his nephews; <a href="Queen%20Victoria%20Eugenia%20of%20Spain">Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain</a>, <a href="Crown%20Princess%20Margaret%20of%20Sweden">Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden</a>, <a href="Crown%20Princess%20Marie%20of%20Romania">Crown Princess Marie of Romania</a>, <a href="Crown%20Princess%20Sophia%20of%20Greece">Crown Princess Sophia of Greece</a>, and <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Empress Alexandra of Russia</a> were his nieces; <a href="King%20Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">King Haakon VII of Norway</a> was both his nephew and his son-in-law; kings <a href="Frederick%20VIII%20of%20Denmark">Frederick VIII of Denmark</a> and <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">George I of Greece</a> were his brothers-in-law; kings <a href="Albert%20I%20of%20Belgium">Albert I of Belgium</a>, <a href="Ferdinand%20of%20Bulgaria">Ferdinand of Bulgaria</a>, and <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Portugal">Charles I</a> and <a href="Manuel%20II%20of%20Portugal">Manuel II of Portugal</a> were his second cousins. Edward doted on his grandchildren, and indulged them, to the consternation of their governesses. However, there was one relation whom Edward did not like: Wilhelm II. Edward's difficult relationship with his nephew exacerbated the tensions between Germany and Britain.

In April 1908, during Edward's annual stay at Biarritz, he accepted the resignation of British Prime Minister Sir <a href="Henry%20Campbell-Bannerman">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a>. In a break with precedent, Edward asked Campbell-Bannerman's successor, <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>, to travel to Biarritz to <a href="kiss%20hands">kiss hands</a>. Asquith complied, but the press criticised the action of the King in appointing a prime minister on foreign soil instead of returning to Britain. In June 1908, Edward became the first reigning British monarch to visit the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, despite refusing to visit in 1906, when Anglo-Russian relations were strained in the aftermath of the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>, the <a href="Dogger%20Bank%20incident">Dogger Bank incident</a>, and the Tsar's dissolution of the <a href="Duma">Duma</a>. The previous month, Edward visited the Scandinavian countries, becoming the first British monarch to visit Sweden.

While Prince of Wales, Edward had to be dissuaded from breaking with constitutional precedent by openly voting for <a href="W.%20E.%20Gladstone">W. E. Gladstone</a>'s <a href="Representation%20of%20the%20People%20Act%201884">Representation of the People Bill (1884)</a> in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. On other matters he was less progressive: he did not, for example, favour giving <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage">votes to women</a>, although he did suggest that the social reformer <a href="Octavia%20Hill">Octavia Hill</a> serve on the <a href="Housing%20of%20the%20Working%20Classes%20Act%201885%23Background">Commission for Working Class Housing</a>. He was also opposed to <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule%20Movement">Irish Home Rule</a>, instead preferring a form of <a href="dual%20monarchy">dual monarchy</a>.

As Prince of Wales, he had come to enjoy warm and mutually respectful relations with Gladstone, whom his mother detested. But the statesman's son, <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="Herbert%20Gladstone">Herbert Gladstone</a>, angered the King by planning to permit Roman Catholic priests in vestments to carry the Host through the streets of London, and by appointing two ladies, <a href="Lady%20Frances%20Balfour">Lady Frances Balfour</a> and Mrs <a href="Harold%20Tennant">H. J. Tennant</a>, to serve on a Royal Commission on reforming divorce law—Edward thought divorce could not be discussed with "delicacy or even decency" before ladies. Edward's biographer <a href="Sir%20Philip%20Magnus-Allcroft%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Philip Magnus</a> suggests that Gladstone may have become a whipping-boy for the King's general irritation with the Liberal government. Gladstone was sacked in the reshuffle the following year and the King agreed, with some reluctance, to appoint him <a href="Governor-General%20of%20South%20Africa">Governor-General of South Africa</a>.

Edward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform, the need for which had become apparent with the failings of the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a>. He supported the redesign of army command, the creation of the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a>, and the decision to provide an <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Expeditionary Force</a> supporting France in the event of war with Germany. Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> as a new strategic threat. Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral <a href="Lord%20Charles%20Beresford">Lord Charles Beresford</a>, who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a> Admiral Sir <a href="John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">John Fisher</a>, who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s.

The King lent support to Fisher, in part because he disliked Beresford, and eventually Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained. The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was <a href="Arthur%20Wilson%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Sir Arthur Wilson</a>, who had retired in 1907. Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.

Edward was rarely interested in politics, although his views on some issues were notably liberal for the time. During his reign he said use of the word "<a href="nigger">nigger</a>" was "disgraceful", despite it then being in common parlance. In 1904, during an Anglo-German summit in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> between Wilhelm II and Edward, Wilhelm with the Russo-Japanese War in mind started to go on about the "<a href="Yellow%20Peril">Yellow Peril</a>", which he called "the greatest peril menacing ... Christendom and European civilisation. If the Russians went on giving ground, the yellow race would, in twenty years time, be in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> and <a href="Poznan">Posen</a>". Wilhelm went on to attack his British guests for supporting Japan against Russia, suggesting that the British were committing "race treason". In response, Edward stated that he "could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin".

Edward lived a life of luxury that was often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects. However, his personal charm with people at all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.

In the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> majority in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> refused to pass the "<a href="People%27s%20Budget">People's Budget</a>" proposed by the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> government of Prime Minister <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>. The crisis eventually led—after Edward's death—to the removal of the Lords' right to veto legislation.

The King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> at <a href="Limehouse">Limehouse</a>. Cabinet minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser <a href="Francis%20Knollys%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Knollys">Lord Knollys</a> and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare—although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the <a href="First%20Home%20Rule%20Bill">First Home Rule Bill</a> in 1886—that he introduced his son to <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a> <a href="Richard%20Haldane">Richard Haldane</a> as "the last King of England". After the King's horse <a href="Minoru%20%28horse%29">Minoru</a> won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day, and laughed when a man shouted: "Now, King. You've won the Derby. Go back home and dissolve this bloody Parliament!"

In vain, the King urged Conservative leaders <a href="Arthur%20Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a> and <a href="Henry%20Petty-Fitzmaurice%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Lansdowne">Lord Lansdowne</a> to pass the Budget, which <a href="Reginald%20Brett%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Esher">Lord Esher</a> had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker agreements between the two Houses over <a href="Irish%20Church%20Act%201869">Irish disestablishment in 1869</a> and the <a href="Representation%20of%20the%20People%20Act%201884">Third Reform Act in 1884</a>. On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward for doing so.

The Finance Bill passed the Commons on 5 November 1909, but was rejected by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge and had forbidden his adviser Lord Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass. In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered "outrageous" by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.

The <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20January%201910">January 1910 election</a> was dominated by talk of removing the Lords' veto. During the election campaign Lloyd George talked of "guarantees" and Asquith of "safeguards" that would be necessary before forming another Liberal government, but the King informed Asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election. Balfour refused to be drawn on whether or not he would be willing to form a Conservative government, but advised the King not to promise to create peers until he had seen the terms of any proposed constitutional change. During the campaign the leading Conservative <a href="Walter%20Long%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Long">Walter Long</a> had asked Knollys for permission to state that the King did not favour Irish Home Rule, but Knollys refused on the grounds that it was not appropriate for the monarch's views to be known in public.

The election resulted in a <a href="hung%20parliament">hung parliament</a>, with the Liberal government dependent on the support of the third largest party, the <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish nationalists</a>. The King suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote, which would also redress the large Conservative majority in the Lords, but <a href="Robert%20Crewe-Milnes%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Crewe">Lord Crewe</a>, Liberal leader in the Lords, advised that this would reduce the Lords' independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked. Pressure to remove the Lords' veto now came from the Irish nationalist MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Irish Home Rule. They threatened to vote against the Budget unless they had their way (an attempt by Lloyd George to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as the Cabinet felt this would recast the Budget too much). Asquith now revealed that there were no "guarantees" for the creation of peers. The Cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.

The King's <a href="Speech%20from%20the%20Throne">Speech from the Throne</a> on 21 February made reference to introducing measures restricting the Lords' power of veto to one of delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase "in the opinion of my advisers" so the King could be seen to be distancing himself from the planned legislation.

The Commons passed resolutions on 14 April that would form the basis for the 1911 <a href="Parliament%20Act%201911">Parliament Act</a>: to remove the power of the Lords to veto money bills, to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay, and to reduce the term of Parliament from seven years to five (the King would have preferred four). But in that debate Asquith hinted—to ensure the support of the nationalist MPs—that he would ask the King to break the deadlock "in that Parliament" (i.e. contrary to Edward's earlier stipulation that there be a second election). The Budget was passed by both Commons and Lords in April.

By April the Palace was having secret talks with Balfour and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who both advised that the Liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand the creation of peers. The King thought the whole proposal "simply disgusting" and that the government was "in the hands of <a href="John%20Redmond">Redmond</a> & Co". Lord Crewe announced publicly that the government's wish to create peers should be treated as formal "ministerial advice" (which, by convention, the monarch must obey) although Lord Esher argued that the monarch was entitled "in extremis" to dismiss the government rather than take their "advice". Esher's view has been called "obsolete and unhelpful".

Edward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a <a href="rodent%20ulcer">rodent ulcer</a>, a type of cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with <a href="radium">radium</a>. Towards the end of his life he increasingly suffered from <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a> when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">George I of Greece</a>, in <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> a week later on 5 May.

The following day, the King suffered several heart attacks, but refused to go to bed, saying, "No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end." Between moments of faintness, his son the Prince of Wales (shortly to be King <a href="George%20V">George V</a>) told him that his horse, Witch of the Air, had won at <a href="Kempton%20Park%20Racecourse">Kempton Park</a> that afternoon. The King replied, "Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad": his <a href="final%20words">final words</a>. At 11:30 p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.

Alexandra refused to allow the King's body to be moved for eight days afterwards, though she allowed small groups of visitors to enter his room. On 11 May, the late King was dressed in his uniform and placed in a massive oak coffin, which was moved on 14 May to the throne room, where it was sealed and lay in state, with a guardsman stood at each corner of the bier. Despite the time that had elapsed since his death, Alexandra noted the King's body remained "wonderfully preserved". On the morning of 17 May, the coffin was placed on a gun carriage and drawn by black horses to <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a>, with the new King and his family walking behind. Following a brief service, the royal family left, and the hall was opened to the public; over 400,000 people filed past the coffin over the next two days.

As <a href="Barbara%20Tuchman">Barbara Tuchman</a> noted in "<a href="The%20Guns%20of%20August">The Guns of August</a>", <a href="Funeral%20of%20King%20Edward%20VII">his funeral</a>, held on 20 May 1910, marked "the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last." A royal train conveyed the King's coffin from London to Windsor Castle, where Edward VII was buried at <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel</a>.

Before his accession to the throne, Edward was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. He was surpassed by his great-great-grandson <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a> on 20 April 2011. The title Prince of Wales is not automatically held by the heir apparent; it is bestowed by the reigning monarch at a time of his or her choosing. Edward was the longest-serving holder of that title until surpassed by Charles on 9 September 2017; Edward was Prince of Wales between 8 December 1841 and 22 January 1901 (59 years, 45 days). Charles was created Prince of Wales on 26 July 1958 ( ago).

As king, Edward VII proved a greater success than anyone had expected, but he was already past the average life expectancy and had little time left to fulfil the role. In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, George V, was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son, and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his "best friend and the best of fathers ... I never had a [cross] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief".

Edward has been recognised as the first truly constitutional British sovereign and the last sovereign to wield effective political power. Though lauded as "Peacemaker", he had been afraid his nephew, the German Emperor Wilhelm II, would tip Europe into war. Four years after Edward's death, World War I broke out. The naval reforms he had supported and his part in securing the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Triple Entente</a> between Britain, France and Russia, as well as his relationships with his extended family, fed the paranoia of the German Emperor, who blamed Edward for the war. Publication of the official biography of Edward was delayed until 1927 by its author, <a href="Sidney%20Lee">Sidney Lee</a>, who feared German propagandists would select material to portray Edward as an anti-German warmonger. Lee was also hampered by the extensive destruction of Edward's personal papers; Edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death. Subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of Edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to Lee.

Historian <a href="R.%20C.%20K.%20Ensor">R. C. K. Ensor</a>, writing in 1936, praised the King's political personality:

Ensor rejects the widespread notion that the King exerted important influence on British foreign policy. Ensor believed Edward gained that reputation by making frequent trips abroad, with many highly publicized visits to foreign courts, but surviving documents paint a different picture of "how comparatively crude his views on foreign policy were, how little he read, and of what naïve indiscretions he was capable."

Edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure, but he received great praise for his affable manners and diplomatic tact. As his grandson <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a> wrote, "his lighter side ... obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence." "He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty", wrote J. B. Priestley. Lord Esher wrote that Edward was "kind and debonair and not undignified—but too human".





Edward's <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20Prince%20of%20Wales">coat of arms as the Prince of Wales</a> was the <a href="Royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal arms</a> <a href="Difference%20%28heraldry%29">differenced</a> by a <a href="Label%20%28heraldry%29">label</a> of three points <a href="argent">argent</a>, and an <a href="inescutcheon">inescutcheon</a> of the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Saxony">Duchy of Saxony</a>, representing his paternal arms. When he acceded as King, he gained the royal arms undifferenced.

Death Valley National Park

Death Valley National Park is an American <a href="national%20park">national park</a> that straddles the <a href="California">California</a>—<a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> border, east of the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a>. The park boundaries include <a href="Death%20Valley">Death Valley</a>, the northern section of <a href="Panamint%20Valley">Panamint Valley</a>, the southern section of <a href="Eureka%20Valley%20%28Inyo%20County%29">Eureka Valley</a>, and most of <a href="Saline%20Valley%2C%20California">Saline Valley</a>. The park occupies an interface zone between the arid <a href="Great%20Basin%20Desert">Great Basin</a> and <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave</a> deserts, protecting the northwest corner of the Mojave Desert and its diverse environment of <a href="Salt%20pan%20%28geology%29">salt-flat</a>s, sand <a href="dune">dune</a>s, <a href="badlands">badlands</a>, valleys, canyons, and mountains. Death Valley is the largest national park in the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">lower 48 states</a>, and the hottest, driest and lowest of all the national parks in the United States. The second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere is in <a href="Badwater%20Basin">Badwater Basin</a>, which is below sea level. Approximately 91% of the park is a designated <a href="U.S.%20Wilderness%20Area">wilderness area</a>. The park is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh <a href="desert">desert</a> environment. Some examples include <a href="Larrea%20tridentata">creosote bush</a>, <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a>, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, and the <a href="Death%20Valley%20pupfish">Death Valley pupfish</a>, a survivor from much wetter times. <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> included Death Valley as the principal feature of its <a href="Mojave%20and%20Colorado%20Deserts%20Biosphere%20Reserve">Mojave and Colorado Deserts Biosphere Reserve</a> in 1984.

A series of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> groups inhabited the area from as early as 7000 BC, most recently the <a href="Timbisha">Timbisha</a> around 1000 AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains. A group of European-Americans, trapped in the valley in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">gold fields of California</a>, gave the valley its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived <a href="boomtown">boom town</a>s sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable <a href="ore">ore</a> to be mined was <a href="borax">borax</a>, which was transported out of the valley with <a href="twenty-mule%20team">twenty-mule team</a>s. The valley later became the subject of books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism expanded in the 1920s when resorts were built around <a href="Stovepipe%20Wells%2C%20California">Stovepipe Wells</a> and <a href="Furnace%20Creek%2C%20California">Furnace Creek</a>. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.

The natural environment of the area has been shaped largely by its geology. The valley is actually a <a href="graben">graben</a> with the oldest <a href="rock%20%28geology%29">rock</a>s being extensively <a href="metamorphism">metamorphosed</a> and at least 1.7 billion years old. Ancient, warm, shallow seas deposited marine sediments until <a href="rift">rift</a>ing opened the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Additional sedimentation occurred until a <a href="subduction">subduction</a> zone formed off the coast. The subduction <a href="Orogeny">uplifted</a> the region out of the sea and created a line of <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es. Later the <a href="crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a> started to pull apart, creating the current <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range</a> landform. Valleys filled with sediment and, during the wet times of <a href="glacial%20period">glacial period</a>s, with lakes, such as <a href="Lake%20Manly">Lake Manly</a>.

In 2013, Death Valley National Park was designated as a <a href="dark-sky%20preserve">dark sky park</a> by the <a href="International%20Dark-Sky%20Association">International Dark-Sky Association</a>.

There are two major valleys in the park, <a href="Death%20Valley">Death Valley</a> and <a href="Panamint%20Valley">Panamint Valley</a>. Both of these valleys were formed within the last few million years and both are bounded by north–south-trending <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a>s. These and adjacent valleys follow the general trend of <a href="Basin%20and%20range%20topography">Basin and Range</a> topography with one modification: there are parallel <a href="strike-slip%20fault">strike-slip fault</a>s that perpendicularly bound the central extent of Death Valley. The result of this shearing action is additional extension in the central part of Death Valley which causes a slight widening and more subsidence there.

Uplift of surrounding mountain ranges and subsidence of the valley floor are both occurring. The uplift on the Black Mountains is so fast that the <a href="alluvial%20fan">alluvial fan</a>s (fan-shaped deposits at the mouth of canyons) there are small and steep compared to the huge alluvial fans coming off the <a href="Panamint%20Range">Panamint Range</a>. Fast uplift of a mountain range in an arid environment often does not allow its canyons enough time to cut a classic V-shape all the way down to the stream bed. Instead, a V-shape ends at a <a href="slot%20canyon">slot canyon</a> halfway down, forming a 'wine glass canyon.' Sediment is deposited on a small and steep alluvial fan.

At below <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> at its lowest point, Badwater Basin on Death Valley's floor is the second-lowest depression in the Western Hemisphere (behind <a href="Laguna%20del%20Carb%C3%B3n">Laguna del Carbón</a> in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>), while <a href="Mount%20Whitney">Mount Whitney</a>, only to the west, rises to . This topographic relief is the greatest elevation gradient in the <a href="Continental%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a> and is the terminus point of the <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a>'s southwestern drainage. Although the extreme lack of water in the Great Basin makes this distinction of little current practical use, it does mean that in wetter times the lake that once filled Death Valley (<a href="Lake%20Manly">Lake Manly</a>) was the last stop for water flowing in the region, meaning the water there was saturated in dissolved materials. Thus the <a href="salt%20pan%20%28geology%29">salt pan</a>s in Death Valley are among the largest in the world and are rich in minerals, such as <a href="borax">borax</a> and various salts and <a href="hydrate">hydrate</a>s. The largest salt pan in the park extends from the Ashford Mill Site to the Salt Creek Hills, covering some of the valley floor. The best known <a href="Dry%20lake">playa</a> in the park is the <a href="Racetrack%20Playa">Racetrack</a>, known for its moving rocks.

Death Valley is the hottest and driest place in North America due to its lack of surface water and low relief. It is so frequently the hottest spot in the United States that many tabulations of the highest daily temperatures in the country omit Death Valley as a matter of course.

On the afternoon of July 10, 1913, the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">United States Weather Bureau</a> recorded a high temperature of 134 °F (56.7 °C) at <a href="Furnace%20Creek%2C%20California">Greenland Ranch</a> (now <a href="Furnace%20Creek%2C%20California">Furnace Creek</a>) in Death Valley. This temperature stands as the highest ambient air temperature ever recorded at the surface of the Earth. (A report of a temperature of 58 °C (136.4 °F) recorded in Libya in 1922 was later determined to be inaccurate.) Daily summer temperatures of or greater are common, as well as below freezing nightly temperatures in the winter. July is the hottest month, with an average high of and an average low of . December is the coldest month, with an average high of and an average low of . The record low is . 

Several of the larger Death Valley springs derive their water from a regional <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>, which extends as far east as southern <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> and <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. Much of the water in this aquifer has been there for many thousands of years, since the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">Pleistocene ice ages</a>, when the <a href="climate">climate</a> was cooler and wetter. Today's drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to recharge the aquifer at the rate at which water is being withdrawn.
The highest range within the park is the Panamint Range with <a href="Telescope%20Peak">Telescope Peak</a> being its highest point at . The Death Valley region is a transitional zone in the northernmost part of the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a> and consists of five mountain ranges removed from the Pacific Ocean. Three of these are significant barriers: the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a>, the <a href="Argus%20Range">Argus Range</a>, and the Panamint Range. Air masses tend to lose moisture as they are forced up over mountain ranges, in what climatologists call a <a href="rainshadow%20effect">rainshadow effect</a>.

The exaggerated rainshadow effect for the Death Valley area makes it <a href="North%20America">North America</a>'s driest spot, receiving about of rainfall annually at Badwater (some years fail to register any measurable rainfall). Annual average precipitation varies from overall below sea level to over in the higher mountains that surround the valley. When rain does arrive it often does so in intense storms that cause <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>s which remodel the landscape and sometimes create very shallow ephemeral lakes.
The hot, dry climate makes it difficult for soil to form. <a href="Mass%20wasting">Mass wasting</a>, the down-slope movement of loose rock, is therefore the dominant erosive force in mountainous area, resulting in "skeletonized" ranges (mountains with very little soil on them). <a href="Dune">Sand dune</a>s in the park, while famous, are not nearly as widespread as their fame or the dryness of the area may suggest. The Mesquite Flat dune field is the most easily accessible from the paved road just east of Stovepipe Wells in the north-central part of the valley and is primarily made of <a href="quartz">quartz</a> sand. Another dune field is just to the north but is instead mostly composed of <a href="travertine">travertine</a> sand. The highest dunes in the park, and some of the highest in North America, are located in the <a href="Eureka%20Valley%20Sand%20Dunes">Eureka Valley</a> about to the north of Stovepipe Wells, while the <a href="Panamint%20Valley">Panamint Valley</a> dunes and the <a href="Saline%20Valley%2C%20California">Saline Valley</a> dunes are located west and northwest of the town, respectively. The Ibex dune field is near the seldom-visited Ibex Hill in the southernmost part of the park, just south of the Saratoga Springs marshland. All of the latter four dune fields are accessible only via unpaved roads. Prevailing winds in the winter come from the north, and prevailing winds in the summer come from the south. Thus the overall position of the dune fields remains more or less fixed.

There are rare exceptions to the dry nature of the area. In 2005, an unusually wet winter created a 'lake' in the Badwater Basin and led to the greatest wildflower season in the park's history. In October 2015, a "1000 year flood event" with over three inches of rain caused major damage in Death Valley National Park.

Four <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> cultures are known to have lived in the area during the last 10,000 years. The first known group, the <a href="Nevares%20Spring%20People">Nevares Spring People</a>, were <a href="hunters%20and%20gatherers">hunters and gatherers</a> who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000 years ago (7000 BC) when there were still small lakes in Death Valley and neighboring Panamint Valley. A much milder climate persisted at that time, and large game animals were still plentiful. By 5,000 years ago (3000 BC) the <a href="Mesquite%20Flat%20People">Mesquite Flat People</a> displaced the Nevares Spring People. Around 2,000 years ago the <a href="Saratoga%20Spring%20People">Saratoga Spring People</a> moved into the area, which by then was probably already a hot, dry desert. This culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at handcrafts. They also left mysterious stone patterns in the valley.

One-thousand years ago, the nomadic <a href="Timbisha">Timbisha</a> (formerly called Shoshone and also known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and gathered <a href="mesquite">mesquite</a> beans along with <a href="pinyon%20pine">pinyon pine</a> nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As the spring and summer progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them at the very top of the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.

The <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> brought the first people of European descent known to visit the immediate area. In December 1849 two groups of <a href="California%20Gold%20Country">California Gold Country</a>-bound travelers with perhaps 100 wagons total stumbled into Death Valley after getting lost on what they thought was a shortcut off the <a href="Old%20Spanish%20Trail%20%28trade%20route%29">Old Spanish Trail</a>. Called the <a href="Death%20Valley%20%2749ers">Bennett-Arcane Party</a>, they were unable to find a pass out of the valley for weeks; they were able to find fresh water at various springs in the area, but were forced to eat several of their oxen to survive. They used the wood of their wagons to cook the meat and make jerky. The place where they did this is today referred to as "Burned Wagons Camp" and is located near the sand dunes.

After abandoning their wagons, they eventually were able to hike out of the valley. Just after leaving the valley, one of the women in the group turned and said, "Goodbye Death Valley," giving the valley they endured its name. Included in the party was <a href="William%20L.%20Manly">William Lewis Manly</a> whose autobiographical book "<a href="Death%20Valley%20in%20%2749">Death Valley in '49</a>" detailed this trek and popularized the area (geologists later named the prehistoric lake that once filled the valley after him).

The ores that are most famously associated with the area were also the easiest to collect and the most profitable: evaporite deposits such as salts, <a href="borate">borate</a>, and <a href="talc">talc</a>. Borax was found by Rosie and Aaron Winters near <a href="Oasis%20at%20Death%20Valley">The Ranch at Death Valley</a> (then called Greenland) in 1881. Later that same year, the <a href="Eagle%20Borax%20Works">Eagle Borax Works</a> became Death Valley's first commercial borax operation. <a href="William%20Tell%20Coleman">William Tell Coleman</a> built the <a href="Harmony%20Borax%20Works">Harmony Borax Works</a> plant and began to process ore in late 1883 or early 1884, continuing until 1888. This mining and smelting company produced borax to make <a href="soap">soap</a> and for industrial uses. The end product was shipped out of the valley to the <a href="Mojave%2C%20California">Mojave</a> railhead in 10-ton-capacity wagons pulled by "<a href="twenty-mule%20team">twenty-mule team</a>s" that were actually teams of 18 mules and two horses each.

The teams averaged two miles (3 km) an hour and required about 30 days to complete a round trip. The trade name <a href="Twenty-Mule-Team%20Borax">"20-Mule Team Borax"</a> was established by <a href="Francis%20Marion%20Smith">Francis Marion Smith</a>'s <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Borax%20Company">Pacific Coast Borax Company</a> after Smith acquired Coleman's borax holdings in 1890. A memorable advertising campaign used the wagon's image to promote the <a href="Boraxo">Boraxo</a> brand of granular hand soap and the <a href="Death%20Valley%20Days">Death Valley Days</a> radio and television programs. In 1914, the <a href="Death%20Valley%20Railroad">Death Valley Railroad</a> was built to serve mining operations on the east side of the valley. Mining continued after the collapse of Coleman's empire, and by the late 1920s the area was the world's number one source of borax. Some four to six million years old, the Furnace Creek Formation is the primary source of borate minerals gathered from Death Valley's playas.

Other visitors stayed to prospect for and mine deposits of <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, and <a href="silver">silver</a>. These sporadic mining ventures were hampered by their remote location and the harsh desert environment. In December 1903, two men from Ballarat were prospecting for silver. One was an out-of-work Irish miner named Jack Keane and the other was a one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren. Quite by accident, Keane discovered an immense ledge of free-milling gold by the duo's work site and named the claim the <a href="Keane%20Wonder%20Mine">Keane Wonder Mine</a>. This started a minor and short-lived <a href="gold%20rush">gold rush</a> into the area. The Keane Wonder Mine, along with mines at <a href="Rhyolite%2C%20Nevada">Rhyolite</a>, <a href="Skidoo%2C%20California">Skidoo</a> and <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Inyo%20County%2C%20California">Harrisburg</a>, were the only ones to extract enough metal ore to make them worthwhile. Outright shams such as <a href="Leadfield%2C%20California">Leadfield</a> also occurred, but most ventures quickly ended after a short series of prospecting mines failed to yield evidence of significant ore (these mines now dot the entire area and are a significant hazard to anyone who enters them). The boom towns which sprang up around these mines flourished during the 1900s (decade) but soon declined after the <a href="Panic%20of%201907">Panic of 1907</a>.

The first documented tourist facilities in Death Valley were a set of tent houses built in the 1920s where Stovepipe Wells is now located. People flocked to resorts built around natural springs thought to have curative and restorative properties. In 1927, Pacific Coast Borax turned the crew quarters of its Furnace Creek Ranch into a resort, creating the <a href="Oasis%20at%20Death%20Valley">Furnace Creek Inn</a> and resort. The spring at Furnace Creek was harnessed to develop the resort, and as the water was diverted, the surrounding <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es and <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s started to shrink.

Soon the valley was a popular winter destination. Other facilities started off as private getaways but were later opened to the public. Most notable among these was Death Valley Ranch, better known as <a href="Scotty%27s%20Castle">Scotty's Castle</a>. This large ranch home built in the <a href="Spanish%20Revival">Spanish Revival</a> style became a hotel in the late 1930s and, largely because of the fame of <a href="Death%20Valley%20Scotty">Death Valley Scotty</a>, a tourist attraction. Death Valley Scotty, whose real name was Walter Scott, was a gold miner who pretended to be owner of "his castle", which he claimed to have built with profits from his gold mine. Neither claim was true, but the real owner, <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> millionaire <a href="Albert%20Mussey%20Johnson">Albert Mussey Johnson</a>, encouraged the myth. When asked by reporters what his connection was to Walter Scott's castle, Johnson replied that he was Mr. Scott's banker.

President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> proclaimed a <a href="U.S.%20National%20Monument">national monument</a> in and around Death Valley on February 11, 1933, setting aside almost two million acres (8,000 km) of southeastern California and small parts of southwesternmost Nevada.

Twelve companies worked in Death Valley using <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> workers during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and on into the early 1940s. They built barracks, graded of roads, installed water and telephone lines, and erected a total of 76 buildings. Trails in the Panamint Range were built to points of scenic interest, and an <a href="adobe">adobe</a> village, laundry and trading post were constructed for <a href="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> Native Americans. Five campgrounds, restrooms, an airplane landing field and picnic facilities were also built.

Creation of the monument resulted in a temporary closing of the lands to prospecting and mining. However, Death Valley was quickly reopened to mining by <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">Congressional</a> action in June of the same year. As improvements in mining technology allowed lower grades of ore to be processed, and new heavy equipment allowed greater amounts of rock to be moved, mining in Death Valley changed. Gone were the days of the "single-blanket, jackass prospector" long associated with the romantic west. <a href="Open-pit%20mine">Open pit</a> and <a href="strip%20mine">strip mine</a>s scarred the landscape as international mining corporations bought claims in highly visible areas of the national monument. The public outcry that ensued led to greater protection for all national park and monument areas in the United States.
In 1976, Congress passed the <a href="Mining%20in%20the%20Parks%20Act">Mining in the Parks Act</a>, which closed Death Valley National Monument to the filing of new mining claims, banned open-pit mining and required the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> to examine the validity of tens of thousands of pre-1976 mining claims. Mining was allowed to resume on a limited basis in 1980 with stricter environmental standards.

The park's Resources Management Division monitors mining within park boundaries and continues to review the status of 19 patented mining claim groups and less than 10 unpatented mining claims, while ensuring that federal guidelines are followed and the park's resources are protected. In 2005, the <a href="Billie%20Mine">Billie Mine</a>, an underground borax mine located along the road to <a href="Dante%27s%20View">Dante's View</a>, closed, ending mining in the park.

Death Valley National Monument was designated a <a href="biosphere%20reserve">biosphere reserve</a> in 1984. On October 31, 1994, the monument was expanded by 1.3 million acres (5,300 km) and re-designated as a <a href="national%20park">national park</a>, via congressional passage of the <a href="California%20Desert%20Protection%20Act">California Desert Protection Act</a> (Public Law 103-433). Consequently, the elevated status for Death Valley made it the largest national park in the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>. Many of the larger cities and towns within the boundary of the regional <a href="ground%20water">ground water</a> flow system that the park and its plants and animals rely upon are experiencing some of the fastest growth rates of any place in the United States. Notable examples within a radius of Death Valley National Park include <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a> and <a href="Pahrump%2C%20Nevada">Pahrump, Nevada</a>. In the case of Las Vegas, the local Chamber of Commerce estimates that 6,000 people are moving to the city every month. Between 1985 and 1995, the population of the Las Vegas Valley increased from 550,700 to 1,138,800.
In 1977, parts of Death Valley were used by director <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a> as a <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Wars%20filming%20locations">filming location for "Star Wars"</a>, providing the setting for the fictional planet <a href="Tatooine">Tatooine</a>.

The park has a diverse and complex geologic history. Since its formation, the area that comprises the park has experienced at least four major periods of extensive <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a>, three or four periods of major <a href="sedimentation">sedimentation</a>, and several intervals of major <a href="plate%20tectonics">tectonic</a> deformation where the crust has been reshaped. Two periods of <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a> (a series of ice ages) have also had effects on the area, although no <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s ever existed in the ranges now in the park.

Little is known about the history of the oldest exposed <a href="rock%20%28geology%29">rock</a>s in the area due to extensive <a href="metamorphism">metamorphism</a> (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). <a href="Radiometric%20dating">Radiometric dating</a> gives an age of 1,700 million years for the metamorphism during the <a href="Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a>. About 1,400 million years ago a mass of <a href="granite">granite</a> now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500 million years of erosion.

The Proterozoic sedimentary <a href="formation%20%28geology%29">formations</a> of the <a href="Geology%20of%20the%20Death%20Valley%20area%23Pahrump%20Group">Pahrump Group</a> were deposited on these basement rocks. This occurred following uplift and erosion of any earlier sediments from the Proterozoic basement rocks. The Pahrump is composed of arkose <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerate</a> (quartz clasts in a concrete-like matrix) and <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a> in its lower part, followed by <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a> from <a href="Carbonate%20rock">carbonate</a> banks topped by <a href="algal%20mat">algal mat</a>s as <a href="stromatolite">stromatolite</a>s, and finished with basin-filling sediment derived from the above, including possible <a href="glacial%20till">glacial till</a> from the hypothesized <a href="Snowball%20Earth">Snowball Earth</a> glaciation. The very youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic lava flows.

A <a href="rift">rift</a> opened and subsequently flooded the region as part of the breakup of the supercontinent <a href="Rodinia">Rodinia</a> in the <a href="Neoproterozoic">Neoproterozoic</a> (by about 755 million years ago) and the creation of the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. A shoreline similar to the present <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> margin of the United States lay to the east. An <a href="algal%20mat">algal mat</a>-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the <a href="continental%20crust">continental crust</a> thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular <a href="unconformity">unconformity</a> (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.

A true <a href="ocean%20basin">ocean basin</a> developed to the west, breaking all the earlier formations along a steep front. A wedge of clastic sediment then began to accumulate at the base of the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelves</a>. Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. The region's first known <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s of complex life are found in the resulting formations. Notable among these are the <a href="Ediacaran">Ediacara fauna</a> and <a href="trilobite">trilobite</a>s, the evolution of the latter being part of the <a href="Cambrian%20Explosion">Cambrian Explosion</a> of life.

The sandy mudflats gave way about 550 million years ago to a carbonate platform (similar to the one around the present-day <a href="Bahama">Bahama</a>s), which lasted for the next 300 million years of <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> time (refer to the middle of the ). Death Valley's position was then within ten or twenty degrees of the Paleozoic <a href="equator">equator</a>. Thick beds of carbonate-rich sediments were periodically interrupted by periods of emergence. Although details of geography varied during this immense interval of time, a north-northeasterly trending coastline generally ran from <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> up through <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. The resulting eight formations and one group are thick and underlay much of the Cottonwood, Funeral, Grapevine, and Panamint ranges.

In the early-to-mid- <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> the western edge of the North American continent was pushed against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a <a href="subduction%20zone">subduction zone</a>. A subduction zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The <a href="Sierran%20Arc">Sierran Arc</a> started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused <a href="thrust%20fault">thrust fault</a>s to develop.

A long period of uplift and erosion was concurrent with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity, which is a large gap in the geologic record. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were carried both east and west by wind and water. No Jurassic- to <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>-aged sedimentary formations exist in the area, except for some possibly Jurassic-age <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic rock</a>s (see the top of the ).

Erosion over many millions of years created a relatively featureless plain. Thirty-five million years ago, sluggish streams migrated laterally over its surface. Several other similar formations were also laid down.

<a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range</a>-associated stretching of large parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16 million years ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3 million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a>s. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and at the base of the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the <a href="Pacific%20Plate">Pacific Plate</a> along the <a href="San%20Andreas%20Fault">San Andreas Fault</a> (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.

Igneous activity associated with this stretching occurred from 12 million to 4 million years ago. Sedimentation is concentrated in valleys (basins) from material eroded from adjacent ranges. The amount of sediment deposited has roughly kept up with this subsidence, resulting in retention of more or less the same valley floor elevation over time.

<a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> ice ages started 2 million years ago, and melt from alpine <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s on the nearby Sierra Nevada Mountains fed a series of lakes that filled Death and <a href="Lake%20Panamint">Panamint valleys</a> and surrounding basins (see the top of the ). The lake that filled Death Valley was the last of a chain of lakes fed by the <a href="Amargosa%20River">Amargosa</a> and <a href="Mojave%20River">Mojave River</a>s, and possibly also the <a href="Owens%20River">Owens River</a>. The large lake that covered much of Death Valley's floor, which geologists call <a href="Lake%20Manly">Lake Manly</a>, started to dry up 10,500 years ago. <a href="Dry%20lake">Saltpan</a>s and playas were created as ice age glaciers retreated, thus drastically reducing the lakes' water source. Only faint shorelines are left.

<a href="Habitat%20%28ecology%29">Habitat</a> varies from saltpan at below sea level to the sub-alpine conditions found on the summit of Telescope Peak, which rises to . Vegetation zones include <a href="creosote%20bush">creosote bush</a>, <a href="salt%20bush">desert holly</a>, and <a href="mesquite">mesquite</a> at the lower elevations and <a href="Sagebrush">sage</a> up through <a href="shadscale">shadscale</a>, <a href="blackbrush">blackbrush</a>, <a href="Yucca%20brevifolia">Joshua tree</a>, <a href="Pi%C3%B1on%20pine">pinyon</a>-<a href="juniper">juniper</a>, to <a href="limber%20pine">limber pine</a> and <a href="Great%20Basin%20bristlecone%20pine">bristlecone pine</a> woodlands. The saltpan is devoid of vegetation, and the rest of the valley floor and lower slopes have sparse cover, although where water is available, an abundance of vegetation is usually present. 
These zones and the adjacent desert support a variety of wildlife <a href="species">species</a>, including 51 species of native <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, 307 species of <a href="bird">bird</a>s, 36 species of <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s, 3 species of <a href="amphibia">amphibia</a>ns, and 2 species of native <a href="fish">fish</a>.

Small mammals are more numerous than large mammals, such as <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a>, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s (), <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s, <a href="kit%20fox">kit fox</a>es, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s, and <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a>. Mule deer are present in the pinyon/juniper associations of the Grapevine, Cottonwood, and Panamint ranges. Bighorn sheep are a rare species of <a href="mountain%20sheep">mountain sheep</a> that exist in isolated bands in the Sierra and in Death Valley. These are highly adaptable animals and can eat almost any plant. They have no known predators, but humans and <a href="donkey">burro</a>s compete for habitat.
The ancestors of the <a href="Death%20Valley%20pupfish">Death Valley pupfish</a> swam to the area from the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> via a long-since dried-up system of rivers and lakes (see <a href="Lake%20Manly">Lake Manly</a>). They now live in two separate populations: one in Salt Creek and another in Cottonball Marsh. Death Valley is one of the hottest and driest places in North America, yet it is home to over 1,000 species of <a href="plant">plant</a>s; 23 of which, including the very rare rock lady ("<a href="Holmgrenanthe%20petrophila">Holmgrenanthe petrophila</a>"), are not found anywhere else.

Adaptation to the dry environment is key. For example, creosote bush and mesquite have tap-<a href="root">root</a> systems that can extend down in order to take advantage of a year-round supply of <a href="ground%20water">ground water</a>. The diversity of Death Valley's plant communities results partly from the region's location in a transition zone between the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a>, the <a href="Great%20Basin%20Desert">Great Basin Desert</a> and the <a href="Sonoran%20Desert">Sonoran Desert</a>. This location, combined with the great relief found within the park, supports vegetation typical of three biotic <a href="life%20zone">life zone</a>s: the lower Sonoran, the Canadian, and the arctic/alpine in portions of the Panamint Range. Based on the Munz and Keck (1968) classifications, seven plant communities can be categorized within these life zones, each characterized by dominant vegetation and representative of three vegetation types: scrub, desert woodland, and coniferous forest. Microhabitats further subdivide some communities into zones, especially on the valley floor.
Unlike more typical locations across the Mojave Desert, many of the water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity of plant and animal species that are not found anywhere else in the world. The existence of these species is due largely to a unique geologic history and the process of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> that has progressed in habitats that have been isolated from one another since the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> epoch.

George I of Great Britain

George I (George Louis; ; 28 May 1660 – 11 June 1727) was <a href="King%20of%20Great%20Britain">King of Great Britain</a> and <a href="King%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> from 1 August 1714 and ruler of the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Duchy and Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover)</a> in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> from 1698 until his death in 1727.

George was born in <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a> and inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg from his father and uncles. A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime, and in 1708 he was ratified as <a href="prince-elector">prince-elector</a> of Hanover. At the age of 54, after the death of his second cousin <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Anne, Queen of Great Britain</a>, George ascended the <a href="British%20throne">British throne</a> as the <a href="List%20of%20British%20Monarchs%23House%20of%20Hanover">first monarch</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">House of Hanover</a>. Although over 50 <a href="Jacobite%20line%20of%20succession%20to%20the%20English%20and%20Scottish%20thrones%20in%201714">Roman Catholics were closer</a> to Anne by <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a> prohibited Catholics from inheriting the British throne; George was Anne's closest living Protestant relative. In reaction, <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobites</a> attempted to depose George and replace him with Anne's Catholic half-brother, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a>, but their attempts failed.

During George's reign, the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of <a href="cabinet%20government">cabinet government</a> led by a prime minister. Towards the end of his reign, actual political power was held by <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a>, now recognised as Britain's first "de facto" <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">prime minister</a>. George died of a stroke on a trip to his native Hanover, where he was buried. He was the last British monarch to be buried outside the United Kingdom.

George was born on 28 May 1660 in the city of <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a> in the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a> in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. He was the eldest son of <a href="Ernest%20Augustus%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Ernest Augustus</a>, Duke of <a href="Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, and his wife, <a href="Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Sophia of the Palatinate</a>. Sophia was the granddaughter of <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">King James I</a> of England through her mother, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth of Bohemia</a>.

For the first year of his life, George was the only heir to the German territories of his father and three childless uncles. George's brother, <a href="Frederick%20Augustus%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Frederick Augustus</a>, was born in 1661, and the two boys (known as "Görgen" and "Gustchen" by the family) were brought up together. Their mother was absent for almost a year (1664–65) during a long convalescent holiday in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, but corresponded regularly with her sons' governess and took a great interest in their upbringing, even more so upon her return. Sophia bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter. In her letters, Sophia describes George as a responsible, conscientious child who set an example to his younger brothers and sisters.

By 1675 George's eldest uncle had died without issue, but his remaining two uncles had married, putting George's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles' estates might pass to their own sons, should they have had any, instead of to George. George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the <a href="Franco-Dutch%20War">Franco-Dutch War</a> with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.

In 1679 another uncle died unexpectedly without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of <a href="Principality%20of%20Calenberg">Calenberg</a>-<a href="Principality%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a>, with his capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, <a href="George%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">George William of Celle</a>, had married his mistress in order to legitimise his only daughter, <a href="Sophia%20Dorothea%20of%20Celle">Sophia Dorothea</a>, but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under <a href="Salic%20law">Salic law</a>, where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, meaning George would inherit all the territory and not have to share it with his brothers.

The same year, George married his first cousin, <a href="Sophia%20Dorothea%20of%20Celle">Sophia Dorothea of Celle</a>, thereby securing additional incomes that would have been outside Salic laws. The <a href="marriage%20of%20state">marriage of state</a> was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. His mother was at first against the marriage because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea's mother (who was not of royal birth), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.

In 1683, George and his brother, Frederick Augustus, served in the <a href="Great%20Turkish%20War">Great Turkish War</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vienna">Battle of Vienna</a>, and Sophia Dorothea bore George a son, <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George Augustus</a>. The following year, Frederick Augustus was informed of the adoption of primogeniture, meaning he would no longer receive part of his father's territory as he had expected. It led to a breach between father and son, and between the brothers, that lasted until Frederick Augustus's death in battle in 1690. With the imminent formation of a single Hanoverian state, and the Hanoverians' continuing contributions to the Empire's wars, Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. George's prospects were now better than ever as the sole heir to his father's electorate and his uncle's duchy.

Sophia Dorothea had a second child, a daughter named after her, in 1687, but there were no other pregnancies. The couple became estranged—George preferred the company of his mistress, <a href="Melusine%20von%20der%20Schulenburg%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Kendal">Melusine von der Schulenburg</a>, and Sophia Dorothea, meanwhile, had her own romance with the Swedish Count <a href="Philip%20Christoph%20von%20K%C3%B6nigsmarck">Philip Christoph von Königsmarck</a>. Threatened with the scandal of an elopement, the Hanoverian court, including George's brothers and mother, urged the lovers to desist, but to no avail. According to diplomatic sources from Hanover's enemies, in July 1694 the Swedish count was killed, possibly with the connivance of George, and his body thrown into the river <a href="Leine">Leine</a> weighted with stones. The murder was claimed to have been committed by four of Ernest Augustus's courtiers, one of whom (Don Nicolò Montalbano) was paid the enormous sum of 150,000 <a href="thaler">thaler</a>s, which was about one hundred times the annual salary of the highest paid minister. Later rumours supposed that Königsmarck was hacked to pieces and buried beneath the Hanover palace floorboards. However, sources in Hanover itself, including Sophia, denied any knowledge of Königsmarck's whereabouts.

George's marriage to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, not on the grounds that either of them had committed adultery, but on the grounds that Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her husband. With the agreement of her father, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in <a href="Ahlden%20House">Ahlden House</a> in her native <a href="Celle">Celle</a>, where she stayed until she died more than thirty years later. She was denied access to her children and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard. She was, however, endowed with an income, establishment, and servants, and was allowed to ride in a carriage outside her castle, albeit under supervision. Melusine von der Schulenburg acted as George's hostess openly from 1698 until his death, and they had three daughters together, born in 1692, 1693 and 1701, respectively.

Ernest Augustus died on 23 January 1698, leaving all of his territories to George with the exception of the <a href="Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück</a>, an office he had held since 1661. George thus became Duke of <a href="Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Brunswick-Lüneburg</a> (also known as Hanover, after its capital) as well as <a href="Prince-elector%23High%20offices">Archbannerbearer</a> and a <a href="Prince-Elector">Prince-Elector</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. His court in Hanover was graced by many cultural icons such as the mathematician and philosopher <a href="Gottfried%20Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> and the composers <a href="George%20Frideric%20H%C3%A4ndel">George Frideric Händel</a> and <a href="Agostino%20Steffani">Agostino Steffani</a>.

Shortly after George's accession to his paternal duchy, <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Prince William, Duke of Gloucester</a>, who was second-in-line to the English and Scottish thrones, died. By the terms of the English <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, George's mother, Sophia, was designated as the heir to the English throne if the then reigning monarch, <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>, and his sister-in-law, <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Anne</a>, died without surviving issue. The <a href="Succession%20to%20the%20British%20throne">succession</a> was so designed because Sophia was the closest Protestant relative of the <a href="British%20royal%20family">British royal family</a>. Fifty-six Catholics with superior hereditary claims were bypassed. The likelihood of any of them converting to Protestantism for the sake of the succession was remote; some had already refused.

In August 1701, George was invested with the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a> and, within six weeks, the nearest Catholic claimant to the thrones, the former king <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, died. William III died the following March and was succeeded by Anne. Sophia became heiress presumptive to the new Queen of England. Sophia was in her seventy-first year, older than Anne by thirty-five years, but she was very fit and healthy and invested time and energy in securing the succession either for herself or for her son. However, it was George who understood the complexities of English politics and <a href="History%20of%20the%20British%20constitution">constitutional law</a>, which required further <a href="Sophia%20Naturalization%20Act%201705">acts in 1705</a> to naturalise Sophia and her heirs as English subjects, and to detail arrangements for the transfer of power through a Regency Council. In the same year, George's surviving uncle died and he inherited further German dominions: the <a href="Principality%20of%20L%C3%BCneburg">Principality of Lüneburg</a>-<a href="Principality%20of%20Grubenhagen">Grubenhagen</a>, centred at <a href="Celle">Celle</a>.

Shortly after George's accession in Hanover, the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> broke out. At issue was the right of <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Spain">Philip</a>, the grandson of King <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a>, to succeed to the Spanish throne under the terms of King <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20Spain">Charles II of Spain</a>'s <a href="will%20%28law%29">will</a>. The Holy Roman Empire, the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">United Dutch Provinces</a>, England, Hanover and many other German states opposed Philip's right to succeed because they feared that the French <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">House of Bourbon</a> would become too powerful if it also controlled Spain. As part of the war effort, George invaded his neighbouring state, <a href="Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a>, which was pro-French, writing out some of the battle orders himself. The invasion succeeded with few lives lost. As a reward, the prior Hanoverian annexation of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Saxe-Lauenburg">Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg</a> by George's uncle was recognised by the British and Dutch.

In 1706, the <a href="Maximilian%20II%20Emanuel%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Elector of Bavaria</a> was deprived of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with command of the imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, partly because he was deceived by his ally, the <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a>, into a diversionary attack, and partly because <a href="Emperor%20Joseph%20I">Emperor Joseph I</a> appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes thought that he had acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George did not hold Marlborough's actions against him; he understood they were part of a plan to lure French forces away from the main attack.

In 1709, George resigned as field marshal, never to go on active service again. In 1710, he was granted the dignity of <a href="Arch-Treasurer">Arch-Treasurer of the Empire</a>, an office formerly held by the <a href="Elector%20Palatine">Elector Palatine</a>—the absence of the Elector of Bavaria allowed a reshuffling of offices. The death of the Emperor in 1711 threatened to destroy the balance of power in the opposite direction, so the war ended in 1713 with the ratification of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a>. Philip was allowed to succeed to the Spanish throne but was removed from the French line of succession, and the Elector of Bavaria was restored.

Though both England and Scotland recognised Anne as their queen, only the <a href="English%20Parliament">English Parliament</a> had settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover, as the heir presumptive. The <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> (the Estates) had not formally settled the succession question for the Scottish throne. In 1703, the Estates passed a bill declaring that their selection for Queen Anne's successor would not be the same individual as the successor to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants in England and its colonies. At first <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> was withheld, but the following year Anne capitulated to the wishes of the Estates and assent was granted to the bill, which became the <a href="Act%20of%20Security%201704">Act of Security 1704</a>. In response the English Parliament passed measures that threatened to restrict Anglo-Scottish trade and cripple the Scottish economy if the Estates did not agree to the Hanoverian succession. Eventually, in 1707, both Parliaments agreed on an <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">Act of Union</a>, which united England and Scotland into a single political entity, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>, and established the rules of succession as laid down by the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>. The union created the largest free trade area in 18th-century Europe.

<a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> politicians believed Parliament had the right to determine the succession, and to bestow it on the nearest Protestant relative of the Queen, while many <a href="Tory">Tories</a> were more inclined to believe in the <a href="hereditary%20right">hereditary right</a> of the Catholic <a href="Stuarts">Stuarts</a>, who were nearer relations. In 1710, George announced that he would succeed in Britain by hereditary right, as the right had been removed from the Stuarts, and he retained it. "This declaration was meant to scotch any Whig interpretation that parliament had given him the kingdom [and] ... convince the Tories that he was no usurper."

George's mother, the Electress Sophia, died on 28 May 1714 at the age of 83. She had collapsed in the <a href="Herrenhausen%20Gardens">gardens at Herrenhausen</a> after rushing to shelter from a shower of rain. George was now Queen Anne's heir presumptive. He swiftly revised the membership of the Regency Council that would take power after Anne's death, as it was known that Anne's health was failing and politicians in Britain were jostling for power. She suffered a stroke, which left her unable to speak, and died on 1 August 1714. The list of regents was opened, the members sworn in, and George was proclaimed King of Great Britain and Ireland. Partly due to contrary winds, which kept him in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> awaiting passage, he did not arrive in Britain until 18 September. George was crowned at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on 20 October. His coronation was accompanied by <a href="Coronation%20riots">rioting</a> in over twenty towns in England.

George mainly lived in Great Britain after 1714, though he visited his home in Hanover in 1716, 1719, 1720, 1723 and 1725; in total George spent about one fifth of his reign as king in Germany. A clause in the Act of Settlement that forbade the British monarch from leaving the country without Parliament's permission was unanimously repealed in 1716. During all but the first of the King's absences power was vested in a Regency Council rather than in his son, George Augustus, Prince of Wales.

Within a year of George's accession the Whigs won an overwhelming victory in the <a href="British%20general%20election%2C%201715">general election of 1715</a>. Several members of the defeated Tory Party sympathised with the <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobites</a>, who sought to replace George with Anne's Catholic half-brother, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a> (called "James III and VIII" by his supporters and "the Pretender" by his opponents). Some disgruntled Tories sided with <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201715">a Jacobite rebellion</a>, which became known as "The Fifteen". James's supporters, led by <a href="John%20Erskine%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mar%20%281675%E2%80%931732%29">Lord Mar</a>, an embittered Scottish nobleman who had previously served as a secretary of state, instigated rebellion in Scotland where support for Jacobitism was stronger than in England. "The Fifteen", however, was a dismal failure; Lord Mar's battle plans were poor, and James arrived late with too little money and too few arms. By the end of the year the rebellion had all but collapsed. In February 1716, faced with impending defeat, James and Lord Mar fled to France. After the rebellion was defeated, although there were some executions and forfeitures, George acted to moderate the Government's response, showed leniency, and spent the income from the forfeited estates on schools for Scotland and paying off part of the <a href="national%20debt">national debt</a>.

George's distrust of the Tories aided the passing of power to the Whigs. Whig dominance would grow to be so great under George that the Tories would not return to power for another half-century. After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the <a href="Septennial%20Act%201715">Septennial Act 1715</a>, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in power could remain in such a position for a greater period of time.

After his accession in Great Britain, George's relationship with his son (which had always been poor) worsened. George Augustus, Prince of Wales, encouraged opposition to his father's policies, including measures designed to increase religious freedom in Britain and expand Hanover's German territories at the expense of Sweden. In 1717 the birth of a grandson led to a major quarrel between George and the Prince of Wales. The King, supposedly following custom, appointed the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>, the <a href="Thomas%20Pelham-Holles%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Newcastle-upon-Tyne">Duke of Newcastle</a>, as one of the <a href="baptism">baptism</a>al sponsors of the child. The King was angered when the Prince of Wales, disliking Newcastle, verbally insulted the Duke at the christening, which the Duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. The Prince was told to leave the royal residence, <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Palace">St. James's Palace</a>. The Prince's new home, <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester House</a>, became a meeting place for the King's political opponents. George and his son were later reconciled at the insistence of <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a> and the desire of <a href="Caroline%20of%20Ansbach">the Princess of Wales</a>, who had moved out with her husband but missed her children who had been left in the care of the King. However, following the quarrel at the baptism, father and son were never again on cordial terms.

George was active in directing British foreign policy during his early reign. In 1717 he contributed to the creation of the <a href="Triple%20Alliance%20%281717%29">Triple Alliance</a>, an anti-Spanish league composed of Great Britain, France and the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>. In 1718 the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> was added to the body, which became known as the Quadruple Alliance. The subsequent <a href="War%20of%20the%20Quadruple%20Alliance">War of the Quadruple Alliance</a> involved the same issue as the War of the Spanish Succession. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a> (1713) had recognised the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, Philip, as the King of Spain on the condition that he gave up his rights to succeed to the French throne. Upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715, however, Philip sought to overturn the treaty.

Spain supported a Jacobite-led invasion of Scotland in 1719, but stormy seas allowed only about three hundred Spanish troops to arrive in Scotland. A base was established at <a href="Eilean%20Donan">Eilean Donan</a> Castle on the west Scottish coast in April, only to be destroyed by British ships a month later. Attempts by the Jacobites to recruit Scottish clansmen yielded a fighting force of only about a thousand men. The Jacobites were poorly equipped and were easily defeated by British <a href="artillery">artillery</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Glen%20Shiel">Battle of Glen Shiel</a>. The clansmen dispersed into the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highlands</a>, and the Spaniards surrendered. The invasion never posed any serious threat to George's government. With the French this time fighting against him in the War, Philip's armies fared poorly. As a result, the Spanish and French thrones remained separate. Simultaneously, Hanover gained from the resolution of the <a href="Great%20Northern%20War">Great Northern War</a>, which had been caused by rivalry between <a href="Swedish%20Empire">Sweden</a> and <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> for control of the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a>. The Swedish territories of <a href="Bremen-Verden">Bremen and Verden</a> were ceded to Hanover in 1719, with Hanover paying Sweden monetary compensation for the loss of territory.

In Hanover, the King was an <a href="absolute%20monarch">absolute monarch</a>. All government expenditure above 50 thalers (between 12 and 13 <a href="pound%20sterling">British pounds</a>), and the appointment of all army officers, all ministers, and even government officials above the level of copyist, was in his personal control. By contrast in Great Britain, George had to govern through Parliament.

In 1715 when the Whigs came to power, George's chief ministers included <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Sir Robert Walpole</a>, <a href="Charles%20Townshend%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Townshend">Lord Townshend</a> (Walpole's brother-in-law), <a href="James%20Stanhope%2C%201st%20Earl%20Stanhope">Lord Stanhope</a> and <a href="Charles%20Spencer%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Sunderland">Lord Sunderland</a>. In 1717 Lord Townshend was dismissed, and Walpole resigned from the Cabinet over disagreements with their colleagues; Lord Stanhope became supreme in foreign affairs, and Lord Sunderland the same in domestic matters.

Lord Sunderland's power began to wane in 1719. He introduced a Peerage Bill that attempted to limit the size of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> by restricting new creations. The measure would have solidified Sunderland's control of the House by preventing the creation of opposition peers, but it was defeated after Walpole led the opposition to the bill by delivering what was considered "the most brilliant speech of his career". Walpole and Townshend were reappointed as ministers the following year and a new, supposedly unified, Whig government formed.

Greater problems arose over financial speculation and the management of the national debt. Certain government bonds could not be redeemed without the consent of the bondholder and had been issued when interest rates were high; consequently each bond represented a long-term drain on public finances, as bonds were hardly ever redeemed. In 1719 the <a href="South%20Sea%20Company">South Sea Company</a> proposed to take over £31 million (three fifths) of the British national debt by exchanging government securities for stock in the company. The Company bribed Lord Sunderland, George's mistress <a href="Melusine%20von%20der%20Schulenburg">Melusine von der Schulenburg</a>, and Lord Stanhope's cousin, <a href="Charles%20Stanhope%20%281673%E2%80%931760%29">Charles Stanhope</a>, who was Secretary of the Treasury, to support their plan. The Company enticed bondholders to convert their high-interest, irredeemable bonds to low-interest, easily tradeable stocks by offering apparently preferential financial gains. Company prices rose rapidly; the shares had cost £128 on 1 January 1720, but were valued at £500 when the conversion scheme opened in May. On 24 June the price reached a peak of £1,050. The company's success led to the speculative flotation of other companies, some of a bogus nature, and the Government, in an attempt to suppress these schemes and with the support of the Company, passed the <a href="Bubble%20Act">Bubble Act</a>. With the rise in the market now halted, uncontrolled selling began in August, which caused the stock to plummet to £150 by the end of September. Many individuals—including aristocrats—lost vast sums and some were completely ruined. George, who had been in Hanover since June, returned to London in November—sooner than he wanted or was usual—at the request of the ministry.

The economic crisis, known as the South Sea Bubble, made George and his ministers extremely unpopular. In 1721 Lord Stanhope, though personally innocent, collapsed and died after a stressful debate in the House of Lords, and Lord Sunderland resigned from public office.

Sunderland, however, retained a degree of personal influence with George until his sudden death in 1722 allowed the rise of Sir Robert Walpole. Walpole became "de facto" <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, although the title was not formally applied to him (officially, he was <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Treasury">First Lord of the Treasury</a> and <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>). His management of the South Sea crisis, by rescheduling the debts and arranging some compensation, helped the return to financial stability. Through Walpole's skilful management of Parliament, George managed to avoid direct implication in the Company's fraudulent actions. Claims that George had received free stock as a bribe are not supported by evidence; indeed receipts in the <a href="Royal%20Archives">Royal Archives</a> show that he paid for his subscriptions and that he lost money in the crash.

As requested by Walpole, George revived the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Order of the Bath</a> in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by offering them the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers of his own choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Hanover%20%281725%29">Treaty of Hanover</a>, which was designed to counterbalance the Austro-Spanish <a href="Treaty%20of%20Vienna%20%281725%29">Treaty of Vienna</a> and protect British trade.

George, although increasingly reliant on Walpole, could still have replaced his ministers at will. Walpole was actually afraid of being removed from office towards the end of George I's reign, but such fears were put to an end when George died during his sixth trip to his native Hanover since his accession as king. He suffered a stroke on the road between <a href="Delden">Delden</a> and <a href="Nordhorn">Nordhorn</a> on 9 June 1727, and was taken by carriage to the Prince-Bishop's palace at Osnabrück where he died in the early hours before dawn on 11 June 1727. He was buried in the chapel of <a href="Leineschloss">Leine Palace</a> in Hanover, but his remains were moved to the chapel at <a href="Herrenhausen%20Gardens">Herrenhausen Gardens</a> after World War II. Leine Palace had burnt out entirely after <a href="Bombing%20of%20Hanover%20in%20World%20War%20II">British aerial bombings</a> and the king's remains, along with his parents', were moved to the 19th-century mausoleum of <a href="King%20Ernest%20Augustus">King Ernest Augustus</a> in the Berggarten.

George was succeeded by his son, George Augustus, who took the throne as <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II</a>. It was widely assumed, even by Walpole for a time, that George II planned to remove Walpole from office but was prevented from doing so by his wife, <a href="Caroline%20of%20Ansbach">Caroline of Ansbach</a>. However, Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II had little choice but to retain him or risk ministerial instability. In subsequent reigns the power of the prime minister increased further at the expense of the power of the sovereign.

George was ridiculed by his British subjects; some of his contemporaries, such as Lady <a href="Mary%20Wortley%20Montagu">Mary Wortley Montagu</a>, thought him unintelligent on the grounds that he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.

The British perceived him as too German, and in the opinion of historian <a href="Ragnhild%20Hatton">Ragnhild Hatton</a>, wrongly assumed that he had a succession of German mistresses. However, in mainland Europe, he was seen as a progressive ruler supportive of <a href="the%20Enlightenment">the Enlightenment</a> who permitted his critics to publish without risk of severe censorship, and provided sanctuary to <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> when the philosopher was exiled from Paris in 1726. European and British sources agree that George was reserved, temperate and financially prudent; George disliked to be in the public light at social events, avoided the royal box at the opera and often travelled incognito to the house of a friend to play cards. Despite some unpopularity, the Protestant George I was seen by most of his subjects as a better alternative to the Roman Catholic Pretender <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James</a>. <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a> indicates such ambivalent feelings as he wrote: 

Writers of the nineteenth century, such as Thackeray, <a href="Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a> and <a href="Philip%20Stanhope%2C%205th%20Earl%20Stanhope">Lord Mahon</a>, were reliant on biased first-hand accounts published in the previous century such as <a href="John%20Hervey%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Hervey">Lord Hervey's</a> memoirs, and looked back on the Jacobite cause with romantic, even sympathetic, eyes. They in turn, influenced British authors of the first half of the twentieth century such as <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>, who introduced further anti-German and anti-Protestant bias into the interpretation of George's reign. However, in the wake of World War II continental European archives were opened to historians of the later twentieth century and nationalistic anti-German feeling subsided. George's life and reign were re-explored by scholars such as Beattie and Hatton, and his character, abilities and motives re-assessed in a more generous light. <a href="John%20H.%20Plumb">John H. Plumb</a> noted that: 

Yet the character of George I remains elusive; he was in turn genial and affectionate in private letters to his daughter, and then dull and awkward in public. Perhaps his own mother summed him up when "explaining to those who regarded him as cold and overserious that he could be jolly, that he took things to heart, that he felt deeply and sincerely and was more sensitive than he cared to show." Whatever his true character, he ascended a precarious throne, and either by political wisdom and guile, or through accident and indifference, he left it secure in the hands of the Hanoverians and of Parliament.

243 Ida

Ida (; <a href="minor%20planet%20designation">minor planet designation</a>: 243 Ida) is an <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> in the <a href="Koronis%20family">Koronis family</a> of the <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>. It was discovered on 29 September 1884 by Austrian astronomer <a href="Johann%20Palisa">Johann Palisa</a> at <a href="Vienna%20Observatory">Vienna Observatory</a> and named after a nymph from Greek mythology. Later telescopic observations categorized Ida as an <a href="S-type%20asteroid">S-type asteroid</a>, the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt. On 28 August 1993, Ida was visited by the unmanned "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>" spacecraft while en route to <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. It was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite.

Ida's orbit lies between the planets <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and Jupiter, like all main-belt asteroids. Its orbital period is 4.84 years, and its rotation period is 4.63 hours. Ida has an average diameter of . It is irregularly shaped and elongated, apparently composed of two large objects connected together. Its surface is one of the most heavily cratered in the Solar System, featuring a wide variety of crater sizes and ages.

Ida's moon Dactyl was discovered by mission member Ann Harch in images returned from "Galileo". It was named after the <a href="Dactyl%20%28mythology%29">Dactyls</a>, creatures which inhabited Mount Ida in Greek mythology. Dactyl is only in diameter, about 1/20 the size of Ida. Its orbit around Ida could not be determined with much accuracy, but the constraints of possible orbits allowed a rough determination of Ida's density and revealed that it is depleted of metallic minerals. Dactyl and Ida share many characteristics, suggesting a common origin.

The images returned from "Galileo" and the subsequent measurement of Ida's mass provided new insights into the geology of S-type asteroids. Before the "Galileo" flyby, many different theories had been proposed to explain their mineral composition. Determining their composition permits a correlation between meteorites falling to the Earth and their origin in the asteroid belt. Data returned from the flyby pointed to S-type asteroids as the source for the <a href="ordinary%20chondrite">ordinary chondrite</a> meteorites, the most common type found on the Earth's surface.

Ida was discovered on 29 September 1884 by Austrian astronomer <a href="Johann%20Palisa">Johann Palisa</a> at the <a href="Vienna%20Observatory">Vienna Observatory</a>. It was his 45th asteroid discovery. Ida was <a href="List%20of%20minor%20planets%23Numbering%20and%20naming%20conventions">named</a> by <a href="Moriz%20von%20Kuffner">Moriz von Kuffner</a>, a Viennese brewer and amateur astronomer. In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, <a href="Idaea">Ida</a> was a nymph of <a href="Crete">Crete</a> who raised the god <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>. Ida was recognized as a member of the <a href="Koronis%20family">Koronis family</a> by <a href="Kiyotsugu%20Hirayama">Kiyotsugu Hirayama</a>, who proposed in 1918 that the group comprised the remnants of a destroyed precursor body.

Ida's <a href="Astronomical%20spectroscopy%23Planets%2C%20asteroids%2C%20and%20comets">reflection spectrum</a> was measured on 16 September 1980 by astronomers David J. Tholen and Edward F. Tedesco as part of the eight-color asteroid survey (ECAS). Its spectrum matched those of the asteroids in the S-type classification. Many observations of Ida were made in early 1993 by the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Observatory%20Flagstaff%20Station">US Naval Observatory in Flagstaff</a> and the <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20Observatory">Oak Ridge Observatory</a>. These improved the measurement of Ida's orbit around the Sun and reduced the uncertainty of its position during the "Galileo" flyby from .

Ida was visited in 1993 by the <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>-bound space probe "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>". Its encounters of the asteroids <a href="951%20Gaspra">Gaspra</a> and Ida were secondary to the Jupiter mission. These were selected as targets in response to a new NASA policy directing mission planners to consider asteroid flybys for all spacecraft crossing the belt. No prior missions had attempted such a flyby. "Galileo" was launched into orbit by the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis">Space Shuttle "Atlantis"</a> mission <a href="STS-34">STS-34</a> on 18 October 1989. Changing "Galileo's" trajectory to approach Ida required that it consume of <a href="propellant">propellant</a>. Mission planners delayed the decision to attempt a flyby until they were certain that this would leave the spacecraft enough propellant to complete its Jupiter mission.
"Galileo's" trajectory carried it into the asteroid belt twice on its way to Jupiter. During its second crossing, it flew by Ida on 28 August 1993 at a speed of relative to the asteroid. The onboard imager observed Ida from a distance of to its closest approach of . Ida was the second asteroid, after Gaspra, to be imaged by a spacecraft. About 95% of Ida's surface came into view of the probe during the flyby.

Transmission of many Ida images was delayed due to a permanent failure in the spacecraft's <a href="high-gain%20antenna">high-gain antenna</a>. The first five images were received in September 1993. These comprised a high-resolution <a href="Image%20stitching">mosaic</a> of the asteroid at a resolution of 31–38 m/<a href="pixel">pixel</a>. The remaining images were sent in February 1994, when the spacecraft's proximity to the Earth allowed higher speed transmissions.

The data returned from the "Galileo" flybys of Gaspra and Ida, and the later "<a href="NEAR%20Shoemaker">NEAR Shoemaker</a>" asteroid mission, permitted the first study of asteroid <a href="geology">geology</a>. Ida's relatively large surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features. The discovery of Ida's moon <a href="Dactyl%20%28moon%29%23Moon">Dactyl</a>, the first confirmed satellite of an asteroid, provided additional insights into Ida's composition.

Ida is classified as an <a href="S-type%20asteroid">S-type asteroid</a> based on ground-based <a href="Spectroscopy">spectroscopic measurements</a>. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the "Galileo" flybys, but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: <a href="ordinary%20chondrite">ordinary chondrite</a> (OC) and <a href="Meteorite%23Meteorite%20types">stony-iron</a>. Estimates of Ida's density are constrained to less than 3.2 g/cm by the long-term stability of Dactyl's orbit. This all but rules out a stony-iron composition; were Ida made of 5 g/cm iron- and nickel-rich material, it would have to contain more than 40% empty space.

The Galileo images also led to the discovery that space weathering was taking place on Ida, a process which causes older regions to become more red in color over time. The same process affects both Ida and its moon, although Dactyl shows a lesser change. The weathering of Ida's surface revealed another detail about its composition: the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of OC meteorites, but the older regions matched the spectra of S-type asteroids.
Both of these discoveries—the space weathering effects and the low density—led to a new understanding about the relationship between S-type asteroids and OC meteorites. S-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part of the asteroid belt. OC meteorites are, likewise, the most common type of meteorite found on the Earth's surface. The reflection spectra measured by remote observations of S-type asteroids, however, did not match that of OC meteorites. The "Galileo" flyby of Ida found that some S-types, particularly the Koronis family, could be the source of these meteorites.

Ida's mass is between 3.65 and 4.99 × 10 kg. Its <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a> produces an acceleration of about 0.3 to 1.1 cm/s over its surface. This field is so weak that an astronaut standing on its surface could leap from one end of Ida to the other, and an object moving in excess of could <a href="escape%20velocity">escape</a> the asteroid entirely.
Ida is a distinctly elongated asteroid, with an irregular surface. Ida is 2.35 times as long as it is wide, and a "waist" separates it into two geologically dissimilar halves. This constricted shape is consistent with Ida being made of two large, solid components, with loose <a href="debris">debris</a> filling the gap between them. However, no such debris was seen in high-resolution images captured by "Galileo". Although there are a few steep slopes tilting up to about 50° on Ida, the slope generally does not exceed 35°. Ida's irregular shape is responsible for the asteroid's very uneven gravitational field. The surface acceleration is lowest at the extremities because of their high rotational speed. It is also low near the "waist" because the mass of the asteroid is concentrated in the two halves, away from this location.
Ida's surface appears heavily <a href="Impact%20crater">cratered</a> and mostly gray, although minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida is covered by a thick layer of <a href="regolith">regolith</a>, loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called "<a href="ejecta%20block">ejecta block</a>s", several of which have been observed on the surface.

The surface of Ida is covered in a blanket of pulverized rock, called "<a href="regolith">regolith</a>", about thick. This material is produced in <a href="impact%20event">impact event</a>s and redistributed across Ida's surface by geological processes. "Galileo" observed evidence of recent <a href="Mass%20wasting">downslope regolith movement</a>.

Ida's regolith is composed of the <a href="silicate">silicate</a> minerals <a href="olivine">olivine</a> and <a href="pyroxene">pyroxene</a>. Its appearance changes over time through a process called <a href="space%20weathering">space weathering</a>. Because of this process, older regolith appears more red in color compared to freshly exposed material.
About 20 large (40–150 m across) ejecta blocks have been identified, embedded in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest pieces of the regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, but they may not have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra on the opposite side of the asteroid.

Several major structures mark Ida's surface. The asteroid appears to be split into two halves, here referred to as "region 1" and "region 2", connected by a "waist". This feature may have been filled in by debris, or blasted out of the asteroid by impacts.

Region 1 of Ida contains two major structures. One is a prominent ridge named "Townsend Dorsum" that stretches 150 degrees around Ida's surface. The other structure is a large indentation named "Vienna Regio".

Ida's region 2 features several sets of grooves, most of which are wide or less and up to long. They are located near, but are not connected with, the craters Mammoth, Lascaux, and Kartchner. Some grooves are related to major impact events, for example a set opposite Vienna Regio.

Ida is one of the most densely cratered bodies yet explored in the Solar System, and impacts have been the primary process shaping its surface. Cratering has reached the saturation point, meaning that new impacts erase evidence of old ones, leaving the total crater count roughly the same. It is covered with craters of all sizes and stages of degradation, and ranging in age from fresh to as old as Ida itself. The oldest may have been formed during the breakup of the <a href="Koronis%20family">Koronis family</a> parent body. The largest crater, Lascaux, is almost across. Region 2 contains nearly all of the craters larger than in diameter, but Region 1 has no large craters at all. Some craters are arranged in chains.

Ida's major craters are named after caves and <a href="lava%20tube">lava tube</a>s on Earth. The crater Azzurra, for example, is named after a submerged cave on the island of <a href="Capri">Capri</a>, also known as the "<a href="Blue%20Grotto%20%28Capri%29">Blue Grotto</a>". Azzurra seems to be the most recent major impact on Ida. The ejecta from this collision is distributed discontinuously over Ida and is responsible for the large-scale color and <a href="albedo">albedo</a> variations across its surface. An exception to the crater morphology is the fresh, asymmetric Fingal, which has a sharp boundary between the floor and wall on one side. Another significant crater is Afon, which marks Ida's <a href="prime%20meridian">prime meridian</a>.

The craters are simple in structure: bowl-shaped with no flat bottoms and no central peaks. They are distributed evenly around Ida, except for a protrusion north of crater Choukoutien which is smoother and less cratered. The <a href="ejecta">ejecta</a> excavated by impacts is deposited differently on Ida than on planets because of its rapid rotation, low gravity and irregular shape. <a href="Ejecta%20blanket">Ejecta blanket</a>s settle asymmetrically around their craters, but fast-moving ejecta that escapes from the asteroid is permanently lost.

Ida was classified as an <a href="S-type%20asteroid">S-type asteroid</a> based on the similarity of its reflectance spectra with similar asteroids. S-types may share their composition with stony-iron or <a href="ordinary%20chondrite">ordinary chondrite</a> (OC) meteorites. The composition of the interior has not been directly analyzed, but is assumed to be similar to OC material based on observed surface color changes and Ida's <a href="bulk%20density">bulk density</a> of 2.27–3.10 g/cm. OC meteorites contain varying amounts of the silicates <a href="olivine">olivine</a> and <a href="pyroxene">pyroxene</a>, <a href="iron">iron</a>, and <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a>. Olivine and pyroxene were detected on Ida by "Galileo". The mineral content appears to be homogeneous throughout its extent. "Galileo" found minimal variations on the surface, and the asteroid's spin indicates a consistent density. Assuming that its composition is similar to OC meteorites, which range in density from 3.48 to 3.64 g/cm, Ida would have a <a href="porosity">porosity</a> of 11–42%.

Ida's interior probably contains some amount of impact-fractured rock, called "<a href="megaregolith">megaregolith</a>". The megaregolith layer of Ida extends between hundreds of meters below the surface to a few kilometers. Some rock in Ida's core may have been fractured below the large craters Mammoth, Lascaux, and Undara.

Ida is a member of the <a href="Koronis%20family">Koronis family</a> of <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid-belt</a> asteroids. Ida orbits the Sun at an average distance of , between the orbits of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. Ida takes 4.84089 years to complete one orbit.

Ida's <a href="rotation%20period">rotation period</a> is 4.63 hours, making it one of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a> of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis of rotation <a href="Precession%20%28astronomy%29">precesses</a> with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.

Ida originated in the breakup of the roughly diameter Koronis parent body. The progenitor asteroid had partially differentiated, with heavier metals migrating to the core. Ida carried away insignificant amounts of this core material. It is uncertain how long ago the disruption event occurred. According to an analysis of Ida's cratering processes, its surface is more than a billion years old. However, this is inconsistent with the estimated age of the Ida–Dactyl system of less than 100 million years; it is unlikely that Dactyl, due to its small size, could have escaped being destroyed in a major collision for longer. The difference in age estimates may be explained by an increased rate of cratering from the debris of the Koronis parent body's destruction.

Ida has a <a href="Asteroid%20moon">moon</a> named Dactyl, official designation (243) Ida I Dactyl ( ). It was discovered in images taken by the "Galileo" spacecraft during its flyby in 1993. These images provided the first direct confirmation of an asteroid moon. At the time, it was separated from Ida by a distance of , moving in a <a href="prograde%20orbit">prograde orbit</a>. Dactyl is heavily cratered, like Ida, and consists of similar materials. Its origin is uncertain, but evidence from the flyby suggests that it originated as a fragment of the Koronis parent body.

Dactyl was found on 17 February 1994 by "Galileo" mission member Ann Harch, while examining delayed image downloads from the spacecraft. "Galileo" recorded 47 images of Dactyl over an observation period of 5.5 hours in August 1993. The spacecraft was from Ida and from Dactyl when the first image of the moon was captured, 14 minutes before "Galileo" made its closest approach.

Dactyl was initially <a href="Astronomical%20naming%20conventions%23Natural%20satellites%20of%20planets">designated</a> 1993 (243) 1. It was named by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1994, for the mythological <a href="Dactyl%20%28mythology%29">dactyls</a> who inhabited <a href="Mount%20Ida%2C%20Crete">Mount Ida</a> on the island of Crete.

Dactyl is an "egg-shaped" but "remarkably spherical" object measuring 1.6 by 1.4 by 1.2 kilometres (0.99 mi × 0.87 mi × 0.75 mi). It was oriented with its longest axis pointing towards Ida. Like Ida, Dactyl's surface exhibits saturation cratering. It is marked by more than a dozen craters with a diameter greater than , indicating that the moon has suffered many collisions during its history. At least six craters form a linear chain, suggesting that it was caused by locally produced debris, possibly ejected from Ida. Dactyl's craters may contain central peaks, unlike those found on Ida. These features, and Dactyl's <a href="spheroid">spheroid</a>al shape, imply that the moon is gravitationally controlled despite its small size. Like Ida, its average temperature is about .

Dactyl shares many characteristics with Ida. Their <a href="albedo">albedo</a>s and reflection <a href="Spectrum">spectra</a> are very similar. The small differences indicate that the space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of <a href="regolith">regolith</a> impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.

The two largest imaged craters on Dactyl were named Acmon and Celmis, after two of the mythological dactyls. Acmon is the largest crater in the above image, and Celmis is near the bottom, mostly obscured in shadow. The craters are 300 and 200 meters in diameter, respectively.

Dactyl's orbit around Ida is not precisely known. "Galileo" was in the <a href="Orbital%20plane%20%28astronomy%29">plane</a> of Dactyl's orbit when most of the images were taken, which made determining its exact orbit difficult. Dactyl orbits in the <a href="direct%20motion">prograde</a> direction and is inclined about 8° to Ida's equator. Based on computer simulations, Dactyl's <a href="pericenter">pericenter</a> must be more than about from Ida for it to remain in a stable orbit. The range of orbits generated by the simulations was narrowed down by the necessity of having the orbits pass through points at which "Galileo" observed Dactyl to be at 16:52:05 UT on 28 August 1993, about from Ida at longitude 85°. On 26 April 1994, the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> observed Ida for eight hours and was unable to spot Dactyl. It would have been able to observe it if it were more than about from Ida.

If in a circular orbit at the distance at which it was seen, Dactyl's orbital period would be about 20 hours. Its orbital speed is roughly , "about the speed of a fast run or a slowly thrown baseball".

Dactyl may have originated at the same time as Ida, from the disruption of the Koronis parent body. However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced its size.
