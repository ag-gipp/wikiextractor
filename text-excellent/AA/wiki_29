Battle of Rossbach

The Battle of Rossbach took place on 5 November 1757 during the <a href="Third%20Silesian%20War">Third Silesian War</a> (1756–1763, part of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>) near the village of <a href="Ro%C3%9Fbach%20%28Braunsbedra%29">Rossbach</a> (Roßbach), in the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Saxony">Electorate of Saxony</a>. It is sometimes called the Battle of, or at, <a href="Reichardtswerben">Reichardtswerben</a>, after a different nearby town. In this 90-minute battle, <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a>, king in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>, defeated an Allied army composed of <a href="Early%20modern%20France">French</a> forces augmented by a contingent of the <a href="Reichsarmee">Reichsarmee</a> (Imperial Army) of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. The French and Imperial army included almost 42,000 men, opposing a considerably smaller Prussian force of 22,000. Despite overwhelming odds, Frederick employed rapid movement, a <a href="flanking%20maneuver">flanking maneuver</a> and <a href="oblique%20order">oblique order</a> to achieve complete surprise.

The Battle of Rossbach marked a turning point in the Seven Years' War, not only for its stunning Prussian victory, but because France refused to send troops against Prussia again and Britain, noting Prussia's military success, increased its financial support for Frederick. Following the battle, Frederick immediately left Rossbach and marched for 13 days to the outskirts of <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a>. There he met the Austrian army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leuthen">Battle of Leuthen</a>; he employed similar tactics to again defeat an army considerably larger than his own.

Rossbach is considered one of Frederick's greatest strategic masterpieces. He crippled an enemy army twice the size of the Prussian force while suffering negligible casualties. His artillery also played a critical role in the victory, based on its ability to reposition itself rapidly responding to changing circumstances on the battlefield. Finally, his cavalry contributed decisively to the outcome of the battle, justifying his investment of resources into its training during the eight-year interim between the conclusion of the <a href="War%20of%20Austrian%20Succession">War of Austrian Succession</a> and the outbreak of the Seven Years' War.

Although the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> was a global conflict, it took a specific intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a> (1740–1748). The 1748 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281748%29">Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</a> concluded the earlier war in which Prussia and Austria were a part; its influence among the European powers was little better than a truce. <a href="Frederick%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20Prussia">Frederick II of Prussia</a>, known as Frederick the Great, acquired the prosperous province of <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>, but had wanted much of the Saxon territories as well. Empress <a href="Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Austria">Maria Theresa of Austria</a> had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. By 1754, escalating tensions between Britain and France in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> offered the Empress the opportunity to regain her lost Central European territories and to limit Prussia's growing power. Similarly, France sought to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. France and Austria put aside their old <a href="French%E2%80%93Habsburg%20relations">rivalry</a> to form a coalition of their own. Faced with this sudden turn of events, the British king, <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II</a>, aligned himself with his nephew, Frederick, and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>; this alliance drew in not only the British king's territories held in <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a>, including Hanover, but also those of his and Frederick's relatives in the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a> and the <a href="Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel</a>. This series of political maneuvers became known as the <a href="Diplomatic%20Revolution">Diplomatic Revolution</a>.

At the start of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four musket volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five; his army could march a day, and was able to conduct, under fire, some of the most complex maneuvers known. After overrunning <a href="Duchy%20of%20Saxony">Saxony</a>, Frederick campaigned in <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> and defeated the Austrians on 6 May 1757 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Prague%20%281757%29">Battle of Prague</a>. He was initially successful, but after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kol%C3%ADn">Battle of Kolín</a>, everything went awry: what had started as a war of movement by Frederick's agile army turned into a <a href="war%20of%20attrition">war of attrition</a>.

By summer 1757, Prussia was threatened on two fronts. In the east, the Russians, under Field Marshal <a href="Stepan%20Fyodorovich%20Apraksin">Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin</a>, besieged <a href="Klaip%C4%97da">Memel</a> with 75,000 troops. Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia, but after five days of artillery bombardment, the Russian army successfully stormed it. The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a> and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested <a href="Battle%20of%20Gross-J%C3%A4gersdorf">Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf</a> on 30 August 1757. However, the Russians were unable to take <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>, the capital of East Prussia, after using up their supplies of cannonballs at Memel and Gross-Jägersdorf, and retreated soon afterward. The logistics of supplying a large army remained a problem for the Russians throughout the war. Although previous experiences in <a href="Russo-Turkish%20Wars">wars with the Ottoman Empire</a> had exposed these problems, the Russians had not solved the challenge of supplying their army at a distance from Moscow. Even so, the Imperial Russian Army offered a new threat to Prussia, forcing Frederick to abandon his invasion of Bohemia and to withdraw further into Prussian territory.

In Saxony and <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>, the Austrian forces slowly reclaimed territory held by Frederick earlier in the year. In September, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moys">Battle of Moys</a>, <a href="Prince%20Charles%20Alexander%20of%20Lorraine">Prince Charles</a>'s <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austrian</a>s defeated the Prussians commanded by <a href="Hans%20Karl%20von%20Winterfeldt">Hans Karl von Winterfeldt</a>, one of Frederick's most trusted generals, who was killed in the battle. As summer ended, a combined force of French and the "<a href="Reichsarmee">Reichsarmee</a>" (Imperial Army) troops, approaching from the west, intended to unite with Prince Charles's main Austrian force, which itself advanced west to <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a>. <a href="Charles%20de%20Rohan%2C%20prince%20de%20Soubise">Prince Soubise</a> and <a href="Prince%20Joseph%20of%20Saxe-Hildburghausen">Prince Joseph of Saxe-Hildburghausen</a> shared command of the Allied force.

If these armies were to unite, Prussia's situation would be dire indeed. Recognizing this threat, Frederick used the strategy of <a href="interior%20lines">interior lines</a> to advance in a quick, arduous march reminiscent of the forced marches of his great grandfather, <a href="Frederick%20William%20I%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Frederick William I</a>, the "Great Elector". An army only marches as fast as its slowest components, which are usually the supply trains, and Frederick obtained needed supplies ahead of the army, which enabled him to abandon his supply wagons. His army covered in only 13 days. Bringing his enemy to battle proved difficult, as the Allies flitted out of his reach. Both Frederick and his enemies moved back and forth for several days, trying to maneuver around each other but ending up in a stalemate. During this time, an Austrian raiding party <a href="1757%20Berlin%20raid">attacked Berlin</a> and almost captured the Prussian royal family.

The story of the Battle of Rossbach is as much the story of the five days of maneuver leading to the battle as it is those famous 90 minutes of battle, and the maneuvers were shaped by the terrain. Initial activity focused on the village of <a href="Weissenfels">Weissenfels</a>, where the middle <a href="Saale">Saale</a> emerges from the <a href="Buntsandstein">Buntsandstein</a> of the <a href="Thuringian%20Basin">Thuringian Basin</a> in the Leipzig highlands, not far from the modern-day <a href="Bundesautobahn%209">A9 highway</a>; the locale lies from the town of <a href="Saale">Saale</a> and southwest of <a href="Jena">Jena</a>. Parts of the valley between Leipzig and Saale were relatively narrow, cut by the river and its tributaries; the hillsides were steep, and there were limited river crossings; this influenced the troop movements leading to the battle, as the various armies competed for sites to cross the river.

The scene of the battle, <a href="Ro%C3%9Fbach%20%28Braunsbedra%29">Rossbach</a>, lay southwest of <a href="Merseburg">Merseburg</a> on a wide plateau dotted by hillocks with elevations up to . The locale was a wide plain largely without trees or hedges. The ground was sandy in some areas, and marshy in others; a small stream ran between Rossbach and Merseburg, south of which rose two low hills, the Janus and the Pölzen. <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a> later described these as unimpressive, although certainly horses dragging cannons would notice them, as the animals slipped in loose stones and sand. To the west, the Saale flowed past a small town of Weissenfels, a few miles southeast of Rossbach.

On 24 October, the Prussian Field Marshal <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Keith">James Keith</a> was in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> when the Imperial Army occupied Weissenfels. Frederick joined him there two days later. Over the next couple of days, the King's brother, <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281726%E2%80%931802%29">Prince Henry</a>, arrived with the main body of the army and his brother-in-law, <a href="Duke%20Ferdinand%20of%20Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a>, arrived from <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a>. <a href="Prince%20Moritz%20of%20Anhalt-Dessau">Prince Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau</a> arrived by 28 October; although his men had marched up to in a day, they were still eager to face the Allied forces. The Allies had established a post close to Markranstädt, and maintained some line of control along the Saale river. This gave Prussia a complement of 22,000 men. On 30 October, the King led the army out of Leipzig, toward <a href="L%C3%BCtzen">Lützen</a>, with Colonel <a href="Johann%20von%20Mayr">Johann von Mayr</a> and his "<a href="Freibatallion">Freibatallion</a>", an independent unit of 1500 mixed troops, in the lead to flush out Allied pickets and reconnaissance parties; this cleared the way for the main army. The next day, Frederick moved out of Lützen at 3:00 pm, during heavy rain. Despite the weather, the <a href="Sz%C3%A9chenyi%20Hussars">Széchenyi Hussars</a> harassed their line of march but, in the hussars' eagerness to annoy the Prussians, they forgot to send a messenger to Weissenfels to warn the garrison of the Prussian approach. When Mayr appeared at about 8:00 a.m. on the 31st, followed by the King and the rest of his army, the French were completely surprised. The force there consisted of four battalions and 18 companies of grenadiers, all but three of them French: 5,000 men under command of <a href="Louis%20des%20Balbes%20de%20Berton%20de%20Crillon%2C%20duc%20de%20Mahon">Louis, Duke de Crillon</a>.

Crillon closed up the town and prepared for action. The Prussians unlimbered their artillery and fired on the town gates; Mayr's men and the Prussian grenadiers knocked out the obstructions. A few precise hits cleared their way into the town and the Allied resistance disappeared in cannon smoke; the Allied troops rapidly withdrew from the town across the bridge over the Saale and, as they withdrew, they set fire to the bridge to prevent the Prussians from following them. A conflagration consumed the wooden bridge so rapidly that 630 men, most of the garrison, were trapped on the wrong side. They surrendered with their arms and equipment. Saxe-Hildburghausen, at <a href="Burgwerben">Burgwerben</a>, ordered a barrage laid down across the Saale to prevent the Prussians from repairing the bridge. Frederick's gunners responded in kind and the two shelled each other until about 3:00 pm.

While the artilleries kept up their noisy exchange, holding the Duke's attention, Frederick sent scouts to find a decent crossing of the Saale, since the one at Weissenfels was not usable. There was little he could do at the burned bridge; to cross the river under Saxe-Hildburghausen's nose, in the face of fire, would have been foolish. Across the river, the Allies had a physical barrier to protect them; they could also use their position to watch Frederick's movement. Inexplicably, though, Saxe-Hildburghausen gave up this advantage and retired toward Burgweben and <a href="Tagewerben">Tagewerben</a>, counting on the intervening hills to protect him. Soubise had advanced from Reichardswerben through Kaynau, and they met up at Gross Körbetha. Their advanced guard patrolled Merseburg, and sought some information from the local inhabitants. Although the local Saxon peasants might have disliked the Prussians, they disliked the French and Austrians more, and they gave up little information. Neither Saxe-Hildburghausen nor Soubise had an idea what Frederick intended, or indeed, what he was doing. Marshal Keith reached Merseburg and found the bridge there destroyed, with the Austrians and French prepared to hold the other side of the river. By the night of 3 November, Frederick's engineers finished their new bridges and the entire Prussian line advanced across the Saale. As soon as Frederick had crossed the river, he sent 1,500 cavalry under the command of <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Seydlitz">Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz</a> to raid the Allied camp. He planned to attack it the next day, but the surprise raid frightened Soubise into moving during the night to a more secure position. On 4 November, Frederick moved to his camp at Rossbach.

On the Allied side, the officers, both French and Austrian, were frustrated by their superiors' timidity. Clearly, Frederick's position was precarious, and the Prussians were outnumbered. One officer, <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Bourcet">Pierre-Joseph Bourcet</a>, convinced Soubise that they should attack Frederick in the morning, by swinging to Frederick's left flank and cutting his line of retreat. This would, Bourcet thought, finish the campaign. After some persuasion Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen were convinced and everyone went to sleep. In the morning of 5 November, some of the Allied troops went out to forage, and Soubise received a notice from Saxe-Hildburghausen, something to the effect of not a moment to be lost, we should advance, gain the heights and attack from the side. Until that point, Soubise had done nothing to rouse the French troops to action.

On the morning of 5 November 1757 the Prussian camp lay between Rossbach on the left and the village of <a href="Bedra">Bedra</a> on the right, facing the Allies. Charles, the Prince Soubise, commanding the French, and the Prince Saxe-Hildburghausen, commanding the Holy Roman Empire's forces, had maneuvered in the preceding days without giving Frederick an opportunity to begin fighting. Their forces were located to the west, with their right flank near the town of <a href="Branderoda">Branderoda</a> and their left at <a href="M%C3%BCcheln">Mücheln</a>. The advanced posts of the Prussians stood in villages immediately west of their camp, those of the Allies on the Schortau hill and the Galgenberg.

The Allies possessed a numerical superiority of two to one, and their advanced post, commanded by <a href="Claude%20Louis%2C%20Comte%20de%20Saint-Germain">Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain</a>, overlooked all parts of Frederick's camp. The French and Habsburg Imperial ("Reichsarmee") troops consisted of 62 battalions (31,000 infantry), 84 squadrons (10,000) of cavalry, and 109 artillery, totaling some 41–42,000 men, under Soubise's and Saxe-Hildburghausen's command. The Allies had taken the lead in the maneuvers of the previous days, and Hildburghausen decided to take the offensive. He had some difficulty inducing Soubise to risk a battle, so the Allies did not begin to move from their campground until after eleven a.m. on 5 November. Soubise probably intended to engage as late in the day as possible, with the idea of gaining what advantages he could in a partial action before nightfall. Their plan called for the Allied army to march by <a href="Zeuchfeld">Zeuchfeld</a>, around Frederick's left, which no serious natural obstacle covered, and to deploy in battle array facing north, between Reichardtswerben on the right and <a href="Pettst%C3%A4dt">Pettstädt</a> on the left. Saxe-Hildburghausen's proposed battle and the more limited aim of Soubise appeared equally likely to succeed by taking this position, which threatened to cut Frederick off from a retreat to the towns on the Saale. The Allies could only attain this position by marching around the Prussian flank, which could put them in the tenuous position of marching across their enemies' front. Consequently, the Allies posted a sizable guard against the obvious risk of interference on their exposed flank.

On the other side, Frederick commanded 27 battalions of infantry (17,000 men) and 43 squadrons of cavalry (5,000 horse), plus 72 companies of artillery, for a total of 22,000 men. He also had several of the siege guns from Leipzig, which arrived late in the morning. He spent the morning watching the French from the Goldacker manor rooftop in Rossbach. The initial stages of Allied movement convinced him that the Allies had started retreating southward towards their magazines; he sent out patrols to learn from the peasants what could be gleaned. They reported back that Soubise had taken the Weissenfels road; it led not only to that village, but also toward Freiburg, where Soubise could find supplies, or to Merseburg, where they would cut the Prussians off from the Saale. At about noon Frederick went to dinner, leaving the young <a href="captain">captain</a> <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Gaudi">Friedrich Wilhelm von Gaudi</a> to observe French movements. Two hours later, his watch captain reported the French approaching. Although Gaudi's excited report at first appeared to confirm a French-Austrian retreat, Frederick observed that Allied columns, which from time to time became visible in the undulations of the ground, appeared to turn eastwards from Zeuchfeld. When Frederick saw for himself that hostile cavalry and infantry were already approaching Pettstädt, he realized his enemy's intentions: to attack him in the flank and rear, and break his communications line, if not crush him completely. They now offered him the battle for which he had maneuvered in vain, and he accepted it without hesitation.

Frederick realized the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00 pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded their tents and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry and moved toward the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except for a few moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel <a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20von%20Moller">Karl Friedrich von Moller</a>'s battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.

Although aware of some of these movements, Soubise thought the Prussians were in full retreat. He ordered his advanced guard to hasten toward the Janus hill, but he issued no instructions on where, how and when to deploy. The Allied infantry moved in three long columns: at the head were the French regiments of Piedmont and Mailly, and on the flanks and in front of the right column were two regiments of Austrian cuirassiers and the Imperial cavalry. Ten French squadrons remained in reserve and twelve others protected the left flank. Soubise, who undoubtedly knew better, ordered no ground reconnaissance and sent no advanced guard. His army marched blindly into Frederick's clutches.

When the Prussians broke camp, they left a handful of light troops to demonstrate before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint Germain. These light troops constituted the flank guard on the Schartau hill, which lay at right angles to the Janus and Pölzen. Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as fast as the Allies' army. If, at the moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.

The Allies marched in normal order in two main columns, the first line on the left, the second line on the right; farther to the right, though, marched a column consisting of the foot reserve, and between the first and second lines trundled the reserve artillery. The right wing cavalry advanced at the head and the left wing cavalry at the tail of the two main columns. Noting some Prussian movement, Soubise ordered a wheeling pivot to the east, a complicated maneuver under parade-ground conditions, and difficult in the field, with troops unfamiliar with each other, on uneven terrain. At first, the columns retained regulation distance, wheeling eastward toward Zeuchfeld, but then part of the reserve infantry moved between the two main columns, hampering the movements of the reserve artillery. In addition, the troops on the outer flank of the wheel found themselves unable to keep up with the overly rapid movement of the inner pivot.

Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen ignored the confusion as their own troops struggled in the wheeling pivot. From their vantage point, it appeared to the Allied commanders that the Prussians were moving eastward; Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen presumed that the Prussians were about to retreat in order to avoid being taken in their flank and rear. The Allied generals hurried the march, sending on the leading (right wing) cavalry towards Reichardtswerben. They also called up part of the left wing cavalry from the tail of the column and even the flank guard cavalry to take part in what they presumed would be the general chase. Any semblance of the wheeling pivot was lost in these fresh maneuvers, and the remaining columns lost all cohesion and order.

Moller's artillery on Janus hill again opened fire on this confusion of men and horses at 3:15 pm. When they came under the fire of Moller's guns, the Allied cavalry, which now lay north of Reichardtswerben and well ahead of their own infantry, suffered from the barrage, but the commanders were not particularly concerned about the display of cannon fire. It was usual to employ heavy guns to protect a retreat, so the Allies assured themselves that Frederick was retreating and contented themselves with bringing some of their field guns into action. The cavalry hurried to get themselves out of range, but this further disorganized the Allied infantry lines, and caused any remaining unit cohesion to break down.

Unseen by the Allies, Seydlitz assembled his cavalry into two lines, one of 20 squadrons and the second of 18, and reduced the speed of his approach until they reached the screening ridge of the Pölzen hill. There, they waited. Seydlitz sat at the head of the lines, calmly smoking his pipe. When the Allied cavalry came within striking distance, 1000 paces from the crest of the ridge, he tossed his pipe in the air: this was the signal to charge. At 3:30 pm, Seydlitz crested the hill and his first 20 squadrons descended on the Allied army; the leading Allied cuirassiers managed to deploy to meet Seydlitz's squadrons, but the momentum of the Prussian attack penetrated the Allied lines and wrought havoc among the disorganized mass. Prussian cavalry rode flank to flank; their training had taught them to form a line three and four deep from a column without breaking pace; once formed into a line, the troopers rode with knees touching, the horses' flanks touching, and horses riding tail to nose. Any attack of Prussian cavalry on open ground meant a line of horses—big Trakehners —bearing down on infantry or cavalry columns, lines, or squares. The horsemen could maneuver at a full gallop, to the left or right, or in an oblique.

The fighting soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, receiving a severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still waiting at the Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The "mêlée" drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring to catch up with the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but the sweep of horses and Allied infantry pulled them into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in <a href="Echelon%20formation">echelon</a> from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.

Seydlitz recalled his cavalry. This in itself was unusual: normally, a cavalry attacked once, maybe twice, and spent the rest of the battle chasing fleeing troops. Seydlitz led his rallied force toward the flank and rear of the Allied army, about out of the fighting and into a <a href="Coppicing">copse</a> of trees between Reichertsweben and Obschutz. There horses and men could catch their breath. The Allies, relieved to see the last of the horsemen, became preoccupied with the Prussian infantry, about four battalions of it, threatening in linear formation to their left. Instead of forming into a similar line of attack, though, the Allied battalions formed into columns, fixed their bayonets and marched forward, prepared for a <a href="Bayonet%23Bayonet%20Charge">charge</a>.

As the Allies advanced, not yet in bayonet range, they came within range of Prince Henry's infantry; disciplined Prussian volleys shredded the orderly Allied columns. Then Moller's artillery, reinforced by siege guns from Leipzig, tore some additional gaps. The leading ranks faltered; the following ranks crowded into them, goaded on by their officers. Prince Henry's infantry advanced, still firing. Finally, seemingly out of nowhere, Seydlitz brought his cavalry in a flanking attack, this time all 38 squadrons in a massed attack; their sudden and energetic appearance at the flank and rear caused havoc and despair among the already demoralized "Reichsarmee" units assembled there. Three regiments of <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>n Imperial troops threw aside their muskets and ran, and the French ran with them. Seydlitz's troopers pursued and cut down the fleeing Allies until darkness made the chase impossible.

The battle had lasted less than 90 minutes and the last episode of the infantry fight no more than fifteen minutes. Only seven Prussian battalions had engaged with the enemy, and these had expended five to fifteen rounds per man.

Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen, who had been wounded, succeeded in keeping one or two regiments together, but the rest scattered over the countryside. The French and Imperial troops lost six generals, an unusually high count in eighteenth century warfare, although not surprising given the emphasis on cavalry action in this battle. Among the French and German Imperial troops, the Austrian demographer <a href="Gaston%20Bodart">Gaston Bodart</a> counted 1,000 dead (including six generals) and approximately 3,500 wounded (including four generals), for a total of 8.3% wounded or dead, and 12.2% (approximately 5,000) missing or captured. Other historians might place the numbers of captured higher, at almost one third, or about 13,800. The Prussians took as trophies 72 cannons (62% of the Allied artillery), seven flags, and 21 standards. The Prussians captured eight French generals and 260 officers.

Prussian losses are more controversial: Frederick boasted of negligible casualties. In his thorough study of regimental histories, Bodart counted 169–170 Prussian dead (including seven officers), and 430 wounded (including Prince Henry, Seydlitz and two other generals, and 19 officers), or about 2.4% of the total Prussian force; these casualties amount to less than 10% of the engaged Prussian force. Other recent sources agree that the Prussians lost as few as 300 and as many as 500 among the wounded. In an assessment of surviving regimental records, modern sources place Prussian losses at even fewer than Bodart did: one colonel was killed, plus two other officers, and 67 soldiers.

Soubise has historically taken the blame for the loss, but this may be an unfair assessment. While he did owe his rank to his good relationship with <a href="Madame%20de%20Pompadour">Madame de Pompadour</a>, the <a href="ma%C3%AEtresse-en-titre">mistress</a> of King <a href="Louis%20XV">Louis XV</a>, he was neither blessed with extraordinary military acumen nor with the best troops: he could do nothing about the former, and most of the latter were with <a href="Louis%20Charles%20C%C3%A9sar%20Le%20Tellier">Louis Charles César Le Tellier</a>, fighting in the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>. Under Soubise's command, the French had conducted a notorious march across Germany, characterized by persistent pillaging. His army also had approximately 12,000 civilian camp followers. There were chefs, hair dressers, <a href="wig">perruquiers</a>, barbers, wives and mistresses, pastry chefs, tailors and clothiers of all kinds, saddle makers, bridle makers, grooms, and servants of all varieties who served the nobility. In addition, the army had its usual motley crew of farriers, grooms, veterinarians, surgeons, and cooks that sustained an army on the march. After the battle, the Comte de Saint Germain, who had commanded the advanced guard and also the rear guard that struggled to keep up with the fleeing army, complained that the troops in his charge had been defective, a gang of robbers, murders, and cowards who ran at the sound of a gunshot.

The Imperial army, although smaller, was not much better, and certainly not the battle-hardened army the Prussians had faced at Kolin. This was the "Reichsarmee", an army consisting of units sent by the constituent members of the Holy Roman Empire. Their commander had reported that they were defective in training, administration, armaments, discipline and leadership. The same might be said of their commander, Saxe-Hildburghausen, an indolent and slow-moving man. The Imperial regimental officers often lacked even basic garrison training. These units had little experience working together, much less fighting together, a problem that expressed itself most evidently in the disastrous wheeling pivot. Furthermore, the "Reichsarmee" contingents came from many principalities, some of which were Protestant, and many of which were unhappy about any alliance with the French; most were more adverse to the French than they were to the Prussians. Once news of the battle's uneven resolution spread, some Germans felt satisfaction; the battle could be seen as retribution for the years of suffering under the French atrocities in the Rhineland and <a href="Electoral%20Palatinate">Palatinate</a> during the <a href="Palatinate%20campaign">Palatinate campaign</a> and the subsequent <a href="Nine%20Years%27%20War">invasions</a> and <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">occupation</a> of <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a>. Mostly, though, Rossbach was significant for the strengthening of Prussia's relationship with Frederick's uncle, King George, and George's <a href="British%20people%23Union%20of%20Scotland%20and%20England">other subjects</a>. The British could now see the advantage of keeping the French occupied on the Continent while they continued their expansion in North America.

While Frederick was engaging the combined Allied forces further west, that autumn the Austrians had slowly retaken Silesia: Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine had captured the city of <a href="Schweidnitz">Schweidnitz</a> and moved on Breslau in lower Silesia. While heading back to Silesia, Frederick learned of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Breslau%20%281757%29">fall</a> of Breslau (22 November). He and his 22,000 men reversed tracks, and covered from Rossbach to <a href="Lutynia%2C%20%C5%9Aroda%20%C5%9Al%C4%85ska%20County">Leuthen</a> (now Lutynia, Poland), west of Breslau in 12 days. On the way, at <a href="Liegnitz">Liegnitz</a>, they joined with the Prussian troops who had survived the fighting at Breslau. The augmented army of about 33,000 troops arrived at Leuthen to find 66,000 Austrians in possession. Despite his troops' exhaustion from the rapid march from Rossbach, Frederick won yet another decisive victory at Leuthen.

After the battle, Frederick reportedly said: "I won the battle of Rossbach with most of my infantry having their muskets shouldered." This is indeed true: less than five percent of his entire force had been engaged. Frederick had discovered the use of operational maneuvers and with a fraction of his entire force—3,500 horsemen, 18 artillery pieces, and three battalions of infantry—had defeated an army of two of the strongest European powers. Frederick's tactics at Rossbach became a landmark in the history of the <a href="Military%20art%20%28military%20science%29">military arts</a>.
Rossbach also highlighted the extraordinary talents of two of Frederick's officers, the artillery colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller and his cavalry general, Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz. Both men possessed the much coveted "<a href="coup%20d%27%C5%93il">coup d'œil</a> militaire", the ability to see at a glance what must be done to tactical advantage. This attribute allowed them to use the artillery and cavalry to full potential. Frederick himself called this "[T]he perfection of that art to learn at one just and determined view the benefits and disadvantages of a country where posts are to be placed and how to act upon the annoyance of the enemy. This is, in a word, the true meaning of a "coup d'œil", without which an officer may commit errors of the greatest consequence." On the morning of the battle Frederick had passed over two senior generals and placed Seydlitz in command of the whole of his cavalry, much to those men's annoyance and to Seydlitz' satisfaction. Seydlitz had spent the interim of the peace (1748–1756) training the cavalry to perform at optimum speed and force. The other outstanding officer, Colonel Moller, had invested the interim in developing a highly mobile artillery force. His artillery engineers were trained similarly to <a href="Dragoon">dragoons</a>, to ride to a battle and fight dismounted; in the case of the artillery, they dragged their guns around the battlefield as needed. This was not yet the <a href="horse%20artillery">flying artillery</a> that Frederick developed later, but it was similar in structure and function. Later developments refined the training and usage.

Furthermore, the battle was one instance in which Moller's and Seydlitz's awareness of Frederick's <a href="Operational%20level%20of%20war">operational objectives</a> led to battlefield success. For example, not content with the single attack and recall, the "<a href="coup%20de%20main">coup de main</a>", Seydlitz withdrew his squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. When the moment was right, he led his cavalry forward again in the "<a href="coup%20de%20gr%C3%A2ce">coup de grâce</a>", the finishing blow. Similarly, Moller's artillery waited on the reverse angle of the hill until the French were in range, then mounted the Janus and laid down a thorough and precise pattern of artillery fire; the concussion of Moller's thorough cannonade could be felt several miles away. Rossbach proved that the column as a means of tactical deployment on battlefield was inferior to the Prussian battle line; the massed columns simply could not hold in the face of either Moller's fire or Seydlitz's cavalry charges. The greater the formation of men, the greater the loss of life and limb.

The stunning victory at the Battle of Rossbach marked a turning point in alliances of the Seven Years' War. Britain increased its financial support for Frederick. French interest in the so-called Prussian war declined sharply after the Rossbach debacle and, with the signing of the <a href="Third%20Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Third Treaty of Versailles</a> in March 1759, France reduced its financial and military contributions to the Coalition, leaving Austria on its own to deal with Prussia in Central Europe.

From 1865 to 1990, the area was mined for <a href="lignite">lignite</a>. The extensive <a href="open-cast">open-cast</a> mining operations caused fundamental changes in the landscape and the population: a total of 18 settlements and some 12,500 people were resettled over the time of the mining and manufacturing. Residents of Rossbach itself were resettled in 1963 and most of the town was destroyed by mining operations in 1963. Today, most of the battlefield is covered in some farmland, <a href="viticulture">vineyard</a>s and a nature park created from flooding the old lignite mine with water; the resulting lake has a surface area of ; at its deepest point, the lake is deep. In the course of filling the old pit, archaeologists found fossils 251–243 million years old.

Four separate monuments dedicated to the battle were erected in the town of Reichardtswerben. The first monument was erected 16 September 1766, in gratitude to God for sparing the town of Reichardtswerben during the battle. The stone at Burgwerben castle was erected 9 July 1844, and bears the following inscription:
After the Battle of Rossbach on 5 November 1757, at 6 o'clock in the evening, the King of Prussia Frederick II, the Great, with only a small entourage, arrived at the castle. All rooms were occupied by wounded officers. His Majesty would not allow any of the [wounded] officers to be disturbed, and set up his field bed in an alcove and, after giving the orders for the day, spent the night there. The present owner was Superintendent Funcke; his grandson, Hauptmann [Franz Leopold] von Funcke, organized this in his memory.<br>

Disintegration (The Cure album)

Disintegration is the eighth studio album by English <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="the%20Cure">the Cure</a>, released on 2 May 1989 by <a href="Fiction%20Records">Fiction Records</a>. The record marks a return to the introspective and gloomy <a href="gothic%20rock">gothic rock</a> style the band had established in the early 1980s. As he neared the age of 30, vocalist and guitarist <a href="Robert%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Robert Smith</a> had felt an increased pressure to follow up on the group's pop successes with a more enduring work. This, coupled with a distaste for the group's newfound popularity, caused Smith to lapse back into the use of <a href="hallucinogenic%20drugs">hallucinogenic drugs</a>, the effects of which had a strong influence on the production of the album. The Cure recorded "Disintegration" at <a href="Hookend%20Recording%20Studios">Hookend Recording Studios</a> in <a href="Checkendon">Checkendon</a>, Oxfordshire, with co-producer <a href="David%20M.%20Allen">David M. Allen</a> from late 1988 to early 1989. During production, founding member <a href="Lol%20Tolhurst">Lol Tolhurst</a> was fired from the band.

"Disintegration" became the band's commercial peak, charting at number three in the United Kingdom and at number 12 in the United States, and producing several hit singles including "<a href="Lovesong%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">Lovesong</a>", which peaked at number two on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>. It remains The Cure's highest selling record to date, with more than three million copies sold worldwide. It was greeted with a warm critical reception before later being acclaimed, eventually being placed at number 326 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine's list of the "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>". <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called it the "culmination of all the musical directions The Cure were pursuing over the course of the '80s".

The Cure's second album "<a href="Seventeen%20Seconds">Seventeen Seconds</a>" (1980) established the group as a prominent <a href="gothic%20rock">gothic rock</a> band, which would be followed up by "<a href="Faith%20%28The%20Cure%20album%29">Faith</a>" (1981), and "<a href="Pornography%20%28album%29">Pornography</a>" (1982). Three singles were released during 1982 and 1983 that were a significant divergence in style for The Cure; essentially, pop hits. "<a href="The%20Love%20Cats%20%28song%29">The Love Cats</a>" became The Cure's first single to infiltrate the top ten in the United Kingdom, peaking at number seven. This shift is attributed to Smith's frustration over the band's labelling as a predictable gothic rock band: "My reaction to all those people ... was to make a demented and calculated song like '<a href="Let%27s%20Go%20to%20Bed%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">Let's Go to Bed</a>'." Following the return of guitarist <a href="Porl%20Thompson">Porl Thompson</a> and bassist <a href="Simon%20Gallup">Simon Gallup</a> in 1984 and the addition of drummer <a href="Boris%20Williams">Boris Williams</a> in 1985, Smith and keyboardist <a href="Lol%20Tolhurst">Lol Tolhurst</a> continued to integrate more pop-oriented themes with the release of the group's sixth studio album "<a href="The%20Head%20on%20the%20Door">The Head on the Door</a>" (1985). With the singles "<a href="In-Between%20Days">In-Between Days</a>" and "<a href="Close%20to%20Me%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">Close to Me</a>", The Cure became a viable commercial force in the United States for the first time.

The band's 1987 double album "<a href="Kiss%20Me%2C%20Kiss%20Me%2C%20Kiss%20Me">Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me</a>" resulted in further commercial success, with a sold-out world tour booked in its wake. Despite the international success the band was now enjoying, internal friction was increasing due to Tolhurst's increasing alcoholism at the time. . Keyboardist <a href="Roger%20O%27Donnell">Roger O'Donnell</a> (who had recently been touring with <a href="The%20Psychedelic%20Furs">The Psychedelic Furs</a>), was soon hired as a second touring keyboardist. As Tolhurst's alcohol consumption increased, the other band members would tease Tolhurst, leading Smith to later comment that his behaviour was similar to that of "some kind of handicapped child being constantly poked with a stick". At the end of the Kissing Tour in support of "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me", Smith became uncomfortable with the side effects of being a pop star and moved to <a href="Maida%20Vale">Maida Vale</a> (in West London) with fiancée Mary Poole. Regularly taking <a href="Lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">LSD</a> to cope with his depression, Smith once again felt The Cure were being misunderstood and sought to return to the band's dark side with their next record.

Robert Smith's depression prior to the recording of "Disintegration" gave way to the realisation on his 29th birthday that he would turn 30 in one year. This realisation was frightening to him, as he felt all the masterpieces in rock and roll had been completed well before the band members reached such an age. Smith consequently began to write music without the rest of the band. The material he had written instantly took a dismal, depressing form, which he credited to "the fact that I was gonna be thirty". The Cure convened at Boris Williams' home in the summer of 1988 where Smith played his bandmates the demos he had recorded. If they had not liked the material, he was prepared to record them as a solo album: "I would have been quite happy to have made these songs on my own. If the group hadn't thought it was right, that would have been fine." His bandmates liked the demos and began playing along. The group recorded 32 songs at Williams' house with a 16-track recorder by the end of the summer. 

When the band entered Hook End Manor Studios in Oxfordshire, their attitude had turned sour towards Tolhurst's escalating alcohol abuse, although Smith insisted that his displeasure was caused by a meltdown in the face of recording The Cure's career-defining album and reaching 30. Displeased with the swollen egos he believed his bandmates possessed, Smith entered what he considered to be "one of my non-talking modes" deciding "I would be monk-like and not talk to anyone. It was a bit pretentious really, looking back, but I actually wanted an environment that was slightly unpleasant". He sought to abandon the mood present on "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me" and the pop singles they had released, and rather recreate the atmosphere of the band's fourth album "<a href="Pornography%20%28album%29">Pornography</a>" (1982). Despite the serious subject matter of the album, keyboardist <a href="Roger%20O%27Donnell">Roger O'Donnell</a> commented in 2009 that the atmosphere in the studio was still upbeat during the sessions: “I remember very clearly laughing and joking and fooling around in the control room while Robert was singing ‘Disintegration’, and then all of us trying to be serious when he came in to listen back.[...] It was never a serious atmosphere in the studio, and when you think about the album and how dark it is, I’m sure people think we were sitting around slitting our wrists with candles and chains hanging from the walls." 

While Tolhurst had contributed to the foundation of the song "Homesick" (according to O'Donnell) , his musical contributions to the album were marginal as his alcohol abuse rendered him more or less in-capable of recording. . The other band members, finally, threatened to quit if Tolhurst was not fired before the end of the recording session. When Tolhurst arrived to the mixing of the album, and then became excessively drunk, a shouting match ensued and he left the building furious; Smith decided to terminate his tenure with The Cure 3 weeks later prior to the band's upcoming tour. It was during this period that keyboardist Roger O'Donnell was asked by Smith to become a full-time member of The Cure, instead of simply a touring musician. Despite Tolhurst's ejection from the group, Smith told "<a href="NME">NME</a>" in April 1989, "He'll probably be back by Christmas. He's getting married, maybe that's his comeback." Tolhurst did in-fact briefly reunite with the band in 2011 during the Reflection tour.

"Disintegration" was Robert Smith's thematic return to a dark and gloomy aesthetic that The Cure had explored in the early 1980s. Smith deliberately sought to record an album that was depressing, as it was a reflection of the despondency he felt at the time. The sound of the album was a shock to the band's American label <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>; the label requested Smith shift the release date back several months. Smith recalled "they thought I was being 'wilfully obscure', which was an actual quote from the letter [Smith received from Elektra]. Ever since then I realised that record companies don't have a fucking clue what The Cure does and what The Cure means." Despite rumours that Smith was one of the only contributors to the record, he confirmed that more than half of the dozen tracks on "Disintegration" had substantial musical input from the rest of the band.

"Disintegration" is characterized by a significant usage of <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s and keyboards, slow, "droning" guitar progressions and Smith's introspective vocals. "Plainsong", the album's opener, "set the mood for "Disintegration" perfectly", according to biographer Jeff Apter, by "unravelling ever so slowly in a shower of synths and guitars, before Smith steps up to the mic, uttering snatches of lyrics ('I'm so cold') as if he were reading from something as sacred as the Dead Sea Scroll." Smith felt the song was a perfect opener for the record, describing it as "very lush, very orchestral". The album's third track, "Closedown", contains layers of keyboard texture complemented with a slow, gloomy guitar line. The track was written by Smith as a means to list his physical and artistic shortcomings. Despite the dark mood present throughout "Disintegration", "Lovesong" was an upbeat track that became a hit in the United States. Ned Raggett of AllMusic noted the difference from other songs: "the Simon Gallup/Boris Williams rhythm section create a tight, serviceable dance groove, while Smith and Porl Thompson add further guitar fills and filigrees as well, adding just enough extra bite to the song. Smith himself delivers the lyric softly, with gentle passion."

Much of the album made use of a considerable amount of guitar effects. "Prayers for Rain", a depressing track (Raggett noted: "the phrase 'savage torpor' probably couldn't better be applied anywhere else than to this song") sees Thompson and Smith "treating their work to heavy duty <a href="flanging">flanging</a>, <a href="Delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a>, backwards-run tapes and more to set the slow, moody crawl of the track." Others, like the title track, are notable for "Smith's commanding lead guitar lines [that are] scaled to epic heights while at the same time buried in the mix, almost as if they're trying to burst from behind the upfront rhythm assault. Roger O'Donnell's keyboards add both extra shade and melody, while Smith's singing is intentionally delivered in a combination of cutting clarity and low resignation, at times further distorted with extra vocal treatments."

While "Disintegration" mainly consists of sombre tracks, "Lovesong", "Pictures of You" and "Lullaby" were equally popular for their accessibility. Smith wanted to create a balance on the album by including songs that would act as an equilibrium with those that were unpleasant. Smith wrote "Lovesong" as a wedding present for Mary Poole. The lyrics had a noticeably different mood than the rest of the record, but Smith felt it was an integral component of "Disintegration": "It's an open show of emotion. It's not trying to be clever. It's taken me ten years to reach the point where I feel comfortable singing a very straightforward love song." The lyrics were a notable shift in his ability to reveal affection. In the past, Smith felt it necessary to disguise or mask such a statement. He noted that without "Lovesong", "Disintegration" would have been radically different: "That one song, I think, makes many people think twice. If that song wasn't on the record, it would be very easy to dismiss the album as having a certain mood. But throwing that one in sort of upsets people a bit because they think, 'That doesn't fit'." "Pictures of You", while upbeat, contained poignant lyrics ("Screamed at the make-believe/Screamed at the sky/You finally found all your courage to let it all go") with a "two-chord cascade of synthesizer slabs, interweaving guitar and bass lines, passionate singing and romantic lyrics." "Lullaby" is composed of what Apter calls "sharp stabs" of rhythmic guitar chords with Smith whispering the words. The premise for the song came to Smith after remembering lullabies his father would sing him when he could not sleep: "[My father] would always make them up. There was always a horrible ending. They would be something like 'sleep now, pretty baby or you won't wake up at all.'"

"Disintegration" was released in May 1989 and peaked at number three on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, the highest position the band had placed on the chart at that point. In the UK, the lead single "<a href="Lullaby%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">Lullaby</a>" became The Cure's highest charting hit in their home country when it reached number five. In the US, due to its appearance in the film "<a href="Lost%20Angels">Lost Angels</a>", the band's American label <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> released "<a href="Fascination%20Street">Fascination Street</a>" as the first single. The international follow-up single to "Lullaby", "<a href="Lovesong%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">Lovesong</a>", became The Cure's highest charting hit in the United States, when it reached number two on the "Billboard" charts. The success of "Disintegration" was such that the March 1990 final single "<a href="Pictures%20of%20You%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">Pictures of You</a>" reached number 24 on the British charts, despite the fact that the album had been released a year earlier. "Disintegration" was certified silver (60,000 copies shipped) in the United Kingdom, and by 1992 had sold more than three million copies worldwide.

In a contemporary review for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", music critic <a href="Michael%20Azerrad">Michael Azerrad</a> gave the album three-and-a-half out of five stars and felt that, "while "Disintegration" doesn't break new ground for the band, it successfully refines what the Cure does best". He concluded, "Despite the title, "Disintegration" hangs together beautifully, creating and sustaining a mood of thoroughly self-absorbed gloom. If, as Smith has hinted, the Cure itself is about to disintegrate, this is a worthy summation." "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" reviewer Chris Roberts dismissed the claims that "Disintegration" was not a miserable record and, noting the tone of the album and its lack of melody ("You'll be lucky to find a tune on here. Or a gag"), he commented that "The Cure have almost invisibly stopped making pop records". Roberts summarised the album as "challenging and claustrophobic, often poignant, often tedious. It's nearly surprising." "<a href="NME">NME</a>" praised "Disintegration" for its tunes, "from the first track 'Plainsong', a swaying, slow narrative, paralysing the listener with sex-poison, to "Disintegration"'s last 'Untitled' Smith's lyrical agony of indecision is remorseless". Reviewer Barbara Ellen noted the large range of emotions in Smith's lyrics, "from deep, loving pink to an ugly, violent maroon and almost back again". Although she found the two extra-tracks superfluous, Ellen hailed "Disintegration" as "a mindblowing and stunningly complete album". "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" gave the album a three-star rating out of five, mainly comparing it to <a href="Joy%20Division">Joy Division</a>'s work. Writer Mat Snow observed: "The Cure have studied well the art of the tragic bass line, the hesitant and melancholy guitar lick, the funereal keyboard coloration". He concluded: ""Disintegration" is thus well-crafted [...], just don't tell me it's original". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" gave the album a "C+" grade and felt that Smith attempts to appease a larger audience by broadening "gothic clichés" and "pumping his bad faith and bad relationship into depressing moderato play-loud keyb anthems far more tedious than his endless vamps".

In a retrospective review for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> gave "Disintegration" four-and-a-half out of five stars, and applauded the band by saying, "The Cure's gloomy soundscapes have rarely sounded so alluring [and] the songs – from the pulsating, ominous 'Fascination Street' to the eerie, string-laced 'Lullaby' – have rarely been so well-constructed and memorable." Erlewine went on to praise "Disintegration" for being "darkly seductive", and "a hypnotic, mesmerizing record". <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork</a> praised the record, admitting ""Disintegration" stands unquestionably as Robert Smith's magnum opus." Writer Chris Ott noted that "scant few albums released in the 1980s can boast an opener as grand as 'Plainsong', the most breathtaking, shimmering anthem the band ever recorded."

"Disintegration" has been included in numerous "Best Of" lists. "Rolling Stone" placed the record at number 326 on its 2003 compilation of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". The magazine's German counterpart placed "Disintegration" at number 184 on the same list. The album was considered to be the best album of 1989 by "Melody Maker", 17th on "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" magazine's "40 Best Albums of the 80s", and 38th on Pitchfork's "Best Albums of the 80s". The album placed at number 14 in "Entertainment Weekly"'s "New Classics: The 100 Best Albums from 1983 to 2008." In 2012, <a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a> listed the album at number 15 on its list of "Best Albums of the 1980s". In a 2001 article in "Rolling Stone", readers selected "Disintegration" as number 9 in of "the 10 Best Albums of the Eighties". The album was also included in the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>". In the "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>" episode "<a href="Mecha-Streisand">Mecha-Streisand</a>", <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle Broflovski</a> called it "the best album ever."

Following completion of "Disintegration", Smith noted that The Cure had "despite my best efforts, actually become everything that I didn't want us to become: a <a href="arena%20rock">stadium rock</a> band." Furthermore, Smith claimed the album's title was the most appropriate one he could think of: "Most of the relationship with the band outside of the band fell apart. Calling it "Disintegration" was kind of tempting fate, and fate retaliated. The family idea of the group really fell apart too after "Disintegration". It was the end of a golden period."

"The Prayer Tour" began in Europe shortly after the release of the album. The band performed numerous high-profile concerts, including shows in front of more than 40,000 fans over two nights in Paris and their first performances in Eastern Europe. Following the European leg, the band elected to travel to North America for their upcoming US leg by boat, instead of plane. Smith and Gallup shared a fear of flight, and ultimately lamented the upcoming dates, wishing to reduce the number of concerts they booked. The record label and tour promoters strongly disagreed, and even proposed to add several new shows to the itinerary because of the success of "Disintegration" in the US. The first concert in the United States was at New Jersey's <a href="Giants%20Stadium">Giants Stadium</a>, where 44,000 people attended; 30,000 tickets were purchased on the first day alone. The opening acts at Giant Stadium were: <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>, <a href="Shelleyan%20Orphan">Shelleyan Orphan</a> and <a href="Love%20and%20Rockets%20%28band%29">Love and Rockets</a> along with a special appearance by The Bubblemen. The band were extremely displeased with the massive turnout; according to Roger O'Donnell: "We had been at sea for five days. The stadium was too big for us to take it all in. We've decided that we don't like playing stadiums that large." Smith recalls that "it was never our intention to become as big as this".

The band's show at <a href="Dodger%20Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a> attracted roughly 50,000 attendees, grossing over <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1.5 million. The band's notably greater popularity in the United States—virtually every concert in the leg was sold out—caused Smith to break down, and threatened the band's future: "It's reached a stage where I personally can't cope with it," he said, "so I've decided this is the last time we're gonna tour." Backstage, there were ongoing feuds between band members owing to the strife onset by Smith. He recalled that towards the end of the tour "I was tearing my hair out ... It was just a difficult tour." <a href="Cocaine">Cocaine</a> use was prevalent, and only ended up distancing Smith from his fellow band members.

Upon returning to the United Kingdom in early October, Smith wanted nothing more to do with recording, promoting and touring for an album. In 1990 "Lullaby" won "Best Music Video of 1989" at the <a href="Brit%20Awards">BRIT Awards</a>. The Cure also released a live album titled "<a href="Entreat">Entreat</a>" (1991), which compiled songs entirely off "Disintegration" from their performance at Wembley Arena, and despite claims that The Cure would never tour again, Smith accepted an invitation to headline the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a>. O'Donnell, after two years with the group, left to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by the band's guitar technician <a href="Perry%20Bamonte">Perry Bamonte</a>. Smith, who was influenced by the <a href="acid%20house">acid house</a> movement that had exploded in London that summer, released a predominantly electronic remix album, "<a href="Mixed%20Up%20%28The%20Cure%20album%29">Mixed Up</a>", in 1990.

Harvey Milk

Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978) was an American politician and <a href="List%20of%20the%20first%20LGBT%20holders%20of%20political%20offices%20in%20the%20United%20States">the first openly gay elected official</a> in the history of <a href="California">California</a>, where he was elected to the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Board%20of%20Supervisors">San Francisco Board of Supervisors</a>. Although he was the most pro-<a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> politician in the United States at the time, politics and activism were not his early interests; he was neither open about his sexuality nor civically active until he was 40, after his experiences in the <a href="counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">counterculture movement of the 1960s</a>.

In 1972, Milk moved from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to the <a href="The%20Castro%2C%20San%20Francisco">Castro District</a> of <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> amid a migration of gay and bisexual men. He took advantage of the growing political and economic power of the neighborhood to promote his interests and unsuccessfully ran three times for political office. Milk's theatrical campaigns earned him increasing popularity, and in 1977 he won a seat as a city supervisor. His election was made possible by a key component of a shift in San Francisco politics.

Milk served almost eleven months in office, during which he sponsored a bill banning discrimination in public accommodations, housing, and employment on the basis of sexual orientation. The Supervisors passed the bill by a vote of 11-1 and was signed into law by Mayor Moscone. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor <a href="George%20Moscone">George Moscone</a> were <a href="Moscone%E2%80%93Milk%20assassinations">assassinated</a> by <a href="Dan%20White">Dan White</a>, who was another city supervisor. White had recently resigned to pursue a private business enterprise, but that endeavor eventually failed and he sought to get his old job back. White was sentenced to seven years in prison for <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a>, which was later reduced to five years. He was released in 1983 and committed suicide by <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> inhalation two years later.

Despite his short career in politics, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and a martyr in the gay community. In 2002, Milk was called "the most famous and most significantly open <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> official ever elected in the United States". <a href="Anne%20Kronenberg">Anne Kronenberg</a>, his final campaign manager, wrote of him: "What set Harvey apart from you or me was that he was a visionary. He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us." Milk was posthumously awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 2009.

Milk was born in the New York City suburb of <a href="Woodmere%2C%20New%20York">Woodmere</a>, to William Milk and Minerva Karns. He was the younger son of <a href="Lithuanian%20Jews">Lithuanian Jewish</a> parents and the grandson of Morris Milk, a department store owner who helped to organize the first synagogue in the area. As a child, Harvey was teased for his protruding ears, big nose, and oversized feet, and tended to grab attention as a class clown. While he was in school, he played football and developed a passion for <a href="opera">opera</a>. In his teens, he knew that he had homosexual tendencies but kept it a closely guarded secret. "I can't let it out," he said. "It would kill my parents." Under his name in the high school yearbook, it read, "Glimpy Milk—and they say WOMEN are never at a loss for words".

Milk graduated from <a href="Bay%20Shore%20High%20School">Bay Shore High School</a> in <a href="Bay%20Shore%2C%20New%20York">Bay Shore, New York</a>, in 1947 and attended New York State College for Teachers in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a> (now the <a href="University%20at%20Albany%2C%20SUNY">State University of New York at Albany</a>) from 1947 to 1951, majoring in mathematics. He also wrote for the college newspaper. One classmate remembered, "He was never thought of as a possible queer—that's what you called them then—he was a man's man".

After graduation, Milk joined the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. He served aboard the <a href="submarine%20rescue%20ship">submarine rescue ship</a> as a <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Diver">diving officer</a>. He later transferred to <a href="Naval%20Base%20San%20Diego">Naval Station, San Diego</a> to serve as a diving instructor. In 1955, he was discharged from the Navy at the rank of <a href="lieutenant%2C%20junior%20grade">lieutenant, junior grade</a>.

Milk's early career was marked by frequent changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at <a href="George%20W.%20Hewlett%20High%20School">George W. Hewlett High School</a> on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the <a href="Jacob%20Riis%20Park">Jacob Riis Park</a> beach, a popular location for gay men in <a href="Queens">Queens</a>. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they decided to move to <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.

Milk tried to keep his early romantic life separate from his family and work. Once again bored and single in New York, he thought of moving to Miami to marry a lesbian friend to "have <a href="beard%20%28companion%29">a front</a> and each would not be in the way of the other". However, he decided to remain in New York, where he secretly pursued gay relationships. In 1962 Milk became involved with <a href="Craig%20Rodwell">Craig Rodwell</a>, who was 10 years younger. Though Milk courted Rodwell ardently, waking him every morning with a call and sending him notes, Milk was uncomfortable with Rodwell's involvement with the New York <a href="Mattachine%20Society">Mattachine Society</a>, a gay-rights organization. When Rodwell was arrested for walking in Riis Park, and charged with inciting a riot and with indecent exposure (the law required men's swimsuits to extend from above the navel to below the thigh), he spent three days in jail. The relationship soon ended as Milk became alarmed at Rodwell's tendency to agitate the police.

Milk abruptly stopped working as an insurance actuary and became a researcher at the <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> firm <a href="Bache%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Bache & Company</a>. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley and recruited him to work on conservative <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201964">1964 presidential campaign</a>. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, McKinley was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit <a href="suicide">suicide</a> if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover <a href="Oliver%20Sipple">Billy Sipple</a> left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> art scene in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.

Since the end of World War II, the major port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of gay men who had been expelled from the military and decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism. By 1969 the <a href="Kinsey%20Institute">Kinsey Institute</a> believed San Francisco had more gay people per capita than any other American city; when the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Mental%20Health">National Institute of Mental Health</a> asked the Institute to survey homosexuals, the Institute chose San Francisco as its focus. Milk and McKinley were among the thousands of gay men attracted to San Francisco. McKinley was a stage manager for <a href="Tom%20O%27Horgan">Tom O'Horgan</a>, a director who started his career in experimental theater, but soon graduated to much larger Broadway productions. They arrived in 1969 with the Broadway touring company of "<a href="Hair%20%28musical%29">Hair</a>". McKinley was offered a job in the New York City production of "<a href="Jesus%20Christ%20Superstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</a>", and their tempestuous relationship came to an end. The city appealed to Milk so much that he decided to stay, working at an investment firm. In 1970, increasingly frustrated with the political climate after the <a href="Cambodian%20Campaign">U.S. invasion of Cambodia</a>, Milk let his hair grow long. When told to cut it, he refused and was fired.

Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, without a steady job or plan. In New York City he became involved with O'Horgan's theater company as a "general aide", signing on as associate producer for "Lenny" and for <a href="Eve%20Merriam">Eve Merriam</a>'s "Inner City". The time he had spent with the cast of <a href="flower%20children">flower children</a> wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary "New York Times" story about O'Horgan described Milk as "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read the description of the formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: "I think he was happier than at any time I had ever seen him in his entire life."

Milk met <a href="Scott%20Smith%20%28activist%29">Scott Smith</a>, 18 years his junior, and began another relationship. Milk and Smith returned to San Francisco, where they lived on money they had saved. In March 1973, after a roll of film Milk left at a local shop was ruined, he and Smith opened a camera store on Castro Street with their last $1,000.

In the late 1960s, the <a href="Society%20for%20Individual%20Rights">Society for Individual Rights</a> (SIR) and the <a href="Daughters%20of%20Bilitis">Daughters of Bilitis</a> (DOB) began to work against police persecution of gay bars and <a href="entrapment">entrapment</a> in San Francisco. <a href="Oral%20sex">Oral sex</a> was still a <a href="felony">felony</a>, and in 1970, nearly 90 people in the city were arrested for having sex in public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800 gay men were arrested for <a href="public%20sex">public sex</a> in San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same offense that year. Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as a <a href="sex%20offender">sex offender</a>.

Congressman <a href="Phillip%20Burton">Phillip Burton</a>, Assemblyman <a href="Willie%20Brown%20%28politician%29">Willie Brown</a>, and other California politicians recognized the growing clout and organization of homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings of gay and lesbian organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor <a href="Dianne%20Feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a> in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman <a href="Richard%20Hongisto">Richard Hongisto</a> worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Police%20Department">San Francisco Police Department</a>, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.

SIR had become powerful enough for political maneuvering. In 1971 SIR members <a href="Jim%20Foster%20%28activist%29">Jim Foster</a>, Rick Stokes, and "<a href="The%20Advocate%20%28LGBT%20magazine%29">Advocate</a>" publisher <a href="David%20B.%20Goodstein">David Goodstein</a> formed the <a href="Alice%20B.%20Toklas%20LGBT%20Democratic%20Club">Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club</a>, known as simply "Alice". Alice befriended liberal politicians to persuade them to sponsor bills, proving successful in 1972 when <a href="Del%20Martin%20and%20Phyllis%20Lyon">Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon</a> obtained Feinstein's support for an ordinance outlawing employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Alice chose Stokes to run for a relatively unimportant seat on the community college board. Though Stokes received 45,000 votes, he was quiet and unassuming, and did not win. Foster, however, shot to national prominence by being the first openly gay man to address a political convention. His speech at the <a href="1972%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1972 Democratic National Convention</a> ensured that his voice, according to San Francisco politicians, was the one to be heard when they wanted the opinions, and especially the votes, of the gay community.

Milk became more interested in political and civic matters when he was faced with civic problems and policies he disliked. One day in 1973, a state bureaucrat entered Milk's shop <a href="Castro%20Camera">Castro Camera</a> and informed him that he owed $100 as a deposit against state sales tax. Milk was incredulous and traded shouts with the man about the rights of business owners; after he complained for weeks at state offices, the deposit was reduced to $30. Milk fumed about government priorities when a teacher came into his store to borrow a projector because the equipment in the schools did not function. Friends also remember around the same time having to restrain him from kicking the television while <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="John%20N.%20Mitchell">John N. Mitchell</a> gave consistent "I don't recall" replies during the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Watergate%20Committee">Watergate hearings</a>. Milk decided that the time had come to run for city supervisor. He said later, "I finally reached the point where I knew I had to become involved or shut up".

Milk received an icy reception from the gay political establishment in San Francisco. Jim Foster, who had by then been active in gay politics for 10 years, resented that the newcomer had asked for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, "There's an old saying in the Democratic Party. You don't get to dance unless you put up the chairs. I've never seen you put up the chairs." Milk was furious that Foster had snubbed him for the position, and the conversation marked the beginning of an antagonistic relationship between the "Alice" Club and Harvey Milk. Some gay bar owners, still battling police harassment and unhappy with what they saw as a timid approach by Alice to established authority in the city, decided to endorse him.

Milk had drifted through life up to this point, but he found his vocation, according to journalist <a href="Frances%20FitzGerald%20%28journalist%29">Frances FitzGerald</a>, who called him a "born politician". At first, his inexperience showed. He tried to do without money, support, or staff, and instead relied on his message of sound financial management, promoting individuals over large corporations and government. After one debate, an opponent told him, "you really gotta change your rap; it's a downer." He supported the reorganization of supervisor elections from a citywide ballot to district ballots, which was intended to reduce the influence of money and give neighborhoods more control over their representatives in city government. He also ran on a <a href="culturally%20liberal">culturally liberal</a> platform, opposing <a href="government%20interference">government interference</a> in private sexual matters and favoring the <a href="Legal%20history%20of%20marijuana%20in%20the%20United%20States">legalization of marijuana</a>. Milk's fiery, flamboyant speeches and savvy media skills earned him a significant amount of press during the 1973 election. He earned 16,900 votes—sweeping the Castro District and other liberal neighborhoods and coming in 10th place out of 32 candidates. Had the elections been reorganized to allow districts to elect their own supervisors, he would have won.

From early in his political career, Milk displayed an affinity for building coalitions. The <a href="Teamsters">Teamsters</a> wanted to strike against beer distributors—<a href="Coors%20Brewing%20Company">Coors</a> in particular—who refused to sign the union contract. An organizer asked Milk for assistance with gay bars; in return, Milk asked the union to hire more gay drivers. A few days later, Milk canvassed the gay bars in and surrounding the Castro District, urging them to refuse to sell the beer. With the help of a coalition of Arab and Chinese grocers the Teamsters had also recruited, the boycott was successful. Milk found a strong political ally in <a href="Trade%20union">organized labor</a>, and it was around this time that he began to style himself "The Mayor of Castro Street". As Castro Street's presence grew, so did Milk's reputation. Tom O'Horgan remarked, "Harvey spent most of his life looking for a stage. On Castro Street he finally found it."

Tensions were growing between the older citizens of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays who were entering the Castro District. In 1973, two gay men tried to open an antique shop, but the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted to prevent them from receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the <a href="Castro%20Street%20Fair">Castro Street Fair</a> in 1974 to attract more customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.

Although he was a newcomer to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting to be taken seriously as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another <a href="gay%20bathhouse">gay bathhouse</a> again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.

Milk favored support for small businesses and the growth of neighborhoods. Since 1968, Mayor Alioto had been luring large corporations to the city despite what critics labeled "the Manhattanization of San Francisco". As blue-collar jobs were replaced by the service industry, Alioto's weakened political base allowed for new leadership to be voted into office in the city. <a href="George%20Moscone">George Moscone</a> was elected mayor. Moscone had been instrumental in repealing the <a href="sodomy%20law">sodomy law</a> earlier that year in the California State Legislature. He acknowledged Milk's influence in his election by visiting Milk's election night headquarters, thanking Milk personally, and offering him a position as a city commissioner. Milk came in seventh place in the election, only one position away from earning a supervisor seat. Liberal politicians held the offices of the mayor, district attorney, and sheriff.

Despite the new leadership in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. In one of Moscone's first acts as mayor, he appointed a police chief to the embattled <a href="San%20Francisco%20Police%20Department">San Francisco Police Department</a> (SFPD). He chose <a href="Charles%20Gain">Charles Gain</a>, against the wishes of the SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.

Keeping his promise to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone appointed him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk, however, considered seeking a position in the <a href="California%20State%20Assembly">California State Assembly</a>. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received more votes than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run—<a href="Art%20Agnos">Art Agnos</a>. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.

Milk spent five weeks on the Board of Permit Appeals before Moscone was forced to fire him when he announced he would run for the California State Assembly. Rick Stokes replaced him. Milk's firing, and the backroom deal made between Moscone, the assembly speaker, and Agnos, fueled his campaign as he took on the identity of a political underdog. He railed that high officers in the city and state governments were against him. He complained that the prevailing gay political establishment, particularly the <a href="Alice%20B.%20Toklas%20Memorial%20Democratic%20Club">Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club</a>, were shutting him out; he referred to Jim Foster and Stokes as gay "<a href="Uncle%20Tom">Uncle Tom</a>s". He enthusiastically embraced a local independent weekly magazine's headline: "Harvey Milk vs. The Machine". The Alice B. Toklas Club made no endorsement in the primary — neither Milk nor Agnos — while other gay-aligned clubs and groups endorsed Agnos or did dual endorsements.

Milk's role as a representative of San Francisco's gay community expanded during this period. On September 22, 1975, President <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, while visiting San Francisco, walked from his hotel to his car. In the crowd, <a href="Sara%20Jane%20Moore">Sara Jane Moore</a> raised a gun to shoot him. A former <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine</a> who had been walking by grabbed her arm as the gun discharged toward the pavement. The bystander was <a href="Oliver%20Sipple">Oliver "Bill" Sipple</a>, who had left Milk's ex-lover Joe Campbell years before, prompting Campbell's suicide attempt. The national spotlight was on him immediately. On psychiatric disability leave from the military, Sipple refused to call himself a hero and did not want his sexuality disclosed. Milk, however, took advantage of the opportunity to illustrate his cause that public perception of gay people would be improved if they came out of the closet. He told a friend: "It's too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that ca-ca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms." Milk contacted a newspaper.<ref name="latimes2/13/89">Morain, Dan (February 13, 1989). "Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President and Then Was Cast in an Unwanted Spotlight", "The Los Angeles Times", p. 1.</ref>

Several days later <a href="Herb%20Caen">Herb Caen</a>, a columnist at "<a href="The%20San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">The San Francisco Chronicle</a>", exposed Sipple as gay and a friend of Milk's. The announcement was picked up by national newspapers, and Milk's name was included in many of the stories. "<a href="Time%20magazine">Time</a>" magazine named Milk as a leader in San Francisco's gay community. Sipple, however, was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> in Detroit, now refused to speak to him. Although he had been involved with the gay community for years, even participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the "Chronicle" for invasion of privacy. President Ford sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life. Milk said that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>.

Milk's continuing campaign, run from the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned with the man who was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.

If the candidate was manic, he was also dedicated and filled with good humor, and he had a particular genius for getting media attention. He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding "Milk for Assembly" signs while commuters drove into the heart of the city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including among one of the most influential political groups in the city, the <a href="Peoples%20Temple">Peoples Temple</a>, an organization that Milk attended regularly. Milk's volunteers even took thousands of brochures and because the Peoples Temple leader, <a href="Jim%20Jones">Jim Jones</a>, was a politically powerful individual in San Francisco, Milk encouraged Temple members to work his phones, spoke at the Temple and later wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending Jones's character. Milk's relationship with the Temple was not entirely similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to "The San Francisco Examiner", Jones and his parishioners were a "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney <a href="Joseph%20Freitas">Joseph Freitas</a>, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [November 20, 1978]. "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", "The San Francisco Examiner", p. C.) Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", "Time", December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> in 1978. (In that letter he called Jones "a man of the highest character," and criticized outspoken Temple defectors for trying to "damage Rev. Jones' reputation" with "apparent bold-faced lies".)<a href="http%3A//www.brasscheck.com/jonestown/milk.jpg"></a> (Coleman, Loren (2004), "The Copycat Effect", Simon & Schuster, p. 68.). However, When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." But to his volunteers, he said: "Make sure you're always nice to the Peoples Temple. If they ask you to do something, do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking you to do it."

The race was close, and Milk lost by fewer than 4,000 votes. Agnos, however, taught Milk a valuable lesson when he criticized Milk's campaign speeches as "a downer ... You talk about how you're gonna throw the bums out, but how are you gonna fix things—other than beat me? You shouldn't leave your audience on a down." In the wake of his loss, Milk, realizing that the Toklas Club would never support him politically, co-founded the <a href="Harvey%20Milk%20Lesbian%2C%20Gay%2C%20Bisexual%2C%20Transgender%20Democratic%20Club">San Francisco Gay Democratic Club</a>.

The fledgling gay rights movement had yet to meet organized opposition in the U.S. In 1977 a few well-connected gay activists in Miami, Florida, were able to pass a civil rights ordinance that made discrimination based on sexual orientation illegal in <a href="Miami-Dade%20County">Dade County</a>. A well-organized group of conservative <a href="Fundamentalist%20Christianity">fundamentalist Christians</a> responded, headed by singer <a href="Anita%20Bryant">Anita Bryant</a>. Their campaign was titled <a href="Save%20Our%20Children">Save Our Children</a>, and Bryant claimed the ordinance infringed her right to teach her children Biblical morality. Bryant and the campaign gathered 64,000 signatures to put the issue to a county-wide vote. With funds raised in part by the Florida Citrus Commission, for which Bryant was the spokeswoman, they ran television advertisements that contrasted the <a href="Orange%20Bowl%20Parade">Orange Bowl Parade</a> with <a href="San%20Francisco%20Pride">San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade</a>, stating that Dade County would be turned into a "hotbed of homosexuality" where "men ... cavort with little boys".

Jim Foster, then the most powerful political organizer in San Francisco, went to Miami to assist gay activists there as election day neared, and a nationwide <a href="boycott">boycott</a> of orange juice was organized. The message of the Save Our Children campaign was influential, and the result was an overwhelming defeat for gay activists; in the largest turnout in any special election in the history of Dade County, 70% voted to repeal the law.

Christian conservatives were inspired by their victory, and saw an opportunity for a new, effective political cause. Gay activists were shocked to see how little support they received. An impromptu demonstration of over 3,000 Castro residents formed the night of the Dade County ordinance vote. Gay men and lesbians were simultaneously angry, chanting "Out of the bars and into the streets!", and elated at their passionate and powerful response. "The San Francisco Examiner" reported that members of the crowd pulled others out of bars along Castro and Polk Streets to "deafening" cheers. Milk led marchers that night on a five-mile (8 km) course through the city, constantly moving, aware that if they stopped for too long there would be a riot. He declared, "This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force."<ref name="sfexam6/8/78">Sharpe, Ivan (June 8, 1977). "Angry Gays March Through S.F.", "The San Francisco Examiner", p. 1.</ref> Activists had little time to recover, however, as the scenario replayed itself when civil rights ordinances were overturned by voters in <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul, Minnesota</a>; <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a>; and <a href="Eugene%2C%20Oregon">Eugene, Oregon</a>, throughout 1977 and into 1978.

California State Senator <a href="John%20Briggs%20%28politician%29">John Briggs</a> saw an opportunity in the Christian fundamentalists' campaign. He was hoping to be elected governor of California in 1978, and was impressed with the voter turnout he saw in Miami. When Briggs returned to <a href="Sacramento">Sacramento</a>, he wrote a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools throughout California. Briggs claimed in private that he had nothing against gays, telling gay journalist <a href="Randy%20Shilts">Randy Shilts</a>, "It's politics. Just politics." Random attacks on gays rose in the Castro. When the police response was considered inadequate, groups of gays patrolled the neighborhood themselves, on alert for attackers. On June 21, 1977, a gay man named Robert Hillsborough died from 15 stab wounds while his attackers gathered around him and chanted "Faggot!" Both Mayor Moscone and Hillsborough's mother blamed Anita Bryant and John Briggs. One week prior to the incident, Briggs had held a press conference at <a href="San%20Francisco%20City%20Hall">San Francisco City Hall</a> where he called the city a "sexual garbage heap" because of homosexuals. Weeks later, 250,000 people attended the 1977 San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, the largest attendance at any Gay Pride event to that point.

In November 1976, voters in San Francisco decided to reorganize supervisor elections to choose supervisors from neighborhoods instead of voting for them in citywide ballots. Harvey Milk quickly qualified as the leading candidate in District 5, surrounding Castro Street.

Anita Bryant's public campaign opposing homosexuality and the multiple challenges to gay rights ordinances across the United States fueled gay politics in San Francisco. Seventeen candidates from the Castro District entered the next race for supervisor; more than half of them were gay. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" ran an exposé on the veritable invasion of gay people into San Francisco, estimating that the city's gay population was between 100,000 and 200,000 out of a total 750,000.<ref name="Gold11/6/77">Gold, Herbert (November 6, 1977), "A Walk on San Francisco's Gay Side", "The New York Times", p. SM17.</ref> The Castro Village Association had grown to 90 businesses; the local bank, formerly the smallest branch in the city, had become the largest and was forced to build a wing to accommodate its new customers. Milk biographer Randy Shilts noted that "broader historical forces" were fueling his campaign.

Milk's most successful opponent was the quiet and thoughtful lawyer Rick Stokes, who was backed by the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club. Stokes had been open about his homosexuality long before Milk had, and had experienced more severe treatment, once hospitalized and forced to endure <a href="Electroconvulsive%20therapy">electroshock therapy</a> to 'cure' him. Milk, however, was more expressive about the role of gay people and their issues in San Francisco politics. Stokes was quoted saying, "I'm just a businessman who happens to be gay," and expressed the view that any normal person could also be homosexual. Milk's contrasting populist philosophy was relayed to "The New York Times": "We don't want sympathetic liberals, we want gays to represent gays ... I represent the gay street people—the 14-year-old runaway from <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>. We have to make up for hundreds of years of persecution. We have to give hope to that poor runaway kid from San Antonio. They go to the bars because churches are hostile. They need hope! They need a piece of the pie!"

Other causes were also important to Milk: he promoted larger and less expensive child care facilities, free public transportation, and the development of a board of civilians to oversee the police. He advanced important neighborhood issues at every opportunity. Milk used the same manic campaign tactics as in previous races: human billboards, hours of handshaking, and dozens of speeches calling on gay people to have hope. This time, even "The San Francisco Chronicle" endorsed him for supervisor. On election day, November 8, 1977, he won by 30% against sixteen other candidates, and after his victory became apparent, he arrived on Castro Street on the back of his campaign manager's motorcycle—escorted by Sheriff <a href="Richard%20Hongisto">Richard Hongisto</a>—to what a newspaper story described as a "tumultuous and moving welcome".

Milk had recently taken a new lover, a young man named Jack Lira, who was frequently drunk in public, and just as often escorted out of political events by Milk's aides. Since the race for the California State Assembly, Milk had been receiving increasingly violent death threats. Concerned that his raised profile marked him as a target for assassination, he recorded on tape his thoughts, and whom he wanted to succeed him if he were killed, adding: "If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door".

Milk's swearing-in made national headlines, as he became the first non-incumbent openly gay man in the United States to win an election for public office.<ref name="cone1/8/1978">Cone, Russ (January 8, 1978). "Feinstein Board President", "The San Francisco Examiner", p. 1.</ref> He likened himself to pioneering African American baseball player <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> and walked to City Hall arm in arm with Jack Lira, stating "You can stand around and throw bricks at Silly Hall or you can take it over. Well, here we are." The Castro District was not the only neighborhood to promote someone new to city politics. Sworn in with Milk were also a single mother (<a href="Carol%20Ruth%20Silver">Carol Ruth Silver</a>), a Chinese American (<a href="Gordon%20Lau">Gordon Lau</a>), and an African American woman (<a href="Ella%20Hill%20Hutch">Ella Hill Hutch</a>)—all firsts for the city. <a href="Dan%20White">Daniel White</a>, a former police officer and firefighter, was also a first-time supervisor, and he spoke of how proud he was that his grandmother was able to see him sworn in.<ref name="nyt1/12/78">Ledbetter, Les (January 12, 1978). "San Francisco Legislators Meet in Diversity", "The New York Times", p. A14.</ref>

Milk's energy, affinity for pranking, and unpredictability at times exasperated Board of Supervisors President Dianne Feinstein. In his first meeting with Mayor Moscone, Milk called himself the "number one queen" and dictated to Moscone that he would have to go through Milk instead of the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club if he wanted the city's gay votes—a quarter of San Francisco's voting population. However, Milk also became Moscone's closest ally on the Board of Supervisors. The biggest targets of Milk's ire were large corporations and real estate developers. He fumed when a parking garage was slated to take the place of homes near the downtown area, and tried to pass a commuter tax so office workers who lived outside the city and drove into work would have to pay for city services they used. Milk was often willing to vote against Feinstein and other more tenured members of the board. In one controversy early in his term, Milk agreed with fellow Supervisor Dan White, whose district was located two miles south of the Castro, that a mental health facility for troubled adolescents should not be placed there. After Milk learned more about the facility, he decided to switch his vote, ensuring White's loss on the issue—a particularly poignant cause that White championed while campaigning. White did not forget it. He opposed every initiative and issue Milk supported.

Milk began his tenure by sponsoring a civil rights bill that outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation. The ordinance was called the "most stringent and encompassing in the nation", and its passing demonstrated "the growing political power of homosexuals", according to "The New York Times". Only Supervisor White voted against it; Mayor Moscone enthusiastically signed it into law with a light blue pen that Milk had given him for the occasion.

Another bill Milk concentrated on was designed to solve the number one problem according to a recent citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets' feces. Dubbed the "pooper scooper law", its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Anne Kronenberg, Milk's campaign manager, called him "a master at figuring out what would get him covered in the newspaper". He invited the press to <a href="Duboce%20Park">Duboce Park</a> to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras were rolling, stepped in the offending substance, seemingly by mistake. His staffers, however, knew he had been at the park for an hour before the press conference looking for the right place to walk in front of the cameras. It earned him the most fan mail of his tenure in politics and went out on national news releases.

Milk had grown tired of Lira's drinking and considered breaking up with him when Lira called a few weeks later and demanded Milk come home. When Milk arrived, he found Lira had hanged himself. Already prone to severe depression, Lira had attempted suicide previously. One of the longest notes he left for Milk indicated he was upset about the Anita Bryant and John Briggs campaigns.

John Briggs was forced to drop out of the 1978 race for California governor, but received enthusiastic support for Proposition 6, dubbed the <a href="Briggs%20Initiative">Briggs Initiative</a>. The proposed law would have made firing gay teachers—and any public school employees who supported gay rights—mandatory. Briggs' messages supporting Proposition 6 were pervasive throughout California, and Harvey Milk attended every event Briggs hosted. Milk campaigned against the bill throughout the state as well, and swore that even if Briggs won California, he would not win San Francisco. In their numerous debates, which toward the end had been honed to quick back-and-forth banter, Briggs maintained that homosexual teachers wanted to abuse and recruit children. Milk responded with statistics compiled by law enforcement that provided evidence that <a href="pedophile">pedophile</a>s identified primarily as heterosexual, and dismissed Briggs' assertions with one-liner jokes: "If it were true that children mimicked their teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around."

Attendance at Gay Pride marches during the summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An estimated 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the "Hope Speech", that "The San Francisco Examiner" said "ignited the crowd":<ref name="jacobs6/27/78">Jacobs, John (June 26, 1978). "An Ecumenical Alliance on the Serious Side of 'Gay' ", "The San Francisco Examiner", p. 3.</ref>

On this anniversary of <a href="Stonewall%20riots">Stonewall</a>, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country ... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets ... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going to talk about it. And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out to your parents, your relatives.

Despite the losses in battles for gay rights across the country that year, he remained optimistic, saying "Even if gays lose in these initiatives, people are still being educated. Because of Anita Bryant and Dade County, the entire country was educated about homosexuality to a greater extent than ever before. The first step is always hostility, and after that you can sit down and talk about it."

Citing the potential infringements on individual rights, former governor of California <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> voiced his opposition to the proposition, as did Governor <a href="Jerry%20Brown">Jerry Brown</a> and President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, the latter in an afterthought following a speech he gave in Sacramento. On November 7, 1978, the proposition lost by more than a million votes, astounding gay activists on election night. In San Francisco, 75 percent voted against it.

On November 10, 1978 (10 months after he was sworn in), White resigned his position on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, saying that his annual salary of $9,600 was not enough to support his family.<ref name="exam11/11/78">"Mayor Hunts a Successor for White", "The San Francisco Examiner", (November 11, 1978), p. 1.</ref> Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed.<ref name="nyt11/29/78">Ledbetter, Les (November 29, 1978).

Retrieved on September 6, 2008.</ref>

On November 18 and 19, news broke of the mass suicide of 900 members of the <a href="Peoples%20Temple">Peoples Temple</a>. The cult had relocated from San Francisco to Guyana. California Representative <a href="Leo%20Ryan">Leo Ryan</a> was in <a href="Jonestown%2C%20Guyana">Jonestown</a> to check on the remote community, and he was killed by gunfire at an airstrip as he tried to escape the tense situation. Dan White remarked to two aides who were working for his reinstatement, "You see that? One day I'm on the front page and the next I'm swept right off."

Moscone planned to announce White's replacement on November 27, 1978. A half hour before the press conference, White avoided metal detectors by entering City Hall through a basement window and went to Moscone's office, where witnesses heard shouting followed by gunshots. White shot Moscone in the shoulder and chest, then twice in the head.<ref name="nyt11/28/78">Turner, Wallace (November 28, 1978). "Suspect Sought Job", "The New York Times", p. 1.</ref> White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with <a href="hollow-point%20bullet">hollow-point bullet</a>s along the way, and intercepted Milk, asking him to step inside for a moment. <a href="Dianne%20Feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a> heard gunshots and called police, then found Milk face down on the floor, shot five times, including twice in the head. Soon after, she announced to the press, "Today San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions. As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is my duty to inform you that both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed, and the suspect is Supervisor Dan White." Milk was 48 years old. Moscone was 49.

Within an hour, White called his wife from a nearby diner; she met him at a church and was with him when he turned himself in. Many people left flowers on the steps of City Hall, and that evening 25,000 to 40,000 formed a spontaneous candlelight march from Castro Street to City Hall. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects. Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Saint%20Mary%20of%20the%20Assumption%20%28San%20Francisco%2C%20California%29">St. Mary's Cathedral</a>. Two memorials were held for Milk; a small one at <a href="Congregation%20Emanu-El%20%28San%20Francisco%2C%20California%29">Temple Emanu-El</a> and a more boisterous one at the <a href="War%20Memorial%20Opera%20House%20%28San%20Francisco%29">Opera House</a>.

In the wake of the Jonestown suicides, Moscone had recently increased security at City Hall. Cult survivors recounted drills for suicide preparations that Jones had called "White Nights". Rumors about the murders of Moscone and Milk were fueled by the coincidence of Dan White's name and Jones's suicide preparations. A stunned District Attorney called the assassinations so close to the news about Jonestown "incomprehensible", but denied any connection. Governor <a href="Jerry%20Brown">Jerry Brown</a> ordered all flags in California to be flown at <a href="half%20staff">half staff</a>, and called Milk a "hard-working and dedicated supervisor, a leader of San Francisco's gay community, who kept his promise to represent all his constituents". President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> expressed his shock at both murders and sent his condolences. Speaker of the California Assembly <a href="Leo%20McCarthy">Leo McCarthy</a> called it "an insane tragedy". "A City in Agony" topped the headlines in "The San Francisco Examiner" the day after the murders; inside the paper stories of the assassinations under the headline "Black Monday" were printed back to back with updates of bodies being shipped home from Guyana. An editorial describing "A city with more sadness and despair in its heart than any city should have to bear" went on to ask how such tragedies could occur, particularly to "men of such warmth and vision and great energies". Dan White was charged with two counts of murder and held without bail, eligible for the death penalty owing to the recent passage of a statewide proposition that allowed death or life in prison for the murder of a public official. One analysis of the months surrounding the murders called 1978 and 1979 "the most emotionally devastating years in San Francisco's fabulously spotted history".

The 32-year-old White, who had been in the Army during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, had run on a tough anti-crime platform in his district. Colleagues declared him a high-achieving "all-American boy". He was to have received an award the next week for rescuing a woman and child from a 17-story burning building when he was a firefighter in 1977. Though he was the only supervisor to vote against Milk's gay rights ordinance earlier that year, he had been quoted as saying, "I respect the rights of all people, including gays". Milk and White at first got along well. One of White's political aides (who was gay) remembered, "Dan had more in common with Harvey than he did with anyone else on the board". White had voted to support a center for gay seniors, and to honor <a href="Phyllis%20Lyon%20and%20Del%20Martin">Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin</a>'s 25th anniversary and pioneering work.

After Milk's vote for the mental health facility in White's district, however, White refused to speak with Milk and communicated with only one of Milk's aides. Other acquaintances remembered White as very intense. "He was impulsive ... He was an extremely competitive man, obsessively so ... I think he could not take defeat," San Francisco's assistant fire chief told reporters. White's first campaign manager quit in the middle of the campaign, and told a reporter that White was an egotist and it was clear that he was antigay, though he denied it in the press. White's associates and supporters described him "as a man with a pugilistic temper and an impressive capacity for nurturing a grudge". The aide who had handled communications between White and Milk remembered, "Talking to him, I realized that he saw Harvey Milk and George Moscone as representing all that was wrong with the world".

When Milk's friends looked in his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been affected by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart and all of his socks had holes. His remains were cremated and his ashes were split. His closest friends scattered most of the ashes in <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. Other ashes were encapsulated and buried beneath the sidewalk in front of 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk at the <a href="Neptune%20Society%20Columbarium">Neptune Society Columbarium</a>, ground floor, San Francisco, California. <a href="Harry%20Britt">Harry Britt</a>, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.

Dan White's arrest and trial caused a sensation and illustrated severe tensions between the liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration as well as the liberal direction of the city government. After White turned himself in and confessed, he sat in his cell while his former colleagues on the police force told Harvey Milk jokes; police openly wore "Free Dan White" T-shirts in the days after the murder. An undersheriff for San Francisco later stated: "The more I observed what went on at the jail, the more I began to stop seeing what Dan White did as the act of an individual and began to see it as a political act in a political movement." White showed no remorse for his actions, and exhibited vulnerability only during an eight-minute call to his mother from jail.

The jury for White's trial consisted of white middle-class San Franciscans who were mostly Catholic; gays and ethnic minorities were excused from the jury pool. Some of the members of the jury cried when they heard White's tearful recorded confession, at the end of which the interrogator thanked White for his honesty. White's defense attorney, Doug Schmidt, argued that his client was not responsible for his actions; Schmidt used the legal defense known as <a href="diminished%20capacity">diminished capacity</a>: "Good people, fine people, with fine backgrounds, simply don't kill people in cold blood." Schmidt tried to prove that White's anguished mental state was a result of manipulation by the politicos in City Hall who had consistently disappointed and confounded him, finally promising to give his job back only to refuse him again. Schmidt said that White's mental deterioration was demonstrated and exacerbated by his junk food binge the night before the murders, since he was usually known to have been health-food conscious. Area newspapers quickly dubbed it the <a href="Twinkie%20defense">Twinkie defense</a>. White was acquitted of the first degree murder charge on May 21, 1979, but found guilty of <a href="voluntary%20manslaughter">voluntary manslaughter</a> of both victims, and he was sentenced to serve seven and two-thirds years. With the sentence reduced for time served and good behavior, he would be released in five. He cried when he heard the verdict.

Acting Mayor Feinstein, Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, and Milk's successor Harry Britt condemned the jury's decision. When the verdict was announced over the police radio, someone sang "<a href="Danny%20Boy">Danny Boy</a>" on the police band. A surge of people from the Castro District walked again to City Hall, chanting "Avenge Harvey Milk" and "He got away with murder". Pandemonium rapidly escalated as rocks were hurled at the front doors of the building. Milk's friends and aides tried to stop the destruction, but the mob of more than 3,000 ignored them and lit police cars on fire. They shoved a burning newspaper dispenser through the broken doors of City Hall, then cheered as the flames grew. One of the rioters responded to a reporter's question about why they were destroying parts of the city: "Just tell people that we ate too many Twinkies. That's why this is happening." The chief of police ordered the police not to retaliate, but to hold their ground. The <a href="White%20Night%20riots">White Night riots</a>, as they became known, lasted several hours.

Later that evening, several police cruisers filled with officers wearing riot gear arrived at the Elephant Walk Bar on Castro Street. Harvey Milk's <a href="prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9">protégé</a> <a href="Cleve%20Jones">Cleve Jones</a> and a reporter for the "San Francisco Chronicle", Warren Hinckle, watched as officers stormed into the bar and began to beat patrons at random. After a 15-minute melee, they left the bar and struck out at people walking along the street. The chief of police finally ordered the officers out of the neighborhood. By morning, 61 police officers and 100 rioters and gay residents of the Castro had been hospitalized. City Hall, police cruisers, and the Elephant Walk Bar suffered damages in excess of $1,000,000.

After the verdict, District Attorney Joseph Freitas faced a furious gay community to explain what had gone wrong. The prosecutor admitted to feeling sorry for White before the trial, and neglected to ask the interrogator who had recorded White's confession (and who was a childhood friend of White's and his police softball team coach) about his biases and the support White received from the police because, he said, he did not want to embarrass the detective in front of his family in court. Nor did Freitas question White's frame of mind or lack of a history of mental illness, or bring into evidence city politics, suggesting that revenge may have been a motive. Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver testified on the last day of the trial that White and Milk were not friendly, yet she had contacted the prosecutor and insisted on testifying. It was the only testimony the jury heard about their strained relationship. Freitas blamed the jury whom he claimed had been "taken in by the whole emotional aspect of [the] trial".

The murders of Milk and Moscone and White's trial changed city politics and the California legal system. In 1980, San Francisco ended district supervisor elections, fearing that a Board of Supervisors so divisive would be harmful to the city and that they had been a factor in the assassinations. A grassroots neighborhood effort to restore district elections in the mid-1990s proved successful, and the city returned to neighborhood representatives in 2000. As a result of Dan White's trial, California voters changed the law to reduce the likelihood of acquittals of accused who knew what they were doing but claimed their capacity was impaired. Diminished capacity was abolished as a defense to a charge, but courts allowed evidence of it when deciding whether to incarcerate, commit, or otherwise punish a convicted defendant. The "Twinkie defense" has entered American mythology, popularly described as a case where a murderer escapes justice because he binged on junk food, simplifying White's lack of political savvy, his relationships with George Moscone and Harvey Milk, and what "San Francisco Chronicle" columnist <a href="Herb%20Caen">Herb Caen</a> described as pandemic police "dislike of homosexuals".

Dan White served a little more than five years for the double homicide of Moscone and Milk. On October 21, 1985 (a year and a half after his release from prison), White was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a running car in his ex-wife's garage. He was 39 years old. His defense attorney told reporters that he had been despondent over the loss of his family, and the situation he had caused, adding, "This was a sick man."<ref name="nyt10/22/85">Lindsey, Robert (October 22, 1985). <a href="https%3A//www.nytimes.com/1985/10/22/us/dan-white-killer-of-san-francisco-mayor-a-suicide.html">"Dan White, Killer of San Francisco Mayor, a suicide"</a>, "The New York Times", p. A18.</ref>

Milk's political career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, and the importance of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide the fact that he was gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.

Milk strongly believed that neighborhoods promoted unity and a small-town experience, and that the Castro should provide services to all its residents. He opposed the closing of an elementary school; even though most gay people in the Castro did not have children, Milk saw his neighborhood having the potential to welcome everyone. He told his aides to concentrate on fixing <a href="pothole">pothole</a>s and boasted that 50 new stop signs had been installed in District 5. Responding to city residents' largest complaint about living in San Francisco—dog feces—Milk made it a priority to enact the ordinance requiring dog owners to take care of their pets' droppings. Randy Shilts noted, "some would claim Harvey was a socialist or various other sorts of ideologues, but, in reality, Harvey's political philosophy was never more complicated than the issue of dogshit; government should solve people's basic problems."
Karen Foss, a communications professor at the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Mexico">University of New Mexico</a>, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics to the fact that he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose ... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective:

And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.

In the last year of his life, Milk emphasized that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and <a href="Violence%20against%20LGBT%20people">violence against them</a>. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so:

I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects ... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.

However, Milk's assassination has become entwined with his political efficacy, partly because he was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend has been unable to be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him a great deal of the Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian <a href="John%20D%27Emilio">John D'Emilio</a> said, "The legacy that I think he would want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity." For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process."

The City of San Francisco has paid tribute to Milk by naming several locations after him. Where Market and Castro streets intersect in San Francisco flies an enormous <a href="Rainbow%20flag%20%28LGBT%20movement%29">Gay Pride flag</a>, situated in Harvey Milk Plaza. The San Francisco Gay Democratic Club changed its name to the Harvey Milk Memorial Gay Democratic Club in 1978 (it is currently named the <a href="Harvey%20Milk%20Lesbian%2C%20Gay%2C%20Bisexual%2C%20Transgender%20Democratic%20Club">Harvey Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Democratic Club</a>) and boasts that it is the largest Democratic organization in San Francisco. In New York City, <a href="Harvey%20Milk%20High%20School">Harvey Milk High School</a> is a school program for at-risk youth that concentrates on the needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students and operates out of the <a href="Hetrick%20Martin%20Institute">Hetrick Martin Institute</a>.

In July 2016, US <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Ray%20Mabus">Ray Mabus</a> advised Congress that he intended to name the second ship of the <a href="Military%20Sealift%20Command">Military Sealift Command</a>'s <a href="John%20Lewis-class%20oiler">John Lewis-class oiler</a>s, <a href="USNS%20Harvey%20Milk%20%28T-AO-206%29">USNS "Harvey Milk"</a>. All ships of the class are to be named after civil rights leaders.

In response to a grassroots effort, in June 2018 the city council of <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> voted to rename a thirteen-block southwestern section of Stark Street to Harvey Milk Street. The mayor, <a href="Ted%20Wheeler">Ted Wheeler</a>, declared that it "sends a signal that we are an open and a welcoming and an inclusive community". The street is located in an area of the city's West side that is historically known as a nexus for Portland's LGTBQ+ community and is the site of many gay bars and nightclubs.

In 1982, freelance reporter <a href="Randy%20Shilts">Randy Shilts</a> completed his first book: a biography of Milk, titled "<a href="The%20Mayor%20of%20Castro%20Street">The Mayor of Castro Street</a>". Shilts wrote the book while unable to find a steady job as an openly gay reporter. "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20Harvey%20Milk">The Times of Harvey Milk</a>", a documentary film based on the book's material, won the 1984 <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Documentary%20Feature">Academy Award for Documentary Feature</a>. Director <a href="Rob%20Epstein">Rob Epstein</a> spoke later about why he chose the subject of Milk's life: "At the time, for those of us who lived in San Francisco, it felt like it was life changing, that all the eyes of the world were upon us, but in fact most of the world outside of San Francisco had no idea. It was just a really brief, provincial, localized current events story that the mayor and a city council member in San Francisco were killed. It didn't have much reverberation."

Milk's life has been the subject of a musical theater production; an <a href="Harvey%20Milk%20%28opera%29">eponymous opera</a>; a <a href="cantata">cantata</a>; a children's picture book; a French-language historical novel for young-adult readers; and the biopic "<a href="Milk%20%28film%29">Milk</a>", released in 2008 after 15 years in the making. The film was directed by <a href="Gus%20Van%20Sant">Gus Van Sant</a> and starred <a href="Sean%20Penn">Sean Penn</a> as Milk and <a href="Josh%20Brolin">Josh Brolin</a> as Dan White, and won two <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>s for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. It took eight weeks to film, and often used extras who had been present at the actual events for large crowd scenes, including a scene depicting Milk's "Hope Speech" at the 1978 Gay Freedom Day Parade.

Milk was included in the ""<a href="Time%20Magazine">Time</a>" 100 Heroes and Icons of the 20th Century" as "a symbol of what gays can accomplish and the dangers they face in doing so". Despite his antics and publicity stunts, according to writer John Cloud, "none understood how his public role could affect private lives better than Milk ... [he] knew that the root cause of the gay predicament was invisibility". "<a href="The%20Advocate%20%28LGBT%20magazine%29">The Advocate</a>" listed Milk third in their "40 Heroes" of the 20th century issue, quoting Dianne Feinstein: "His homosexuality gave him an insight into the scars which all oppressed people wear. He believed that no sacrifice was too great a price to pay for the cause of human rights."
In August 2009, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> posthumously awarded Milk the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> for his contribution to the gay rights movement stating "he fought discrimination with visionary courage and conviction". Milk's nephew <a href="Stuart%20Milk">Stuart</a> accepted for his uncle. Shortly after, Stuart co-founded the <a href="Harvey%20Milk%20Foundation">Harvey Milk Foundation</a> with <a href="Anne%20Kronenberg">Anne Kronenberg</a> with the support of <a href="Desmond%20Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>, co-recipient of 2009 Presidential Medal of Freedom and now a member of the Foundation's Advisory Board. Later in the year, California governor <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> designated May 22 as "<a href="Harvey%20Milk%20Day">Harvey Milk Day</a>", and inducted Milk in the <a href="California%20Hall%20of%20Fame">California Hall of Fame</a>.

Since 2003, the story of Harvey Milk has been featured in three exhibitions created by the <a href="GLBT%20Historical%20Society">GLBT Historical Society</a>, a San Francisco–based museum, archives, and research center, to which the estate of Scott Smith donated Milk's personal belongings that were preserved after his death. On May 22, 2014, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> issued a <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a> honoring Harvey Milk, the first openly <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> political official to receive this honor. The stamp features a photo taken in front of Milk's Castro Camera store and was unveiled on what would have been his 84th birthday.

Harry Britt summarized Milk's impact the evening Milk was shot in 1978: "No matter what the world has taught us about ourselves, we can be beautiful and we can get our thing together ... Harvey was a prophet ... he lived by a vision ... Something very special is going to happen in this city and it will have Harvey Milk's name on it."

In 2012, Milk was inducted into the <a href="Legacy%20Walk">Legacy Walk</a>, an outdoor public display which celebrates <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> history and people.
In November 2017, plans were presented for a stepped memorial plaza in the Castro district designed by American architecture firm <a href="Perkins%20Eastman">Perkins Eastman</a>.

Tarbosaurus

Tarbosaurus ( ; meaning "alarming lizard") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a> <a href="theropod%20dinosaur">theropod dinosaur</a> that flourished in <a href="Asia">Asia</a> about 70 <a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a>, at the end of the Late <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a>. <a href="Fossil">Fossil</a>s have been recovered in <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, with more fragmentary remains found further afield in parts of <a href="China">China</a>.

Although many <a href="species">species</a> have been named, modern paleontologists recognize only one, "T. bataar", as valid. Some experts see this species as an Asian representative of the <a href="North%20America">North America</a>n genus "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>"; this would make the genus "Tarbosaurus" redundant. "Tarbosaurus" and "Tyrannosaurus", if not <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a>, are considered to be at least closely related genera. "<a href="Alioramus">Alioramus</a>", also from Mongolia, has previously been thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of "Tarbosaurus", though this has since been disproven with the discovery of "<a href="Qianzhousaurus">Qianzhousaurus</a>" and the description of the Alioramini.

Like most known tyrannosaurids, "Tarbosaurus" was a large <a href="biped">biped</a>al <a href="predation">predator</a>, weighing up to five tonnes and equipped with about sixty large teeth. It had a unique locking mechanism in its lower jaw and the smallest forelimbs relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids, renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered forelimbs.

"Tarbosaurus" lived in a humid <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a> criss-crossed by river channels. In this environment, it was an <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>, probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the <a href="hadrosaur">hadrosaur</a> "<a href="Saurolophus">Saurolophus</a>" or the <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> "<a href="Nemegtosaurus">Nemegtosaurus</a>". "Tarbosaurus" is represented by dozens of <a href="fossil">fossil</a> specimens, including several complete skulls and skeletons. These remains have allowed scientific studies focusing on its <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a>, skull mechanics, and brain structure.

Although slightly smaller than "Tyrannosaurus", "Tarbosaurus" was one of the largest tyrannosaurids. The largest known individuals were between long. The mass of a fully grown individual is considered comparable to or slightly smaller than "Tyrannosaurus", often estimated to be around 4–5 metric tons.

The largest known "Tarbosaurus" skull is more than long, larger than all other tyrannosaurids except "Tyrannosaurus". The skull was tall, like that of "Tyrannosaurus", but not as wide, especially towards the rear. The unexpanded rear of the skull meant that "Tarbosaurus" eyes did not face directly forwards, suggesting that it lacked the <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular vision</a> of "Tyrannosaurus". Large <a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestra</a>e (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. Between 58 and 64 teeth lined its jaws, slightly more than in "Tyrannosaurus" but fewer than in smaller tyrannosaurids like "<a href="Gorgosaurus">Gorgosaurus</a>" and "Alioramus". Most of its teeth were oval in <a href="Cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross section</a>, although the teeth of the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> at the tip of the upper jaw had a "D"-shaped cross section. This <a href="heterodonty">heterodonty</a> is characteristic of the family. The longest teeth were in the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (upper jaw bone), with <a href="tooth%20crown">crowns</a> up to 85 millimeters (3.3 in) long. In the <a href="mandible">lower jaw</a>, a ridge on the outer surface of the <a href="angular%20bone">angular</a> bone articulated with the rear of the <a href="dentary">dentary</a> bone, creating a locking mechanism unique to "Tarbosaurus" and "Alioramus". Other tyrannosaurids lacked this ridge and had more flexibility in the lower jaw.

Tyrannosaurids varied little in body form, and "Tarbosaurus" was no exception. The head was supported by an "S"-shaped neck, while the rest of the <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>, including the long tail, was held horizontally. "Tarbosaurus" had tiny forelimbs, proportionably to body size the smallest of all members of the family. The hands had two clawed digits each, with an additional unclawed third metacarpal found in some specimens, similar to closely related genera. Holtz has suggested that "Tarbosaurus" also has a theropod reduction of fingers IV-I "developed further" than in other tyrannosaurids, as the second metacarpal in the "Tarbosaurus" specimens he studied is less than twice the length of the first metacarpal (other tyrannosaurids have a second metacarpal about twice the length of the first metacarpal). Also, the third metacarpal in "Tarbosaurus" is proportionally shorter than in other tyrannosaurids; in other tyrannosaurids (like "<a href="Albertosaurus">Albertosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Daspletosaurus">Daspletosaurus</a>"), the third metacarpal is often longer than the first metacarpal, while in the "Tarbosaurus" specimens studied by Holtz, the third metacarpal is shorter than the first.

In contrast to the forelimbs, the three-toed hindlimbs were long and thick, supporting the body in a bipedal posture. The long, heavy tail served as a <a href="counterweight">counterweight</a> to the head and torso and placed the <a href="center%20of%20gravity">center of gravity</a> over the hips.

In 1946, a joint <a href="USSR">Soviet</a>-Mongolian expedition to the <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a> in the Mongolian <a href="%C3%96mn%C3%B6govi%20Province">Ömnögovi Province</a> turned up a large theropod skull and some <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e in the <a href="Nemegt%20Formation">Nemegt Formation</a>. In 1955, <a href="Evgeny%20Maleev">Evgeny Maleev</a>, a Soviet <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a>, made this specimen the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> (<a href="Paleontological%20Institute%20of%20Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">PIN</a> 551-1) of a new species, which he called "Tyrannosaurus bataar". The specific name is a misspelling of the Mongolian баатар/"baatar" ("hero"). In the same year, Maleev also described and named three new theropod skulls, each associated with skeletal remains discovered by the same expedition in 1948 and 1949. The first of these (PIN 551-2) was named "Tarbosaurus efremovi", a new generic name composed of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "τάρβος"/"tarbos" ("terror", "alarm", "awe", or "reverence") and "σαυρος"/"sauros" ("lizard"), and the species named after <a href="Ivan%20Yefremov">Ivan Yefremov</a>, a Russian paleontologist and <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> author. The other two (PIN 553-1 and PIN 552-2) were also named as new species and assigned to the North American genus "Gorgosaurus" ("G. lancinator" and "G. novojilovi", respectively). All three of these latter specimens are smaller than the first.

A 1965 paper by <a href="Anatoly%20Konstantinovich%20Rozhdestvensky">A.K. Rozhdestvensky</a> recognized all of Maleev's specimens as different <a href="ontogeny">growth stages</a> of the same species, which he believed to be distinct from the North American "Tyrannosaurus". He created a new combination, "Tarbosaurus bataar", to include all the specimens described in 1955 as well as newer material. Later authors, including Maleev himself, agreed with Rozhdestvensky's analysis, although some used the name "Tarbosaurus efremovi" rather than "T. bataar". American paleontologist <a href="Kenneth%20Carpenter">Kenneth Carpenter</a> re-examined the material in 1992. He concluded that it belonged to the genus "Tyrannosaurus", as originally published by Maleev, and lumped all the specimens into the species "Tyrannosaurus bataar" except the remains that Maleev had named "Gorgosaurus novojilovi". Carpenter thought this specimen represented a separate, smaller genus of tyrannosaurid, which he called "Maleevosaurus novojilovi". George Olshevsky created the new generic name "Jenghizkhan" (after <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a>) for "Tyrannosaurus bataar" in 1995, while also recognizing "Tarbosaurus efremovi" and "Maleevosaurus novojilovi", for a total of three distinct, contemporaneous genera from the Nemegt Formation. A 1999 study subsequently reclassified "Maleevosaurus" as a juvenile "Tarbosaurus". All research published since 1999 recognizes only a single species, which is either called "Tarbosaurus bataar" or "Tyrannosaurus bataar".

After the original Russian-Mongolian expeditions in the 1940s, <a href="Poland">Polish</a>-Mongolian joint expeditions to the Gobi Desert began in 1963 and continued until 1971, recovering many new fossils, including new specimens of "Tarbosaurus" from the Nemegt Formation. Expeditions involving <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese and Mongolian scientists between 1993 and 1998, as well as private expeditions hosted by <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> paleontologist <a href="Phil%20Currie">Phil Currie</a> around the turn of the 21st century, discovered and collected further "Tarbosaurus" material. More than 30 specimens are known, including more than 15 skulls and several complete postcranial skeletons.

"Tarbosaurus" fossils are only found around the Gobi Desert of Mongolia and China, both of which ban their export, though some specimens have been looted by private collectors. A recent $1 million smuggling deal was uncovered when suspicions were raised about a catalog put out by Heritage Auctions for an event in New York City on May 20, 2012. By Mongolian law, any specimen found in the <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a> was to rest at an appropriate Mongolian institution and there was little reasonable doubt that the "Tarbosaurus bataar" advertised on the catalog was a stolen one. The president of Mongolia and many paleontologists raised objections to the sale which led to a last-minute investigation that confirmed that it was a specimen that can only be found in the Gobi Desert, rightfully belonging to Mongolia. During the court case (<a href="United%20States%20v.%20One%20Tyrannosaurus%20Bataar%20Skeleton">United States v. One "Tyrannosaurus Bataar" Skeleton</a>), <a href="Eric%20Prokopi">Eric Prokopi</a>, the smuggler, pleaded guilty to illegal smuggling and the dinosaur was returned to Mongolia in 2013, where it is temporarily displayed on <a href="Sukhbaatar%20Square">Sukhbaatar Square</a>, the center of the city of Ulaanbaatar. Prokopi had sold the dinosaur with a partner and fellow commercial hunter in England, Christopher Moore. The case led to the repatriation of dozens more Mongolian dinosaurs, including several skeletons of "Tarbosaurus bataar".

<a href="China">Chinese</a> paleontologists discovered a partial skull and skeleton of a small theropod (<a href="Institute%20of%20Vertebrate%20Paleontology%20and%20Paleoanthropology">IVPP</a> V4878) in the <a href="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a> Autonomous Region of China in the mid-1960s. In 1977, <a href="Dong%20Zhiming">Dong Zhiming</a> described this specimen, which was recovered from the <a href="Subashi%20Formation">Subashi Formation</a> in <a href="Shanshan%20County">Shanshan County</a>, as a new genus and species, "Shanshanosaurus huoyanshanensis". <a href="Gregory%20Paul">Gregory Paul</a> recognized "Shanshanosaurus" as a tyrannosaurid in 1988, referring it to the now-defunct genus "<a href="Aublysodon">Aublysodon</a>". Dong and Currie later re-examined the specimen and deemed it to be a juvenile of a larger species of tyrannosaurid. These authors refrained from assigning it to any particular genus but suggested "Tarbosaurus" as a possibility.

"Albertosaurus periculosus", "Tyrannosaurus luanchuanensis", "Tyrannosaurus turpanensis" and "<a href="Chingkankousaurus">Chingkankousaurus fragilis</a>" were considered synonyms of "Tarbosaurus" in the second edition of the Dinosauria, but "Chingkankousaurus" has been assessed as dubious by Brusatte et al. (2013).

Named in 1976 by <a href="Sergei%20Kurzanov">Sergei Kurzanov</a>, "<a href="Alioramus">Alioramus</a>" is another genus of tyrannosaurid from slightly older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded "Alioramus" was quite closely related to "Tarbosaurus". It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie to speculate that "Alioramus" might represent a juvenile "Tarbosaurus", but he noted that the much higher tooth count and row of crests on top of the snout suggested otherwise.

"Tarbosaurus" is classified as a <a href="theropod">theropod</a> in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae within the family <a href="Tyrannosauridae">Tyrannosauridae</a>. Other members include "Tyrannosaurus" and the earlier "<a href="Daspletosaurus">Daspletosaurus</a>", both from North America, and possibly the Mongolian genus "Alioramus". Animals in this subfamily are more closely related to "Tyrannosaurus" than to "<a href="Albertosaurus">Albertosaurus</a>" and are known for their robust build with proportionally larger skulls and longer <a href="femur">femur</a>s than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae.

"Tarbosaurus bataar" was originally described as a species of "Tyrannosaurus", an arrangement that has been supported by some more recent studies. Others prefer to keep the genera separate, while still recognizing them as <a href="sister%20taxa">sister taxa</a>. A 2003 <a href="cladistic">cladistic</a> analysis based on skull features instead identified "Alioramus" as the closest known relative of "Tarbosaurus", as the two genera share skull characteristics that are related to stress distribution and that are not found in other tyrannosaurines. If proven, this relationship would argue against "Tarbosaurus" becoming a synonym for "Tyrannosaurus" and would suggest that separate tyrannosaurine lineages <a href="evolution">evolved</a> in Asia and North America. The two known specimens of "Alioramus", which show juvenile characteristics, are not likely juvenile individuals of "Tarbosaurus" because of their much higher tooth count (76 to 78 teeth) and their unique row of bony bumps along the top of their snouts.

The discovery of "<a href="Lythronax%20argestes">Lythronax argestes</a>", a much earlier tyrannosaurine further reveals the close relationship between "Tyrannosaurus" and "Tarbosaurus", and it was discovered that "Lythronax" is a sister taxon to a clade consisting of Campanian genus "Zhuchengtyrannus", and Maastrichtian genera "Tyrannosaurus" and "Tarbosaurus". Further studies of "Lythronax" also suggest that the Asian tyrannosauroids were part of one evolutionary radiation.
Below is the cladogram of Tyrannosauridae based on the <a href="phylogenetic%20analysis">phylogenetic analysis</a> conducted by Loewen "et al." in 2013.

Like several other large tyrannosaurids, "Tarbosaurus" is known from relatively abundant and well-preserved fossil material. In fact, one quarter of all fossils collected from the Nemegt Formation belong to "Tarbosaurus". Although "Tarbosaurus" has not been studied as thoroughly as the North American tyrannosaurids, the available material has allowed scientists to draw limited conclusions about its biology.

In 2001, <a href="Bruce%20Rothschild">Bruce Rothschild</a> and others published a study examining evidence for <a href="stress%20fractures">stress fractures</a> and <a href="tendon%20avulsions">tendon avulsions</a> in <a href="theropod">theropod</a> dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. None of the eighteen "Tarbosaurus" foot bones examined in the study was found to have a stress fracture, but one of the ten examined hand bones was found to have one. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are more likely to be obtained while in contact with struggling prey. The presence of stress fractures and tendon avulsions in general provide evidence for a "very active" predation-based diet rather than obligate scavenging.

In 2012, bite marks on two fragmentary <a href="gastralia">gastralia</a> of the holotype specimen of the large ornithomimosaur "<a href="Deinocheirus%20mirificus">Deinocheirus mirificus</a>" were reported. The size and shape of the bite marks match the teeth of "Tarbosaurus", the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent feeding behavior instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. "Tarbosaurus" bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.

The skull of "Tarbosaurus" was completely described for the first time in 2003. Scientists noted key differences between "Tarbosaurus" and the North American tyrannosaurids. Many of these differences are related to the handling of stress by the skull bones during a bite. When the upper jaw bit down on an object, <a href="force">force</a> was transmitted up through the maxilla, the primary tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, into surrounding skull bones. In North American tyrannosaurids, this force went from the maxilla into the fused <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s on top of the snout, which were firmly connected in the rear to the <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a>s by bony struts. These struts locked the two bones together, suggesting that force was then transmitted from the nasals to the lacrimals.

"Tarbosaurus" lacked these bony struts, and the connection between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards projection of the maxilla was massively developed in "Tarbosaurus" and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in "Tarbosaurus". The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal</a> and <a href="prefrontal%20bone">prefrontal bone</a>s in "Tarbosaurus". The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.

Another major difference between "Tarbosaurus" and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones in the rear of the mandible and the dentary in the front, "Tarbosaurus" had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on the surface of the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.

Some scientists have <a href="hypothesis">hypothesized</a> that the more rigid skull of "Tarbosaurus" was an adaptation to hunting the massive <a href="titanosaurid">titanosaurid</a> <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a>s found in the Nemegt Formation, which did not exist in most of North America during the Late Cretaceous. The differences in skull mechanics also affect tyrannosaurid phylogeny. "Tarbosaurus"-like articulations between the skull bones are also seen in "Alioramus" from Mongolia, suggesting that it, and not "Tyrannosaurus", is the closest relative of "Tarbosaurus". Similarities between "Tarbosaurus" and "Tyrannosaurus" might therefore be related to their large size, independently developed through <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>.

There is evidence to suggest that Tarbosaurus was both a predator and scavenger, as shown with its fossilized bite marks being found on "Saurolophus" remains. As for its bite force, it was revealed that "Tarbosaurus" had a bite force of around 8,000 to 10,000 pounds per force, meaning that it could possibly crush bone like its North American relative, "Tyrannosaurus".

A "Tarbosaurus" skull found in 1948 by Soviet and Mongolian scientists (PIN 553-1, originally called "Gorgosaurus lancinator") included the skull cavity that held the brain. Making a plaster <a href="Casting">cast</a>, called an "<a href="endocranial%20cast">endocast</a>", of the inside of this cavity allowed Maleev to make preliminary observations about the shape of a "Tarbosaurus" brain. A newer <a href="polyurethane">polyurethane</a> rubber cast allowed a more detailed study of "Tarbosaurus" brain structure and function.

The endocranial structure of "Tarbosaurus" was similar to that of "Tyrannosaurus", differing only in the positions of some <a href="cranial%20nerve">cranial nerve</a> roots, including the <a href="trigeminal%20nerve">trigeminal</a> and <a href="accessory%20nerve">accessory nerve</a>s. Tyrannosaurid brains were more similar to those of <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns and other <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s than to <a href="bird">bird</a>s. The total brain volume for a "Tarbosaurus" is estimated at only .

The large size of the <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>s, as well as the <a href="terminal%20nerve">terminal</a> and <a href="olfactory%20nerve">olfactory nerve</a>s, suggest that "Tarbosaurus" had a keen <a href="sense%20of%20smell">sense of smell</a>, as was also the case with "Tyrannosaurus". The <a href="Olfactory%20bulb%23Accessory%20olfactory%20bulb">vomeronasal bulb</a> is large and differentiated from the olfactory bulb, which was initially suggested as being indicative of a well-developed <a href="Vomeronasal%20organ">Jacobsen's organ</a>, which was used to detect <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s. This may imply that "Tarbosaurus" had complex mating behavior. However, the identification of the vomeronasal bulb has been challenged by other researchers, since they are not present in any living archosaurs.

The <a href="auditory%20nerve">auditory nerve</a> was also large, suggesting good <a href="Hearing%20%28sense%29">hearing</a>, which may have been useful for auditory <a href="animal%20communication">communication</a> and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed <a href="Vestibular%20system">vestibular</a> component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with <a href="eyesight">eyesight</a> were smaller and undeveloped. The <a href="midbrain%20tectum">midbrain tectum</a>, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in "Tarbosaurus", as were the <a href="optic%20nerve">optic nerve</a> and the <a href="oculomotor%20nerve">oculomotor nerve</a>, which controls eye movement. Unlike "Tyrannosaurus", which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, "Tarbosaurus" had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that "Tarbosaurus" relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.

Most specimens of "Tarbosaurus" represent adult or subadult individuals; juveniles remain very rare. Nevertheless, the 2006 discovery of a juvenile skeleton including a complete, long skull provides information on the life history of this dinosaur. This individual probably was aged 2 to 3 years at the time of death. Compared with adult skulls, the juvenile skull was weakly constructed and the teeth were thin, indicating different food preferences in juveniles and adults that reduced competition between different age groups. Examination of the sclerotic rings in this juvenile "Tarbosaurus" suggests they may also have been crepuscular or nocturnal hunters. Whether the adult "Tarbosaurus" were also nocturnal is currently unknown due to lack of fossil evidence.

Skin impressions were recovered from a large skeleton at the Bugiin Tsav locality that was previously destroyed by poachers. These impressions show non-overlapping scales with an average diameter of and pertain to the thoracic region of the individual, although the exact position can not be assessed any longer due to the destruction of the skeleton.

<a href="Phil%20Currie">Phil Currie</a> and colleagues (2003) described two footprints from the Nemegt locality that probably pertain to "Tarbosaurus". These tracks represents natural casts, which means that only the sandy infill of the tracks and not the tracks itself are preserved. The better preserved tracks feature skin impressions over large areas on and behind the toe impressions that are similar to those discovered in Bugiin Tsav. They also feature vertical parallel slide marks that were left by scales when the foot was pushed into the ground. The track measures in length, thus representing a large individual. The second track, although even larger, was affected by <a href="erosion">erosion</a> and does not show any detail.

The vast majority of known "Tarbosaurus" fossils were recovered from the <a href="Nemegt%20Formation">Nemegt Formation</a> in the <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a> of southern Mongolia. This <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a> has never been <a href="radiometric%20dating">dated radiometrically</a>, but the <a href="fauna">fauna</a> present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> stage, at the end of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> about 70 million years ago. The <a href="Subashi%20Formation">Subashi Formation</a>, in which "Shanshanosaurus" remains were discovered, is also Maastrichtian in age.

"Tarbosaurus" is found chiefly in the Nemegt Formation, whose sediments preserve large river channels and soil deposits that indicate a far more humid climate than those suggested by the underlying <a href="Barun%20Goyot%20Formation">Barun Goyot</a> and <a href="Djadochta%20Formation">Djadochta Formation</a>s. However, <a href="Caliche%20%28mineral%29">caliche</a> deposits indicate at least periodic droughts. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers. The rock <a href="facies">facies</a> of this formation suggest the presence of mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs. Fossils of an unidentified tyrannosaur from the older Djadochta Formation, which closely resemble those of "Tarbosaurus", may indicate that it also lived at an earlier time and in a more arid ecosystem than that of the Nemegt.

Occasional <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a> fossils are found, as well as a variety of other aquatic animals like fish and turtles. Crocodilians included several species of "<a href="Shamosuchus">Shamosuchus</a>", a genus with teeth adapted for crushing shells. <a href="Mammal">Mammal</a> fossils are exceedingly rare in the Nemegt Formation, but many birds have been found, including the <a href="enantiornithine">enantiornithine</a> "<a href="Gurilynia">Gurilynia</a>" and the <a href="Hesperornithes">hesperornithiform</a> "<a href="Judinornis">Judinornis</a>", as well as "<a href="Teviornis">Teviornis</a>", an early representative of the still-existing <a href="Anseriformes">Anseriformes</a> (waterfowl). Scientists have described many dinosaurs from the Nemegt Formation, including the <a href="ankylosaurid">ankylosaurid</a> "<a href="Saichania">Saichania</a>", and <a href="pachycephalosaur">pachycephalosaur</a> "<a href="Prenocephale">Prenocephale</a>". By far the largest predator known from the formation, adult "Tarbosaurus" most likely preyed upon large hadrosaurs such as "<a href="Saurolophus">Saurolophus</a>" and "<a href="Barsboldia">Barsboldia</a>", or sauropods such as "<a href="Nemegtosaurus">Nemegtosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Opisthocoelicaudia">Opisthocoelicaudia</a>". Adults would have received little competition from small theropods such as the small <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a> "<a href="Alioramus">Alioramus</a>", <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a>s ("<a href="Borogovia">Borogovia</a>", "<a href="Tochisaurus">Tochisaurus</a>", "<a href="Zanabazar%20%28dinosaur%29">Zanabazar</a>"), <a href="oviraptorosaur">oviraptorosaur</a>s ("<a href="Elmisaurus">Elmisaurus</a>", "<a href="Nemegtomaia">Nemegtomaia</a>", "<a href="Rinchenia">Rinchenia</a>") or "<a href="Bagaraatan">Bagaraatan</a>", sometimes considered a <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> <a href="tyrannosauroid">tyrannosauroid</a>. Other theropods, like the gigantic "<a href="Therizinosaurus">Therizinosaurus</a>", might have been <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a>, and <a href="ornithomimosaur">ornithomimosaur</a>s such as "<a href="Anserimimus">Anserimimus</a>", "<a href="Gallimimus">Gallimimus</a>", and gigantic "<a href="Deinocheirus">Deinocheirus</a>" might have been omnivores that only took small prey and were therefore no competition for "Tarbosaurus". However, as in other large tyrannosaurids as well as modern <a href="Komodo%20dragon">Komodo dragon</a>s, juveniles and subadult "Tarbosaurus" would have filled niches between the massive adults and these smaller theropods.

European nightjar

The European nightjar ("Caprimulgus europaeus"), Common goatsucker, Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar, is a <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a> and <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> bird in the <a href="nightjar">nightjar</a> <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> that breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia. The Latin <a href="Genus%23Generic%20name">generic name</a> refers to the old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> differ <a href="cline%20%28biology%29">clinally</a>, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards the east of the range. All populations are <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.

The preferred habitat is dry, open country with some trees and small bushes, such as <a href="heath">heath</a>s, forest clearings or newly planted woodland. The male European nightjar occupies a <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a> in spring and advertises his presence with a distinctive sustained churring trill from a perch. He patrols his territory with wings held in a V and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Wing clapping also occurs when the male chases the female in a spiralling display flight. The European nightjar does not build a nest, and its two grey and brown blotched eggs are laid directly on the ground; they hatch after about 17–21 days and the downy chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in another 16–17 days.

The European nightjar feeds on a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are relatively large, each with a <a href="tapetum%20lucidum">reflective layer</a>, which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not <a href="Animal%20echolocation">echolocate</a>. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a> use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>.

The <a href="nightjar">nightjar</a>s, Caprimulgidae, are a large <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of mostly <a href="nocturnality">nocturnal</a> <a href="insectivore">insect-eating</a> birds. The largest and most widespread <a href="genus">genus</a> is "<a href="Caprimulgus">Caprimulgus</a>", characterised by stiff bristles around the mouth, long pointed wings, a comb-like middle claw and patterned plumage. The males, and sometimes females, often have white markings in the wing or tail. Within the genus, the European nightjar forms a superspecies with the <a href="rufous-cheeked%20nightjar">rufous-cheeked nightjar</a> and the <a href="sombre%20nightjar">sombre nightjar</a>, African species with similar songs. It is replaced further east in Asia by the <a href="jungle%20nightjar">jungle nightjar</a> which occupies similar habitat.

The European nightjar was described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">"Systema naturae"</a> in 1758 under its current scientific name. "Caprimulgus" is derived from the Latin "capra", "nanny goat", and "mulgere", "to milk", referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats, and the species name, "europaeus" is Latin for "European". The common name "nightjar", first recorded in 1630, refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird, the second part of the name deriving from the distinctive churring song. Old or local names refer to the song, "churn owl", habitat, "fern owl", diet, "dor hawk" and "moth hawk".

There are six recognised subspecies, although the differences are mainly <a href="cline%20%28biology%29">clinal</a>; birds become smaller and paler in the east of the range and the males have larger white wing spots. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the subspecies' ranges overlap.
The fossil record is deficient, but it is likely that these poorly defined subspecies diverged as global temperature rose over the last 10,000 years or so. Only one record of the species possibly dates back to the late <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>.

The European nightjar is long, with a wingspan. The male weighs and the female . The adult of the nominate subspecies has greyish-brown upperparts with dark streaking, a pale buff hindneck collar and a white moustachial line. The closed wing is grey with buff spotting, and the underparts are greyish-brown, with brown barring and buff spots. The bill is blackish, the <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is dark brown and the legs and feet are brown.

The flight on long pointed wings is noiseless, due to their soft plumage, and very buoyant. Flying birds can be sexed since the male has a white wing patch across three <a href="primary%20feather">primary feather</a>s and white tips to the two outer tail feathers, whereas females do not show any white in flight. Chicks have downy brown and buff plumage, and the fledged young are similar in appearance to the adult female. Adults <a href="moulting">moult</a> their body feathers from June onwards after breeding, suspend the process while migrating, and replace the tail and <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s on the wintering grounds. Moult is completed between January and March. Immature birds follow a similar moult strategy to the adults unless they are from late broods, in which case the entire moult may take place in Africa.

Other nightjar species occur in parts of the breeding and wintering ranges. The <a href="red-necked%20nightjar">red-necked nightjar</a> breeds in <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberia</a> and northwest Africa; it is larger, greyer and longer winged than the European nightjar, and has a broad buff collar and more conspicuous white markings on the wings and tail. Wintering European nightjars in Africa may overlap with the related rufous-cheeked and sombre nightjars. Both have a more prominent buff hind-neck collar and more spotting on the wing <a href="Covert%20feather">coverts</a>. The sombre nightjar is also much darker than its European cousin. Given their nocturnal habits, cryptic plumage and difficulty of observation, nightjar observation "is as much a matter of fortune as effort or knowledge".

The male European nightjar's song is a sustained churring trill, given continuously for up to 10 minutes with occasional shifts of speed or pitch. It is delivered from a perch, and the male may move around its <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a> using different song posts. Singing is more frequent at dawn and dusk than during the night, and is reduced in poor weather. The song may end with a bubbling trill and wing-clapping, perhaps indicating the approach of a female. Migrating or wintering birds sometimes sing. Individual male nightjars can be identified by analysing the rate and length of the pulses in their songs. Even a singing male may be hard to locate; the perched bird is difficult to spot in low light conditions, and the song has a <a href="ventriloquism">ventriloquial</a> quality as the singer turns his head. The song is easily audible at , and can be heard at in good conditions; it can be confused with the very similar sound of the <a href="Gryllotalpa%20gryllotalpa">European mole cricket</a>.

The female does not sing, but when on the wing, both sexes give a short "cuick, cuick" call, also used when chasing predators. Other calls include variations on a sharp "chuck" when alarmed, hisses given by adults when handled or chicks when disturbed, and an assortment of "wuk, wuk, wuk", muffled "oak, oak" and murmurs given at the nest. Large young have a threat display with the mouth opened wide while hissing loudly.

The breeding range of the European nightjar comprises Europe north to around latitude 64°N and Asia north to about 60°N and east to <a href="Lake%20Baikal">Lake Baikal</a> and eastern Mongolia. The southern limits are northwestern Africa, Iraq, Iran and the northwestern <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>. This nightjar formerly bred in Syria and Lebanon.

All populations are <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, and most birds winter in Africa south of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>, with just a few records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and East Africa. Some Asian birds may therefore cross 100° of <a href="longitude">longitude</a> on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or "C. e. meridionalis". Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed that European nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa where they have to cross several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, the Seychelles, the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>, <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> and the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>.

The European nightjar is a bird of dry, open country with some trees and small bushes, such as <a href="heath">heath</a>s, <a href="common%20land">commons</a>, <a href="moorland">moorland</a>, forest clearings or felled or newly planted woodland. When breeding, it avoids treeless or heavily wooded areas, cities, mountains, and farmland, but it often feeds over wetlands, cultivation or gardens. In winter it uses a wider range of open habitats including <a href="acacia">acacia</a> <a href="steppe">steppe</a>, sandy country and highlands. It has been recorded at altitudes of on the breeding grounds and in the wintering areas.

The European nightjar is <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a> and <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>. During the day it rests on the ground, often in a partly shaded location, or perches motionless lengthwise along an open branch or a similar low perch. The <a href="crypsis">cryptic</a> plumage makes it difficult to see in the daytime, and birds on the ground, if they are not already in shade, will turn occasionally to face the sun thereby minimising their shadow. If it feels threatened, the nightjar flattens itself to the ground with eyes almost closed, flying only when the intruder is away. It may call or wing clap as it goes, and land as far as from where it was flushed. In the wintering area it often roosts on the ground but also uses tree branches up to high. Roost sites at both the breeding and wintering grounds are used regularly if they are undisturbed, sometimes for weeks at a time.

Like other nightjars, it will sit on roads or paths during the night and hover to investigate large intruders such as deer or humans. It may be mobbed by birds while there is still light, and by bats, other nightjar species or <a href="Eurasian%20woodcock">Eurasian woodcock</a>s during the night. Owls and other predators such as <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es will be mobbed by both male and female European nightjars. Like other aerial birds, such as <a href="swift">swift</a>s and <a href="swallow">swallow</a>s, nightjars make a quick plunge into water to wash. They have a unique serrated comb-like structure on the middle claw that is used to <a href="preening%20%28bird%29">preen</a> and perhaps remove parasites.

In cold or inclement weather, several nightjar species can slow their <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> and go into <a href="torpor">torpor</a>, notably the <a href="common%20poorwill">common poorwill</a>, which will maintain that state for weeks. The European nightjar has been observed in captivity to be able to maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown.

Breeding is normally from late May to August, but may be significantly earlier in northwest Africa or western Pakistan. Returning males arrive about two weeks before the females and establish territories which they patrol with wings held in a V-shape and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Fights may take place in flight or on the ground. The male's display flight involves a similar wing and tail position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral. If she lands, he continues to display with bobbing and fluttering until the female spreads her wings and tail for copulation. Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground. In good habitat, there may be 20 pairs per square kilometre (50 per square mile).

The European nightjar is normally <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>. There is no nest, and the eggs are laid on the ground among plants or tree roots, or beneath a bush or tree. The site may be bare ground, leaf litter or pine needles, and is used for a number of years. The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is usually one or two whitish eggs, rarely unmarked, but normally blotched with browns and greys. The eggs average and weigh , of which 6% is shell.

Several nightjar species are known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.

Eggs are laid 36–48 hours apart, and incubation, mainly by the female, starts with the first egg. The male may incubate for short periods, especially around dawn or dusk, but spends the day roosting, sometimes outside his territory or close to other males. If the female is disturbed while breeding, she runs or flutters along the ground feigning injury until she has drawn the intruder away. She may also move the eggs a short distance with her bill. Each egg hatches after about 17–21 days. The <a href="precocial">semi-precocial</a> downy chicks are mobile when hatched, but are brooded to keep them warm. They <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in 16–17 days and become independent of the adults around 32 days after hatching. A second brood may be raised by early nesting pairs, in which case the female leaves the first brood a few days before they fledge; the male then cares for the first brood and assists with the second. Both adults feed the young with balls of insects which are either regurgitated into the chick's mouth or pecked by the chick from the adult's open bill.

Broods that fail tend to do so during incubation. One English study showed that only 14.5% of eggs survived to hatching, but once that stage was reached the chances of fledging successfully were high. European nightjars breed when aged one year, and typically live for four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12 years.

The European nightjar feeds on a wide variety of flying insects, including <a href="moth">moth</a>s, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, <a href="mantis">mantis</a>es, <a href="dragonfly">dragonflies</a>, <a href="cockroach">cockroach</a>es and <a href="fly">flies</a>. It will pick <a href="glowworm">glowworm</a>s off vegetation. It consumes grit to aid with digesting its prey, but any plant material and non-flying invertebrates consumed are taken inadvertently while hunting other food items. Young chicks have been known to eat their own <a href="faeces">faeces</a>.

Birds hunt over open habitats and woodland clearings and edges, and may be attracted to insects concentrating around artificial lights, near farm animals or over stagnant ponds. They usually feed at night, but occasionally venture out on overcast days. Nightjars pursue insects with a light twisting flight, or flycatch from a perch; they may rarely take prey off the ground. They drink by dipping to the water surface as they fly. Breeding European nightjars travel on average from their nests to feed. Migrating birds live off their fat reserves.

European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting their prey against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly continuously on darker nights when prey is harder to see. Hunting frequency reduces in the middle of the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the <a href="chitin">chitin</a> <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, are regurgitated as <a href="pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellets</a>.

Nightjars have relatively large eyes, each with a <a href="tapetum%20lucidum">tapetum lucidum</a> (reflective layer behind the <a href="retina">retina</a>) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of <a href="rod%20cell">rod cell</a>s and far fewer <a href="cone%20cell">cone cell</a>s compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision at the expense of colour discrimination In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not <a href="Animal%20echolocation">echolocate</a>.

The eggs and chicks of this ground-nesting bird are vulnerable to predation by red foxes, <a href="pine%20marten">pine marten</a>s, <a href="European%20hedgehog">European hedgehog</a>s, <a href="least%20weasel">least weasel</a>s and domestic dogs, and by birds including <a href="crow">crow</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">Eurasian magpie</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20jay">Eurasian jay</a>s and owls. Snakes, such as <a href="common%20adder">common adder</a>s, may also rob the nest. Adults may be caught by birds of prey including <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>s, <a href="hen%20harrier">hen harrier</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>s, <a href="common%20buzzard">common buzzard</a>s, <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine</a> and <a href="sooty%20falcon">sooty falcon</a>s.

Parasites recorded on the European nightjar include a single species of <a href="Mallophaga">biting louse</a> found on the wings, and a <a href="Analgoidea">feather mite</a> that occurs only on the white wing markings. <a href="Avian%20malaria">Avian malaria</a> has also been recorded. The <a href="leucocytozoon">leucocytozoon</a> blood parasite "<a href="Leucocytozoon%20caprimulgi">L. caprimulgi</a>" is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity and the fact that it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.

Estimates of the European population of the European nightjar range from 470,000 to more than 1 million birds, suggesting a total global population of 2–6 million individuals. Although there appears to be a fall in numbers, it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The huge breeding range and population mean that this species is classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>.

The largest breeding populations are in Russia (up to 500,000 pairs), Spain (112,000 pairs) and Belarus (60,000 pairs). There have been declines in much of the range, but especially in northwestern Europe. The loss of insect prey through <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a> use, coupled with disturbance, collision with vehicles and habitat loss have contributed to the falling population. As ground-nesting birds, they are adversely affected by disturbance, especially by domestic dogs, which may destroy the nest or advertise its presence to crows or predatory mammals. Breeding success is higher in areas with no public access; where access is permitted, and particularly where dog owners allow their pets to run loose, successful nests tend to be far from footpaths or human habitation.

In Britain and elsewhere, commercial forestry has created new habitat which has increased numbers, but these gains are likely to be temporary as the woodland develops and becomes unsuitable for nightjars. In the United Kingdom, it is red-listed as a cause for concern, and in Ireland it is close to extinction.

Poets sometimes use the nightjar as an indicator of warm summer nights, as in <a href="George%20Meredith">George Meredith's</a> "Love in the Valley"
"Lone on the fir-branch, his rattle-notes unvaried/Brooding o'er the gloom, spins the brown eve-jar", <a href="Dylan%20Thomas">Dylan Thomas's</a>
"<a href="Fern%20Hill">Fern Hill</a>" "and all the night long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars/flying with the ricks", or <a href="William%20Wordsworth">Wordsworth's</a> "Calm is the fragrant air", "The busy dor-hawk chases the white moth/With burring note". Nightjars only sing when perched, and <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a> referenced the eerie silence of a hunting bird in "Afterwards": "If it be in the dusk when, like an eyelid's soundless blink/The dewfall-hawk comes crossing the shades to alight/Upon the wind-warped upland thorn".

"Caprimulgus" and the old name "goatsucker" both refer to the myth, old even in the time of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, that nightjars suckled from nanny goats, which subsequently ceased to give milk or went blind. This ancient belief is reflected in nightjar names in other European languages, such as German "Ziegenmelker", Polish "kozodój" and Italian "succiacapre", which also mean goatsucker, but despite its antiquity, it has no equivalents in Arab, Chinese or Hindu traditions. It is likely that the birds were attracted by insects around domestic animals, and, as strange nocturnal creatures, were then blamed for any misfortune that befell the beast. Another old name, "puckeridge", was used to refer to both the bird and a disease of farm animals, the latter actually caused by <a href="botfly">botfly</a> <a href="larva">larva</a>e under the skin. "Lich fowl" (corpse bird) is an old name which reflects the superstitions that surrounded this strange nocturnal bird. Like "gabble ratchet" (corpse hound), it may refer to the belief that the souls of unbaptised children were doomed to wander in nightjar form until <a href="Last%20Judgment">Judgement Day</a>.

Red-billed chough

The red-billed chough, Cornish chough or simply chough ( ; "Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax"), is a bird in the <a href="crow">crow</a> family, one of only two species in the genus "<a href="Pyrrhocorax">Pyrrhocorax</a>". Its eight <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> breed on mountains and coastal cliffs from the western coasts of Ireland and Britain east through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia, India and China.

This bird has glossy black plumage, a long curved red bill, red legs, and a loud, ringing call. It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread <a href="Primary%20feather">primaries</a>. The red-billed chough <a href="pair%20bond">pairs</a> for life and displays <a href="philopatry">fidelity</a> to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a wool-lined stick nest and lays three eggs. It feeds, often in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> prey.

Although it is subject to predation and parasitism, the main threat to this species is changes in agricultural practices, which have led to population decline, some local <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpation</a>, and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. The red-billed chough, which derived its common name from the <a href="jackdaw">jackdaw</a>, was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a> and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. The red-billed chough has been depicted on postage stamps of a few countries, including the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, with four different stamps, and The <a href="Gambia">Gambia</a>, where the bird does not occur.

The red-billed chough was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1758 as "Upupa pyrrhocorax". It was moved to its current genus, "Pyrrhocorax", by <a href="Marmaduke%20Tunstall">Marmaduke Tunstall</a> in his 1771 "Ornithologia Britannica". The genus name is derived from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "πυρρός (pyrrhos)", "flame-coloured", and "κόραξ (korax)", "raven". The only other member of the genus is the <a href="Alpine%20chough">Alpine chough</a>, "Pyrrhocorax graculus". The closest relatives of the choughs are the typical <a href="crow">crow</a>s, "Corvus", especially the jackdaws in the subgenus "<a href="Coloeus">Coloeus</a>".

"Chough" was originally an alternative <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a> name for the jackdaw, "Corvus monedula", based on its call. The similar red-billed species, formerly particularly common in Cornwall, became known initially as "Cornish chough" and then just "chough", the name transferring from one species to the other. The Australian <a href="white-winged%20chough">white-winged chough</a>, "Corcorax melanorhamphos", despite its similar shape and habits, is only distantly related to the true choughs, and is an example of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>.

There are eight extant <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, although differences between them are slight.


There is one known prehistoric form of the red-billed chough. "P. p. primigenius", a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> that lived in Europe during the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">last ice age</a>, which was described in 1875 by <a href="Alphonse%20Milne-Edwards">Alphonse Milne-Edwards</a> from finds in southwest France.

Detailed analysis of call similarity suggests that the Asiatic and Ethiopian races diverged from the western subspecies early in <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary history, and that Italian red-billed choughs are more closely allied to the North African subspecies than to those of the rest of Europe.

The adult of the "nominate" subspecies of the red-billed chough, "P. p. pyrrhocorax", is in length, has a wingspan, and weighs an average 310 grammes (10.9 oz). Its plumage is velvet-black, green-glossed on the body, and it has a long curved red bill and red legs. The sexes are similar (although adults can be sexed in the hand using a formula involving <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> length and bill width) but the juvenile has an orange bill and pink legs until its first autumn, and less glossy plumage.

The red-billed chough is unlikely to be confused with any other species of bird. Although the jackdaw and Alpine chough share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the Alpine chough has a short yellow bill. Even in flight, the two choughs can be distinguished by Alpine's less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.

The red-billed chough's loud, ringing "chee-ow" call is clearer and louder than the similar vocalisation of the jackdaw, and always very different from that of its yellow-billed <a href="Conspecificity">congener</a>, which has rippling "preep" and whistled "sweeeooo" calls. Small subspecies of the red-billed chough have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.

The red-billed chough breeds in Ireland, western Great Britain, the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, southern Europe and the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> basin, the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, and in mountainous country across <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, India and China, with two separate populations in the Ethiopian Highlands. It is a <a href="bird%20migration">non-migratory resident</a> throughout its range.

Its main habitat is high mountains; it is found between in North Africa, and mainly between in the Himalayas. In that mountain range it reaches in the summer, and has been recorded at altitude on <a href="Mount%20Everest">Mount Everest</a>. In the British Isles and <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> it also breeds on coastal sea cliffs, feeding on adjacent short grazed grassland or <a href="machair">machair</a>. It was formerly more widespread on coasts but has suffered from the loss of its specialised habitat. It tends to breed at a lower elevation than the Alpine chough, that species having a diet better adapted to high altitudes.

The red-billed chough breeds from three years of age, and normally raises only one brood a year, although the age at first breeding is greater in large populations. A pair exhibits strong mate and <a href="philopatry">site fidelity</a> once a <a href="pair%20bond">bond</a> is established. The bulky nest is composed of roots and stems of <a href="Calluna">heather</a>, <a href="furze">furze</a> or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair; in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live <a href="Himalayan%20tahr">Himalayan tahr</a>. The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or cliff face. In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep. Old buildings may be used, and in <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a> working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>n towns, including <a href="Ulaanbaatar">Ulaanbaatar</a>. The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where they are available.

The chough lays three to five eggs in size and weighing 15.7 grammes (0.55 oz), of which 6% is shell. They are spotted, not always densely, in various shades of brown and grey on a creamy or slightly tinted ground.
The egg size is independent of the clutch size and the nest site, but may vary between different females. The female <a href="avian%20incubation">incubates</a> for 17–18 days before the <a href="altricial">altricial</a> downy chicks are hatched, and is fed at the nest by the male. The female <a href="avian%20incubation">broods</a> the newly hatched chicks for around ten days, and then both parents share feeding and nest sanitation duties. The chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> 31–41 days after hatching.

Juveniles have a 43% chance of surviving their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, although an age of 17 years has been recorded. The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates with the number of young fledging each year and their survival rate. Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.

The red-billed chough's food consists largely of insects, spiders and other <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s taken from the ground, with <a href="ant">ant</a>s probably being the most significant item. The Central Asian subspecies "P. p. centralis" will perch on the backs of wild or domesticated <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s to feed on parasites. Although invertebrates make up most of the chough's diet, it will eat vegetable matter including fallen grain, and in the Himalayas has been reported as damaging <a href="barley">barley</a> crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn. In the Himalayas, they form large flocks in winter.

The preferred feeding habitat is short grass produced by grazing, for example by sheep and rabbits, the numbers of which are linked to the chough's breeding success. Suitable feeding areas can also arise where plant growth is hindered by exposure to coastal salt spray or poor soils. It will use its long curved bill to pick ants, <a href="dung%20beetle">dung beetle</a>s and emerging flies off the surface, or to dig for grubs and other invertebrates. The typical excavation depth of reflects the thin soils which it feeds on, and the depths at which many invertebrates occur, but it may dig to in appropriate conditions.

Where the two chough species occur together, there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively "<a href="Gagea">Gagea</a>" bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> <a href="larva">larva</a>e whereas Alpine choughs ate <a href="cranefly">cranefly</a> <a href="pupa">pupa</a>e. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough mainly consumed <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, <a href="fly">fly</a> larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.

The red-billed chough's predators include the <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20eagle-owl">Eurasian eagle-owl</a>, while the <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a> will take nestlings. In northern <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near <a href="lesser%20kestrel">lesser kestrel</a> colonies. This small <a href="insectivore">insectivorous</a> <a href="falcon">falcon</a> is better at detecting a predator and more vigorous in defence than its <a href="Corvidae">corvid</a> neighbours. The breeding success of the red-billed chough in the vicinity of the kestrels was found to be much higher than that of birds elsewhere, with a lower percentage of nest failures (16% near the falcon, 65% elsewhere).

This species is occasionally <a href="brood%20parasite">parasitised</a> by the <a href="great%20spotted%20cuckoo">great spotted cuckoo</a>, a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a> for which the <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">Eurasian magpie</a> is the primary host.
Red-billed choughs can acquire blood parasites such as "<a href="Plasmodium">Plasmodium</a>", but a study in Spain showed that the prevalence was less than one percent, and unlikely to affect the life history and conservation of this species. These low levels of parasitism contrast with a much higher prevalence in some other passerine groups; for example a study of <a href="thrush%20%28bird%29">thrushes</a> in Russia showed that "all" the <a href="fieldfare">fieldfare</a>s, <a href="redwing">redwing</a>s and <a href="song%20thrush">song thrush</a>es sampled carried haematozoans, particularly "Haemoproteus" and "<a href="Trypanosoma">Trypanosoma</a>".

Red-billed choughs can also carry <a href="mite">mite</a>s, but a study of the feather mite "<a href="Gabucinia%20delibata">Gabucinia delibata</a>", acquired by young birds a few months after fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually "improved" the body condition of its host. It is possible that the feather mites enhance feather cleaning and deter <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s, and may complement other feather care measures such as sunbathing, and <a href="anting%20%28bird%20activity%29">anting</a>—rubbing the plumage with ants (the <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a> from the insects deters parasites).

The red-billed chough has an extensive range, estimated at 10 million square kilometres (3.8 million sq mi), and a large population, including an estimated 86,000 to 210,000 individuals in Europe. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>.

However, the European range has declined and fragmented due to the loss of traditional pastoral farming, persecution and perhaps disturbance at breeding and nesting sites, although the numbers in <a href="France">France</a>, Great Britain and Ireland may now have stabilised. The European breeding population is between 12,265–17,370 pairs, but only in Spain is the species still widespread. Since in the rest of the continent breeding areas are fragmented and isolated, the red-billed chough has been categorised as "vulnerable" in Europe.

In Spain, the red-billed chough has recently expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings are threatened by human disturbance, persecution and the loss of old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.

A small group of wild red-billed chough arrived naturally in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> in 2001, and nested in the following year. This was the first English breeding record since 1947, and a slowly expanding population has bred every subsequent year.

In <a href="Jersey">Jersey</a>, the <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Trust">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, in partnership with the <a href="States%20of%20Jersey">States of Jersey</a> and the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Jersey">National Trust for Jersey</a> began a project in 2010, aimed at restoring selected areas of Jersey's coastline with the intention of returning those birds that had become locally extinct. The red-billed chough was chosen as a flagship species for this project, having been absent from Jersey since around 1900. Durrell initially received two pairs of choughs from <a href="Paradise%20Park%2C%20Cornwall">Paradise Park</a> in Cornwall and began a <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a> programme. In 2012, the red-billed choughs were living free in the central valley area of <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Park">Durrell Wildlife Park</a>, and the Trust expects colonisation of the coastal areas of Jersey in the following years.

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the red-billed chough, also known as 'sea-crow', was considered sacred to the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> <a href="Cronus">Cronus</a> and dwelt on <a href="Calypso%20%28mythology%29">Calypso's</a> 'Blessed Island', where "The birds of broadest wing their mansions form/The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow."

The red-billed chough has a long association with Cornwall, and appears on the Cornish <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>. According to Cornish legend <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a> did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated into the body of a red-billed chough, the red colour of its bill and legs being derived from the blood of the last battle and hence killing this bird was unlucky. Legend also holds that after the last Cornish chough departs from Cornwall, then the return of the chough, as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.

Up to the eighteenth century, the red-billed chough was associated with <a href="arson">fire-raising</a>, and was described by <a href="William%20Camden">William Camden</a> as "incendaria avis", "oftentime it secretly conveieth fire sticks, setting their houses afire". <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> was also familiar with this story:
It is counted little better than a kite, for it is of ravenous quality, and is very mischievous; it will steal and carry away any thing it finds about the house, that is not too heavy, tho' not fit for its food; as knives, forks, spoons and linnen cloths, or whatever it can fly away with, sometimes they say it has stolen bits of firebrands, or lighted candles, and lodged them in the stacks of corn, and the thatch of barns and houses, and set them on fire; but this I only had by oral tradition.

Not all mentions of "chough" refer to this species. Because of the origins of its name, when <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> writes of "the crows and choughs that wing the midway air" ["<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>", act 4, scene 6] or <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>'s Vermin Act of 1532 is "ordeyned to dystroye Choughes, Crowes and Rookes", they are clearly referring to the <a href="jackdaw">jackdaw</a>.

Since at least the 14th century, <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> has been <a href="attributed%20arms">attributed</a> a coat of arms consisting of three Cornish choughs on a silver field. The symbolism behind this is not known for certain; according to one legend, a chough strayed into the cathedral during Becket's murder, while another school of thought states that the choughs are a <a href="canting%20arms">canting</a> reference to Becket's name, as they were once known as "beckits". The latter theory does not stand up to scrutiny, as the use of the term "beckit" to mean a chough is not found before the 19th century. Regardless of its origin, the chough is still used in heraldry as a symbol of Becket, and appears in the arms of several persons and institutions associated with him, most prominently the city of <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>.

This species has been depicted on the stamps of <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, The Gambia, the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> and <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. It is the animal symbol of the island of <a href="La%20Palma">La Palma</a>.

In Britain, the Cornish chough was the emblem of the Royal Navy battlecruiser HMS "Hood".

Alpine chough

The Alpine chough (), or yellow-billed chough ("Pyrrhocorax graculus"), is a <a href="bird">bird</a> in the <a href="crow">crow</a> family, one of only two species in the genus "<a href="Pyrrhocorax">Pyrrhocorax</a>". Its two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> breed in high mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> to <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> and Nepal, and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird. The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen take-up and reduce water loss.

This bird has glossy black <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, a yellow beak, red legs, and distinctive calls. It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s. The Alpine chough <a href="pair%20bond">pairs</a> for life and displays <a href="philopatry">fidelity</a> to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a lined stick nest and lays three to five brown-blotched whitish eggs. It feeds, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> prey in summer and fruit in winter; it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food.

Although it is subject to predation and parasitism, and changes in agricultural practices have caused local population declines, this widespread and abundant species is not threatened globally. Climate change may present a long-term threat, by shifting the necessary Alpine habitat to higher altitudes.

The Alpine chough was first described as "Corvus graculus" by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in the "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1766. It was moved to its current genus, "Pyrrhocorax", by English <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="Marmaduke%20Tunstall">Marmaduke Tunstall</a> in his 1771 "Ornithologia Britannica", along with the only other member of the genus, the <a href="red-billed%20chough">red-billed chough</a>, " P. pyrrhocorax". The closest relatives of the choughs were formerly thought to be the typical <a href="crow">crow</a>s, "Corvus", especially the jackdaws in the subgenus "<a href="Coloeus">Coloeus</a>", but <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="cytochrome%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bb">cytochrome b</a> analysis shows that the genus "Pyrrhocorax", along with the <a href="ratchet-tailed%20treepie">ratchet-tailed treepie</a> (genus "Temnurus"), diverged early from the rest of the <a href="Corvidae">Corvidae</a>.

The genus name is derived from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "πύρρος (purrhos)", "flame-coloured", and "κόραξ (korax)", "raven". The species epithet "graculus" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for a jackdaw. The current binomial name of the Alpine chough was formerly sometimes applied to the red-billed chough. The English word "chough" was originally an alternative <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a> name for the <a href="jackdaw">jackdaw</a>, "Corvus monedula", based on its call. The red-billed chough, formerly particularly common in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> and known initially as the "Cornish chough", eventually became just "chough", the name transferring from one genus to another.

The Alpine chough has two extant subspecies.
<a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>n <a href="Paleontology">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Ferdinand%20Stoliczka">Ferdinand Stoliczka</a> separated the Himalayan population as a third subspecies, "P. g. forsythi", but this has not been widely accepted and is usually treated as <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a>ous with "digitatus". A <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> form from Europe was similar to the extant subspecies, and is sometimes categorised as "P. g. vetus".

The Australian <a href="white-winged%20chough">white-winged chough</a>, "Corcorax melanorhamphos", despite its similar bill shape and black plumage, is only distantly related to the true choughs.

The adult of the nominate subspecies of the Alpine chough has glossy black <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, a short yellow bill, dark brown <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>, and red legs. It is slightly smaller than red-billed chough, at length with a tail and a wingspan, but has a proportionally longer tail and shorter wings than its relative. It has a similar buoyant and easy flight. The sexes are identical in appearance although the male averages slightly larger than the female. The juvenile is duller than the adult with a dull yellow bill and brownish legs. The Alpine chough is unlikely to be confused with any other species; although the jackdaw and red-billed chough share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the red-billed chough has a long red bill.

The subspecies "P. g. digitatus" averages slightly larger than the nominate form, weighing against for "P. g. graculus", and it has stronger feet. This is in accordance with <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">Bergmann's rule</a>, which predicts that the largest birds should be found higher elevations or in colder and more arid regions. The extremities of the body, the bill and <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a>, were longer in warmer areas, in line with <a href="Allen%27s%20rule">Allen's rule</a>. Temperature seemed to be the most important cause of body variation in the Alpine chough.

The flight of the Alpine chough is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high manoeuvrability is accomplished by fanning the tail, folding its wings, and soaring in the <a href="Vertical%20draft">updraughts</a> at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.

The <a href="trill%20%28music%29">rippling</a> "preep" and whistled "sweeeooo" calls of the Alpine chough are quite different from the more typically <a href="crow">crow-like</a> "chee-ow" vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed chough. It also has a rolling "churr" <a href="alarm%20signal">alarm call</a>, and a variety of quiet warbles and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds. In a study of chough calls throughout the <a href="Palearctic%20ecozone">Palearctic region</a> it was found that call <a href="audio%20frequency">frequencies</a> in the Alpine chough showed an <a href="inverse%20relationship">inverse relationship</a> between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.

The Alpine Chough breeds in mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> across <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> and the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> to western China. There are also populations in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> and <a href="Crete">Crete</a>. It is a <a href="bird%20migration">non-migratory resident</a> throughout its range, although Moroccan birds have established a small colony near <a href="M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a> in southern Spain, and wanderers have reached <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> and <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>.

This is a high-altitude species normally breeding between in Europe, in Morocco, and in the Himalayas. It has nested at , higher than any other bird species, even surpassing the red-billed chough which has a diet less well adapted to the highest altitudes. It has been observed following mountaineers ascending <a href="Mount%20Everest">Mount Everest</a> at an altitude of . It usually nests in cavities and fissures on inaccessible rock faces, although locally it will use holes between rocks in fields, and forages in open habitats such as <a href="alpine%20meadow">alpine meadow</a>s and <a href="scree">scree slope</a>s to the <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a> or lower, and in winter will often congregate around human settlements, <a href="ski%20resort">ski resort</a>s, hotels and other tourist facilities. Its penchant for waiting by hotel windows for food is popular with tourists, but less so with hotel owners.

The Alpine chough is socially <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, showing high partner fidelity in summer and winter and from year to year. Nesting typically starts in early May, and is non-colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity. The bulky nests are composed of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair, and may be constructed on ledges, in a cave or similar fissure in a cliff face, or in an abandoned building. The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is 3–5 glossy whitish eggs, averaging in size, which are tinged with buff, cream or light-green and marked with small brown blotches; they are incubated by the female for 14–21 days before hatching. The chicks hatch with a dense covering of natal <a href="down%20feather">down</a>, in contrast to those of the red-billed chough which are almost naked, and <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in a further 29–31 days from hatching. The young birds are fed by both parents, and may also be fed by other adults when they have fledged and joined the flock. Breeding is possible in the high mountains because chough eggs have relatively fewer pores than those of lowland species, and lose less water by evaporation at low atmospheric pressure. The <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s of bird species that breed at high altitude also have <a href="haemoglobin">haemoglobin</a> with a genetically determined high affinity for oxygen.

In the western Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests in a greater variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and abandoned buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.

A study of three different European populations showed a mean clutch size of 3.6 eggs, producing 2.6 chicks, of which 1.9 fledged. Adult survival rate varied from 83 to 92%, with no significant difference detected between males and females. Survival of first-year birds was, at 77%, lower than that of adults. The availability or otherwise of human food supplied from tourist activities did not affect breeding success.

In the summer, the Alpine chough feeds mainly on <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s collected from pasture, such as <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s ("<a href="Selatosomus%20aeneus">Selatosomus aeneus</a>" and "<a href="Otiorhynchus%20morio">Otiorhynchus morio</a>" have been recorded from <a href="Pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellets</a>), <a href="snail">snail</a>s, <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s and <a href="fly">fly</a> <a href="larva">larva</a>e. The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including <a href="berry">berries</a> such as the European Hackberry ("<a href="Celtis%20australis">Celtis australis</a>") and Sea-buckthorn ("<a href="Sea-buckthorn">Hippophae rhamnoides</a>"), <a href="rose%20hip">rose hip</a>s, and domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of "<a href="Crocus%20vernus">Crocus vernus albiflorus</a>", including the <a href="Gynoecium">pistils</a>, perhaps as a source of <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a>s. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, <a href="landfill">refuse dump</a>s and <a href="picnic">picnic areas</a>. Where additional food is available, winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.

This bird always forages in groups, which are larger in winter than summer, and have constant composition in each season. Where food resources are restricted, adults dominate young birds, and males outrank females. Foraging areas change altitudinally through the year, depending on climatic factors, food availability and food quality. During the breeding season, birds remain above the <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a>, although they may use food provided by tourists at refuges and picnic areas.

Movement to lower levels begins after the first snowfalls, and feeding by day is mainly in or near valley bottoms when the snow cover deepens, although the birds return to the mountains to roost. In March and April the choughs frequent villages at valley tops or forage in snow-free patches prior to their return to the high meadows. Feeding trips may cover distance and in altitude. In the Alps, the development of skiing above has enabled more birds to remain at high levels in winter.

Where their ranges overlap, the two chough species may feed together in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively "<a href="Gagea">Gagea</a>" bulbs dug from the ground, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate <a href="crane%20fly">crane fly</a> <a href="pupa">pupa</a>e. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in <a href="juniper">juniper</a> forests where they feed on <a href="Juniper%20berry">juniper berries</a>, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region and at the same time of year, which feed by digging in the soil of terraced pastures of villages.

Predators of the choughs include the <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20eagle-owl">Eurasian eagle-owl</a>, while the <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a> will take nestlings.
Alpine choughs have been observed diving at a Tibetan <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>. It seems likely that this "<a href="mobbing">mobbing</a>" behaviour may be play activity to give practice for when genuine defensive measures may be needed to protect eggs or young.

The Alpine chough is a host of the widespread bird <a href="flea">flea</a> "Ceratophyllus vagabunda", two specialist chough fleas "Frontopsylla frontalis" and "F. laetus", a <a href="cestoda">cestode</a> "Choanotaenia pirinica", and various species of <a href="chewing%20louse">chewing lice</a> in the genera "<a href="Brueelia">Brueelia</a>", "<a href="Menacanthus">Menacanthus</a>" and "Philopterus".

The Alpine chough has an extensive though sometimes fragmented range, estimated at 1–10 million square kilometres (0.4–3.8 million sq mi), and a large population, including an estimated 260,000 to 620,000 individuals in Europe. The Corsican population has been estimated to comprise about 2,500 birds. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>.

At the greatest extent of the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a> around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within the last couple of centuries. In the <a href="Poland">Polish</a> <a href="Tatra%20Mountains">Tatra Mountains</a>, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where <a href="intensive%20farming">intensive farming</a> methods have been introduced, such as <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.

Choughs can be locally threatened by the accumulation of <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s and <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>, which would cause the species' preferred <a href="Alpine%20climate">Alpine climate</a> zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.

Australian magpie

The Australian magpie ("Gymnorhina tibicen") is a medium-sized black and white <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird native to <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and southern <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Although once considered to be three separate <a href="species">species</a>, it is now considered to be one, with nine recognised <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>. A member of the <a href="Artamidae">Artamidae</a>, the Australian magpie is placed in its own <a href="genus">genus</a> "Gymnorhina" and is most closely related to the <a href="black%20butcherbird">black butcherbird</a> ("Melloria quoyi"). It is not, however, closely related to the <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">European magpie</a>, which is a <a href="corvid">corvid</a>.

The adult Australian magpie is a fairly robust bird ranging from in length, with distinctive black and white <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, gold brown eyes and a solid wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bill. The male and female are similar in appearance, and can be distinguished by differences in back markings. The male has pure white feathers on the back of the head and the female has white blending to grey feathers on the back of the head. With its long legs, the Australian magpie walks rather than waddles or hops and spends much time on the ground.

Described as one of Australia's most accomplished <a href="songbird">songbird</a>s, the Australian magpie has an array of complex vocalisations. It is <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a>, with the bulk of its varied diet made up of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. This species is commonly fed by households around the country, but in spring a small minority of breeding magpies (almost always males) become aggressive and swoop and attack those who approach their nests.

Over 1000 Australian magpies were introduced into <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> from 1864 to 1874 but have subsequently been accused of displacing native birds and are now treated as a pest species. Introductions also occurred in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> and <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, where the birds are not considered an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>. The Australian magpie is the mascot of several Australian sporting teams, most notably the <a href="Collingwood%20Football%20Club">Collingwood Magpies</a>, <a href="Western%20Suburbs%20Magpies">the Western Suburbs Magpies</a> and <a href="Port%20Adelaide%20Magpies">Port Adelaide Magpies</a>.

The Australian magpie was first described by English ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1801 as "Coracias tibicen", the type collected in the <a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a> region. Its <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "tibicen" "flute-player" or "piper" in reference to the bird's melodious call. An early recorded vernacular name is "piping poller", written on a painting by <a href="Thomas%20Watling">Thomas Watling</a>, one of a group known collectively as the <a href="Port%20Jackson%20Painter">Port Jackson Painter</a>, sometime between 1788 and 1792. "Tarra-won-nang", or "djarrawunang", "wibung", and "marriyang" were names used by the local <a href="Eora">Eora</a> and <a href="Darug%20people">Darug</a> inhabitants of the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a>. "Booroogong" and "garoogong" were <a href="Wiradjuri">Wiradjuri</a> words, and "carrak" was a Jardwadjali term from Victoria. Among the <a href="Kamilaroi">Kamilaroi</a>, it is "burrugaabu", "galalu", or "guluu". It was known as "Warndurla" among the <a href="Yinjibarndi%20language">Yindjibarndi</a> people of the central and western <a href="Pilbara">Pilbara</a>. Other names used include "piping crow-shrike", "piper", "maggie", "flute-bird" and "organ-bird". The term "bell-magpie" was proposed to help distinguish it from the European magpie but failed to gain wide acceptance.

The bird was named for its similarity in colouration to the <a href="European%20magpie">European magpie</a>; it was a common practice for early settlers to name plants and animals after European counterparts. However, the European magpie is a member of the <a href="Corvidae">Corvidae</a>, while its Australian counterpart is placed in the family <a href="Artamidae">Artamidae</a> (although both are members of a broad <a href="corvida">corvid</a> lineage). The Australian magpie's affinities with <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s and <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s were recognised early on and the three genera were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by <a href="John%20Albert%20Leach">John Albert Leach</a> after he had studied their musculature. American ornithologists <a href="Charles%20Sibley">Charles Sibley</a> and <a href="Jon%20Edward%20Ahlquist">Jon Ahlquist</a> recognised the close relationship between <a href="woodswallow">woodswallow</a>s and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini <a href="clade">clade</a>, in the Artamidae. The Australian magpie is placed in its own <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus "Gymnorhina" which was introduced by the English zoologist <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a> in 1840. The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek "gumnos" for "naked" or "bare" and "rhis", "rhinos" "nostrils". Some authorities such as <a href="Glen%20Milton%20Storr">Glen Storr</a> in 1952 and <a href="Leslie%20Christidis">Leslie Christidis</a> and Walter Boles in their 2008 checklist, have placed the Australian magpie in the butcherbird genus "<a href="Cracticus">Cracticus</a>", arguing that its adaptation to ground-living is not enough to consider it a separate genus. A molecular genetic study published in a 2013 showed that the Australian magpie is a <a href="Sister%20group">sister taxon</a> to the <a href="black%20butcherbird">black butcherbird</a> ("Melloria quoyi") and that the two species are in turn sister to a clade that includes the other butcherbirds in the genus "Cracticus". The ancestor to the two species is thought to have split from the other butcherbirds between 8.3 and 4.2 million years ago, during the late Miocene to early Pliocene, while the two species themselves diverged sometime during the Pliocene (5.8–3.0 million years ago).

The Australian magpie was subdivided into three species in the literature for much of the twentieth century—the black-backed magpie ("G. tibicen"), the white-backed magpie ("G. hypoleuca"), and the western magpie ("G. dorsalis"). They were later noted to <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridise</a> readily where their territories crossed, with hybrid grey or striped-backed magpies being quite common. This resulted in them being reclassified as one species by <a href="Julian%20Ralph%20Ford">Julian Ford</a> in 1969, with most recent authors following suit.

There are currently thought to be nine subspecies of the Australian magpie, although there are large zones of overlap with intermediate forms between the taxa. There is a tendency for birds to become larger with increasing latitude, the southern subspecies being larger than those further north, except the Tasmanian form which is small. The original form, known as the black-backed magpie and classified as "Gymnorhina tibicen", has been split into four black-backed races:


The white-backed magpie, originally described as "Gymnorhina hypoleuca" by <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> in 1837, has also been split into races:


The adult magpie is a fairly solid, sturdy bird ranging from in length with a wingspan, and weighing . Its robust wedge-shaped bill is bluish-white bordered with black, with a small hook at the tip. The black legs are long and strong. The plumage is pure glossy black and white; both sexes of all subspecies have black heads, wings and underparts with white shoulders. The tail has a black terminal band. The nape is white in the male and light greyish-white in the female. Mature magpies have dull red eyes, in contrast to the yellow eyes of currawongs and white eyes of Australian ravens and crows. The main difference between the subspecies lies in the "saddle" markings on the back below the nape. Black-backed subspecies have a black saddle and white nape. White-backed subspecies have a wholly white nape and saddle. The male Western Australian subspecies "dorsalis" is also white-backed, but the equivalent area in the female is scalloped black.

Juveniles have lighter greys and browns amidst the starker blacks and whites of their plumage; two- or three-year-old birds of both sexes closely resemble and are difficult to distinguish from adult females. Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age. Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age, though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded. The reported age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is between the ages of three and five years.

Well-known and easily recognisable, the Australian magpie is unlikely to be confused with any other species. The <a href="pied%20butcherbird">pied butcherbird</a> has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The <a href="magpie-lark">magpie-lark</a> is a much smaller and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.

One of Australia's most highly regarded songbirds, the Australian magpie has a wide variety of calls, many of which are complex. Pitch may vary as much as four octaves, and the bird can mimic over 35 species of native and introduced bird species, as well as dogs and horses. Magpies have even been noted to mimic human speech when living in close proximity to humans. Its complex, musical, warbling call is one of the most familiar Australian bird sounds. In <a href="Denis%20Glover">Denis Glover</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Magpies">The Magpies</a>", the mature magpie's call is described as "quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle", one of the most famous lines in New Zealand poetry, and as "waddle giggle gargle paddle poodle", in the children's book "Waddle Giggle Gargle" by <a href="Pamela%20Allen">Pamela Allen</a>.

When alone, a magpie may make a quiet musical warbling; these complex melodious warbles or subsongs are pitched at 2–4 K<a href="Hertz">Hz</a> and do not carry for long distances. These songs have been recorded up to 70 minutes in duration and are more frequent after the end of the breeding season. Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling known as "carolling" to advertise or defend their territory; one bird initiates the call with the second (and sometimes more) joining in. Often preceded by warbling, carolling is pitched between 6 and 8 kHz and has 4–5 elements with slurring indistinct noise in between. Birds will adopt a specific posture by tilting their heads back, expanding their chests, and moving their wings backwards. A group of magpies will sing a short repetitive version of carolling just before dawn ("dawn song"), and at twilight after sundown ("dusk song"), in winter and spring.

Fledgling and juvenile magpies emit a repeated short and loud (80 <a href="Decibel">dB</a>), high-pitched (8 kHz) <a href="Begging%20behavior%20in%20animals">begging call</a>. Magpies may indulge in beak-clapping to warn other species of birds. They employ several high pitched (8–10 kHz) alarm or rallying calls when intruders or threats are spotted. Distinct calls have been recorded for the approach of eagles and monitor lizards.

The Australian magpie is found in the <a href="Trans%20Fly%20savanna%20and%20grasslands">Trans-Fly region</a> of southern New Guinea, between the <a href="Oriomo%20River">Oriomo River</a> and <a href="Muli%20Strait">Muli Strait</a>, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York</a>, the <a href="Gibson%20Desert">Gibson</a> and <a href="Great%20Sandy%20Desert">Great Sandy Desert</a>s, and southwest of Tasmania. Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into New Zealand by local <a href="Acclimatisation%20society">Acclimatisation Societies</a> of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington Acclimatisation Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed forms are spread on both the North and eastern South Island, while black-backed forms are found in the <a href="Hawke%27s%20Bay%20region">Hawke's Bay region</a>. Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951. They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the <a href="tui%20%28bird%29">tui</a> and <a href="kereru">kereru</a>, sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings, although studies by <a href="Waikato%20University">Waikato University</a> have cast doubt on this, and much blame on the magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only. Introductions also occurred in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western <a href="Taveuni">Taveuni</a> in <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, however.

The Australian magpie prefers open areas such as grassland, fields and residential areas such as parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly on the ground in these open areas. It has also been recorded in mature <a href="pine%20plantation">pine plantation</a>s; birds only occupy rainforest and wet <a href="sclerophyll%20forest">sclerophyll forest</a> in the vicinity of cleared areas. In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the <a href="masked%20lapwing">masked lapwing</a> ("Vanellus miles") have been implicated.

The Australian magpie is almost exclusively <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a>, although it may call into the night, like some other members of the Artamidae. Natural predators of magpies include various species of <a href="monitor%20lizard">monitor lizard</a> and the <a href="barking%20owl">barking owl</a>. Birds are often killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing and eating <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>s or mice, rats or rabbits targeted with baiting. The <a href="Australian%20raven">Australian raven</a> may take nestlings left unattended.
On the ground, the Australian magpie moves around by walking, and is the only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, although birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.

The magpie is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy and defend the same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a <a href="bird%20of%20prey">raptor</a> results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves either side of the bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the "negotiating display", the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory while the rest of the group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a "group strength display", employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.

A wide variety of displays are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The "manus flutter" is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primary feathers</a> in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting to bring down the leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as <a href="blue-faced%20honeyeater">blue-faced honeyeater</a>s and <a href="Australasian%20pipit">Australasian pipit</a>s.

Magpies have a long breeding season which varies in different parts of the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated. Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork, often in an exposed position. The trees used are most commonly <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a>s, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced <a href="pine">pine</a>, "<a href="Crataegus">Crataegus</a>", and <a href="elm">elm</a> have been recorded. Other bird species, such as the <a href="yellow-rumped%20thornbill">yellow-rumped thornbill</a> ("Acanthiza chrysorrhoa"), <a href="willie%20wagtail">willie wagtail</a> ("Rhipidura leucophrys"), <a href="southern%20whiteface">southern whiteface</a> ("Aphelocephala leucopsis"), and (less commonly) <a href="noisy%20miner">noisy miner</a> ("Manorina melanocephala"), often nest in the same tree as the magpie. The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest, while the diminutive <a href="striated%20pardalote">striated pardalote</a> ("Pardalotus striatus") has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the magpie nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies. The <a href="channel-billed%20cuckoo">channel-billed cuckoo</a> ("Scythrops novaehollandiae") is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings.
The Australian magpie produces a clutch of two to five light blue or greenish <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>, which are oval in shape and about . The chicks hatch synchronously around 20 days after <a href="Egg%20incubation">incubation</a> begins; like all <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, the chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>—they are born pink, naked, and blind with large feet, a short broad beak and a bright red throat. Their eyes are fully open at around 10 days. Chicks develop fine downy feathers on their head, back and wings in the first week, and pinfeathers in the second week. The black and white colouration is noticeable from an early stage. Nestlings are fed exclusively by the female, though the male magpie will feed his partner. The Australian magpie is known to engage in <a href="cooperative%20breeding">cooperative breeding</a>, and helper birds will assist in feeding and raising young. This does vary from region to region, and with the size of the group—the behaviour is rare or nonexistent in pairs or small groups.
Juvenile magpies begin foraging on their own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year. The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.

The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items located at or near ground level including invertebrates such as <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s, <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s, <a href="snail">snail</a>s, <a href="spider">spider</a>s and <a href="scorpion">scorpion</a>s as well as a wide variety of <a href="insect">insect</a>s—<a href="cockroach">cockroach</a>es, ants, beetles, <a href="cicada">cicada</a>s, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult <a href="grasshoppers">grasshoppers</a>, may be seized mid-flight. <a href="Skink">Skink</a>s, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet. It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous <a href="cane%20toad">cane toad</a> by flipping it over and consuming the underparts. Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae. One study showed birds were able to find <a href="Scarabaeidae">scarab beetle</a> larvae by sound or vibration. Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food. Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.

Magpies are ubiquitous in urban areas all over Australia, and have become accustomed to people. A small percentage of birds become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to early - mid October, and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby. Attacks begin as the eggs hatch, increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow, and tail off as the chicks leave the nest.

The percentage has been difficult to estimate but is significantly less than 9%. Almost all attacking birds (around 99%) are male, and they are generally known to attack pedestrians at around from their nest, and cyclists at around . There appears to be some specificity in choice of attack targets, with the majority of individuals specializing on either pedestrians or cyclists. Smaller - especially younger - people, lone people, and people travelling quickly (i.e., runners and cyclists) appear to be targeted most often by swooping magpies. Anecdotal evidence suggests that if a magpie sees a human trying to rescue a chick that has fallen from its nest, the bird will view this help as predation, and will become more aggressive to humans from then on.

Magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly "snap" their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder's (usually a cyclist's) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim's chest and pecking at the face and eyes.
Magpie attacks can cause injuries, typically wounds to the head, and being unexpectedly swooped while cycling can result in loss of control of the bicycle, which may cause injury.

If it is necessary to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire's hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides of the head and neck.

Magpies prefer to swoop at the back of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can discourage the bird. A basic disguise such as sunglasses worn on the back of the head may fool the magpie as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.

Cyclists can deter attack by attaching a long pole with a flag to a bike, and the use of <a href="cable%20tie">cable tie</a>s on helmets has become common and appears to be effective.

Magpies are a protected native species in Australia, so it is illegal to kill or harm them. However, this protection is removed in some Australian states if a magpie attacks a human, allowing for the bird to be killed if it is considered particularly aggressive (such a provision is made, for example, in section 54 of the South Australian <a href="National%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20Act%201972">National Parks and Wildlife Act</a>). More commonly, an aggressive bird will be caught and relocated to an unpopulated area. Magpies have to be moved some distance as almost all are able to find their way home from distances of less than . Removing the nest is of no use as birds will breed again and possibly be more aggressive the second time around.

Some claim that swooping can be prevented by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, will return to the same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.

The Australian magpie featured in aboriginal folklore around Australia. The <a href="Yinjibarndi%20language">Yindjibarndi</a> people of the <a href="Pilbara">Pilbara</a> in the northwest of the country used the bird as a signal for sunrise, frightening them awake with its call. They were also familiar with its highly territorial nature, and it features in a song in their "Burndud", or songs of customs. It was a totem bird of the people of the Illawarra region south of Sydney.

Under the name <a href="piping%20shrike">piping shrike</a>, the white-backed magpie was declared the official emblem of the <a href="Government%20of%20South%20Australia">Government of South Australia</a> in 1901 by Governor <a href="Hallam%20Tennyson%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a>, and has featured on the South Australian flag since 1904. The magpie is a commonly used emblem of sporting teams in Australia, and its brash, cocky attitude has been likened to the Australian psyche. Such teams tend to wear uniforms with black and white stripes. The <a href="Collingwood%20Football%20Club">Collingwood Football Club</a> adopted the magpie from a visiting South Australian representative team in 1892. The <a href="Port%20Adelaide%20Magpies%20Football%20Club">Port Adelaide Magpies</a> would similarly adopt the black and white colours and Magpie name in 1902. Other examples include Brisbane's <a href="Souths%20Logan%20Magpies">Souths Logan Magpies</a>, and Sydney's <a href="Western%20Suburbs%20Magpies">Western Suburbs Magpies</a>. Disputes over who has been the first club to adopt the magpie emblem have been heated at times. Another club, <a href="Glenorchy%20Football%20Club">Glenorchy Football Club</a> of Tasmania, was forced to change uniform design when placed in the same league as another club (<a href="Claremont%20Magpies">Claremont Magpies</a>) with the same emblem.

In New Zealand, the <a href="Hawke%27s%20Bay%20Rugby%20Union">Hawke's Bay Rugby Union</a> team, from <a href="Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand">Napier, New Zealand</a>, is also known as the magpies. One of the best-known New Zealand poems is "<a href="The%20Magpies">The Magpies</a>" by <a href="Denis%20Glover">Denis Glover</a>, with its refrain "Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle", imitating the sound of the bird – and the popular New Zealand comic "<a href="Footrot%20Flats">Footrot Flats</a>" features a magpie character by the name of Pew.

An <a href="online%20poll">online poll</a> conducted by "<a href="Guardian%20Australia">Guardian Australia</a>" and <a href="BirdLife%20Australia">BirdLife Australia</a> was held in late 2017 to choose the "Australian Bird of the Year". The Australian magpie won the contest with 19,926 votes (13.3%), narrowly ahead of the <a href="Australian%20white%20ibis">Australian white ibis</a>.

New York Dolls (album)

New York Dolls is the debut <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by the American <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> band <a href="New%20York%20Dolls">New York Dolls</a>. It was released on July 27, 1973, by <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a>.

In the years leading up to the album, the New York Dolls had developed a local fanbase by playing regularly in <a href="lower%20Manhattan">lower Manhattan</a> after forming in 1971. However, most <a href="record%20producer">music producer</a>s and record companies were reluctant to work with them because of their vulgarity and onstage fashion; the group later appeared in exaggerated <a href="drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a> on the album cover for shock value.

After signing a contract with Mercury, the New York Dolls recorded their first album at <a href="Record%20Plant">The Record Plant</a> in New York City with producer <a href="Todd%20Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>, who was known for his sophisticated <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer <a href="David%20Johansen">David Johansen</a> and guitarist <a href="Sylvain%20Sylvain">Sylvain Sylvain</a> later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporated carefree <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>, <a href="Brill%20Building%20pop">Brill Building pop</a> influences, and <a href="camp%20%28style%29">campy</a> sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explored themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity.

"New York Dolls" was met with widespread critical acclaim but sold poorly and polarized listeners. The band proved difficult to market outside their native New York and developed a reputation for rock-star excesses while touring the United States in support of the album. Despite its commercial failure, "New York Dolls" was an influential precursor to the 1970s <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> movement and has since been named in various publications as one of the best debut records in <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> and one of the greatest albums of all time.

In 1971, vocalist <a href="David%20Johansen">David Johansen</a> formed the New York Dolls with guitarists <a href="Johnny%20Thunders">Johnny Thunders</a> and <a href="Rick%20Rivets">Rick Rivets</a>, bassist <a href="Arthur%20Kane">Arthur Kane</a>, and drummer <a href="Billy%20Murcia">Billy Murcia</a>; Rivets was replaced by <a href="Sylvain%20Sylvain">Sylvain Sylvain</a> in 1972. The band was meant to be a temporary project for the members, who were club-going youths that had gone to New York City with different career pursuits. As Sylvain recalled, "We just said 'Hey, maybe this will get us some chicks.' That seemed like a good enough reason." He and Murcia originally planned to work in the clothing business and opened a boutique on Lexington Avenue that was across the street from a toy repair shop called <a href="the%20New%20York%20Dolls%20Hospital">the New York Dolls Hospital</a>, which gave them the idea for their name. The group soon began playing regularly in <a href="lower%20Manhattan">lower Manhattan</a> and earned a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a> within a few months with their reckless style of <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>. Nonetheless, record companies were hesitant to sign them because of their onstage <a href="cross-dressing">cross-dressing</a> and blatant vulgarity. In October 1972, they garnered the interest of critics when they opened for English rock band <a href="Faces%20%28band%29">the Faces</a> at the <a href="Wembley%20Arena">Empire Pool</a> in Wembley. However, on the New York Dolls' first tour of England that year, Murcia died after consuming a lethal combination of alcohol and <a href="methaqualone">methaqualone</a>. They enlisted <a href="Jerry%20Nolan">Jerry Nolan</a> as his replacement, while managers <a href="Marty%20Thau">Marty Thau</a>, Steve Leber, and David Krebs still struggled to find the band a <a href="recording%20contract">record deal</a>.

After returning to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as <a href="Max%27s%20Kansas%20City">Max's Kansas City</a> and the <a href="Mercer%20Arts%20Center">Mercer Arts Center</a> in what Sylvain called a determined effort to <a href="Fake%20it%20%27til%20you%20make%20it">"fake it until they could make it"</a>: "We had to make ourselves "feel" famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass '<a href="Excalibur">Excalibur</a>' after <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a>. It was crazy." Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a> publicity director Bud Scoppa, and <a href="Paul%20Nelson%20%28critic%29">Paul Nelson</a>, an <a href="A%26amp%3BR">A&R</a> executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of <a href="the%20Rolling%20Stones">the Rolling Stones</a>: "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he called me and said, 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' Then, after that, I fell in love with them anyway." In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a <a href="US%20%24">US $</a>25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.

For the New York Dolls' debut album, Mercury wanted to find a record producer who could make the most out of the group's sound and the hype they had received from critics and fans in New York. At the band's first board meeting in Chicago, Johansen fell asleep in Mercury's conference room while record executives discussed potential producers. He awoke when they mentioned <a href="Todd%20Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>, a musician and producer who by 1972 had achieved unexpected rock stardom with his double album "<a href="Something/Anything%3F">Something/Anything?</a>" and its hit singles "<a href="I%20Saw%20the%20Light%20%28Todd%20Rundgren%20song%29">I Saw the Light</a>" and "<a href="Hello%20It%27s%20Me">Hello It's Me</a>". Rundgren had socialized at venues such as Max's Kansas City and first saw the New York Dolls when his girlfriend at the time, model <a href="Bebe%20Buell">Bebe Buell</a>, brought him there to see them play.

Known for having refined <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become increasingly interested in <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> sounds by the time he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls' debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. "The Dolls weren't out to expand any musical horizons", said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders' "attitude" and Johansen's charismatic antics onstage. Johansen referred to Rundgren as "an expert on second rate rock 'n' roll", but also said the band was "kind of <a href="persona%20non%20grata">persona non grata</a>, at the time, with most producers. They were afraid of us, I don't know why, but Todd wasn't. We all liked him from Max's ... Todd was cool and he was a producer." Sylvain, on the other hand, felt the decision to enlist him was based on availability, time, and money: "It wasn't a long list. Todd was in New York and seemed like he could handle the pace." Upon being hired, Rundgren declared that "the only person who can produce a New York record is someone who lives in New York".

Mercury booked the New York Dolls at <a href="Record%20Plant">The Record Plant</a> in New York City, where they recorded their self-titled debut album in April 1973. Rundgren was originally concerned that they had taken "the worst sounding studio in the city at that time" because it was the only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: "The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate." "New York Dolls" was recorded in eight days on a budget of $17,000 (equivalent to $ in ). With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, "we went into a room and just recorded. It wasn't like these people who conceptualize things. It was just a document of what was going on at the time."

In the studio, the New York Dolls dressed in their usual flashy clothes. Rundgren, who did not approve of their raucous sound, at one point yelled at them during the sessions to "get the glitter out of your asses and play". Sylvain recalled Rundgren inviting Buell and their Chihuahua to the studio and putting the latter atop an expensive <a href="mixing%20console">mixing console</a>, while Johansen acknowledged that his recollections of the sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them: "It was like the 1920s, with palm tree décor and stuff. Well, that's how I remember it, anyway." He also said Rundgren directed the band from the <a href="recording%20studio">control room</a> with engineer <a href="Jack%20Douglas%20%28record%20producer%29">Jack Douglas</a> and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album. According to Scopa, the group's carefree lifestyle probably conflicted with Rundgren's professional work ethic and schedule: "He doesn't put up with bullshit. I mean, [the band] rarely started their live sets before midnight, so who knows? Todd was very much in charge in the studio, however, and I got the impression that everybody was looking to him."

Although Sylvain said Rundgren was not an interfering producer, he occasionally involved himself to improve a <a href="take">take</a>. Sylvain recalled moments when Rundgren went into the <a href="Recording%20studio%23Isolation%20booth">isolation booth</a> with Nolan when he struggled keeping a beat and drummed out beats on a <a href="cowbell">cowbell</a> for him to use as a <a href="click%20track">click track</a>. During another session, he stopped a take and walked out of the control room to plug in Kane's bass <a href="Loudspeaker%20enclosure">cabinet</a>. Scoppa, who paid afternoon visits to the studio, overheard Rundgren say, "Yeah, that's all you needed. Okay, let's try it again!", and ultimately found the exchange funny and indicative of Rundgren's opinion of the band: "Todd was such a 'musician' while they were just getting by on attitude and energy. But as disdainful as he appeared to be at some points he got the job done really well." Rundgren felt Johansen's wild singing often sounded screamed or drunken but were eloquent in the sense that Johansen demonstrated a "propensity to incorporate certain cultural references into the music", particularly on "<a href="Personality%20Crisis%20%28song%29">Personality Crisis</a>". While recording the song, Johansen walked back into the control room and asked Rundgren if his vocals sounded "ludicrous enough".

Because the New York Dolls had little money, Sylvain and Thunders played the austerely designed and affordable <a href="Gibson%20Les%20Paul%20Junior">Gibson Les Paul Junior</a> guitars on the record. They jokingly referred to them as "automatic guitars" due to their limited <a href="electric%20guitar%23Built-in%20sound%20shaping">sound shaping</a> features. To amplify their guitars, they ran a <a href="Marshall%201959">Marshall Plexi</a> standalone amplifier through the speaker cabinets of a <a href="Fender%20Showman">Fender Dual Showman</a>, and occasionally used a <a href="Fender%20Twin%20Reverb">Fender Twin Reverb</a>. Some songs were embellished with additional instruments, including Buddy Bowser's brassy saxophone on "Lonely Planet Boy". Johansen sang into <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">distorted</a> guitar <a href="Pickup%20%28music%20technology%29">pickups</a> for additional vocals and <a href="overdubbing">overdubbed</a> them into the song. He also played an Asian <a href="gong">gong</a> for "Vietnamese Baby" and harmonica on "Pills". For "Personality Crisis", Sylvain originally played on The Record Plant's Yamaha <a href="grand%20piano">grand piano</a> before Rundgren added his own piano flourishes to both that song and "Private World". Rundgren also contributed to the background vocals heard on "<a href="Trash%20%28New%20York%20Dolls%20song%29">Trash</a>" and played synthesizers on "Vietnamese Baby" and "Frankenstein (Orig.)", which Sylvain recalled: "I remember him getting those weird sounds from this beautiful old <a href="Moog%20synthesizer">Moog synthesizer</a> he brought in. He said it was a model that only he and <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> had."

"New York Dolls" was <a href="audio%20mixing">mixed</a> in less than half a day. Rundgren felt the band seemed distracted and disinterested at that point, so he tried unsuccessfully to ban them from the mixing session. For the final mix, he minimized the sound of Nolan's drumming. In retrospect, Rundgren said the quality of the mix was poor because the band had hurried and questioned him while mixing the record: "It's too easy for it to become a free-for-all, with every musician only hearing their own part and not the whole. They all had other places to be, so rather than split, they rushed the thing and if that wasn't enough they took it to the crappy <a href="audio%20mastering">mastering</a> lab that Mercury had put them in." Thunders famously complained to a journalist that Rundgren "fucked up the mix" on "New York Dolls", adding to stories that the two had clashed during the album's recording. Both Johansen and Scoppa later said they did not see any conflict between the two and that Thunders' typically foolish behavior was misinterpreted. Johansen later praised Rundgren for how he enhanced and <a href="Equalization%20%28audio%29">equalized</a> each instrument, giving listeners the impression that "[they're] in a room and there's a band playing", while Sylvain said his mix accurately captured how the band sounded live.

"New York Dolls" features 10 original songs and 1 <a href="cover%20song">cover</a>—the 1963 <a href="Bo%20Diddley">Bo Diddley</a> song "Pills". Johansen described the album as "a little jewel of urban folk art". Rundgren, on the other hand, said the band's sensibilities were different from "the urban New York thing" because they had been raised outside <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and drew on carefree <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> and <a href="Brill%20Building">Brill Building</a> pop influences such as <a href="the%20Shangri-Las">the Shangri-Las</a>: "Their songs, as punky as they were, usually had a lot to do with the same old boy-girl thing but in a much more inebriated way." Johansen quoted the lyric "you'd best believe I'm in love L-U-V" from the Shangri-Las' "<a href="Give%20Him%20a%20Great%20Big%20Kiss">Give Him a Great Big Kiss</a>" (1964) when he opened "Looking for a Kiss", which tells a story of adolescent romantic desire hampered by peers who use drugs. On "Subway Train", he used lyrics from the American folk standard "<a href="Someone%27s%20in%20the%20Kitchen%20with%20Dinah">Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah</a>". In the opinion of critic <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a>, the album's rowdy <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> songs also revamped <a href="riff%20%28music%29">riffs</a> from <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a> and the Rolling Stones, resulting in music that sounded edgy and threatening in spite of the New York Dolls' wittingly <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a> and <a href="camp%20%28style%29">camp</a> sensibilities. "Personality Crisis" featured raunchy dual guitars, <a href="boogie-woogie">boogie-woogie</a> piano, and a histrionic pause, while "Trash" was a punky <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a> song with brassy singing. 

Several songs on "New York Dolls" function as what <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a> deemed "colorful, if exaggerated, expressions of teen <a href="social%20alienation">alienation</a>". According to <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, because many of Manhattan's white youths were wealthy and somewhat artsy, only ill-behaved young people from the <a href="outer%20boroughs">outer boroughs</a> like the band could "capture the oppressive excitement Manhattan holds for a half-formed human being". "Private World", an <a href="escapism">escapist</a> plea for stability, was co-written by Kane, who rarely contributed as a songwriter and felt overwhelmed as a young adult in the music business. Johansen, the band's main lyricist, said "Frankenstein (Orig.)" was about "how kids come to Manhattan from all over, they're kind of like whipped dogs, they're very repressed. Their bodies and brains are disoriented from each other ... it's a love song." Its <a href="Frankenstein%27s%20monster">titular monster</a> was interpreted by critic Frank Kogan to be the personification of New York and its ethos—"the ostentation and the terror, the dreams and the fear"—while Johansen asking listeners if they "could make it with Frankenstein" involved more than sexual slang: "David was asking if you—if I—could make it with the monster of life, whether I could embrace life in all its pain and dreams and disaster." Sylvain jokingly said "Frankenstein" was titled with the parenthetical qualifier because rock musician <a href="Edgar%20Winter">Edgar Winter</a> had released his <a href="Frankenstein%20%28instrumental%29">song of the same name</a> before the band could record their own: "Our song 'Frankenstein' was a big hit in our live show ... Now, his thing didn't sound at all like ours, but I'm sure he stole our title."

Although the New York Dolls exhibited <a href="tongue-in-cheek">tongue-in-cheek</a> qualities, <a href="Gary%20Graff">Gary Graff</a> observed a streetwise realism in the album's songs. In Christgau's opinion, Johansen's colloquial and morally superior lyrics were imbued with humor and a sense of human limits in songs whose fundamental theme was authenticity. This theme was explored in stories about lost youths, as on "Subway Train", or in a study of a specific subject, such as the "schizy imagemonger" on "Personality Crisis". He argued that beneath the band's decadent and campy surface were lyrics about "the modern world ... one nuclear bomb could blow it all away. Pills and personality crises weren't evils—easy, necessary, or whatever. They were strategies and <a href="tropism">tropism</a>s and positive pleasures". According to journalist Steve Taylor, "Vietnamese Baby" dealt with the impact of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> at the time on everyday activities for people, whose fun was undermined by thoughts of <a href="collective%20guilt">collective guilt</a>. 

On songs such as "Subway Train" and "Trash", Johansen used <a href="ambiguity">ambiguity</a> as a lyrical mode. In Kogan's opinion, Johansen sang in an occasionally unintelligible manner and wrote in a perplexing, fictional style that was lazy yet ingenious, as it provided his lyrics an abundance of "emotional meaning" and interpretation: "David never provides an objective framework, he's always jumping from voice to voice, so you're hearing a character addressing another character, or the narrator addressing the character, or the character or the narrator addressing us, all jammed up together so you're hearing bits of conversation and bits of subjective description in no kind of chronological order. But as someone says in 'Vietnamese Baby': 'Everything connects.'" On "Trash", Johansen undercut his vaguely <a href="pansexuality">pansexual</a> beliefs with the possibility of going to "<a href="List%20of%20LGBT%20slang%20terms">fairyland</a>" if he took a "lover's leap" with the song's subject.

"New York Dolls" was released on July 27, 1973, in the United States and on October 19 in the United Kingdom. Its controversial cover featured the band dressed in exaggerated <a href="drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a>, including high wigs, messy make-up, high heels, and <a href="garter%20%28stockings%29">garters</a>. The photo was used for shock value, and on the back of the album, the band is photographed in their usual stage wear. To announce the album's release, Mercury published an advertisement slogan that read "Introducing The New York Dolls: A Band You're Gonna Like, Whether You Like It Or Not", while other ads called them "The Band You Love to Hate". Two <a href="double%20A-side">double A-side</a>d, <a href="7%26quot%3B%20single">7" single</a>s were released—"Trash" / "Personality Crisis" in July and "<a href="Jet%20Boy">Jet Boy</a>" / "Vietnamese Baby" in November 1973—neither of which <a href="record%20chart">charted</a>.

"New York Dolls" was commercially unsuccessful and only reached number 116 on the American <a href="Billboard%20200">Top LPs</a> while in the UK it failed to chart altogether. The record sold over 100,000 copies at the time and fell well short of expectations in the press. According to "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" in 2003, it ended up selling fewer than 500,000 copies. Music journalist Phil Strongman said its commercial failure could be attributed to the New York Dolls' divisive effect on listeners, including writers from the same magazine. In a <a href="feature%20story">feature story</a> on the band for "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", Mark Plummer dismissed their playing as the poorest he had ever seen, while the magazine's reporter Michael Watts viewed them as an encouraging albeit momentary presence in what he felt was a lifeless rock and roll scene at the time. In "<a href="Creem">Creem</a>"s readers poll, the album earned the band awards in the categories of "Best New Group of the Year" and "Worst New Group of the Year".

"New York Dolls" nonetheless received widespread acclaim from contemporary reviewers. In a rave review for "<a href="NME">NME</a>", <a href="Nick%20Kent">Nick Kent</a> said the band's raunchy style of rock and roll was vividly recorded by Rundgren on an album that, besides <a href="The%20Stooges">Iggy and the Stooges</a>' "<a href="Raw%20Power">Raw Power</a>" (1973), served as the only one "so far to fully define just exactly where 1970s rock should be coming from". "<a href="Trouser%20Press">Trouser Press</a>" founder and editor Ira Robbins viewed "New York Dolls" as an innovative record, brilliantly chaotic, and well produced by Rundgren. <a href="Ellen%20Willis">Ellen Willis</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", said it was by far the year's most compelling hard rock album and that at least half of its songs were immediate classics, particularly "Personality Crisis" and "Trash", which she called "transcendent". In "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>", Christgau hailed the New York Dolls as "the best hard rock band in the country and maybe the world right now", writing that their "special genius" was combining the shrewd songwriting savvy of early-1960s <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> with the anarchic sound of late-1960s <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>. He claimed the record's frenzied approach, various emotions, and wild noise conveyed Manhattan's harsh, deviant thrill better than <a href="the%20Velvet%20Underground">the Velvet Underground</a>. "Rolling Stone" critic <a href="Tony%20Glover">Tony Glover</a> believed the band's impressive live sound was mostly preserved on the album, but he was slightly critical of production flourishes and overdubs, feeling they made some lyrics incomprehensible and some choruses too sonorous. Although he was surprised Rundgren's production worked well with the group's raunchy sound on most of the songs, Glover ultimately asked whether or not "the record alone will impress as much as seeing them live (they're a highly "watchable" group)."

After the album's release, the New York Dolls toured the US as a supporting act for English rock band <a href="Mott%20the%20Hoople">Mott the Hoople</a>. Reviews complimented their songwriting, Thunders and Sylvain's guitar interplay, and noted their campy fashion and the resemblance of Johansen and Thunders to <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> and <a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a>. However, some critics panned them as an unserious group of amateurs who could not play or sing. During their appearance on "<a href="The%20Old%20Grey%20Whistle%20Test">The Old Grey Whistle Test</a>" in England, the show's host <a href="Bob%20Harris%20%28radio%29">Bob Harris</a> dismissed their music as "<a href="glam%20punk">mock rock</a>" in his on-air comments. They also developed a reputation for rock-star excesses, including drugs, <a href="groupie">groupie</a>s, trashed hotel rooms, and public disturbances, and according to Ben Edmonds of "Creem", became "the most walked-out-on band in the history of show business". Strongman wrote that the band and the album were difficult to market because of their kitschy style and how Murcia's death had exacerbated their association with <a href="Drug%20harmfulness">hard drugs</a>, which "wasn't altogether true in the early days". They remained the most popular band in New York City, where their <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> night concert at the <a href="Waldorf%20Astoria%20New%20York">Waldorf Astoria</a> in 1973 drew hundreds of young fans and local television coverage.

"New York Dolls" has since been often cited as one of the greatest debut albums in rock music, one of the genre's most popular cult records, and a foundational work for the late 1970s <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> movement. It was a pivotal influence on many of the rock and roll, punk, and <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> groups that followed, including the <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a>, <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">Kiss</a>, the <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>, <a href="the%20Damned%20%28band%29">The Damned</a>, and <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a>. According to "<a href="The%20Mojo%20Collection">The Mojo Collection</a>" (2007), the record ignited punk rock and could still inspire more movements because of the music's abundant attitude and passion, while "<a href="Encyclopedia%20of%20Popular%20Music">Encyclopedia of Popular Music</a>" writer <a href="Colin%20Larkin%20%28writer%29">Colin Larkin</a> deemed it "a major landmark in rock history, oozing attitude, vitality and controversy from every note". <a href="Chuck%20Eddy">Chuck Eddy</a> named it one of the records crucial to the evolution of rock music. In "<a href="101%20Albums%20That%20Changed%20Popular%20Music">101 Albums That Changed Popular Music</a>" (2009), Chris Smith wrote that the New York Dolls pioneered punk's aesthetic of amateurish musicianship on the album, which undermined the musical sophistication that had developed over the past decade in popular music and had been perfected months earlier on <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>" (1973). In "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s list of "1000 albums to hear before you die", the newspaper credited the record for serving as "an efficacious antidote to the excesses of prog rock".

In a retrospective review for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, Erlewine—the website's senior editor—claimed that "New York Dolls" was a more quintessential <a href="proto-punk">proto-punk</a> album than any of the Stooges' releases because of how it "plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy <a href="urban%20mythology">urban mythology</a> along the way". <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>'s "<a href="The%20Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20Ziggy%20Stardust%20and%20the%20Spiders%20from%20Mars">Ziggy Stardust</a>" (1972) or anything by <a href="Marc%20Bolan">Marc Bolan</a> because of how the band "captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism". In "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>" (2004), Joe Gross called it an "absolutely essential" record and "epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image". Sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the right side, an orientation which he said younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols adopted. Rundgren was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: "The irony is that I wound up producing the seminal punk album, but I was never really thought of as a punk producer, and I never got called by punk acts. They probably thought I was too expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn't really consider themselves punk."

"New York Dolls" has frequently been named one of the greatest albums of all-time; according to <a href="Acclaimed%20Music">Acclaimed Music</a>, it is the 167th most prominently ranked record on critics' all-time lists. In 1978, it was ranked as the 199th greatest record ever in <a href="Paul%20Gambaccini">Paul Gambaccini</a>'s book "Rock Critics' Choice: The Top 200 Albums", which polled a number of leading music journalists and record collectors. Christgau, one of the critics polled, named it the 15th best album of the 1970s in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" the following year. "New York Dolls" was included in <a href="Neil%20Strauss">Neil Strauss</a>'s 1996 list of the 100 most influential <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative</a> records, and the "<a href="Spin%20Alternative%20Record%20Guide">Spin Alternative Record Guide</a>" (1995) named it the 70th best alternative album. In 2002, it was included on a list published by "<a href="Q%20magazine">Q</a>" of the 100 best punk records, while "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" named it both the 13th greatest punk album and the 49th greatest album of all time. In 2003, "Rolling Stone" placed the record at number 213 on <a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">its 500 greatest albums list</a> and "Personality Crisis" at number 271 on <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">its 500 greatest songs list</a>. In 2007, "Mojo" polled a panel of prominent recording artists and songwriters for the magazine's "100 Records That Changed the World" publication, in which "New York Dolls" was voted the 39th most influential and inspirational record ever. English singer <a href="Morrissey">Morrissey</a> named it his favorite album in a list for "<a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a>" in 2010. According to <a href="Paul%20Myers%20%28musician%29">Paul Myers</a>, the record "struck such a chord with Morrissey that he was not only moved to form his own influential group, <a href="The%20Smiths">The Smiths</a> ... but would eventually convince the surviving Dolls to reunite [in 2004]". In 2013, "New York Dolls" was placed at number 355 on <a href="NME%27s%20The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">"NME"s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time</a>.

Eurasian tree sparrow

The Eurasian tree sparrow ("Passer montanus") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird in the <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a> family with a rich chestnut <a href="Crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a> and <a href="nape">nape</a>, and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly <a href="plumage">plumage</a>d, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia, where it is known as the tree sparrow, and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States, where it is known as the Eurasian tree sparrow or German sparrow to differentiate it from the native unrelated <a href="American%20tree%20sparrow">American tree sparrow</a>. Although several subspecies are recognised, the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range.

The Eurasian tree sparrow's untidy nest is built in a natural cavity, a hole in a building or the large nest of a <a href="European%20magpie">European magpie</a> or <a href="white%20stork">white stork</a>. The typical <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is five or six eggs which hatch in under two weeks. This sparrow feeds mainly on seeds, but invertebrates are also consumed, particularly during the breeding season. As with other small birds, infection by parasites and diseases, and predation by <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> take their toll, and the typical life span is about two years.

The Eurasian tree sparrow is widespread in the towns and cities of eastern Asia, but in Europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside, with the <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a> breeding in the more urban areas. The Eurasian tree sparrow's extensive range and large population ensure that it is not endangered globally, but there have been large declines in western European populations, in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of <a href="herbicide">herbicide</a>s and loss of winter <a href="crop%20residue">stubble</a> fields. In eastern Asia and western Australia, this species is sometimes viewed as a pest, although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art.

The Eurasian tree sparrow is long, with a <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a> of about and a weight of , making it roughly 10% smaller than the house sparrow. The adult's crown and nape are rich <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a>, and there is a kidney-shaped black ear patch on each pure white cheek; the chin, throat, and the area between the bill and throat are black. The upperparts are light brown, streaked with black, and the brown wings have two distinct narrow white bars. The legs are pale brown, and the bill is lead-blue in summer, becoming almost black in winter.

This sparrow is distinctive even within its genus in that it has no plumage differences between the sexes; the juvenile also resembles the adult, although the colours tend to be duller. Its contrasting face pattern makes this species easily identifiable in all plumages; the smaller size and brown, not grey, crown are additional differences from the male house sparrow. Adult and juvenile Eurasian tree sparrows undergo a slow complete <a href="moult">moult</a> in the autumn, and show an increase in body mass despite a reduction in stored fat. The change in mass is due to an increase in blood volume to support active feather growth, and a generally higher water content in the body.
The Eurasian tree sparrow has no true song, but its <a href="bird%20vocalization">vocalisations</a> include an excited series of "tschip" calls given by unpaired or courting males. Other monosyllabic chirps are used in social contacts, and the flight call is a harsh "teck". A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types (<a href="meme">meme</a>s) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from the small size of the founding North American population and a consequent loss of <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a>.

The Old World <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a> genus "<a href="Passer">Passer</a>" is a group of small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> birds that is believed to have originated in Africa, and which contains 15–25 species depending on the authority. Its members are typically found in open, lightly wooded, habitats, although several species, notably the <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a> ("P. domesticus") have adapted to human habitations. Most species in the genus are typically long, predominantly brown or greyish birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks. They are primarily ground-feeding seed-eaters, although they also consume invertebrates, especially when breeding. Genetic studies show that the Eurasian tree sparrow diverged from the other Eurasian members of its genus relatively early, before the <a href="speciation">speciation</a> of the house, <a href="plain-backed%20sparrow">plain-backed</a> and <a href="Spanish%20sparrow">Spanish sparrow</a>s. The Eurasian species is not closely related to the <a href="American%20tree%20sparrow">American tree sparrow</a> ("Spizelloides arborea"), which is in a different family, the <a href="American%20sparrow">American sparrow</a>s.

The Eurasian tree sparrow's binomial name is derived from two <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words: "passer", "sparrow", and "montanus", "of the mountains" (from "mons" "mountain"). The Eurasian tree sparrow was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his 1758 "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" as "Fringilla montana", but, along with the house sparrow, it was soon moved from the <a href="finch">finch</a>es (family Fringillidae) into the new genus "Passer" created by French zoologist <a href="Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson">Mathurin Jacques Brisson</a> in 1760. The Eurasian tree sparrow's common name is given because of its preference of tree holes for nesting. This name, and the scientific name "montanus", do not appropriately describe this species's habitat preferences: the <a href="German%20language">German</a> name "Feldsperling" ("field sparrow") comes closer to doing so.

This species varies little in appearance across its large range, and the differences between the seven extant <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> recognised by Clement are slight. At least 15 other subspecies have been proposed, but are considered to be intermediates of the listed <a href="race%20%28biology%29">races</a>.

The Eurasian tree sparrow's natural breeding range comprises most of <a href="temperateness">temperate</a> Europe and Asia south of about <a href="68th%20parallel%20north">latitude 68°N</a> (north of this the summers are too cold, with July average temperatures below 12 °C) and through Southeast Asia to <a href="Java">Java</a> and <a href="Bali">Bali</a>. It formerly bred in the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroes</a>, <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and <a href="Gozo">Gozo</a>. In South Asia it is found mainly in the temperate zone. It is sedentary over most of its extensive range, but northernmost breeding populations <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> south for the winter, and small numbers leave southern Europe for North Africa and the Middle East. The eastern subspecies "P. m. dilutus" reaches coastal Pakistan in winter and thousands of birds of this race move through eastern China in autumn.

The Eurasian tree sparrow has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> outside its native range, but has not always become established, possibly due to competition with the house sparrow. It was introduced successfully to <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and <a href="Micronesia">Micronesia</a>, but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root. Ship-carried birds colonised <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. This sparrow has occurred as a natural <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Iceland.
In North America, a population of about 15,000 birds has become established around <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a> and neighbouring parts of Illinois and southeastern Iowa. These sparrows are descended from 12 birds imported from Germany and released in late April 1870 as part of a project to enhance the native North American avifauna. Within its limited US range of about , the Eurasian tree sparrow has to compete with the house sparrow in urban centres, and is therefore mainly found in parks, farms and rural woods. The American population is sometimes referred to as the "German sparrow", to distinguish it from both the native American tree sparrow species and the much more widespread "English" house sparrow.

In Australia, the Eurasian tree sparrow is present in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, towns in central and northern <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and some centres in the <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a> region of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. It is a prohibited species in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, where it often arrives on ships from Southeast Asia.

Despite its scientific name, "Passer montanus", this is not typically a mountain species, and reaches only in Switzerland, although it has bred at in the northern Caucasus and as high as in Nepal. In Europe, it is frequently found on coasts with cliffs, in empty buildings, in <a href="pollarding">pollarded</a> willows along slow water courses, or in open countryside with small isolated patches of woodland. The Eurasian tree sparrow shows a strong preference for nest-sites near <a href="wetland">wetland</a> habitats, and avoids breeding on intensively managed mixed farmland.

When the Eurasian tree sparrow and the larger house sparrow occur in the same area, the house sparrow generally breeds in urban areas while the smaller Eurasian tree sparrow nests in the countryside. Where trees are in short supply, as in Mongolia, both species may utilise man-made structures as nest sites. The Eurasian tree sparrow is rural in Europe, but is an urban bird in eastern Asia; in southern and central Asia, both "Passer" species may be found around towns and villages. In parts of the Mediterranean, such as Italy, both the tree and the Italian or Spanish sparrows may be found in settlements. In Australia, the Eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird, and it is the house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats.

The Eurasian tree sparrow reaches breeding maturity within a year from hatching, and typically builds its nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face. Some nests are not in holes as such, but are built among roots of overhanging <a href="gorse">gorse</a> or similar bush. Roof cavities in houses may be used, and in the tropics, the crown of a palm tree or the ceiling of a verandah can serve as a nest site. This species will breed in the disused domed nest of a <a href="European%20magpie">European magpie</a>, or an active or unused stick nest of a large bird such as the <a href="white%20stork">white stork</a>, <a href="white-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed eagle</a>, <a href="osprey">osprey</a>, <a href="black%20kite">black kite</a> or <a href="grey%20heron">grey heron</a>. It will sometimes attempt to take over the nest of other birds that breed in holes or enclosed spaces, such as the <a href="barn%20swallow">barn swallow</a>, <a href="Common%20house%20martin">house martin</a>, <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a> or <a href="European%20bee-eater">European bee-eater</a>.

Pairs may breed in isolation or in loose colonies, and will readily use <a href="nest%20box">nest box</a>es. In a Spanish study, boxes made from a mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types, but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete, perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1.5 °C warmer than their wooden counterparts.

The male calls from near the nest site in spring to proclaim ownership and attract a mate. He may also carry nest material into the nest hole. The display and nest building is repeated in autumn. The preferred locations for the autumn display are old Eurasian tree sparrow nests, particularly those where nestlings had hatched. Empty nest boxes, and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds, such as <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a>, <a href="European%20pied%20flycatcher">pied flycatchers</a> or <a href="common%20redstart">common redstart</a>s, are rarely used for the autumn display.

The untidy nest is composed of hay, grass, <a href="wool">wool</a> or other material and lined with <a href="feather">feather</a>s, which improve the thermal insulation. A complete nest consists of three layers; base, lining and dome. The typical clutch is five or six <a href="Egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a> (rarely more than four in Malaysia), white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots, small blotches, or speckling; they are in size and weigh , of which 7% is shell. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 12–13 days before the <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, naked chicks hatch, and a further 15–18 days elapse before they <a href="fledge">fledge</a>. Two or three broods may be raised each year; birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs, but the reverse is true for second and third clutches. Females which copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time, so within-pair mating may be an indicator of the pairs' reproductive ability. There is a significant level of promiscuity; in a Hungarian study, more than 9% of chicks were sired by extra-pair males, and 20% of the broods contained at least one extra-pair young.

<a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">Hybridisation</a> between the Eurasian tree sparrow and the house sparrow has been recorded in many parts of the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the <a href="Eastern%20Ghats">Eastern Ghats</a> of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the <a href="Spanish%20sparrow">Spanish sparrow</a> ("P. hispaniolensis") and <a href="Italian%20sparrow">Italian sparrow</a>s ("P. italiae"), was recorded in Malta in 1975.

The tree sparrow is a predominantly seed and grain eating bird which feeds on the ground in flocks, often with house sparrows, finches, or buntings. It eats weed seeds, such as <a href="Caryophyllaceae">chickweeds</a> and <a href="Chenopodium">goosefoot</a>, spilled grain, and it may also visit <a href="Bird%20feeder">feeding stations</a>, especially for <a href="peanut">peanut</a>s. It will also feed on <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly on animal food; it takes insects, <a href="woodlouse">woodlice</a>, <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s, <a href="centipede">centipede</a>s, <a href="spider">spider</a>s and <a href="Opiliones">harvestmen</a>.

Adults use a variety of wetlands when foraging for invertebrate prey to feed nestlings, and aquatic sites play a key role in providing adequate diversity and availability of suitable invertebrate prey to allow successful chick rearing throughout the long breeding season of this multi-brooded species. Large areas of formerly occupied farmland no longer provide these invertebrate resources due to the effects of <a href="intensive%20farming">intensive farming</a>, and the availability of supplementary seed food within of the nest-site does not influence nest-site choice, or affect the number of young raised.

In winter, seed resources are most likely to be a key limiting factor. At this time of year, individuals in a flock form linear <a href="dominance%20hierarchy">dominance hierarchies</a>, but there is no strong relation between the size of the throat patch and position in that hierarchy. This is in contrast to the house sparrow; in that species, fights to establish dominance are reduced by the display of the throat patch, the size of which acts as a <a href="Signalling%20theory">signalling</a> "badge" of <a href="Fitness%20%28biology%29">fitness</a>. Although there is evidence that the black throat patch of male, but not female, tree sparrows predicts fighting success in foraging flocks.

The risk of predation affects feeding strategies. A study showed increased distance between shelter and a food supply meant that birds visited a feeder in smaller flocks, spent less time on it and were more vigilant when far from shelter. Sparrows can feed as "producers", searching for food directly, or "scroungers", just joining other flock members who have already discovered food. Scrounging was 30% more likely at exposed feeding sites, although this is not due to increased anti-predator vigilance. A possible explanation is that riskier places are used by individuals with lower fat reserves.

Predators of the tree sparrow include a variety of <a href="accipiter">accipiter</a>s, <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s and <a href="owl">owl</a>s, such as the <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>, <a href="common%20kestrel">common kestrel</a>, <a href="little%20owl">little owl</a>, and sometimes <a href="long-eared%20owl">long-eared owl</a> and white stork. It does not appear to be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, <a href="Eurasian%20jay">jays</a>, <a href="least%20weasel">least weasel</a>s, rats, cats and constricting snakes such as the <a href="horseshoe%20whip%20snake">horseshoe whip snake</a>.

Many species of <a href="bird%20louse">birdlice</a> are present on the birds and in their nests, and mites of the genus "Knemidocoptes" have been known to infest populations, resulting in lesions on the legs and toes. Parasitisation of nestlings by "<a href="Protocalliphora">Protocalliphora</a>" <a href="blow-fly">blow-fly</a> larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality. Egg size does not influence nestling mortality, but chicks from large eggs grow faster.

Tree sparrows are also subject to bacterial and viral infections. Bacteria have been shown to be an important factor in the failure of eggs to hatch and in nestling mortality, and mass deaths due to "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>" infection have been noted in Japan. <a href="Avian%20malaria">Avian malaria</a> parasites have been found in the blood of many populations, and birds in China were found to harbour a strain of <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus%20subtype%20H5N1">H5N1</a> that was highly virulent to chickens.

The immune response of tree sparrows is less robust than that of the house sparrow and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter. The house sparrow and tree sparrow are the most frequent victims of <a href="roadkill">roadkill</a> on the roads of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. The maximum recorded age is 13.1 years, but three years is a typical lifespan.

The tree sparrow has a large range estimated as and a population of 190–310 million individuals. Although the population is declining, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> (that is, declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species' <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> is evaluated at the global level as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>.

Although the tree sparrow has been expanding its range in <a href="Fennoscandia">Fennoscandia</a> and eastern Europe, populations have been declining in much of western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the <a href="skylark">skylark</a>, <a href="corn%20bunting">corn bunting</a> and <a href="northern%20lapwing">northern lapwing</a>. From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations seems to have been particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.

The tree sparrow is seen as a pest in some areas. In Australia, it damages many cereal and fruit crops and spoils cereal crops, animal feed and stored grain with its droppings. <a href="Quarantine">Quarantine</a> rules prohibit the transport of this species into Western Australia.

Chairman <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> of China attempted in April 1958 to reduce crop damage by tree sparrows, estimated at of grain per bird each year, by mobilising three million people and many scarecrows to drive the birds to death by exhaustion. Although initially successful, the "<a href="great%20sparrow%20campaign">great sparrow campaign</a>" had overlooked the numbers of locusts and other insect pests consumed by the birds, and crop yields fell, exacerbating a famine which led to the deaths of 30 million people between 1959 and 1961. The tree sparrow's consumption of insects has led to its use in agriculture to control fruit tree pests and the <a href="common%20asparagus%20beetle">common asparagus beetle</a>, "Crioceris aspergi".

The tree sparrow has long been depicted in Chinese and Japanese art, often on a plant spray or in a flying flock, and representations by oriental artists including <a href="Hiroshige">Hiroshige</a> have featured on the postage stamps of <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">Antigua and Barbuda</a>, Central African Republic, China and the Gambia. More straightforward illustrations were used on the stamps of Belarus, Belgium, Cambodia, Estonia and Taiwan. The fluttering of the bird gave rise to a traditional Japanese dance, the "<a href="Japanese%20traditional%20dance%23Nihon%20Buy%C5%8D">Suzume Odori</a>", developed in <a href="Sendai">Sendai</a>, which was depicted by artists such as <a href="Hokusai">Hokusai</a>.

In the Philippines, where it is one of several species referred to as "<a href="maya%20%28bird%29">maya</a>", and is sometimes specifically referred to as the "mayang simbahan" ("church maya" or "church sparrow"), the tree sparrow is the most common bird in the cities. Many urban Filipinos confuse it with the former national bird of the Philippines, the <a href="black-headed%20munia">black-headed munia</a> – also called a "maya", but specifically differentiated in <a href="folk%20taxonomy">folk taxa</a> as the "mayang pula" ("red maya").

USS Connecticut (BB-18)

USS "Connecticut" (BB-18), the fourth <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> ship to be named after the state of <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Connecticut-class%20battleship">her class</a> of six battleships. Her <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid on 10 March 1903; launched on 29 September 1904, "Connecticut" was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 29 September 1906, as the most advanced ship in the US Navy.

"Connecticut" served as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> for the <a href="Jamestown%20Exposition">Jamestown Exposition</a> in mid-1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the founding of the <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown</a> colony. She later sailed with the <a href="Great%20White%20Fleet">Great White Fleet</a> on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the US Navy's growing fleet of <a href="Blue-water%20navy">blue-water</a>-capable ships. After completing her service with the Great White Fleet, "Connecticut" participated in several flag-waving exercises intended to protect American citizens abroad until she was pressed into service as a troop transport at the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> to expedite the return of <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Forces">American Expeditionary Forces</a> from France.

For the remainder of her career, "Connecticut" sailed to various places in both the Atlantic and Pacific while training newer recruits to the Navy. However, the provisions of the 1922 <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> stipulated that many of the older battleships, "Connecticut" among them, would have to be disposed of, so she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923, and sold for <a href="scrap">scrap</a> on 1 November 1923.

The design that evolved into the was conceived on 6 March 1901, when <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="John%20Davis%20Long">John Davis Long</a> asked the Board on Construction for a study of future battleship designs. When this was completed, different bureaus supported different designs.

The Board on Construction favored a ship on which and guns would be replaced by 24 newly designed guns, which were the most powerful guns with shells that could be handled by one person. In addition, the ships would mount twenty-four anti-<a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> guns. The main armor would be thinner overall because it would be distributed over the entire length. The Board's favored design would result in a ship weighing <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a>.

The <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a>, however, proposed a modified with sixteen 8-inch guns, twelve in turrets and four in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s; the casemate guns were later eliminated, leaving twelve 8-inch, twelve 6-inch, and eight 3-inch guns on a ship of . This design was later rejected because the reduction in anti-torpedo boat guns was too drastic.

Although one of the two designs had been rejected, the debate did not end. In November, the Board decided on a different plan, with eight 8-inch guns mounted in four waist turrets and 12 7-inch guns. This arrangement was chosen because the 8-inch gun could penetrate medium armor on battleships, and the 7-inch gun was capable of rapid fire. The new design also had heavier armor and a thicker belt than the first design. Two ships of this plan, "Connecticut" and , were authorized on 1 July 1902, and three more were added on 2 March 1903: , , and . was authorized on 27 April 1904.

"Connecticut" was ordered on 1 July 1902. On 15 October 1902, she was awarded to the <a href="New%20York%20Naval%20Shipyard">New York Naval Shipyard</a>. She was <a href="keel">laid down</a> on 10 March 1903, and <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 29 September 1904. She was sponsored by Miss Alice B. Welles, granddaughter of <a href="Gideon%20Welles">Gideon Welles</a>, Secretary of the Navy during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. A crowd of over 30,000 people attended the launch, as did many of the Navy's ships. The <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s , , , , , , , and were at the ceremony, along with the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>s and and the auxiliary cruiser .

Three attempts to sabotage the ship were discovered in 1904. On 31 March, rivets on the keel plates were found bored through. On 14 September, a bolt was found driven into the <a href="Slipway%23Ship%20construction">launching way</a>, where it protruded some . Shortly after "Connecticut" was launched on 29 September, a <a href="diameter">diameter</a> hole was discovered drilled through a steel <a href="keel">keel</a> plate. The ship's <a href="watertight%20compartment">watertight compartment</a>s and pumps prevented her from sinking, and all damage was repaired. The incidents prompted the Navy to post armed guards at the shipyard, and an overnight watch was kept by a Navy tug manned by <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a> who had orders to shoot to kill any unauthorized person attempting to approach the ship.

As "Connecticut" was only 55% complete when she was launched, missing most of her upper works, protection, machinery and armament, it was two years before "Connecticut" was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 29 September 1906. Captain <a href="William%20Swift">William Swift</a> was the first captain of the new battleship. "Connecticut" sailed out of New York for the first time on 15 December 1906, becoming the first ship in the US Navy to ever go to sea without a <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>. She first journeyed south to the <a href="Virginia%20Capes">Virginia Capes</a>, where she conducted a variety of training exercises; this was followed by a <a href="Shakedown%20%28testing%29">shakedown cruise</a> and battle practice off Cuba and Puerto Rico. During the cruise, she participated in a search for the missing steamer "Ponce".
On 13 January 1907, "Connecticut" ran onto a <a href="reef">reef</a> while entering the harbor at <a href="Culebra%20Island">Culebra Island</a>. The Navy did not release any information about the grounding until press dispatches from <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">San Juan</a>, carrying news of the incident reached the mainland on 23 January. Even then, Navy authorities in San Juan claimed to be ignorant of the situation, and, that same day, the Navy Department itself said that they only knew that Captain Swift thought she had touched bottom and that an examination of the ship's bottom by divers had revealed no damage. The Navy amended this the next day, releasing a statement that "Connecticut" had been only slightly damaged and had returned to her shakedown cruise. However, damage to the ship was much more serious than the Navy admitted; in contrast to an official statement saying that "Connecticut" had only "touched" the rocks, she actually had run full upon the reef when traversing "a course well marked with buoys" in "broad daylight" and did enough damage to probably require a <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a>ing. This apparent attempt at a cover-up was enough for the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> to consider an official inquiry into the matter.

On 21 March, the Navy announced that Swift would be <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>ed for "through negligence, causing a vessel to run upon a rock" and "neglect of duty in regard to the above". Along with the officer of the deck at the time of the accident, <a href="Lieutenant%20%28navy%29">Lieutenant</a> <a href="Harry%20E.%20Yarnell">Harry E. Yarnell</a>, Swift faced a court martial of seven rear admirals, a captain, and a lieutenant. He was sentenced to one year's suspension from duty, later reduced to nine months; after about six months, the sentence was remitted on 24 October. However, he was not assigned command of another ship.

"Connecticut" steamed back to <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a> after this, arriving on 16 April; when she arrived, Rear Admiral <a href="Robley%20D.%20Evans">Robley D. Evans</a>, commander of the <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">Atlantic Fleet</a>, transferred his flag from to "Connecticut", making her the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the fleet. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> opened the <a href="Jamestown%20Exposition">Jamestown Exposition</a> on 25 April, and "Connecticut" was named as the official host of the vessels that were visiting from other countries. Sailors and marines from the ship took part in various events ashore, and foreign dignitaries, along with the governors of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, were hosted aboard the ship on 29 April. Evans closed the Exposition on 4 May, on the quarterdeck of "Connecticut". On 10 June, "Connecticut" joined in the <a href="Presidential%20Fleet%20Review">Presidential Fleet Review</a>; she left three days later for an overhaul in the <a href="New%20York%20Naval%20Yard">New York Naval Yard</a>. After the overhaul, "Connecticut" conducted maneuvers off Hampton Roads, and target practice off Cape Cod. She was ordered back to the New York Naval Yard, once again on 6 September, for a refit that would make her suitable for use as flagship of the <a href="Great%20White%20Fleet">Great White Fleet</a>.

"Connecticut" left the New York Naval Yard, on 5 December 1907, and arrived the next day in Hampton Roads, where the Great White Fleet would assemble with her as their flagship. After an eight-day period known as "Navy Farewell Week" during which festivities were held for the departing sailors, and all 16 battleships took on full loads of coal, stores, and ammunition, the ships were ready to depart. The battleship captains paid their respects to President Theodore Roosevelt on the presidential yacht , and all the ships weighed anchor and departed at 1000. They passed in review before the President, and then began traveling south. After steaming past <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a>, the fleet headed for the Caribbean. They approached Puerto Rico, on 20 December, caught sight of <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> on 22 December, and later dropped anchor in <a href="Port%20of%20Spain">Port of Spain</a>, the capital of <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, making the first port visit of the Great White Fleet. With the <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> flotilla that had left Hampton Roads, two weeks previously, and five <a href="collier%20%28ship%20type%29">colliers</a> to fill the coal bunkers of the fleet, Port of Spain had a total of 32 US Navy ships in the harbor, making it "[resemble] a US Navy base".

After spending Christmas in Trinidad, the ships departed for <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, on 29 December. A ceremonial Brazilian escort of three cruisers met the task force outside Rio, and "thousands of wildly cheering Brazilians lined the shore"; 10 days of ceremonies, games, and festivities followed, and the stopover was so successful that the visit was the cause of a major boost in <a href="Brazil%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">US–Brazilian relations</a>. The fleet left Rio on 22 January 1908, still heading south, this time bound for the coaling stop of <a href="Punta%20Arenas%2C%20Chile">Punta Arenas, Chile</a>.

Four cruisers from Argentina, "San Martin", "Buenos Ayres", "9 De Julio", and "Pueyrredon", all under the command of Admiral Hipolito Oliva, sailed to salute the American ships on their way to Chile. The fleet arrived at Punta Arenas, on 1 February, and spent five days in the town of 14,000. Heading north, they followed the coastline of Chile, passing in review of Chilean President <a href="Pedro%20Montt">Pedro Montt</a> on 14 February, outside <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valparaíso</a>, and they were escorted to <a href="Callao">Callao</a>, in Peru, by the cruiser <a href="BAP%20Coronel%20Bolognesi%20%281906%29">"Coronel Bolognesi"</a> on 19 and 20 February. Peru's president, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Pardo%20y%20Barreda">José Pardo</a>, came aboard "Connecticut" during this time, as Rear Admiral Evans was quite ill and could not go ashore. After taking on coal, the ships steamed for Mexico, on 29 February, passing in review of the cruiser <a href="BAP%20Almirante%20Grau%20%281907%29">"Almirante Grau"</a>, which had Pardo embarked, before leaving.

Arriving in Mexico, on 20 March, the fleet underwent three weeks of target practice. Rear Admiral Evans was relieved of command during this time, as he was completely bedridden and in constant pain, on 30 March, "Connecticut" set sail north at full speed. She was met two days later by the schooner , which took the admiral to a hospital. "Connecticut" traveled back south to rejoin the fleet, and Rear Admiral <a href="Charles%20M.%20Thomas">Charles M. Thomas</a> took Evans's place on "Connecticut" as the commander of the fleet, which continued its journey north, bound for <a href="California">California</a>.

On 5 May, Evans returned to "Connecticut" in time for the fleet's sailing through the <a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a> on 6 May, although he was still in pain. Over one million people watched the 42-ship fleet sail into the bay. After a grand parade through <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, a review of the fleet by Secretary of the Navy <a href="Victor%20H.%20Metcalf">Victor H. Metcalf</a>, a gala reception, and a farewell address from Evans (who was retiring due to his illness and his age), the fleet left San Francisco, for <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, with Rear Admiral <a href="Charles%20Stillman%20Sperry">Charles Stillman Sperry</a> as commander. The ships all underwent refits before the next leg of the voyage. The fleet left the West Coast again on 7 July, bound for Hawaii, which it reached on 16 July.

Leaving Hawaii, on 22 July, the ships next stopped at <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, Sydney, and <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. High seas and winds hampered the ships for part of the voyage to New Zealand, but they arrived on 9 August; festivities, parades, balls, and games were staples of the visits to each city. The highlight of the austral visit was a parade of 12,000 US Navy, <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, and <a href="Commonwealth">Commonwealth</a> naval and military personnel in front of 250,000 people.

After stopping at <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, in the Philippines, the fleet set course for <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, Japan. They encountered a typhoon on the way on 12 October, but no ships were lost; the fleet was only delayed 24 hours. After three Japanese <a href="men-of-war">men-of-war</a> and six merchantmen escorted the Americans in, festivities began. The celebrations culminated in the <a href="Uraga%2C%20Kanagawa">Uraga</a>, where <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Matthew%20C.%20Perry">Matthew C. Perry</a> had <a href="Matthew%20C.%20Perry%23First%20visit%2C%201852-1853">anchored</a> a little more than 50 years prior. The ships then departed on 25 October. After three weeks of exercises in the Philippines' <a href="Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a>, the ships sailed south on 1 December, for <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>; they did not stop there, however, passing outside the city on 6 December. Continuing on, they stopped at <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, for coal from 12–20 December, before sailing on for the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. It took three days for all 16 battleships to traverse the canal, even though it was closed to all other traffic. They then headed for a coaling stop at <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, after which the fleet split up into <a href="Great%20White%20Fleet%23Ships%202">individual divisions</a> to call on different ports in the Mediterranean. The First Division, of which "Connecticut" was a part, originally planned to visit Italy, before moving on to <a href="Villefranche-sur-Mer">Villefranche</a>, but "Connecticut" and were quickly dispatched to southern Italy, on a humanitarian mission when news of an earthquake reached the fleet. Seamen from the ships helped clear debris and unload supplies from the US Navy refrigerated supply ship ; Admiral Sperry received the personal thanks of <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20III%20of%20Italy">King Victor Emmanuel III</a> for their assistance.

After port calls were concluded, the ships headed for <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, where they found a conglomerate of warships from many different nations awaiting them "with decks manned and horns blaring": the battleships and with the cruiser and the Second Cruiser Squadron represented Great Britain's <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, battleships and with cruisers , and represented the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a>, and various gunboats represented France and the Netherlands. After coaling for five days, the ships got under way and left for home on 6 February 1909.

After weathering a few storms, the ships met nine of their fellow US Navy ships five days out of Hampton Roads: four battleships (, , , and  – the only sister of "Connecticut" to not make the cruise, two armored cruisers, and three scout cruisers. "Connecticut" then led all of these warships around Tail-of-the-Horseshoe Lightship on 22 February to pass in review of President Roosevelt, who was then on the presidential yacht anchored off <a href="Old%20Point%20Comfort">Old Point Comfort</a>, ending a trip. Roosevelt boarded the ship after she anchored and gave a short speech, saying, "You've done the trick. Other nations may do as you have done, but they'll follow you."

Following her return from the world cruise, "Connecticut" continued to serve as flagship of the Atlantic Fleet, interrupted only by a March 1909 overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. After rejoining the fleet, she cruised the East Coast from her base at <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. For the rest of 1909, the battleship conducted training and participated in ceremonial observances, such as the <a href="Hudson-Fulton%20Celebration">Hudson-Fulton Celebration</a>. In early January 1910, "Connecticut" left for Cuban waters and stayed there until late March when she returned to New York for a refit. After several months conducting maneuvers and battle practice off the <a href="New%20England">New England</a> coast, she left for Europe on 2 November to go on a midshipman training cruise. She arrived in <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Portland</a>, England on 15 November and was present during the 1 December birthday celebration of <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Queen Alexandra</a>, the <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a>. "Connecticut" next visited <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>, France, where she welcomed visitors from the town and also hosted commander-in-chief of the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> "Vice-Amiral" <a href="Laurent%20Marin-Darbel">Laurent Marin-Darbel</a>, and a delegation of his officers. While there, a boat crew from "Connecticut" engaged a crew from the French battleship in a rowing race; "Connecticut"s crew won by twelve lengths. "Connecticut" departed French waters for <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>, Cuba, on 30 December, and stayed there until 17 March, when she departed for Hampton Roads.

"Connecticut" was the leader of the ships that passed in review during the Presidential Fleet Review in New York, on 2 November; she then remained in New York, until 12 January 1912, when she returned to Guantánamo Bay. During a March overhaul at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Naval%20Yard">Philadelphia Naval Yard</a>, the battleship relinquished her role as flagship to the armored cruiser . After the overhaul's completion, "Connecticut"s activities through the end of 1912 included practicing with torpedoes in <a href="Fort%20Pond%20Bay">Fort Pond Bay</a>, conducting fleet maneuvers, and battle practice off <a href="Block%20Island">Block Island</a> and the Virginia Capes. Stopping in New York, "Connecticut" conducted training exercises in Guantánamo Bay from 13 February to 20 March; during this time (on the 28th), she once again became the Atlantic Fleet flagship for a brief and final time when she served in the interim as Rear Admiral <a href="Charles%20J.%20Badger">Charles J. Badger</a> transferred his flag from to . After taking on stores in Philadelphia, "Connecticut" sailed for Mexico and arrived on 22 April; she was to patrol the waters near <a href="Tampico%2C%20Tamaulipas">Tampico</a> and <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Vera Cruz</a>, protecting American citizens and interests during disturbances there and in <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>.

On 22 June 1912, "Connecticut" departed Mexican waters for Philadelphia, where she was dry docked for three months of repairs. Upon their completion, "Connecticut" conducted gunnery practice off the Virginia Capes. On 23 October, "Connecticut" became the flagship of the Fourth Battleship Division. After the division passed in review before Secretary of the Navy <a href="George%20von%20Lengerke%20Meyer">George von Lengerke Meyer</a> on the 25th, "Connecticut" left for <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, Italy, where she remained until 30 November. The battleship departed Italy for Vera Cruz and arrived on 23 December. She took refugees from Mexico to Galveston and carried officers of the Army and representative from the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> back in the opposite direction.

On 29 May 1914, while still in Mexico, "Connecticut" relinquished the duty of flagship to , but remained in Mexico, until 2 July, when she left for <a href="Havana">Havana</a>. Arriving there on 8 July, "Connecticut" embarked <a href="Madison%20R.%20Smith">Madison R. Smith</a>, the US minister to Haiti, and took him to <a href="Port-au-Prince">Port-au-Prince</a>, arriving five days later. "Connecticut" remained in Haiti for a month, then left for Philadelphia on 8 August and arrived there on 14 August.

"Connecticut" then went to <a href="Maine">Maine</a> and the Virginia Capes, for battle practice, after which she went into the Philadelphia Naval Yard for an overhaul. After more than 15 weeks, "Connecticut" emerged on 15 January 1915, and steamed south to Cuba, where she conducted training exercises. During maneuvers there in March 1915, a chain wrapped around her starboard propeller, breaking the shaft and forcing her return to Philadelphia, for repairs. She remained there until 31 July, when she embarked 433 men from the Second Regiment, First Brigade, of the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> for transport to Port-au-Prince, where they were put ashore on 5 August, as part of the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Haiti">US occupation of Haiti</a>. "Connecticut" delivered supplies to amphibious troops in <a href="Cap-Ha%C3%AFtien">Cap-Haïtien</a>, on 5 September and remained near Haiti, for the next few months, supporting landing parties ashore, including detachments of Marines and sailors from "Connecticut" under the command of <a href="Major">Major</a> <a href="Smedley%20Butler">Smedley Butler</a>. After departing Haiti, "Connecticut" arrived in Philadelphia, on 15 December, and was placed into the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20reserve%20fleets">Atlantic Reserve Fleet</a>.

As part of the US response to Germany's <a href="unrestricted%20submarine%20warfare%20%28February%201915%29">unrestricted submarine warfare</a>, "Connecticut" was recommissioned on 3 October 1916. Two days later, Admiral <a href="Herbert%20O.%20Dunn">Herbert O. Dunn</a> made her the flagship of the Fifth Battleship Division, transferring his flag from "Minnesota". "Connecticut" operated along the East Coast and in the Caribbean until the United States entered <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> on 6 April 1917. For the duration of the war, "Connecticut" was based in <a href="York%20River%2C%20Virginia">York River, Virginia</a>. More than 1,000 trainees—midshipmen and gun crews for merchant ships—took part in exercises on her while she sailed in <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, and off the Virginia Capes.

At the close of the war, "Connecticut" was assigned to the <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a> for transport duty, and from 6 January – 22 June 1919, she made four voyages to return troops from France. On 6 January, she left Hampton Roads, for <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest, France</a>, where she embarked 1,000 troops. After bringing them to New York, arriving on 2 February, "Connecticut" traveled back to Brest, and picked up the 53rd Pioneer Regiment, a company of Marines, and a company of <a href="military%20police">military police</a>, 1,240 troops in all. These men were delivered to Hampton Roads, on 24 March. After two months, "Connecticut" made another run overseas: following a short period of liberty in Paris, for her crew, she embarked 891 men variously from the 502nd Army Engineers, a medical detachment, and the Red Cross. They were dropped off in <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News</a>, on 22 June. On 23 June 1919, after having returned over 4,800 men, "Connecticut" was reassigned as flagship of the Second Battleship Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="Hilary%20P.%20Jones">Hilary P. Jones</a>.

While based in Philadelphia, for the next 11 months, "Connecticut" trained midshipmen. On 2 May 1920, 200 midshipmen boarded the ship for a training cruise. In company with the other battleships of her squadron, "Connecticut" sailed to the Caribbean, and through the Panama Canal, in order to visit four ports-of-call: Honolulu, Seattle, San Francisco, and <a href="San%20Pedro%20Bay%20%28California%29">San Pedro Bay</a> (Los Angeles and <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a>). After visiting all four, the squadron made their way back through the canal and headed for home. However, the port engine of "Connecticut" gave out three days after transiting the canal, requiring "New Hampshire" to tow the battleship into Guantánamo Bay. The pair arrived on 28 August. The midshipmen were debarked there, and Vice Admiral Jones transferred his flag from "Connecticut" to his new flagship, . The Navy repair ship was dispatched from New York on 1 September to tow "Connecticut" to Philadelphia; they arrived at the Navy Yard there on 11 September.

On 21 March 1921, "Connecticut" again became the flagship of the Second Battleship Squadron when Rear Admiral <a href="Charles%20Frederick%20Hughes">Charles Frederick Hughes</a> took command. The ships of the squadron departed Philadelphia, on 7 April, to perform maneuvers and training exercises off Cuba, though they returned to take part in the Presidential Review in Hampton Roads, on 28 April. After participating in <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">Naval Academy</a> celebrations on <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a>, "Connecticut" and her squadmates departed on a midshipman cruise which took them to Europe. On 28 June, "Connecticut" hosted a Norwegian delegation that included <a href="King%20of%20Norway">King</a> <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII</a>, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Norway">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Otto%20Blehr">Otto Blehr</a>, the Minister of Defence, and the First Sea Lord of the <a href="Royal%20Norwegian%20Navy">Royal Norwegian Navy</a>. After arriving in Portugal, on 21 July, the battleship hosted the Civil Governor of the Province of Lisbon and the Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="Portuguese%20Navy">Portuguese Navy</a>. Six days later, "Connecticut" hosted the Portuguese president, <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Almeida">António José de Almeida</a>. The battleship squadron departed for Guantánamo Bay, on 29 July, and, after arrival there, remained for gunnery practice and exercises. "Connecticut", leaving the rest of the squadron, departed for Annapolis, and disembarked her midshipmen on 30 August, then proceeded to Philadelphia.

"Connecticut" departed Philadelphia, for California, on 4 October, for duty with the Pacific Fleet. After touching at San Diego, on 27 October, she arrived on 28 October, at <a href="San%20Pedro%2C%20California">San Pedro</a>, where Rear Admiral <a href="Herman%20Osman%20Stickney">H.O. Stickney</a> designated her the flagship of Pacific Fleet Training. For the next few months, "Connecticut" cruised along the West Coast, taking part in exercises and commemorations. Under the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, which set tonnage limits for its signatory nations, the Navy designated "Connecticut" for scrapping. Getting under way for her final voyage on 11 December, she made a five-day journey to the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Navy%20Yard">Puget Sound Navy Yard</a>, where she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923. On 1 November, the ex-"Connecticut" was sold for scrap to Walter W. Johnson, of San Francisco, for $42,750.

Common house martin

The common house martin ("Delichon urbicum"), sometimes called the northern house martin or, particularly in Europe, just house martin, is a <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> of the <a href="swallow">swallow</a> family which breeds in Europe, north Africa and temperate Asia; and winters in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> and <a href="tropical%20Asia">tropical Asia</a>. It feeds on insects which are caught in flight, and it migrates to climates where flying insects are plentiful. It has a blue head and upperparts, white rump and pure white underparts, and is found in both open country and near human habitation. It is similar in appearance to the two other martin <a href="species">species</a> of the genus "<a href="Delichon">Delichon</a>", which are both <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to eastern and southern Asia. It has two accepted <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>.

Both the scientific and colloquial name of the bird are related to its use of human-made structures. It builds a closed cup nest from mud pellets under eaves or similar locations on buildings usually in <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a>.

It is hunted by the <a href="Eurasian%20hobby">Eurasian hobby</a> ("Falco subbuteo"), and like other birds is affected by internal <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s and external fleas and mites, although its large range and population mean that it is not threatened globally.

The common house martin was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1758 as "Hirundo urbica", but was placed in its current genus, "Delichon", by <a href="Thomas%20Horsfield">Thomas Horsfield</a> and <a href="Frederic%20Moore">Frederic Moore</a> in 1854. "Delichon" is an <a href="anagram">anagram</a> of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Ancient Greek</a> term "χελιδών" ("chelīdōn"), meaning "swallow", and the species name "urbicum" ("urbica" until 2004, due to a misunderstanding of Latin grammar) means "of the town" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>.

The genus "<a href="Delichon">Delichon</a>" is a recent divergence from the <a href="barn%20swallow">barn swallow</a> genus "<a href="Hirundo">Hirundo</a>", and its three members are similar in appearance with blue upperparts, a contrasting white-rump, and whitish underparts. In the past, the common house martin was sometimes considered to be conspecific with the <a href="Asian%20house%20martin">Asian house martin</a> ("D. dasypus"), which breeds in the mountains of central and eastern Asia and winters in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, and it also closely resembles the <a href="Nepal%20house%20martin">Nepal house martin</a> ("D. nipalense"), a resident in the mountains of southern Asia. Although the three "Delichon" martins are similar in appearance, only "D. urbicum" has a pure white rump and underparts.

The common house martin has two geographical <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, the western <a href="Subspecies%23Nomenclature">nominate subspecies</a> "D. u. urbicum", and the eastern "D. u. lagopodum", which was described by German <a href="zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a> in 1811. Other races, like "meridionalis" from around the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> have been described, but the claimed differences from the nominate race are <a href="Cline%20%28population%20genetics%29">clinal</a>, and therefore probably invalid.

The adult common house martin of the western nominate race is long, with a wing span of and a weight averaging . It is steel-blue above with a white rump, and white underparts, including the underwings; even its short legs have white downy feathering. It has brown eyes and a small black bill, and its toes and exposed parts of the legs are pink. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile bird is sooty black, and some of its wing <a href="covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a> and quills have white tips and edgings. "D. u. lagopodum" differs from the nominate race in that its white rump extends much further onto the tail, and the fork of its tail is intermediate in depth between that of "D. u. urbicum" and that of the Asian house martin.

The white rump and underparts of the common house martin, very noticeable in flight, prevent confusion with other widespread <a href="Palearctic%20ecozone">Palaeoarctic</a> swallows such as the barn swallow ("Hirundo rustica"), <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a> ("Riparia riparia") or <a href="red-rumped%20swallow">red-rumped swallow</a> ("Cecropis daurica"). In Africa, confusion with <a href="grey-rumped%20swallow">grey-rumped swallow</a> ("Pseudhirundo griseopyga") is possible, but that species has a grey rump, off-white underparts and long, deeply forked tail. The common house martin flies with a wing beat averaging 5.3 beats per second, which is faster than the wing beat of 4.4 beats per second for the barn swallow, but the flight speed of 11 m·s (36 ft·s) is typical for hirundines.

The common house martin is a noisy species, especially at its breeding colonies. The male's song, given throughout the year, is a soft twitter of melodious chirps. The contact call, also given on the wintering grounds, is a hard "chirrrp", and the alarm is a shrill "tseep".

The subspecies "D. u. urbicum" breeds across temperate <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> east to central Mongolia and the <a href="Yenisei%20River">Yenisei River</a>, and in Morocco, Tunisia and northern Algeria, and migrates on a broad front to winter in <a href="Sahara">sub-Saharan</a> Africa. "D. u. lagopodum" breeds eastwards of the Yenisei to <a href="Kolyma">Kolyma</a> and south to northern Mongolia and northern China; it winters in southern China and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>.

The preferred habitat of the common house martin is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, and preferably near water, although it is also found in mountains up to at least altitude. It is much more urban than the barn swallow, and will nest even in city centres if the air is clean enough. It is more likely to be found near trees than other Eurasian swallows, since they provide insect food and also roosting sites. This species does not normally use the reed-bed roosts favoured by migrating barn swallows.

It uses similar open habitats on the wintering grounds, but the common house martin is less conspicuous than wintering barn swallows, tending to fly higher and be more nomadic. In the tropical parts of its wintering range, like <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a> and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, it appears to be mainly found in the higher areas.

The common house martin is a <a href="Bird%20migration">migrant</a> which moves on a broad-front (i.e. European birds are not funnelled through the short sea crossings used by large soaring birds, but cross the Mediterranean and <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>). While migrating they feed in the air on insects, and they usually travel in daylight. Migration brings its own hazards; in 1974, several hundred thousand birds of this species were found dead or dying in the <a href="Swiss%20Alps">Swiss Alps</a> and surrounding areas, caught by heavy snowfall and low temperatures. Adult survival on autumn migration depends mainly on temperature, with precipitation another major factor, but for juveniles low temperatures during the breeding season are more critical. It is anticipated that since extreme weather is predicted to become more frequent with <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, future survival rates will depend more on adverse weather conditions than at present.

The common house martin returns to the breeding grounds a few days after the first barn swallows; like that species, particularly when the weather is poor, it seldom goes straight to the nesting sites, but hunts for food over large fresh water bodies. There are records of migrant house martins staying to breed in Namibia and South Africa instead of returning north. As would be expected for a long distance migrant, it has occurred as a vagrant eastwards to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and west to <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, Bermuda and the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>.

The common house martin was originally a cliff and cave nester, and some cliff-nesting colonies still exist, with the nests built below an overhanging rock. It now largely uses human structures such as bridges and houses. Unlike the barn swallow, it uses the outside of inhabited buildings, rather than the inside of barns or stables. The nests are built at the junction of a vertical surface and an overhang, such as on house eaves, so that they may be strengthened by attachment to both planes.

Breeding birds return to Europe between April and May, and nest building starts between late March in North Africa and mid-June in <a href="S%C3%A1pmi%20%28area%29">Lapland</a>. The nest is a neat closed convex cup fixed below a suitable ledge, with a narrow opening at the top. It is constructed by both sexes with mud pellets collected in their beaks, and lined with grasses, hair or other soft materials. The mud, added in successive layers, is collected from ponds, streams or puddles. <a href="House%20sparrow">House sparrow</a>s frequently attempt to take over the nest during construction, with the house martins rebuilding elsewhere if they are successful. The entrance at the top of the cup is so small once it is complete that sparrows cannot take over the nest.

The common house martin tends to breed colonially, and nests may be built in contact with each other. A <a href="Group%20size%20measures">colony size</a> of less than 10 nests is typical, but there are records of colonies with thousands of nests. Four or five white eggs are usually laid, which average in size, and weigh . The female does most of the incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, first-year birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.

There are normally two broods each year, the nest being reused for the second brood, and repaired and used again in subsequent years. Hatching success is 90%, and fledging survival 60–80%. Third broods are not uncommon, though late nestlings are often left to starve. The average annual mortality for adults nesting in the <a href="Palearctic%20ecozone">Western Palaearctic</a> is 40–60%, with most deaths outside the breeding season. A study of British breeders gave an average adult survival rate of just under 40%, but ranging from 25% to 70%. Rainfall in the African wintering grounds is a major factor in adult survival, although wet weather in the breeding areas has very little effect. Although individuals aged 10 and 14 years have been recorded, most survive less than five years. For weeks after leaving the nest the young congregate in ever-increasing flocks which, as the season advances, may be seen gathering in trees or on housetops, or on the wires with swallows. By the end of October, most martins have left their breeding areas in western and central Europe, though late birds in November and December are not uncommon, and further south migration finishes later anyway.

Once established, pairs remain together to breed for life; however, extra-pair copulations are common, making this species genetically polygamous, despite being socially monogamous. A <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> study showed that 15% of nestlings were not related to their putative fathers, and 32% of broods contained at least one extra-pair chick. Extra-pair males, usually from nests where laying had already taken place, were often seen to enter other nests. The paired male initially ensured that his female spent little time alone at the nest, and accompanied her on flights, but the mate-guarding slackened after egg laying began, so the youngest nestling was the most likely to have a different father.

The common house martin has been regularly recorded as hybridising with the barn swallow, this being one of the most common passerine interspecific crosses. The frequency of this hybrid has led to suggestions that "Delichon" is not sufficiently separated genetically from "Hirundo" to be considered a separate genus.

The common house martin is similar in habits to other aerial <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s, including other swallows and martins and the unrelated <a href="swift">swift</a>s, and catches insects in flight. In the breeding areas, <a href="fly">flies</a> and <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s make up much of the diet, and in Europe, the house martin takes a larger proportion of aphids and small flies than the barn swallow. As with that species, <a href="hymenoptera">hymenoptera</a>ns, especially flying <a href="ant">ant</a>s, are important food items in the wintering area.

This species hunts at an average height of during the breeding season, but lower in wet conditions. The hunting grounds are typically within of the nest, with a preference for open ground or water, the latter especially in poor weather, but the martins will also follow the plough or large animals to catch disturbed insects. On the wintering grounds, hunting takes place at a greater height of over .

Although the common house martin is hunted by the <a href="Eurasian%20hobby">hobby</a> ("<a href="Falco%20subbuteo">Falco subbuteo</a>"), its aerial skills enable it to evade most predators.

It is parasitised externally by <a href="fleas">fleas</a> and <a href="mites">mites</a>, including the "house martin flea", "<a href="Ceratophyllus%20hirundinis">Ceratophyllus hirundinis</a>", and internally by <a href="endoparasites">endoparasites</a> such as "<a href="Haemoproteus%20prognei">Haemoproteus prognei</a>" (avian <a href="malaria">malaria</a>), which are transmitted by blood-sucking insects including mosquitoes. A Polish study showed that nests typically contained more than 29 specimens of ectoparasite, with "C. hirundinis" and "<a href="Oeciacus%20hirundinis">Oeciacus hirundinis</a>" the most abundant.

The common house martin has a large range, with an estimated global extent of . Its European population is estimated to be 20–48 million individuals. Global population trends have not been quantified, although there is evidence of population fluctuations. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>, and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>) which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants. In Europe and Britain however, population numbers indicate a declining trend, and leading conservation groups in Britain have updated the conservations status to amber indicating medium conservation concern there.

This is a species which has greatly benefited historically from forest clearance creating the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation which has given it an abundance of safe nest sites. However, populations can fluctuate locally for a number of reasons. New housing has created more nest sites, and clean-air legislation has enabled breeding in the centre of major cities like London. The population of house martins in Sheffield, central UK, has been estimated at 12,353 individuals. Conversely, poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows can reduce numbers. Widespread declines in common house martin numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970. As an attractive bird which feeds on flying insects, the house martin has usually been tolerated by humans when it shares their buildings for nesting, although the accumulation of droppings below breeding birds can be a nuisance leading to some destruction of nests.

This species lacks the wealth of literary references associated with its relative, the barn swallow, although it is possible that some of the older mentions for that bird might equally well refer to the house martin. <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> was clearly describing the house martin when <a href="Banquo">Banquo</a> brings the nests and birds to the attention of <a href="Duncan%20I%20of%20Scotland">Duncan</a> at Macbeth's castle, <a href="Inverness">Inverness</a>: "This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve
By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed
The air is delicate." (<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>, Act I, scene VI).

There are old legends, with no basis in fact, that house martins would wall-up house sparrows by closing the entrance of the mud nest with the intruder inside, or that they would gather "en masse" to kill a sparrow.

The <a href="martlet">martlet</a>, often believed to refer to the house martin, or possibly a swallow, was a <a href="Heraldry">heraldic</a> bird with short tufts of feathers in the place of legs. It was the <a href="cadency">cadency</a> mark of the fourth son of a noble family, and features in many <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coats of arms</a>, including the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">Plantagenets</a>. The lack of feet signified its inability to land, which explained its link to a younger son, also landless. It also represented swiftness.

Isidor Isaac Rabi

Isidor Isaac Rabi (; born Israel Isaac Rabi, 29 July 1898 – 11 January 1988) was an American <a href="physicist">physicist</a> who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944 for his discovery of <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a>, which is used in <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a>. He was also one of the first scientists in the United States to work on the <a href="cavity%20magnetron">cavity magnetron</a>, which is used in <a href="microwave%20radar">microwave radar</a> and <a href="microwave%20oven">microwave oven</a>s.

Born into a traditional <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> family in <a href="Ryman%C3%B3w">Rymanów</a>, <a href="Galicia%20%28Central%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>, in what was then part of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, Rabi came to the United States as a baby and was raised in New York's <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a>. He entered <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> as an <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a> student in 1916, but soon switched to <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>. Later, he became interested in <a href="physics">physics</a>. He continued his studies at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, where he was awarded his doctorate for a thesis on the <a href="magnetic%20susceptibility">magnetic susceptibility</a> of certain crystals. In 1927, he headed for Europe, where he met and worked with many of the finest physicists of the time.

In 1929, Rabi returned to the United States, where Columbia offered him a faculty position. In collaboration with <a href="Gregory%20Breit">Gregory Breit</a>, he developed the <a href="Breit%E2%80%93Rabi%20equation">Breit–Rabi equation</a> and predicted that the <a href="Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach%20experiment">Stern–Gerlach experiment</a> could be modified to confirm the properties of the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>. His techniques for using nuclear magnetic resonance to discern the <a href="magnetic%20moment">magnetic moment</a> and <a href="nuclear%20spin">nuclear spin</a> of atoms earned him the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1944. Nuclear magnetic resonance became an important tool for nuclear physics and chemistry, and the subsequent development of magnetic resonance imaging from it has also made it important to the field of medicine.

During World War II he worked on <a href="radar">radar</a> at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) <a href="Radiation%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a> (RadLab) and on the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a>, and was chairman from 1952 to 1956. He also served on the Science Advisory Committees (SACs) of the <a href="Office%20of%20Defense%20Mobilization">Office of Defense Mobilization</a> and the Army's <a href="Ballistic%20Research%20Laboratory">Ballistic Research Laboratory</a>, and was <a href="President%27s%20Science%20Advisory%20Committee">Science Advisor</a> to President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. He was involved with the establishment of the <a href="Brookhaven%20National%20Laboratory">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> in 1946, and later, as United States delegate to <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, with the creation of <a href="CERN">CERN</a> in 1952. When Columbia created the rank of University Professor in 1964, Rabi was the first to receive that position. A special chair was named after him in 1985. He retired from teaching in 1967 but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus and Special Lecturer until his death.

Israel Isaac Rabi was born on 29 July 1898 into a <a href="Polish-Jewish">Polish-Jewish</a> <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a> family in <a href="Ryman%C3%B3w">Rymanów</a>, <a href="Galicia%20%28Central%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>, in what was then part of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> but is now Poland. Soon after he was born, his father, David Rabi, emigrated to the United States. The younger Rabi and his mother, Sheindel, joined David there a few months later, and the family moved into a two-room apartment on the <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a> of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. At home the family spoke <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>. When Rabi was enrolled in school, Sheindel said his name was Izzy, and a school official, thinking it was short for Isidor, put that down as his name. Henceforth, that became his official name. Later, in response to <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>, he started writing his name as Isidor Isaac Rabi, and was known professionally as I.I. Rabi. To most of his friends and family, including his sister Gertrude, who was born in 1903, he was known simply as "Rabi", which was pronounced "Robby". In 1907, the family moved to <a href="Brownsville%2C%20Brooklyn">Brownsville, Brooklyn</a>, where they ran a grocery store.

As a boy, Rabi was interested in science. He read science books borrowed from the public library and built his own radio set. His first scientific paper, on the design of a <a href="Microphone%23Condenser%20microphone">radio condenser</a>, was published in "<a href="Modern%20Electrics">Modern Electrics</a>" when he was in elementary school. After reading about <a href="Copernican%20heliocentrism">Copernican heliocentrism</a>, he became an atheist. "It's all very simple", he told his parents, adding, "Who needs God?" As a compromise with his parents, for his <a href="Bar%20Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvah</a>, which was held at home, he gave a speech in Yiddish about how an electric light works. He attended the <a href="John%20Jay%20Educational%20Campus%20%28Brooklyn%29">Manual Training High School</a> in Brooklyn, from which he graduated in 1916. Later that year, he entered <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> as an <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a> student, but soon switched to <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>. After the <a href="American%20entry%20into%20World%20War%20I">American entry into World War I</a> in 1917, he joined the <a href="Student%20Army%20Training%20Corps">Student Army Training Corps</a> at Cornell. For his senior thesis, he investigated the <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>s of <a href="manganese">manganese</a>. He was awarded his Bachelor of Science degree in June 1919, but since at the time Jews were largely excluded from employment in the chemical industry and academia, he did not receive any job offers. He worked briefly at the <a href="Lederle%20Laboratories">Lederle Laboratories</a>, and then as a <a href="bookkeeper">bookkeeper</a>.

In 1922 Rabi returned to Cornell as a graduate chemistry student, and began studying physics. In 1923 he met, and began courting, Helen Newmark, a summer-semester student at <a href="Hunter%20College">Hunter College</a>. In order to be near her when she returned home, Rabi continued his studies at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, where his supervisor was <a href="Albert%20Potter%20Wills">Albert Wills</a>. In June 1924 Rabi landed a job as a part-time tutor at the <a href="City%20College%20of%20New%20York">City College of New York</a>. Wills, whose specialty was magnetism, suggested that Rabi write his doctoral thesis on the <a href="magnetic%20susceptibility">magnetic susceptibility</a> of <a href="sodium">sodium</a> vapor. The topic did not appeal to Rabi, but after <a href="William%20Lawrence%20Bragg">William Lawrence Bragg</a> gave a seminar at Columbia about the <a href="electric%20susceptibility">electric susceptibility</a> of certain crystals called <a href="Tutton%27s%20salt">Tutton's salt</a>s, Rabi decided to research their magnetic susceptibility, and Wills agreed to be his supervisor.

Measuring the magnetic resonance of crystals first involved <a href="crystal%20growth">growing the crystals</a>, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals then had to be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a>'s 1873 "<a href="A%20Treatise%20on%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism">A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism</a>", which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a <a href="torsion%20balance">torsion balance</a> into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two magnetic poles. When it matched that of the crystal, the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled "On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals", to "<a href="Physical%20Review">Physical Review</a>" on 16 July 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by <a href="Kariamanickam%20Srinivasa%20Krishnan">Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan</a>, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded that he needed to promote his work as well as publish it.

Like many other young physicists, Rabi was closely following momentous events in Europe. He was astounded by the <a href="Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach%20experiment">Stern–Gerlach experiment</a>, which convinced him of the validity of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. With <a href="Ralph%20Kronig">Ralph Kronig</a>, <a href="Francis%20Bitter">Francis Bitter</a>, <a href="Mark%20Zemansky">Mark Zemansky</a> and others, he set out to extend the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger equation</a> to <a href="Rotational%E2%80%93vibrational%20spectroscopy%23Symmetric%20top%20molecules">symmetric top molecules</a> and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was that none of them could solve the resulting equation, a second-order <a href="partial%20differential%20equation">partial differential equation</a>. Rabi found the answer in a book by the 19th-century mathematician <a href="Carl%20Gustav%20Jacob%20Jacobi">Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi</a>. The equation had the form of a <a href="hypergeometric%20function">hypergeometric equation</a> to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to "Physical Review", which published it in 1927.

In May 1927, Rabi was appointed a Barnard Fellow. This came with a <a href="stipend">stipend</a> of $1,500 ($ in dollars) for the period from September 1927 to June 1928. He immediately applied for a year's leave of absence from the City College of New York so he could study in Europe. When this was refused, he resigned. On reaching <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, where he hoped to work for <a href="Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a>, he met two fellow Americans, <a href="Julius%20Adams%20Stratton">Julius Adams Stratton</a> and <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>. They found that Schrödinger was leaving, as he had been appointed head of the Theoretical Institute at <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">Friedrich Wilhelm University</a> in Berlin. Rabi therefore decided to seek a position with <a href="Arnold%20Sommerfeld">Arnold Sommerfeld</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Munich">University of Munich</a> instead. In Munich, he found two more Americans, <a href="Howard%20Percy%20Robertson">Howard Percy Robertson</a> and <a href="Edward%20Condon">Edward Condon</a>. Sommerfeld accepted Rabi as a postdoctoral student. German physicists <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a> and <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a> were also working with Sommerfeld at the time, but the three Americans became especially close.

On Wills' advice, Rabi traveled to <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> for the 97th annual meeting of the <a href="British%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, where he heard <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> present a paper on quantum mechanics. Afterwards, Rabi moved to <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, where he volunteered to work for <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>. Bohr was on vacation, but Rabi went straight to work on calculating the magnetic susceptibility of molecular <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. After Bohr returned in October, he arranged for Rabi and <a href="Yoshio%20Nishina">Yoshio Nishina</a> to continue their work with <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Hamburg">University of Hamburg</a>.

Although he came to <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> to work with Pauli, Rabi found <a href="Otto%20Stern">Otto Stern</a> working there with two English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, Ronald Fraser and John Bradshaw Taylor. Rabi soon made friends with them, and became interested in their <a href="molecular%20beam">molecular beam</a> experiments, for which Stern would receive the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1943. Their research involved non-uniform magnetic fields, which were difficult to manipulate and hard to measure accurately. Rabi came up with the idea of using a uniform field instead, with the molecular beam at a glancing angle, so the atoms would be deflected like light through a prism. This would be easier to use, and produce more accurate results. Encouraged by Stern, and greatly assisted by Taylor, Rabi managed to get his idea to work. On Stern's advice, Rabi wrote a letter about his results to "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>", which published it in February 1929, followed by a paper entitled "Zur Methode der Ablenkung von Molekularstrahlen" ("On the method of deflection of molecular beams") to "<a href="Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20Physik">Zeitschrift für Physik</a>", where it was published in April.

By this time the Barnard Fellowship had expired, and Rabi and Helen were living off a $182 per month stipend from the <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a>. They left Hamburg for <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, where he hoped to work with Heisenberg. In Leipzig, he found <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a>, a fellow New Yorker. It would be the start of a long friendship. Heisenberg departed for a tour of the United States in March 1929, so Rabi and Oppenheimer decided to go to the <a href="ETH%20Zurich">ETH Zurich</a>, where Pauli was now the professor of physics. Rabi's education in physics was enriched by the leaders in the field he met there, which included <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>, <a href="Walter%20Heitler">Walter Heitler</a>, <a href="Fritz%20London">Fritz London</a>, <a href="Francis%20Wheeler%20Loomis">Francis Wheeler Loomis</a>, <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, <a href="John%20C.%20Slater">John Slater</a>, <a href="Le%C3%B3%20Szil%C3%A1rd">Leó Szilárd</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a>.

On 26 March 1929, Rabi received an offer of a lectureship from Columbia, with an annual salary of $3,000. The dean of Columbia's physics department, <a href="George%20B.%20Pegram">George B. Pegram</a>, was looking for a theoretical physicist to teach <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a> and an advanced course in the new subject of quantum mechanics, and Heisenberg had recommended Rabi. Helen was now pregnant, so Rabi needed a regular job, and this job was in New York. He accepted, and returned to the United States in August on the . Rabi became the only Jewish faculty member at Columbia at the time.
As a teacher, Rabi was underwhelming. <a href="Leon%20Lederman">Leon Lederman</a> recalled that after a lecture, students would head to the library to try to work out what Rabi had been talking about. <a href="Irving%20Kaplan%20%28chemist%29">Irving Kaplan</a> rated Rabi and <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a> as "the worst teachers I ever had". <a href="Norman%20Ramsey">Norman Ramsey</a> considered Rabi's lectures "pretty dreadful", while <a href="William%20Nierenberg">William Nierenberg</a> felt that he was "simply an awful lecturer". Despite his shortcomings as a lecturer, his influence was great. He inspired many of his students to pursue careers in physics, and some became famous.

Rabi's first daughter, Helen Elizabeth, was born in September 1929. A second girl, Margaret Joella, followed in 1934. Between his teaching duties and his family, he had little time for research, and published no papers in his first year at Columbia, but was nonetheless promoted to assistant professor at its conclusion. He became a professor in 1937.

In 1931 Rabi returned to particle beam experiments. In collaboration with <a href="Gregory%20Breit">Gregory Breit</a>, he developed the <a href="Breit-Rabi%20equation">Breit-Rabi equation</a>, and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm the properties of the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>. The next step was to do so. With the help of Victor W. Cohen, Rabi built a molecular beam apparatus at Columbia. Their idea was to employ a weak magnetic field instead of a strong one, with which they hoped to detect the <a href="nuclear%20spin">nuclear spin</a> of sodium. When the experiment was conducted, four beamlets were found, from which they deduced a nuclear spin of .

Rabi's Molecular Beam Laboratory began to attract others, including <a href="Sidney%20Millman">Sidney Millman</a>, a graduate student who studied <a href="lithium">lithium</a> for his doctorate. Another was <a href="Jerrold%20Zacharias">Jerrold Zacharias</a> who, believing that the sodium nucleus would be too difficult to understand, proposed studying the simplest of the elements, hydrogen. Its <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> isotope had only recently been discovered at Columbia in 1931 by Urey, who received the 1934 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for this work. Urey was able to supply them with both <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> and gaseous deuterium for their experiments. Despite its simplicity, Stern's group in Hamburg had observed that hydrogen did not behave as predicted. Urey also helped in another way; he gave Rabi half his prize money to fund the Molecular Beam Laboratory. Other scientists whose careers began at the Molecular Beam Laboratory included Norman Ramsey, <a href="Julian%20Schwinger">Julian Schwinger</a>, <a href="Jerome%20Kellogg">Jerome Kellogg</a> and <a href="Polykarp%20Kusch">Polykarp Kusch</a>. All were men; Rabi did not believe that women could be physicists. He never had a woman as a doctoral or postdoctoral student, and generally opposed women as candidates for faculty positions.

At the suggestion of <a href="C.%20J.%20Gorter">C. J. Gorter</a>, the team attempted to use an oscillating field. This became the basis for the <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> method. In 1937, Rabi, Kusch, Millman and Zacharias used it to measure the <a href="magnetic%20moment">magnetic moment</a> of several lithium compounds with molecular beams, including <a href="lithium%20chloride">lithium chloride</a>, <a href="lithium%20fluoride">lithium fluoride</a> and <a href="dilithium">dilithium</a>. Applying the method to hydrogen, they found that the moment of a <a href="proton">proton</a> was 2.785±0.02 <a href="nuclear%20magneton">nuclear magneton</a>s, and not 1 as predicted by the then-current theory, while that of a deuteron was 0.855±0.006 nuclear magnetons. This provided more accurate measurements of what Stern's team had found, and Rabi's team had confirmed, in 1934. Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a <a href="neutron">neutron</a> with aligned spins, the <a href="neutron%20magnetic%20moment">neutron's magnetic moment</a> could be inferred by subtracting the proton's magnetic moment from the deuteron's. The resulting value was not zero, and had a sign opposite to that of the proton. Based on curious artifacts of these more accurate measurements, Rabi suggested that the deuteron had an <a href="quadrupole">electric quadrupole moment</a>. This discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the <a href="nuclear%20force">nuclear force</a> binding nucleons. For the creation of the molecular-beam magnetic-resonance detection method, Rabi was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1944.

In September 1940, Rabi became a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's <a href="Ballistic%20Research%20Laboratory">Ballistic Research Laboratory</a>. That month, the British <a href="Tizard%20Mission">Tizard Mission</a> brought a number of new technologies to the United States, including a <a href="cavity%20magnetron">cavity magnetron</a>, a high-powered device that generates <a href="microwave">microwave</a>s using the interaction of a stream of <a href="electron">electron</a>s with a <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>. This device, which promised to revolutionize <a href="radar">radar</a>, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. <a href="Alfred%20Lee%20Loomis">Alfred Lee Loomis</a> of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> decided to establish a new laboratory at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name <a href="Radiation%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a> was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Berkeley Radiation Laboratory</a>. Loomis recruited <a href="Lee%20DuBridge">Lee DuBridge</a> to run it.

Loomis and DuBridge recruited physicists for the new laboratory at an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret that it had to be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave radar set by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype installed in a <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">Douglas A-20 Havoc</a> by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave radar set was produced. The magnetron was further developed on both sides of the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150 cm to 10 cm, and then to 3 cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the <a href="SCR-584%20radar">SCR-584 radar</a> for <a href="fire-control%20system">fire control</a>, and <a href="LORAN">LORAN</a>, a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.

In 1942 Oppenheimer attempted to recruit Rabi and <a href="Robert%20Bacher">Robert Bacher</a> to work at the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> on a new secret project. They convinced Oppenheimer that his plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> under contract from the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a>. In the end, Rabi still did not go west, but did agree to serve as a consultant to the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. Rabi attended the <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity test</a> in July 1945. The scientists working on Trinity set up a <a href="betting%20pool">betting pool</a> on the yield of the test, with predictions ranging from total dud to 45 kilotons of <a href="TNT%20equivalent">TNT equivalent</a> (kt). Rabi arrived late and found the only entry left was for 18 kilotons, which he purchased. Wearing welding goggles, he waited for the result with Ramsey and <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>. The blast was rated at 18.6 kilotons, and Rabi won the pool.

In 1945, Rabi delivered the Richtmyer Memorial Lecture, held by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20Physics%20Teachers">American Association of Physics Teachers</a> in honor of <a href="Floyd%20K.%20Richtmyer">Floyd K. Richtmyer</a>, wherein he proposed that the magnetic resonance of atoms might be used as the basis of a clock. <a href="William%20L.%20Laurence">William L. Laurence</a> wrote it up for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", under the headline "'Cosmic pendulum' for clock planned". Before long Zacharias and Ramsey had built such <a href="atomic%20clock">atomic clock</a>s. Rabi actively pursued his research into magnetic resonance until about 1960, but he continued to make appearances at conferences and seminars until his death.
Rabi chaired Columbia's physics department from 1945 to 1949, during which time it was home to two Nobel laureates (Rabi and Enrico Fermi) and eleven future laureates, including seven faculty (Polykarp Kusch, <a href="Willis%20Lamb">Willis Lamb</a>, <a href="Maria%20Goeppert-Mayer">Maria Goeppert-Mayer</a>, <a href="James%20Rainwater">James Rainwater</a>, Norman Ramsey, <a href="Charles%20Townes">Charles Townes</a> and <a href="Hideki%20Yukawa">Hideki Yukawa</a>), a research scientist (<a href="Aage%20Bohr">Aage Bohr</a>), a visiting professor (Hans Bethe), a doctoral student (Leon Lederman) and an undergraduate (<a href="Leon%20Cooper">Leon Cooper</a>). <a href="Martin%20L.%20Perl">Martin L. Perl</a>, a doctoral student of Rabi's, won the Nobel Prize in 1995. Rabi was the <a href="Eugene%20Higgins%20professor%20of%20physics">Eugene Higgins professor of physics</a> at Columbia but when Columbia created the rank of University Professor in 1964, Rabi was the first to receive such a chair. This meant that he was free to research or teach whatever he chose. He retired from teaching in 1967 but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus until his death. A special chair was named after him in 1985.

A legacy of the Manhattan Project was the network of <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy%20National%20Laboratories">national laboratories</a>, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, he set up a rival group at MIT and <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a>. Rabi had discussions with <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie%20Groves">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>, the director of the Manhattan Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins</a>, MIT, <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Rochester">Rochester</a> and <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a>) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the <a href="Brookhaven%20National%20Laboratory">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a>.
Rabi suggested to <a href="Edoardo%20Amaldi">Edoardo Amaldi</a> that Brookhaven might be a model that Europeans could emulate. Rabi saw science as a way of inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the <a href="UNESCO">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization</a> (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the <a href="Palazzo%20Vecchio">Palazzo Vecchio</a> in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the "Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire" (<a href="CERN">CERN</a>). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed and hung it on the wall of his home office.

The <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201946">Atomic Energy Act of 1946</a> that created the Atomic Energy Commission provided for a nine-man General Advisory Committee (GAC) to advise the Commission on scientific and technical matters. Rabi was one of those appointed in December 1946. The GAC was enormously influential throughout the late 1940s, but in 1950 the GAC unanimously opposed the development of the <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a>. Rabi went further than most of the other members, and joined Fermi in opposing the hydrogen bomb on moral as well as technical grounds. However, President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> overrode the GAC's advice, and ordered development to proceed. Rabi later said:

Oppenheimer was not reappointed to the GAC when his term expired in 1952, and Rabi succeeded him as chairman, serving until 1956. Rabi later testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Atomic Energy Commission's <a href="Oppenheimer%20security%20hearing">controversial security hearing</a> in 1954 that led to Oppenheimer being stripped of his security clearance. Many witnesses supported Oppenheimer, but none more forcefully than Rabi:

Rabi was appointed a member of the Science Advisory Committee (SAC) of the <a href="Office%20of%20Defense%20Mobilization">Office of Defense Mobilization</a> in 1952, serving as its chairman from 1956 to 1957. This coincided with the <a href="Sputnik%20crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>. President <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> met with the SAC on 15 October 1957, to seek advice on possible US responses to the <a href="Soviet%20space%20program">Soviet satellite success</a>. Rabi, who knew Eisenhower from the latter's time as president of Columbia, was the first to speak, and put forward a series of proposals, one of which was to strengthen the committee so it could provide the President with timely advice. This was done, and the SAC became the <a href="President%27s%20Science%20Advisory%20Committee">President's Science Advisory Committee</a> a few weeks later. He also became Eisenhower's Science Advisor. In 1956 Rabi attended the <a href="Project%20Nobska">Project Nobska</a> <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a> conference, where discussion ranged from <a href="oceanography">oceanography</a> to nuclear weapons. He served as the US Representative to the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> Science Committee at the time that the term "software engineering" was coined. While serving in that capacity, he bemoaned the fact that many large software projects were delayed. This prompted discussions that led to the formation of a study group that organized the first conference on software engineering.

In the course of his life, Rabi received many honors in addition to the Nobel Prize.

Great spotted woodpecker

The great spotted woodpecker ("Dendrocopos major") is a medium-sized <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a> with pied black and white plumage and a red patch on the lower belly. Males and young birds also have red markings on the neck or head. This species is found across Eurasia and parts of North Africa. Across most of its range it is <a href="bird%20migration">resident</a>, but in the north some will migrate if the <a href="conifer%20cone">conifer cone</a> crop fails. Some individuals have a tendency to wander, leading to the recent recolonisation of Ireland and to <a href="Vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrancy</a> to North America. Great spotted woodpeckers chisel into trees to find food or excavate nest holes, and also drum for contact and territorial advertisement; they have <a href="anatomy">anatomical</a> adaptations to manage the physical stresses from the hammering action. It is similar to the less common <a href="lesser%20spotted%20woodpecker">lesser spotted woodpecker</a>.

The great spotted woodpecker occurs in all types of woodlands and is catholic in its diet, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect <a href="larva">larva</a>e from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips. The typical <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean. When the young <a href="fledge">fledge</a> they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.

The great spotted woodpecker is closely related to some other members of its genus. It has a number of <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, some of which are distinctive enough to be potential new species. It has a huge range and large population, with no widespread threats, so it is classed as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).

The <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s are an ancient bird family consisting of three subfamilies, the <a href="wryneck">wryneck</a>s, the <a href="piculet">piculet</a>s and the true woodpeckers, <a href="Picinae">Picinae</a>. The largest of the six <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribes</a> within the Picinae is the pied woodpeckers, a group which includes the great spotted woodpecker. Within the large genus "<a href="Dendrocopus">Dendrocopus</a>" the great spotted woodpecker's closest relatives are the <a href="Himalayan%20woodpecker">Himalayan</a>, <a href="Sind%20woodpecker">Sind</a>, <a href="Syrian%20woodpecker">Syrian</a> and <a href="white-winged%20woodpecker">white-winged woodpecker</a>s and possibly the <a href="Darjeeling%20woodpecker">Darjeeling woodpecker</a>. The great spotted woodpecker has been recorded as <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridising</a> with the Syrian woodpecker.

The great spotted woodpecker was described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his 1758 "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" as "Picus major". It was moved to its current genus, "Dendrocopus", by the German naturalist <a href="Carl%20Ludwig%20Koch">Carl Ludwig Koch</a> in 1816. The genus name "Dendrocopus" is a combination of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words "dendron ", "tree", and "kopos", "striking ". The specific "major" is from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "maior", "greater".

The number of subspecies of the great spotted woodpecker recognised by different authors varies widely from as few as 14 to nearly 30. This is largely because changes are <a href="cline%20%28biology%29">clinal</a> with many intermediate forms. However, <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> data suggests that the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> region's "Dendrocopus major poelzami", Japanese "D. m. japonicus" and Chinese "D. m. cabanisi" may all merit full species status. Despite its distinctive appearance, "D. m. canariensis" from <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> in the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> appears to be closely related to the <a href="Subspecies%23Nominotypical%20subspecies%20and%20subspecies%20autonyms">nominate subspecies</a> "D. m. major".

The <a href="chronospecies">fossil subspecies</a> "D. m. submajor" lived during the <a href="Middle%20Pleistocene">Middle Pleistocene</a> <a href="Riss%20glaciation">Riss glaciation</a> (250,000 to 300,000 years ago) when it was found in Europe south of the <a href="ice%20sheet">ice sheet</a>. It is sometimes treated as a distinct species, but did not differ significantly from the extant great spotted woodpecker, whose European subspecies are probably its direct descendants.

The adult great spotted woodpecker is long, weighs and has a wingspan. The upperparts are glossy blue-black, with white on the sides of the face and neck. Black lines run from the shoulder to the nape, the base of the bill and about halfway across the breast. There is a large white shoulder patch and the flight feathers are barred with black and white, as is the tail. The underparts are white other than a scarlet lower belly and undertail. The bill is slate-black, the legs greenish-grey and the eye is deep red. Males have a crimson patch on the nape, which is absent from the otherwise similar females. Juvenile birds are less glossy than adults and have a brown tinge to their upperparts and dirty white underparts. Their markings are less well-defined than the adult's and the lower belly is pink rather than red. The crown of the juvenile's head is red, less extensively in young females than males.

The various subspecies differ in plumage, the general pattern being that northern forms are larger, heavier-billed and whiter beneath, as predicted by <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">Bergmann's rule</a>, so north Eurasian "D. m. major" and "D. m. kamtschaticus" are large and strikingly white, whereas "D. m. hispanicus" in <a href="Iberia">Iberia</a> and "D. m. harterti" in <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> and <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> are somewhat smaller and have darker underparts. "D. m. canariensis" and "D. m. thanneri" in the Canary Islands are similar to the Iberian race but have contrasting white flanks. In Morocco, "D. m. mauritanus" is pale below with red in the centre of its breast, and birds breeding at higher altitudes are larger and darker than those lower in the hills. "D. m. numidus" in Algeria and Tunisia is very distinctive, with a breast band of red-tipped black feathers. Caspian "D. m. poelzami" is small, relatively long-billed and has brown underparts. "D. m. japonicus" of Japan has less white on its shoulders but more in its wings. The two Chinese forms, "D. m. cabanisi" and "D. m. stresemanni", have brownish heads and underparts, and often some red on the breast. Both races have increasingly dark underparts towards the south of their respective ranges.

The great spotted woodpecker is similar to some other species in its genus. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, although juvenile great spotted woodpeckers often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can potentially be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has a far more extensive white wing patch than the great spotted woodpecker. The Sind woodpecker is very similar to the Syrian species, and can be distinguished from great spotted woodpecker in the same way.

Adult great spotted woodpeckers have a complete <a href="moulting">moult</a> after the breeding season which takes about 120 days. Northern "D. m. major" starts its moult from mid-June to late July and finishes in October or November, temperate races like "D. m. pinetorum" are earlier, commencing in early June to mid-July and completing in mid-September to late October, and southern "D. m. hispanicus" starts late May or June and finishes as early as August. Juveniles have a partial moult, retaining some of the wing <a href="covert%20feather">coverts</a> but replacing body, tail and <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primary</a> feathers. This moult to near-adult plumage starts from late May to early August and finishes from mid-September to late November, timing varying with latitude as with the adults.

The call of the great spotted woodpecker is a sharp "kik", which may be repeated as a wooden rattling "krrarraarr" if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, "gwig", is mostly given in the display flight. The great spotted woodpecker drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.

Both sexes drum, although the male does so much more often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16 strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late as the early twentieth century it was thought that the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.

The great spotted woodpecker occurs in Eurasia from the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> to Japan, and in North Africa from Morocco to Tunisia, and it is absent only from those areas too cold or dry to have suitable woodland habitat. It is found in a wide variety of woodlands, <a href="Flowering%20plant">broadleaf</a>, <a href="Pinophyta">coniferous</a> or mixed, and in modified habitats like parks, gardens and <a href="olive">olive</a> groves. It occurs from sea-level to the <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a>, up to in Europe, in Morocco and in <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>.

The great spotted woodpecker is mainly resident year-round, but sizeable <a href="bird%20migration">movements</a> can occur when there are shortages of <a href="pine">pine</a> and <a href="spruce">spruce</a> cones in the north of the range. Highland populations often descend to lower altitudes in winter. Juveniles also have a tendency to wander some distance from where they were hatched, often as far as , sometimes up to . Vagrants have reached the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> and Iceland, and there are several sightings from North America in at least the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, <a href="Pribilof%20Islands">Pribilof Islands</a> and <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>.

The great spotted woodpecker became extinct in the island of <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> in the seventeenth century, due to deforestation, but the island was naturally recolonised by this species, with the first proven nesting in <a href="County%20Down">County Down</a> in 2007. Its expansion in range is continuing, with breeding proven or suspected in at least 10 counties by 2013, with the main concentration in Down and <a href="County%20Wicklow">County Wicklow</a>. <a href="Gene">Gene</a>tic evidence shows the birds to be of British, rather than Scandinavian, ancestry, with the populations in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Irish Republic</a> having separate origins. The great spotted woodpecker was also found to have been nesting in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> from 2009.

The great spotted woodpecker spends much of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, many of which are shared by other woodpecker species. These include the <a href="Dactyly%23Zygodactyly">zygodactyl</a> arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>, the <a href="pygostyle">pygostyle</a>, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.

The hammering of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great forces which are potentially damaging to the birds. In the great spotted woodpecker and most of its relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper <a href="mandible">mandible</a> is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.

As well as using holes for breeding, great spotted woodpeckers roost at night, and sometimes during the day, in old nest cavities, excavated by other woodpeckers. They will occasionally make a new roosting hole or use an artificial site such as a nest box.

Great spotted woodpeckers are strongly territorial, typically occupying areas of about year-round, which are defended mainly by the male, a behaviour which attracts females. Pairs are <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> during the breeding period, but often change partners before the next season.

The great spotted woodpecker is sexually mature when aged one year, and starts its courtship behaviour in the following December. It has a fluttering flight display in which the male flies with shallow wingbeats and a spread tail. He calls in flight and may land at a prospective nest-site. The pair excavate a new hole at least above the ground and usually lower than , although sometimes much higher. The chosen site is normally a tree, alive or dead, occasionally a utility pole or <a href="nest%20box">nest box</a>. Old holes are rarely re-used, although the same tree may be used for nesting for several years. The nest cavity is deep with an entrance hole wide. It is excavated by both sexes, the male doing most of the chiselling. As with other woodpeckers, the hole is unlined, although wood chips from the excavation may cover the base of the cavity.

Trees chosen for nest holes have soft <a href="Wood%23Heartwood%20and%20sapwood">heartwood</a> and tough <a href="Wood%23Heartwood%20and%20sapwood">sapwood</a>, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It is not certain how suitable trees are selected, although it may be by drumming, since woods with differing <a href="elastic%20modulus">elastic modulus</a> and <a href="density">density</a> may transmit sound at different <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speeds</a>. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included <a href="Alnus%20incana">grey alder</a>, <a href="Betula%20platyphylla">Japanese white birch</a>, <a href="Ostrya%20japonica">Japanese hop-hornbeam</a>, <a href="Syringa%20reticulata">Japanese tree lilac</a>, <a href="willow">willow</a>s, <a href="Larix%20kaempferi">Japanese larch</a> and <a href="Prunus%20sargentii">Sargent's cherry</a>. The <a href="Quercus%20mongolica">Mongolian oak</a> and <a href="Acer%20pictum">prickly castor-oil tree</a> were rarely if ever used.

The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs that measure and weigh about , of which 7% is shell. They are laid from mid-April to June, the later dates being for birds breeding in the north of the range or at altitude. The eggs are incubated by either adult during the day and by the male at night, for 10–12 days before hatching. Both birds brood and feed the <a href="altricial">altricial</a> naked chicks and keep the nest clean. The young <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in 20–23 days from hatching. Each parent then takes responsibility for feeding part of the brood for about ten days, during which time they normally remain close to the nest tree.

Great spotted woodpeckers have only one brood a year. The survival rates for adults and young are unknown, as is the average lifespan, but the maximum known age for a great spotted woodpecker is just over 11 years.

The great spotted woodpecker is <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a>. It digs <a href="beetle">beetle</a> <a href="larva">larva</a>e from trees and also takes many other <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s including adult beetles, ants and spiders. The bird also digs for Lepidoptera larvae like "<a href="Acronicta%20rumicis">Acronicta rumicis</a>". <a href="Crustacean">Crustacean</a>s, <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s and carrion may be eaten, and bird feeders are visited for <a href="suet">suet</a> and domestic scraps. The nests of other cavity-nesting birds, such as <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a>, may be raided for their eggs and chicks; nest boxes may be similarly attacked, holes being pecked to admit entrance by the woodpecker where necessary. <a href="Common%20house%20martin">House martin</a> colonies can be destroyed in repeated visits.

Fat-rich plant products such as nuts and conifer seeds are particularly important as winter food in the north of the woodpecker's range, and can then supply more than 30% of the bird's energy requirements. Other plant items consumed include buds, berries and tree sap, the latter obtained by drilling rings of holes around a tree trunk.

The great spotted woodpecker feeds at all levels of a tree, usually alone, but sometimes as a pair. It will use an "anvil" on which to hammer hard items, particularly pine, spruce and larch cones, but also fruit, nuts and hard-bodied insects.

Easily accessible items are picked off the tree surface or from fissures in the bark, but larvae are extracted by chiselling holes up to deep and trapping the soft insect with the tongue, which can extend to beyond the bill, and is covered with bristles and sticky <a href="saliva">saliva</a> to trap the prey. The woodpecker is able to extend its tongue so far because the <a href="hyoid%20bone">hyoid bone</a> to which it is attached has long flexible "horns" that wind around the skull and can move forward when required.

Great spotted woodpeckers are hunted by woodland <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> such as the <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a> and the <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>. This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding <a href="fly">fly</a> "<a href="Carnus%20hemapterus">Carnus hemapterus</a>", and its internal parasites may include the <a href="Acanthocephala">spiny-headed worm</a> "<a href="Prosthorhynchus%20transversus">Prosthorhynchus transversus</a>". <a href="Protozoa">Protozoa</a>ns also occur, including the potentially fatal "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>", which causes <a href="toxoplasmosis">toxoplasmosis</a>. The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the <a href="cestoda">tapeworm</a> "<a href="Anomotaenia%20brevis">Anomotaenia brevis</a>".

The total population for the great spotted woodpecker is estimated at 73.7–110.3 million individuals, with 35% of the population in Europe. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable or slightly increasing, especially in Britain, where the population has recently overspilled into Ireland. For this reason the great spotted woodpecker is evaluated as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a>.

Breeding densities have been recorded as between 0.1–6.6 pairs/10 ha (0.04–2.7 pairs/10 acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on <a href="alluvium">alluvium</a>. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland and its ability to thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of "D. m. canariensis" on Tenerife and "D. m. thanneri" on <a href="Gran%20Canaria">Gran Canaria</a> face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.

Panzer I

The Panzer I was a <a href="light%20tank">light tank</a> produced in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> in the 1930s. The name is short for the German ("<a href="Armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armored fighting vehicle</a> mark I"), abbreviated "". The tank's official German ordnance inventory designation was <a href="Sonderkraftfahrzeug">Sd.Kfz.</a> 101 ("special purpose vehicle 101").

Design of the Panzer I began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of <a href="armored%20warfare">armored warfare</a> to the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a>, the Panzer I saw combat in Spain during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, in <a href="History%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%9345%29">Poland</a>, <a href="Military%20history%20of%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II">France</a>, the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28WWII%29">Soviet Union</a> and <a href="North%20African%20campaign">North Africa</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, and in China during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>. Experiences with the Panzer I during the Spanish Civil War helped shape the German Panzerwaffes' <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a> in 1939 and <a href="Battle%20of%20France">France</a> in 1940. By 1941, the Panzer I chassis design was used as the basis of <a href="tank%20destroyer">tank destroyer</a>s and <a href="assault%20gun">assault gun</a>s. There were attempts to upgrade the Panzer I throughout its service history, including by foreign nations, to extend the design's lifespan. It continued to serve in the <a href="Spanish%20Armed%20Forces">Spanish Armed Forces</a> until 1954.

The Panzer I's performance in armored combat was limited by its thin <a href="Vehicle%20armour">armour</a> and light armament of two <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, which were never intended for use against armoured targets, rather being ideal for infantry suppression, in line with inter-war doctrine. As a design intended for training, the Panzer I was less capable than some other contemporary light tank designs, such as the Soviet <a href="T-26">T-26</a>, although it was still relatively advanced compared to older designs, such as the <a href="Renault%20FT">Renault FT</a>, still in service in several nations, and others. Although lacking in armoured combat as a tank, it formed a large part of Germany's mechanized forces and was used in all major campaigns between September 1939 and December 1941, where it still performed much useful service against entrenched infantry and other "soft" targets, which were unable to respond even against thin armor, and who were highly vulnerable to machine gun fire. The small, vulnerable light tank, along with its somewhat more powerful successor the <a href="Panzer%20II">Panzer II</a>, would soon be surpassed as a front-line armoured combat vehicle by more powerful German tanks, such as the <a href="Panzer%20III">Panzer III</a>, and later the <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a>, <a href="Panther%20tank">Panzer V</a>, and <a href="Tiger%20I">Panzer VI</a>; nevertheless, the Panzer I's contribution to the early victories of Nazi Germany during World War II was significant. Later in that war the turrets of many of the then-obsolete PzKpfw Is and <a href="Panzer%20II">PzKpfw II</a>s were repurposed as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers, particularly on the <a href="Atlantic%20Wall">Atlantic Wall</a>.

The post-<a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> of 1919 prohibited the design, manufacture and deployment of <a href="tank">tank</a>s within the <a href="Reichswehr">Reichswehr</a>. Paragraph Twenty-four of the treaty provided for a 100,000-<a href="German%20mark">mark</a> fine and imprisonment of up to six months for anybody who "[manufactured] armoured vehicles, tanks or similar machines, which may be turned to military use".

Despite the manpower and technical limitations imposed on the German Army by the Treaty of Versailles, several Reichswehr officers established a clandestine general staff to study World War I and develop future strategies and tactics. Although at first the concept of the tank as a mobile weapon of war met with apathy, German industry was encouraged to look into tank design, while quiet cooperation was undertaken with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. There was also minor military cooperation with Sweden, including the extraction of technical data that proved invaluable to early German tank design. As early as 1926 the German companies Krupp, <a href="Rheinmetall">Rheinmetall</a> and <a href="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a> were contracted to develop prototype tanks armed with a large, 75-millimeter <a href="cannon">cannon</a>. These were designed under the cover name "<a href="Gro%C3%9Ftraktor">Großtraktor</a>" (large <a href="tractor">tractor</a>) to veil the true purpose of the vehicle. By 1930 a light tank armed with rapid-fire machineguns was to be developed under the cover name "<a href="Leichttraktor">Leichttraktor</a>" (light tractor). The six produced "Großtraktor" were later put into service for a brief period with the 1 Panzer Division; the "Leichttraktor" remained in testing until 1935.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, German tank theory was pioneered by two figures: General <a href="Oswald%20Lutz">Oswald Lutz</a> and his chief of staff, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Heinz%20Guderian">Heinz Guderian</a>. Guderian became the more influential of the two and his ideas were widely publicized. Like his contemporary, Sir <a href="Percy%20Hobart">Percy Hobart</a>, Guderian initially envisioned an <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armored</a> <a href="corps">corps</a> ("panzerkorps") composed of several types of tanks. This included a slow <a href="infantry%20tank">infantry tank</a>, armed with a small-<a href="caliber">caliber</a> cannon and several <a href="machine%20guns">machine guns</a>. The infantry tank, according to Guderian, was to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti-tank guns and <a href="artillery">artillery</a>. He also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank, similar to the British <a href="cruiser%20tank">cruiser tank</a>, which was to be armoured against enemy anti-tank weapons and have a large, 75-millimeter (2.95 in) main gun. Lastly, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> needed a <a href="heavy%20tank">heavy tank</a>, armed with a 150-millimeter (5.9 in) cannon to defeat enemy <a href="fortifications">fortifications</a>, and even stronger armor. Such a tank required a weight of 70 to 100 tonnes and was completely impractical given the manufacturing capabilities of the day.

Soon after rising to power in Germany, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> approved the creation of Germany's first panzer divisions. Simplifying his earlier proposal, Guderian suggested the design of a main combat vehicle, which would be developed into the <a href="Panzer%20III">Panzer III</a>, and a breakthrough tank, the Panzer IV. No existing design appealed to Guderian. As a stopgap, the German Army ordered a preliminary vehicle to train German tank crews. This became the Panzer I.

The Panzer I's design history can be traced to the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="Carden%20Loyd%20tankette">Carden Loyd tankette</a>, of which it borrowed much of its track and suspension design. After six prototype "Kleintraktor" were produced the cover name was changed to "Krupp-Traktor" whereas the development codename was changed to "Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper" (La S) (Agricultural Tractor). The La S was intended not just to train Germany's panzer troops, but to prepare Germany's industry for the mass production of tanks in the near future; a difficult engineering feat for the time. The armament of production versions was to be two 7.92 mm <a href="MG%2013">MG 13 machine gun</a>s in a rotating turret. Machine guns were known to be largely useless against even the lightest tank armour of the time, restricting the Panzer I to a training and anti-infantry role by design.
The final official designation, assigned in 1938, was "Panzerkampfwagen I" (M.G.) with special ordnance number "Sd.Kfz. 101". The first 150 tanks (1./LaS, 1st series LaS, Krupp-Traktor), produced in 1934, did not include the rotating turret and were used for crew training. Following these, production was switched to the combat version of the tank. The Ausf. A was under-armoured, with steel plate of only 13 millimeters (0.51 in) at its thickest. The tank had several design flaws, including suspension problems, which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities, and engine overheating. The driver was positioned inside the chassis and used conventional steering levers to control the tank, while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as gunner. The two crewmen could communicate by means of a voice tube. Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins, containing various numbers of 25-round magazines. 1,190 of the Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A were built in three series (2.-4./LaS). Further 25 were built as command tanks."

Many of the problems in the Ausf. A were corrected with the introduction of the Ausf. B. The air-cooled engine (producing just was replaced by a water-cooled, six-cylinder Maybach NL 38 TR, developing , and the <a href="gearbox">gearbox</a> was changed to a more reliable model. The larger engine required the extension of the vehicle's chassis by 40 cm (16 in), and this allowed the improvement of the tank's suspension, adding another <a href="bogie%20wheel">bogie wheel</a> and raising the tensioner. The tank's weight increased by 0.4 tons. Production of the Ausf. B began in August 1936 and finished in summer 1937 after 399 had been built in two series (5a-6a/LaS). Further 159 were built as command tanks in two series, 295 chassis were built as turretless training tanks. 147 more training tanks were built as convertible chassis with hardened armour with option to upgrade them to full combat status by adding superstructure and turret.

Two more combat versions of the Panzer I were designed and produced between 1939 and 1942. By this stage, the design concept had been superseded by medium and heavy tanks and neither variant was produced in sufficient numbers to have a real impact on the progress of the war. These new tanks had nothing in common with either the Ausf. A or B except name. One of these, the Panzer I Ausf. C, was designed jointly between <a href="Krauss-Maffei">Krauss-Maffei</a> and Daimler-Benz in 1939 to provide an amply armoured and armed reconnaissance light tank. The Ausf. C boasted a completely new chassis and turret, a modern <a href="torsion-bar%20suspension">torsion-bar suspension</a> and five "Schachtellaufwerk"-style interleaved roadwheels. It also had a maximum armor thickness of 30 millimeters (1.18 in), over twice that of either the Ausf. A or B, and was armed with a Mauser EW 141 semi-automatic <a href="anti-tank%20rifle">anti-tank rifle</a>, with a 50-round drum, firing powerful armor-piercing 7.92x94mm Patrone 318 anti-tank rounds. Forty of these tanks were produced, along with six prototypes. Two tanks were deployed to <a href="1st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">1st Panzer Division</a> in 1943, and the other thirty-eight were deployed to the LVIII Panzer Reserve Corps during the <a href="Normandy%20Landings">Normandy landings</a>.

The second vehicle, the Ausf. F, was as different from the Ausf. C as it was from the Ausf. A and B. Intended as an infantry support tank, the Panzer I Ausf. F had a maximum armour thickness of 80 millimeters (3.15 in) and weighed between 18 and 21 tonnes. The Ausf. F was armed with two 7.92-millimeter <a href="MG-34">MG-34</a>s. Thirty were produced in 1940, and a second order of 100 was later canceled. In order to compensate for the increased weight, a new Maybach HL45 Otto engine was used, allowing a maximum road speed of 25 kilometers per hour (15.5 mph) and used five overlapping road wheels per side, dropping the Ausf. C's interleaved units. Eight of the thirty tanks produced were sent to the 1st Panzer Division in 1943 and saw combat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kursk">Battle of Kursk</a>. The rest were given to several army schools for training and evaluation purposes.

On 18 July 1936, war broke out on the <a href="Iberian%20peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a> as Spain dissolved into a state of <a href="Spanish%20civil%20war">civil war</a>. After the chaos of the initial uprising, two opposing sides coalesced and began to consolidate their position—the <a href="Popular%20front">Popular front</a> (the Republicans) and the <a href="Spain%20under%20Franco">Spanish Nationalist front</a>. In an early example of a <a href="proxy%20war">proxy war</a>, both sides quickly received support from other countries, most notably the Soviet Union and Germany as both wanted to test their tactics and equipment. The first shipment of foreign tanks, 50 Soviet <a href="T-26">T-26</a>s, arrived on the 15 of October. The shipment was under the surveillance of Nazi Germany's "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" and Germany immediately responded by sending 41 Panzer I's to Spain a few days later. This first shipment was followed by four more shipments of Panzer I Ausf. B's, with 122 vehicles shipped in total.

The first shipment of Panzer I's was brought under the command of Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Wilhelm%20Ritter%20von%20Thoma">Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma</a> in Gruppe Thoma (also referred to as Panzergruppe Drohne). Gruppe Thoma formed part of Gruppe Imker, the ground formations of the German <a href="Condor%20Legion">Condor Legion</a>, who fought on the side of <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Franco's</a> Nationalists. Between July and October, a rapid Nationalist advance from Seville to Toledo placed them in position to take the Spanish capital, <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>. The Nationalist advance and the fall of the town of Illescas to Nationalist armies on 18 October 1936 caused the government of the Popular Front's <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Republic</a>, including President <a href="Manuel%20Aza%C3%B1a">Manuel Azaña</a>, to flee to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="Valencia%2C%20Spain">Valencia</a>. In an attempt to stem the Nationalist tide and gain crucial time for Madrid's defence, Soviet armour was deployed south of the city under the command of Colonel Krivoshein before the end of October. At this time, several T-26 tanks under the command of Captain Paul Arman were thrown into a Republican counterattack directed towards the town of Torrejon de Velasco in an attempt to cut off the Nationalist advance north. This was the first recorded tank battle in the Spanish Civil War. Despite initial success, poor communication between the Soviet Republican armour and Spanish Republican infantry caused the isolation of Captain Arman's force and the subsequent destruction of a number of tanks. This battle also marked the first use of the <a href="molotov%20cocktail">molotov cocktail</a> against tanks. <a href="Ritter">Ritter</a> von Thoma's Panzer Is fought for the Nationalists only days later on 30 October, and immediately experienced problems. As the Nationalist armour advanced, it was engaged by the Commune de Paris battalion, equipped with Soviet <a href="BA-10">BA-10</a> armoured cars. The 45-millimeter gun in the BA-10 was more than sufficient to knock out the poorly armoured Panzer I at ranges below 500 meters (550 yd).

Although the Panzer I would participate in almost every major Nationalist offensive of the war, the Nationalist army began to deploy more and more captured T-26 tanks to offset their disadvantage in protection and firepower. At one point, von Thoma offered up to 500 <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a> for each T-26 captured. Although the Panzer I was initially able to knock out the T-26 at close range—150 meters (165 yd) or less—using an armor-piercing 7.92 millimeter bullet, the Republican tanks began to engage at ranges where they were immune to the machine guns of the Panzer I.

The Panzer I was upgraded in order to increase its lethality. On 8 August 1937, Major General García Pallasar received a note from Generalísimo <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> that expressed the need for a Panzer I (or "negrillo", as their Spanish crews called them) with a 20-millimeter gun. Ultimately, the piece chosen was the <a href="Breda%20Model%2035">Breda Model 1935</a>, due to the simplicity of the design over competitors such as the German <a href="2%20cm%20FlaK%2030">Flak 30</a>. Furthermore, the 20 mm Breda was capable of perforating 40 millimeters of armour at 250 meters (1.57 in at 275 yd), which was more than sufficient to penetrate the frontal armour of the T-26. Although originally 40 Italian <a href="L3/35">CV.35</a> light tanks were ordered with the Breda in place of their original armament, this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same gun to the Panzer I would yield better results. Prototypes were ready by September 1937 and an order was placed after successful results. The mounting of the Breda in the Panzer I required the original turret to be opened at the top and then extended by a vertical supplement. Four of these tanks were finished at the Armament Factory of <a href="Seville">Seville</a>, but further production was canceled as it was decided sufficient numbers of Republican T-26 tanks had been captured to fulfill the Nationalist leadership's request for more lethal tanks. The Breda modification was not particularly liked by German crews, as the unprotected gap in the turret, designed to allow the tank's commander to aim, was found to be a dangerous weak point.

In late 1938, another Panzer I was sent to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45 mm gun, captured from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or <a href="BT-5">BT-5</a>). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.

In 1937, around ten Panzer I Ausf. As were sold to the <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29">Republic of China</a> (ROC) during a period of <a href="Sino-German%20cooperation%20until%201941">strong co-operative ties between the ROC and Nazi Germany</a>, which were subsequently fielded in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nanjing">Battle of Nanjing</a> by the 3rd Armoured Battalion of the ROC's <a href="Chinese%20Nationalist%20Army">National Revolutionary Army</a> (NRA) to fight against the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> (IJA).

Following <a href="Nanking%20Massacre">the fall of Nanking</a>, the Chinese Panzer I Ausf. As were captured by the Japanese and put on display at the <a href="Yasukuni%20Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a>. Because of the close relationship between Hitler's Germany and Imperial Japan by that time, the Chinese Panzer I Ausf. As were instead labelled as "Made in the USSR" (the USSR being the common enemy of these two strongly anti-communist nations).

During the initial campaigns of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Germany's light tanks, including the Panzer I, formed the bulk of its armoured strength. In March 1938, the German Army <a href="Anschluss">marched into Austria</a>, experiencing a mechanical breakdown rate of up to thirty percent. However, the experience revealed to Guderian several faults within the German "Panzerkorps" and he subsequently improved logistical support. In October 1938, Germany occupied <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>'s <a href="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a>, and the remainder of the country in March 1939. The capture of Czechoslovakia allowed several Czech tank designs, such as the <a href="Panzer%2038%28t%29">Panzer 38(t)</a>, and their subsequent variants and production, to be incorporated into the German Army's strength. It also prepared German forces for the invasion of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>.

On 1 September 1939, Germany <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">invaded Poland</a> using seventy-two divisions (including 16 reserve infantry divisions in OKH reserves), including seven panzer divisions (1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 10., "Kempf") and four light divisions (1., 2., 3., 4.). Three days later, <a href="France">France</a> and <a href="UK">Britain</a> declared war on Germany. The seven panzer and four light divisions were arrayed in five armies, forming two army groups. The battalion strength of the 1st Panzer Division included no less than fourteen Panzer Is, while the other six divisions included thirty-four. A total of about 2,700 tanks were available for the invasion of Poland, but only 310 of the heavier Panzer III and IV tanks were available. Furthermore, 350 were of Czech design—the rest were either Panzer Is or <a href="Panzer%20II">Panzer II</a>s. The invasion was swift and the last Polish pockets of resistance surrendered on 6 October. The entire campaign had lasted five weeks (with help of the Soviet forces, which attacked on 17 September), and the success of Germany's tanks in the campaign was summed up in response to Hitler on 5 September: when asked if it had been the <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s who destroyed a Polish artillery regiment, Guderian replied, "No, our panzers!"

Some 832 German tanks (including 320 PzI, 259 PzII, 40 Pz III, 76 PzIV, 77 Pz35(t), 13 PzBef III, 7 PzBef 38(t), 34 other PzBef and some Pz38(t)) were lost during the campaign, approximately 341 of which were never to return to service. This represented about a third of Germany's armor deployed for the Polish campaign. During the campaign, no less than half of Germany's tanks were unavailable due to maintenance issues or enemy action, and of all tanks, the Panzer I proved the most vulnerable to Polish anti-tank weapons.

Furthermore, it was found that the handling of armoured forces during the campaign left much to be desired. During the beginning of Guderian's attack in northern Poland, his corps was held back to coordinate with infantry for quite a while, preventing a faster advance. It was only after Army Group South had its attention taken from Warsaw at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bzura">Battle of Bzura</a> that Guderian's armour was fully unleashed. There were still lingering tendencies to reserve Germany's armour, even if in independent divisions, to cover an infantry advance or the flanks of advancing infantry armies. Although tank production was increased to 125 tanks per month after the Polish Campaign, losses forced the Germans to draw further strength from Czech tank designs, and light tanks continued to form the majority of Germany's armored strength.

Months later, Panzer Is participated in <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">Operation Weserübung</a>—the invasion of Denmark and Norway.

Despite its obsolescence, the Panzer I was also used in the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">invasion of France</a> in May 1940. Of 2,574 tanks available for the campaign, no fewer than 523 were Panzer Is, while there were 627 Panzer IIIs and IVs, 955 Panzer II, 106 Czech <a href="Panzer%2035%28t%29">Panzer 35(t)</a>, and 228 Panzer 38(t). For their defense, the French boasted up to 4,000 tanks, including 300 <a href="Char%20B1">Char B1</a>, armed with a 47 mm (1.7 in) gun in the turret and a larger 75 mm (2.95 in) low-velocity gun in the hull. The French also had around 250 <a href="Somua%20S-35">Somua S-35</a>, widely regarded as one of the best tanks of the period, armed with the same 47 mm main gun and protected by almost 55 mm (2.17 in) of armour at its thickest point. Nevertheless, the French also deployed over 3,000 light tanks, including about 500 World War I-vintage <a href="FT-17">FT-17</a>s. The two main advantages that German armor enjoyed were radios allowing them to coordinate faster than their British or French counterparts, and superior tactical doctrine, in addition to markedly faster speed, generally.

Italian setbacks in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and their colony of <a href="Libya">Libya</a> caused Hitler to dispatch aircraft to <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, and a blocking force to <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>. This blocking force was put under the command of Lieutenant General <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a> and included the motorized <a href="5th%20Light%20Division">5th Light Division</a> and the <a href="15th%20Panzer%20Division">15th Panzer Division</a>. This force landed at <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> on 12 February 1941. Upon arrival, Rommel had around 150 tanks, about half Panzer III and IV. The rest were Panzer I's and IIs, although the Panzer I was soon replaced. On 6 April 1941, Germany attacked both <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, with fourteen divisions <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">invading Greece</a> from neighboring <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, which by then had joined the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a>. The <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> included no less than six panzer divisions, which still fielded the Panzer I. Yugoslavia surrendered 17 April 1941, and Greece fell on 30 April 1941.
The final major campaign in which the Panzer I formed a large portion of the armoured strength was "<a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>", 22 June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 Panzer I's. By the end of the month, a large portion of the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> found itself <a href="Battle%20of%20Bia%C5%82ystok%E2%80%93Minsk">trapped</a> in the Minsk pocket, and by 21 September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany's armour in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers were shocked to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the <a href="T-34">T-34</a> and <a href="Kliment%20Voroshilov%20tank">KV</a> series. As seen during the Spanish Civil War only 5 years earlier, the Panzer I was clearly no match for even the weakest of Soviet armour it encountered, with even armoured cars such as the BA-10 proving capable of defeating the Panzer I when fitted with medium-caliber anti-tank weapons. Army Group North quickly realized that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could reliably penetrate the thick frontal armour of the <a href="KV-1%20%28tank%29">KV-1</a>. The performance of the Red Army during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow">Battle of Moscow</a> and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the Panzer I was not largely suitable for this front of war. Some less battle-worthy Panzer Is were tasked with towing lorries and other light (mainly wheeled) vehicles through the thick <a href="rasputitsa">Russian-autumn mud</a> to alleviate logistical and transportation issues and problems at the frontlines, whilst other Panzer Is were relegated for anti-<a href="partisan%20%28military%29">partisan</a> actions or rear-guard protection duties (such as defending airfields or other vital military installations on occupied enemy territory).

After Germany, Spain fielded the largest number of Panzer I tanks. A total of 122 were exported to Spain during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, and, as late as 1945, Spain's "Brunete Armored Division" fielded 93. The Panzer I remained in use in Spain until aid arrived from the United States in 1954 when they were replaced by the relatively modern <a href="M47%20Patton">M47 Patton</a>. Between 1935 and 1936, an export version of the Panzer I Ausf. B, named the L.K.B. ("Leichte Kampfwagen B"), was designed for export to <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. Modifications included up-gunning to a 20-millimeter gun and fitting a Krupp M 311 V-8 gasoline engine. Although three examples were built, none were exported to Bulgaria, although a single Panzer I Ausf. A had previously been sold.

A final order was supplied to <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> in 1942, totalling eight Ausf. B's and six command versions. These were incorporated into the 1st Armoured Division and saw combat in late 1942. At least 1 Panzer I Ausf. B was sent to the <a href="Croatian%20Home%20Guard%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Army</a> of the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a>.

Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several variants of the Panzer I were designed, especially during the later years of its combat history. Because they were obsolescent from their introduction, incapable of defeating foreign armor, and outclassed by newer German tanks, the Panzer I chassis were increasingly adapted as <a href="tank%20destroyer">tank destroyer</a>s and other variants. One of the best-known variants was the "<a href="Sd.Kfz.%20265%20Panzerbefehlswagen">kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen</a>" ("small armoured command vehicle"), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B chassis was also used to build the German Army's first tracked tank destroyer, the <a href="Panzerj%C3%A4ger%20I">Panzerjäger I</a>. This vehicle was armed with a <a href="47%20mm%20kanon%20P.U.V.%20vz.%2036%20%28%C5%A0koda%20A6%29">Czech 47-millimeter (1.85 in)</a> anti-tank gun.

Paul Tibbets

Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. (23 February 1915 – 1 November 2007) was a <a href="brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>. He is best known as the pilot who flew the <a href="B-29%20Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> known as the "<a href="Enola%20Gay">Enola Gay</a>" (named after his mother) when it dropped <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a>, the first of two <a href="atomic%20bombs">atomic bombs</a> used in warfare, on the Japanese city of <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>.

Tibbets enlisted in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> in 1937 and qualified as a pilot in 1938. After the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, he flew anti-submarine patrols over the Atlantic. In February 1942, he became the commanding officer of the <a href="340th%20Bombardment%20Squadron">340th Bombardment Squadron</a> of the <a href="97th%20Bombardment%20Group">97th Bombardment Group</a>, which was equipped with the <a href="Boeing%20B-17">Boeing B-17</a>. In July 1942, the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group to be deployed as part of the <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a>, and Tibbets became deputy group commander. He flew the lead plane in the first American daylight <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> mission against <a href="Occupied%20Europe">Occupied Europe</a> on 17 August 1942, and the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe on 9 October 1942. Tibbets was chosen to fly <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark W. Clark</a> and <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> to Gibraltar. After flying 43 combat missions, he became the assistant for bomber operations on the staff of the <a href="Twelfth%20Air%20Force">Twelfth Air Force</a>.

Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943 to help with the development of the <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a>. In September 1944, he was appointed the commander of the <a href="509th%20Composite%20Group">509th Composite Group</a>, which would conduct the <a href="bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>. After the war, he participated in the <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a> tests at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> in mid-1946, and was involved in the development of the <a href="Boeing%20B-47%20Stratojet">Boeing B-47 Stratojet</a> in the early 1950s. He commanded the <a href="308th%20Armament%20Systems%20Wing">308th Bombardment Wing</a> and <a href="6th%20Air%20Division">6th Air Division</a> in the late 1950s, and was <a href="military%20attach%C3%A9">military attaché</a> in India from 1964 to 1966. After leaving the Air Force in 1966, he worked for <a href="NetJets">Executive Jet Aviation</a>, serving on the founding board and as its president from 1976 until his retirement in 1987.

Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in <a href="Quincy%2C%20Illinois">Quincy, Illinois</a>, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old the family moved to <a href="Davenport%2C%20Iowa">Davenport, Iowa</a>, and then to Iowa's capital, <a href="Des%20Moines">Des Moines</a>, where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to <a href="Hialeah%2C%20Florida">Hialeah, Florida</a>, to escape from harsh <a href="midwest">midwest</a>ern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. One day his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by <a href="Barnstorming">barnstormer</a> <a href="Doug%20Davis%20%28aviator%29">Doug Davis</a>, dropping candy bars with tiny parachutes to the crowd of people attending the races at the <a href="Hialeah%20Park%20Race%20Track">Hialeah Park Race Track</a>.

In the late 1920s, business issues forced Tibbets's family to return to <a href="Alton%2C%20Illinois">Alton, Illinois</a>, where he graduated from <a href="Western%20Military%20Academy">Western Military Academy</a> in 1933. He then attended the <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a> in <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville</a>, and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of <a href="Sigma%20Nu">Sigma Nu</a> <a href="Fraternities%20and%20sororities">fraternity</a> in 1934. During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's <a href="Opa-locka%20Airport">Opa-locka Airport</a> with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at <a href="Eastern%20Airlines">Eastern Airlines</a>. After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a> after his second year to complete his <a href="pre-med">pre-med</a> studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only a year and a half as he changed his mind about wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> and become a pilot in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a>.

Because he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the <a href="Aviation%20Cadet%20Training%20Program%20%28USAAF%29">Aviation Cadet Training Program</a>. On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at <a href="Fort%20Thomas%2C%20Kentucky">Fort Thomas</a>, <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, and was sent to <a href="Randolph%20Air%20Force%20Base">Randolph Field</a> in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> and received his <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force%20aeronautical%20rating%23Air%20Corps%2C%20World%20War%20II%2C%20Cold%20War%20and%20Post-Cold%20War%20changes">pilot rating</a> in 1938 at <a href="Kelly%20Air%20Force%20Base">Kelly Field</a> in San Antonio.

After graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the <a href="16th%20Electronic%20Warfare%20Squadron">16th Observation Squadron</a>, which was based at <a href="Lawson%20Field">Lawson Field</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, with a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> supporting the <a href="Infantry%20School">Infantry School</a> at nearby <a href="Fort%20Benning">Fort Benning</a>. It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a <a href="department%20store">department store</a> in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Georgia">Columbus</a>, Georgia. The two quietly married in a <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a> seminary in <a href="Holy%20Trinity%2C%20Alabama">Holy Trinity</a>, <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper. They had two sons. Paul III was born in 1940, in Columbus, Georgia, and graduated from <a href="Huntingdon%20College">Huntingdon College</a> and <a href="Auburn%20University">Auburn University</a>. He was a <a href="colonel">colonel</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Reserves">United States Army Reserves</a> and worked as a hospital <a href="pharmacist">pharmacist</a>. He died in <a href="West%20Monroe%2C%20Louisiana">West Monroe</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, in 2016. The younger son, Gene Wingate Tibbets, was born in 1944, and was at the time of his death in 2012 residing in <a href="Georgiana%2C%20Alabama">Georgiana</a> in <a href="Butler%20County%2C%20Alabama">Butler County</a> in southern Alabama.

While Tibbets was stationed at Fort Benning, he was promoted to <a href="first%20lieutenant">first lieutenant</a> and served as a personal pilot for <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="George%20S.%20Patton%20Jr.">George S. Patton, Jr.</a>, in 1940 and 1941. In June 1941, Tibbets transferred to the <a href="9th%20Bombardment%20Squadron">9th Bombardment Squadron</a> of the <a href="3d%20Bombardment%20Group">3d Bombardment Group</a> at <a href="Hunter%20Air%20Force%20Base">Hunter Field</a>, <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a>, Georgia, as the engineering officer, and flew the <a href="A-20%20Havoc">A-20 Havoc</a>. While there he was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">captain</a>. In December 1941, he received orders to join the <a href="29th%20Bombardment%20Group">29th Bombardment Group</a> at <a href="MacDill%20Air%20Force%20Base">MacDill Field</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, for training on the <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a>. On 7 December 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> while listening to the radio during a routine flight. Due to fears that German <a href="U-Boats">U-Boats</a> might enter <a href="Tampa%20Bay">Tampa Bay</a> and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah. Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at <a href="Pope%20Air%20Force%20Base">Pope Army Airfield</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, with 21 <a href="B-18%20Bolo">B-18 Bolo</a> medium bombers. The B-18s were used as an intermediate trainer, which pilots flew after basic flight training in a <a href="Cessna%20UC-78">Cessna UC-78</a> and before qualifying in the B-17.

In February 1942, Tibbets reported for duty with the 29th Bombardment Group as its engineering officer. Three weeks later he was named the commanding officer of the <a href="340th%20Bombardment%20Squadron">340th Bombardment Squadron</a> of the <a href="97th%20Bombardment%20Group">97th Bombardment Group</a>, equipped with the B-17D. It was initially based at MacDill, and then Sarasota Army Airfield, Florida, before moving to <a href="Godfrey%20Army%20Airfield">Godfrey Army Airfield</a> in <a href="Bangor%2C%20Maine">Bangor, Maine</a>.

In July 1942 the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group of the <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a> to be deployed to England, where it was based at <a href="RAF%20Polebrook">RAF Polebrook</a>. It had been hastily assembled to meet demands for an early deployment, and arrived without any training in the basics of high altitude daylight bombing. In the first weeks of August 1942, under the tutelage of <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> veterans, the group received intensive training for its first mission. The group commander, <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Cornelius W. Cousland, was replaced by <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Frank%20A.%20Armstrong%20Jr.">Frank A. Armstrong Jr.</a>, who appointed Tibbets as his deputy.

Tibbets flew the lead bomber "Butcher Shop" for the first American daylight heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow penetration raid against a <a href="marshalling%20yard">marshalling yard</a> in <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a> in <a href="Occupied%20France">Occupied France</a>, with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, "Red Gremlin", nor his regular crew, which included <a href="Bombardier%20%28air%20force%29">bombardier</a> <a href="Thomas%20Ferebee">Thomas Ferebee</a> and navigator <a href="Theodore%20Van%20Kirk">Theodore Van Kirk</a>, who later flew with him in "Enola Gay". On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of <a href="Lille">Lille</a>. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.

On that first mission, Tibbets saw in real-time that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians. At the time, he thought to himself, "People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed. Those are not soldiers." But then he thought back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program and ended up in drug sales. The reason why they had failed the program was because "they had too much sympathy for their patients", which "destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities". It dawned on Tibbets that:

In the leadup to <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>, the Allied invasion of <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, the commander of the Eighth Air Force, <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Carl%20Spaatz">Carl Spaatz</a> was ordered to provide his best two pilots for a secret mission. He chose Tibbets and Major Wayne Connors. Tibbets flew Major General <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark W. Clark</a> from <a href="RAF%20Polebrook">Polebrook</a> to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> while Connors flew Clark's chief of staff, Brigadier General <a href="Lyman%20Lemnitzer">Lyman Lemnitzer</a>. A few weeks later Tibbets flew the <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Commander</a>, <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, there. "By reputation", historian <a href="Stephen%20Ambrose">Stephen Ambrose</a> wrote, Tibbets was "the best flier in the Army Air Force."

Tibbets had flown 25 combat missions against targets in France when the 97th Bomb Group was transferred to North Africa as part of Major General <a href="Jimmy%20Doolittle">Jimmy Doolittle</a>'s <a href="Twelfth%20Air%20Force">Twelfth Air Force</a>. For Tibbets, the war in North Africa introduced him to the realities of aerial warfare. He claimed that he saw the real effects of bombing civilians and the trauma of losing his brothers in arms. In January 1943, Tibbets, who had now flown 43 combat missions, was assigned as the assistant for bomber operations to Colonel <a href="Lauris%20Norstad">Lauris Norstad</a>, Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force. Tibbets had recently been given a battlefield promotion to <a href="colonel">colonel</a>, but did not receive it, as such promotions had to be confirmed by a panel of officers. He was told that Norstad had vetoed the promotion, saying "there's only going to be one colonel in operations."

Tibbets did not get along well with Norstad, or with Doolittle's chief of staff, Brigadier General <a href="Hoyt%20Vandenberg">Hoyt Vandenberg</a>. In one planning meeting, Norstad wanted an all-out raid on <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a> to be flown at . Tibbets protested that <a href="flak">flak</a> would be most effective at that altitude. When challenged by Norstad, Tibbets said he would lead the mission himself at 6,000 feet if Norstad would fly as his co-pilot. Norstad backed down, and the mission was successfully flown at .

When <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Henry H. "Hap" Arnold</a>, the Chief of <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>, requested an experienced bombardment pilot to help with the development of the <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a> bomber, Doolittle recommended Tibbets. Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943. At the time, the B-29 program was beset by a host of technical problems, and the chief test pilot, <a href="Edmund%20T.%20Allen">Edmund T. Allen</a>, had been killed in a crash of the prototype aircraft.

Working with <a href="Spirit%20AeroSystems">the Boeing plant</a> in <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a>, Tibbets test-flew the B-29 and soon accumulated more flight time in it than any other pilot. He found that without defensive armament and armor plating, the aircraft was lighter, and its performance was much improved. In simulated combat engagements against a <a href="P-47">P-47</a> fighter at the B-29's cruising altitude of , he discovered that the B-29 had a smaller turning radius than the P-47, and could avoid it by turning away.

After a year of developmental testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the <a href="17th%20Air%20Division">17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy)</a>, a B-29 training unit based at <a href="Grand%20Island%20Army%20Airfield">Grand Island Army Air Field</a>, Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition pilots to the B-29. Tibbets taught two <a href="Women%20Airforce%20Service%20Pilots">Women Airforce Service Pilots</a>, <a href="Dora%20Dougherty%20Strother">Dora Dougherty</a> and Dorothea (Didi) Moorman, to fly the B-29 as demonstration pilots.

On 1 September 1944, Tibbets reported to <a href="Colorado%20Springs%20Army%20Airfield">Colorado Springs Army Airfield</a>, the headquarters of the <a href="Second%20Air%20Force">Second Air Force</a>, where he met with its commander, Major General <a href="Uzal%20Ent">Uzal Ent</a>, and three representatives of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="John%20Lansdale%20Jr.">John Lansdale Jr.</a>, <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20S.%20Parsons">William S. Parsons</a>, and <a href="Norman%20F.%20Ramsey%20Jr.">Norman F. Ramsey Jr.</a>, who briefed him on the project. Tibbets was told that he would be in charge of the <a href="509th%20Composite%20Group">509th Composite Group</a>, a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and a high priority for all kinds of <a href="materiel">military stores</a>. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: <a href="Great%20Bend%20Army%20Airfield">Great Bend Army Airfield</a>, Kansas; <a href="Mountain%20Home%20Army%20Airfield">Mountain Home Army Airfield</a>, Idaho; or <a href="Wendover%20Army%20Air%20Field">Wendover Army Air Field</a>, Utah. Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.

When the operation was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel <a href="Roscoe%20C.%20Wilson">Roscoe C. Wilson</a> were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, but he was in his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.
Tibbets was promoted to colonel in January 1945 and brought his wife and family along with him to Wendover. He felt that allowing married men in the group to bring their families would improve morale, although it put a strain on his own marriage. In order to disguise all the civilian engineers on base who were working on the Manhattan Project, Tibbets was forced to lie to his wife; he told her that the engineers were "sanitary workers." At one point, Tibbets found that Lucy had co-opted a scientist to unplug a drain.

On 6 March 1945 (concurrent with the activation of <a href="Project%20Alberta">Project Alberta</a>), the 1st Ordnance Squadron, Special (Aviation) was activated at Wendover, again using Army Air Forces personnel on hand or already at <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos</a>. Its purpose was to provide "skilled machinists, welders and munitions workers" and special equipment to the group to enable it to assemble atomic weapons at its operating base, thereby allowing the weapons to be transported more safely in their component parts. A rigorous candidate selection process was used to recruit personnel, reportedly with an 80% rejection rate. The 509th Composite Group reached full strength in May 1945.

With the addition of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to <a href="Tinian">Tinian</a>, an island in the northern <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Marianas</a> within striking distance of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of <a href="Project%20Alberta">Project Alberta</a>. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island: the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General <a href="Thomas%20Farrell%20%28general%29">Thomas Farrell</a>, and <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="William%20R.%20Purnell">William R. Purnell</a> of the <a href="Military%20Policy%20Committee">Military Policy Committee</a>.

The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945, to its port of embarkation at <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS "Cape Victory" for the Marianas, while the group's materiel was shipped on the SS "Emile Berliner". An advance party of the air echelon flew by C-54 to <a href="North%20Field%20%28Tinian%29">North Field, Tinian</a>, between May 15 and 22, where it was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945. Project Alberta's "Destination Team" also sent most of its members to Tinian to supervise the assembly, loading, and dropping of the bombs under the administrative title of 1st Technical Services Detachment, Miscellaneous War Department Group.
On 5 August 1945, Tibbets formally named his B-29 "<a href="Enola%20Gay">Enola Gay</a>" after his mother. "Enola Gay" had been personally selected by him while it was still on the <a href="assembly%20line">assembly line</a> at the <a href="Glenn%20L.%20Martin%20Company">Glenn L. Martin Company</a> plant in <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Nebraska">Bellevue, Nebraska</a>. The regularly assigned aircraft commander, <a href="Robert%20A.%20Lewis">Robert A. Lewis</a>, was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of August 6 to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis would fly the mission as Tibbets's co-pilot.

At 02:45 the next day—in accordance with the terms of <a href="Operations%20Order%20No.%2035">Operations Order No. 35</a>—the "Enola Gay" departed North Field for <a href="Hiroshima%2C%20Japan">Hiroshima, Japan</a>, with Tibbets at the controls. Tinian was approximately away from Japan, so it took six hours to reach Hiroshima. The atomic bomb, code-named "<a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a>", was dropped over Hiroshima at 08:15 local time. Tibbets recalled that the city was covered with a tall <a href="mushroom%20cloud">mushroom cloud</a> after the bomb was dropped.

Tibbets was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> by Spaatz immediately after landing on Tinian. He became a celebrity, with pictures and interviews of his wife and children in the major American newspapers. He was seen as a national hero who had ended the war with Japan. Tibbets later received an invitation from President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> to visit the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. The 509th Composite Group was awarded an <a href="Air%20Force%20Outstanding%20Unit%20Award">Air Force Outstanding Unit Award</a> in 1999.

Tibbets was interviewed extensively by Mike Harden of the "<a href="Columbus%20Dispatch">Columbus Dispatch</a>", and profiles appeared in the newspaper on anniversaries of the first dropping of an atomic bomb. In a 1975 interview he said: "I'm proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did ... I sleep clearly every night." "I knew when I got the assignment," he told a reporter in 2005, "it was going to be an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible."

The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at <a href="Roswell%20Army%20Airfield">Roswell Army Airfield</a>, New Mexico. Colonel <a href="William%20H.%20Blanchard">William H. Blanchard</a> replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the <a href="509th%20Bombardment%20Wing">509th Bombardment Wing</a>, the successor to the 509th Composite Group. Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> nuclear tests at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> in the Pacific, but he and his "Enola Gay" crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.

Tibbets then attended the <a href="Air%20Command%20and%20Staff%20School">Air Command and Staff School</a> at <a href="Maxwell%20Air%20Force%20Base">Maxwell Air Force Base</a>, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>. When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General <a href="Thomas%20S.%20Power">Thomas S. Power</a>, was posted to London as air attaché, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be <a href="jet%20aircraft">jet aircraft</a> and thus became involved in the <a href="Boeing%20B-47%20Stratojet">Boeing B-47 Stratojet</a> program. He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at <a href="Eglin%20Air%20Force%20Base">Eglin Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Valparaiso%2C%20Florida">Valparaiso, Florida</a>, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted.

Tibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the <a href="Air%20War%20College">Air War College</a>. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the <a href="Allied%20Air%20Forces%20in%20Central%20Europe">Allied Air Forces in Central Europe</a> Headquarters at <a href="Fontainebleau%2C%20France">Fontainebleau, France</a>. He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He returned to the United States in February 1956 to command the <a href="308th%20Bombardment%20Wing">308th Bombardment Wing</a> at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956. They had a son, James Tibbets.

In January 1958, Tibbets became commander of the <a href="6th%20Air%20Division">6th Air Division</a> at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959. This was followed by another tour of duty at the Pentagon as director of Management Analysis. In July 1962, he was assigned to the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> as deputy director for operations, and then, in June 1963, as deputy director for the National Military Command System. In 1964, Tibbets was named <a href="military%20attach%C3%A9">military attaché</a> in India. He spent 22 months there on this posting, which ended in June 1966. He retired from the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) on 31 August 1966.

After his retirement from the Air Force, Tibbets worked for <a href="Executive%20Jet%20Aviation">Executive Jet Aviation</a> (EJA), an air taxi company based in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, and now called <a href="NetJets">NetJets</a>. He was one of the founding board members and attempted to extend the company's operations to Europe, but was unsuccessful. He retired from the company in 1968, and returned to Miami, Florida, where he had spent part of his childhood. The banks foreclosed on EJA in 1970, and <a href="Bruce%20Sundlun">Bruce Sundlun</a> became president. Sundlun lured Tibbets back to EJA that year. Tibbets succeeded Sundlun as president on 21 April 1976, and remained in the role until 1986. He served for a year as a consultant before his second and final retirement from EJA in 1987.

<a href="Barry%20Nelson">Barry Nelson</a> played Tibbets in the film "<a href="The%20Beginning%20or%20the%20End">The Beginning or the End</a>" (1947). "<a href="Above%20and%20Beyond%20%281952%20film%29">Above and Beyond</a>" (1952) depicted the World War II events that involved Tibbets; <a href="Robert%20Taylor%20%28actor%29">Robert Taylor</a> starred as Tibbets and <a href="Eleanor%20Parker">Eleanor Parker</a> played the role of his first wife Lucy. Tibbets was also the model for screenwriter <a href="Sy%20Bartlett">Sy Bartlett</a>'s fictional character "Major Joe Cobb" in the film "<a href="Twelve%20O%27Clock%20High">Twelve O'Clock High</a>" (1949), and for a brief period in February 1949 was slated to be the film's technical advisor until his replacement at the last minute by Colonel John H. deRussy. "Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb", a 1980 made-for-television movie, somewhat fictionalized, told the story of Tibbets crew. <a href="Patrick%20Duffy">Patrick Duffy</a> played Tibbets and <a href="Kim%20Darby">Kim Darby</a> played Lucy.

In other fictional portrayals, Nicholas Kilbertus was Tibbets in the film "<a href="Day%20One%20%281989%20film%29">Day One</a>" (1989), <a href="David%20Gow">David Gow</a> played him in the TV movie "Hiroshima" (1995), and <a href="Ian%20Shaw%20%28actor%29">Ian Shaw</a> played the part in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s TV <a href="docudrama">docudrama</a> "<a href="Hiroshima%20%28documentary%29">Hiroshima</a>" (2005), for which Tibbets was also interviewed on camera. An interview with Tibbets also appeared in the movie "<a href="Atomic%20Cafe">Atomic Cafe</a>" (1982), as well as was in the 1970s British <a href="Documentary%20film">documentary</a> series "<a href="The%20World%20at%20War">The World at War</a>", and the "Men Who Brought the Dawn" episode of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Networks">Smithsonian Networks</a>' "War Stories" (1995). Tibbets figured largely in the 2000 book "Duty: A Father, His Son and the Man Who Won the War" by <a href="Bob%20Greene">Bob Greene</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>".

In 1976, the United States government apologized to Japan after Tibbets re-enacted the bombing—complete with a mushroom cloud—in a restored B-29 at an <a href="air%20show">air show</a> in Texas. He said that he had not intended for the re-enactment to insult the Japanese people. In 1995, he denounced the 50th anniversary exhibition of the "Enola Gay" at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, which attempted to present the bombing in context with the destruction it caused, as a "damn big insult", due to its focus on the Japanese casualties rather than the brutality of the Japanese government. He was inducted into the <a href="National%20Aviation%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Aviation Hall of Fame</a> in 1996.

Tibbets's grandson <a href="Paul%20W.%20Tibbets%20IV">Paul W. Tibbets IV</a> graduated from the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Academy">United States Air Force Academy</a> in 1989, and in April 2006 became commander of the <a href="393d%20Bomb%20Squadron">393d Bomb Squadron</a>, flying the <a href="B-2%20Spirit">B-2 Spirit</a> at <a href="Whiteman%20AFB">Whiteman AFB</a>, Missouri. The squadron was one of the two operational squadrons that had formed part of the 509th Composite Group when Tibbets commanded it. Paul Tibbets IV was promoted to brigadier general in 2014, and became Deputy Director for Nuclear Operations at the Global Operations Directorate of the <a href="United%20States%20Strategic%20Command">United States Strategic Command</a> at <a href="Offutt%20Air%20Force%20Base">Offutt Air Force Base</a> in Nebraska. As such, he was responsible for America's strategic nuclear forces. On 5 June 2015, he assumed command of the <a href="509th%20Bomb%20Wing">509th Bomb Wing</a>.

Tibbets died in his Columbus, Ohio, home on 1 November 2007, at the age of 92. He had suffered small <a href="stroke">stroke</a>s and <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a> during his final years and had been in <a href="hospice">hospice</a> care. He was survived by his French-born wife, Andrea, and two sons from his first marriage, Paul III and Gene as well as his son, James, from his second marriage. Tibbets had asked for no funeral or headstone, because he feared that opponents of the bombing might use it as a place of protest or destruction. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered over the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>; he had flown over the Channel many times during the war.

Kelpie

Kelpie, or water kelpie, is the <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> name given to a shape-shifting water spirit inhabiting the <a href="loch">loch</a>s and pools of Scotland. It has usually been described as appearing as a <a href="water%20horse">horse</a>, but is able to adopt human form. Some accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves when appearing as a human, leading to its association with the Christian idea of <a href="Satan">Satan</a> as alluded to by <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a> in his 1786 poem "<a href="Address%20to%20the%20Devil">Address to the Devil</a>".

Almost every sizeable body of water in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of <a href="Loch%20Ness">Loch Ness</a>. Parallels to the general <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic</a> <a href="neck%20%28water%20spirit%29">neck or nixie</a> and the <a href="North%20Germanic%20languages">Scandinavian</a> <a href="b%C3%A4ckah%C3%A4st">bäckahäst</a> have been observed. More widely, the <a href="wihwin">wihwin</a> of Central America and the Australian <a href="bunyip">bunyip</a> have been seen as counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a>s once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.

Kelpies have been portrayed in their various forms in art and literature, including recently as two high steel sculptures in <a href="Falkirk">Falkirk</a>, "<a href="The%20Kelpies">The Kelpies</a>", completed in October 2013.

The etymology of the <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> word "kelpie" is uncertain, but it may be derived from the <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Gaelic</a> "calpa" or "cailpeach", meaning "heifer" or "colt". The first recorded use of the term to describe a mythological creature, then spelled "kaelpie", appears in the manuscript of an <a href="ode">ode</a> by <a href="William%20Collins%20%28poet%29">William Collins</a>, composed some time before 1759 and reproduced in the <a href="Transactions%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20of%20Edinburgh">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</a> of 1788. The <a href="toponymy">place names</a> Kelpie hoall and Kelpie hooll are reported in "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20the%20Older%20Scottish%20Tongue">A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue</a>" as appearing in the 1674 burgh records for <a href="Kirkcudbright">Kirkcudbright</a>.

<a href="Douglas%20Harper">Douglas Harper</a>, historian and founder of the <a href="Online%20Etymology%20Dictionary">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, defines "kelpie" as "the Lowland name of a demon in the shape of a horse". It is the most common water spirit in Scottish folklore, but the name is attributed to several different forms in narratives recorded throughout the country. The late 19th century saw the onset of an interest in transcribing folklore, but the recorders were inconsistent in spelling and frequently <a href="Anglicisation">anglicised</a> words, which could result in differing names for the same spirit.

Commentators have disagreed over the kelpie's aquatic habitat. Folklorists who define kelpies as spirits living beside rivers, as distinguished from the Celtic lakeside-dwelling water horse ("<a href="each-uisge">each-uisge</a>"), include 19th-century minister of <a href="Tiree">Tiree</a> <a href="John%20Gregorson%20Campbell">John Gregorson Campbell</a> and 20th-century writers <a href="Lewis%20Spence">Lewis Spence</a> and <a href="Katharine%20Mary%20Briggs">Katharine Briggs</a>. This distinction is not universally applied however; Sir <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a> for instance claims that the kelpie's range may extend to lochs. Mackillop's dictionary reconciles the discrepancy, stating that the kelpie was "initially thought to inhabit ... streams, and later any body of water." But the distinction should stand, argues one annotator, who suggests that people are led astray when an "each uisge" in a "common practice of translating" are referred to as kelpies in English accounts, and thus mistakenly attribute lake-dwelling habits to the latter.

Others associate the term "kelpie" with a wide variety of mythical creatures. Counterparts in some regions of Scotland include the shoopiltee and <a href="nuggle">nuggle</a> of <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> and the <a href="tangie">tangie</a> of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>; in other parts of the United Kingdom they include the Welsh <a href="Ceffyl%20D%C5%B5r">ceffyl dŵr</a> and the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Manx</a> <a href="Glashtyn%23Cabyll-ushtey">cabbyl-ushtey</a>. Parallels to the general <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic</a> <a href="neck%20%28water%20spirit%29">neck</a> and the <a href="Scandinavian%20folklore">Scandinavian</a> <a href="b%C3%A4ckah%C3%A4st">bäckahäst</a> have been observed; <a href="Nick%20Middleton">Nick Middleton</a> observes that "the kelpie of Scottish folklore is a direct parallel of the [sic] bäckahästen [of Scandinavian folklore]". The <a href="wihwin">wihwin</a> of Central America and the Australian <a href="bunyip">bunyip</a> are seen as similar creatures in other parts of the world.

The <a href="mythology">mythological</a> kelpie is usually described as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the "<a href="Neck%20%28water%20spirit%29">nykur</a>" of Iceland. An <a href="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a> variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the <a href="River%20Spey">River Spey</a> was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.

The creature's nature was described by <a href="Walter%20Gregor">Walter Gregor</a>, a folklorist and one of the first members of <a href="the%20Folklore%20Society">the Folklore Society</a>, as "useful", "hurtful", or seeking "human companionship"; in some cases, kelpies take their victims into the water, devour them, and throw the entrails to the water's edge. In its equine form the kelpie is able to extend the length of its back to carry many riders together into the depths; a common theme in the tales is of several children clambering onto the creature's back while one remains on the shore. Usually a little boy, he then pets the horse but his hand sticks to its neck. In some variations the lad cuts off his fingers or hand to free himself; he survives but the other children are carried off and drowned, with only some of their entrails being found later. Such a creature said to inhabit Glen Keltney in <a href="Perthshire">Perthshire</a> is considered to be a kelpie by 20th-century folklorist <a href="Katharine%20Mary%20Briggs">Katharine Mary Briggs</a>, but a similar tale also set in Perthshire has an "each uisge" as the culprit and omits the embellishment of the young boy. The lad does cut his finger off when the event takes place in <a href="Thurso">Thurso</a>, where a water kelpie is identified as the culprit. The same tale set at <a href="Sunart">Sunart</a> in the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highlands</a> gives a specific figure of nine children lost, of whom only the innards of one are recovered. The surviving boy is again saved by cutting off his finger, and the additional information is given that he had a Bible in his pocket. Gregorson Campbell considers the creature responsible to have been a water horse rather than a kelpie, and the tale "obviously a pious fraud to keep children from wandering on Sundays".

Kelpie myths usually describe a solitary creature, but a fairy story recorded by <a href="John%20Francis%20Campbell">John F. Campbell</a> in "<a href="Popular%20Tales%20of%20the%20West%20Highlands">Popular Tales of the West Highlands</a>" (1860) has a different perspective. Entitled "Of the Drocht na Vougha or Fuoah", which is given the translation of "the bridge of the fairies or kelpies", it features a group of <a href="fuath">voughas</a>. The spirits had set about constructing a bridge over the <a href="Dornoch%20Firth">Dornoch Firth</a> after becoming tired of travelling across the water in cockleshells. It was a magnificent piece of work resplendent with gold piers and posts, but sank into the water to become a treacherous area of quicksand after a grateful onlooker tried to bless the kelpies for their work. The same story is recorded by Folklore Society member and folklore collector <a href="Charlotte%20Louisa%20Hawkins%20Dempster">Charlotte Dempster</a> simply as "The Kelpie's Bridge" (1888) with no mention of Voughas or Fuoah. Quoting the same narrative <a href="Jennifer%20Westwood">Jennifer Westwood</a>, author and folklorist, uses the descriptor "water kelpies", adding that in her opinion "Kelpies, here and in a few other instances, is used in a loose sense to mean something like 'imps.

Progeny resulting from a mating between a kelpie and a normal horse were impossible to drown, and could be recognised by their shorter than normal ears, a characteristic shared by the mythical <a href="water%20bull">water bull</a> or "tarbh uisge" in Scottish Gaelic, similar to the Manx "tarroo ushtey".

Kelpies have the ability to <a href="shapeshifting">transform</a> themselves into non-equine forms, and can take on the outward appearance of human figures, in which guise they may betray themselves by the presence of water weeds in their hair. Gregor described a kelpie adopting the guise of a wizened old man continually muttering to himself while sitting on a bridge stitching a pair of trousers. Believing it to be a kelpie, a passing local struck it on the head, causing it to revert to its equine form and scamper back to its lair in a nearby pond. Other accounts describe the kelpie when appearing in human form as a "rough, shaggy man who leaps behind a solitary rider, gripping and crushing him", or as tearing apart and devouring humans.

A folk tale from <a href="Barra">Barra</a> tells of a lonely kelpie that transforms itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put to work for a year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. The wise man then asks the kelpie, once again transformed into the handsome young man the girl had first met, whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.

Traditionally, kelpies in their human form are male. One of the few stories describing the creature in female form is set at Conon House in <a href="Ross%20and%20Cromarty">Ross and Cromarty</a>. It tells of a "tall woman dressed in green", with a "withered, meagre countenance, ever distorted by a malignant scowl", who overpowered and drowned a man and a boy after she jumped out of a stream.

The arrival of <a href="History%20of%20Christianity%20in%20Scotland">Christianity</a> in Scotland in the 6th century resulted in some folk stories and beliefs being recorded by scribes, usually Christian monks, instead of being perpetuated by <a href="oral%20tradition">word of mouth</a>. Some accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves even in human form, leading to its association with the Christian notion of <a href="Satan">Satan</a>, just as with the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> god <a href="Pan%20%28god%29">Pan</a>. <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a> refers to such a Satanic association in his "<a href="Address%20to%20the%20Devil">Address to the Devil</a>" (1786):
When a kelpie appeared in its equine persona without any <a href="Horse%20tack">tack</a>, it could be captured using a halter stamped with the sign of a <a href="Christian%20cross">cross</a>, and its strength could then be harnessed in tasks such as the transportation of heavy mill stones. One folk tale describes how the Laird of Morphie captured a kelpie and used it to carry stones to build his castle. Once the work was complete, the laird released the kelpie, which was evidently unhappy about its treatment. The curse it issued before leaving – "Sair back and sair banes/ Drivin' the Laird o' Morphies's stanes,/ The Laird o' Morphie'll never thrive/ As lang's the kelpy is alive" – was popularly believed to have resulted in the extinction of the laird's family. Some kelpies were said to be equipped with a bridle and sometimes a saddle, and appeared invitingly ready to ride, but if mounted they would run off and drown their riders. If the kelpie was already wearing a bridle, <a href="exorcism">exorcism</a> might be achieved by removing it. A bridle taken from a kelpie was endowed with magical properties, and if brandished towards someone, was able to transform that person into a horse or pony.

Just as with cinematic <a href="werewolf">werewolves</a>, a kelpie can be killed by being shot with a silver bullet, after which it is seen to consist of nothing more than "turf and a soft mass like jelly-fish" according to an account published by Spence. When a blacksmith's family were being frightened by the repeated appearances of a water kelpie at their summer cottage, the blacksmith managed to render it into a "heap of starch, or something like it" by penetrating the spirit's flanks with two sharp iron spears that had been heated in a fire.

Almost every sizeable Scottish body of water has a kelpie story associated with it, but the most widely reported is the kelpie of <a href="Loch%20Ness">Loch Ness</a>. Several stories of mythical spirits and monsters are attached to the loch's vicinity, dating back to 6th-century reports of Saint <a href="Columba">Columba</a> defeating a monster on the banks of the <a href="River%20Ness">River Ness</a>. The early 19th-century kelpie that haunted the woods and shores of Loch Ness was tacked up with its own saddle and bridle. A fable attached to the notoriously nasty creature has the Highlander James MacGrigor taking it by surprise and cutting off its bridle, the source of its power and life, without which it would die within twenty-four hours. As the kelpie had the power of speech, it attempted unsuccessfully to bargain with MacGrigor for the return of its bridle. After following MacGrigor to his home, the kelpie asserted that MacGrigor would be unable to enter his house while in possession of the bridle, because of the presence of a cross above the entrance door. But MacGrigor outwitted the creature by tossing the bridle through a window, so the kelpie accepted its fate and left, cursing and swearing. The myth is perpetuated with further tales of the bridle as it is passed down through the family. Referred to as "Willox's Ball and Bridle", it had magical powers of healing; a spell was made by placing the items in water while chanting "In the name of the Father, the Son and of the Holy Ghost"; the water could then be used as a cure.

A popular and more recent explanation for the Loch Ness monster among believers is that it belongs to a line of long-surviving <a href="plesiosauria">plesiosaurs</a>, but the kelpie myth still survives in children's books such as <a href="Mollie%20Hunter">Mollie Hunter</a>'s "The Kelpie's Pearls" (1966) and <a href="Dick%20King-Smith">Dick King-Smith</a>'s "The Water Horse" (1990).

Folklorist Gary R. Varner has suggested that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in <a href="horse%20sacrifice">horse sacrifice</a>s performed in ancient <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.

Historian and <a href="symbol">symbol</a>ogist Charles Milton Smith has hypothesised that the kelpie myth might originate with the <a href="water%20spout">water spout</a>s that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, giving the impression of a living form as they move across the water. Sir Walter Scott alludes to a similar explanation in his epic poem "<a href="The%20Lady%20of%20the%20Lake%20%28poem%29">The Lady of the Lake</a>" (1810), which contains the lines

<a href="Pictish%20stone">Pictish stone</a>s dating from the 6th to 9th centuries featuring what has been dubbed the <a href="Pictish%20Beast">Pictish Beast</a> may be the earliest representations of a kelpie or kelpie-like creature. 

Victorian artist <a href="Thomas%20Millie%20Dow">Thomas Millie Dow</a> sketched the kelpie in 1895 as a melancholy dark-haired maiden balanced on a rock, a common depiction for artists of the period. Other depictions show kelpies as poolside maidens, as in <a href="Herbert%20James%20Draper">Draper</a>'s 1913 oil on canvas. Folklorist Nicola Bown has suggested that painters such as Millie Dow and Draper deliberately ignored earlier accounts of the kelpie and reinvented it by altering its sex and nature.

Two high steel sculptures in <a href="Falkirk">Falkirk</a> on the <a href="Forth%20and%20Clyde%20Canal">Forth and Clyde Canal</a>, named "<a href="The%20Kelpies">The Kelpies</a>", borrow the name of the mythical creature to associate with the strength and endurance of the horse; designed by sculptor <a href="Andy%20Scott%20%28sculptor%29">Andy Scott</a>, they were built as monuments to Scotland's horse-powered industrial heritage. Construction was completed in October 2013 and the sculptures were opened for public access from April 2014.

Blonde on Blonde

Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by American <a href="singer-songwriter">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, released June 20, 1966 on <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, <a href="Bob%20Dylan%20%26amp%3B%20The%20Band">the Hawks</a>. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—"<a href="One%20of%20Us%20Must%20Know%20%28Sooner%20or%20Later%29">One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)</a>". At producer <a href="Bob%20Johnston">Bob Johnston</a>'s suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist <a href="Al%20Kooper">Al Kooper</a>, and guitarist <a href="Robbie%20Robertson">Robbie Robertson</a> moved to the <a href="Columbia%20Records%23The%201960s">CBS</a> studios in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.

"Blonde on Blonde" completed the trilogy of <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with "<a href="Bringing%20It%20All%20Back%20Home">Bringing It All Back Home</a>" and "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>". Critics often rank "Blonde on Blonde" as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a <a href="Modernism">modernist</a> literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called "a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial". It was one of the first <a href="double%20album">double album</a>s in rock music.

The album peaked at number nine on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. "Blonde on Blonde" spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: "<a href="Rainy%20Day%20Women%20%E2%99%AF12%20%26amp%3B%2035">Rainy Day Women #12 & 35</a>" and "<a href="I%20Want%20You%20%28Bob%20Dylan%20song%29">I Want You</a>". Two additional songs—"<a href="Just%20Like%20a%20Woman">Just Like a Woman</a>" and "<a href="Visions%20of%20Johanna">Visions of Johanna</a>"—have been named as among Dylan's greatest compositions and were featured in <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">"Rolling Stone"s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a> list.

After the release of "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>" in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist <a href="Mike%20Bloomfield">Mike Bloomfield</a> and keyboard player <a href="Al%20Kooper">Al Kooper</a> had backed Dylan on his new album and at <a href="Electric%20Dylan%20controversy">Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival</a>. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the <a href="Paul%20Butterfield%20Blues%20Band">Paul Butterfield Blues Band</a>. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, <a href="Albert%20Grossman">Albert Grossman</a>, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of <a href="Levon%20Helm">Levon Helm</a> from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: <a href="Robbie%20Robertson">Robbie Robertson</a>, <a href="Rick%20Danko">Rick Danko</a>, <a href="Richard%20Manuel">Richard Manuel</a> and <a href="Garth%20Hudson">Garth Hudson</a>. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker <a href="Ronnie%20Hawkins">Ronnie Hawkins</a>. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer <a href="John%20P.%20Hammond">John Hammond, Jr.</a>, son of record producer <a href="John%20Hammond%20%28producer%29">John Hammond</a>, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album "So Many Roads".

Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City. Their immediate task was to record a hit single as the follow-up to "<a href="Positively%204th%20Street">Positively 4th Street</a>", but Dylan was already shaping his next album, the third one that year backed by rock musicians.

Producer <a href="Bob%20Johnston">Bob Johnston</a>, who had overseen the recording of "Highway 61 Revisited", started work with Dylan and the Hawks at Columbia Studio A, 799 Seventh Avenue, New York, on October 5. They concentrated on a new arrangement of "<a href="Can%20You%20Please%20Crawl%20Out%20Your%20Window%3F">Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?</a>", a song recorded during the "Highway 61 Revisited" sessions but not included on that album. Three further numbers were attempted, but none progressed into completed songs. Both the fragmentary "Jet Pilot" and "I Wanna Be Your Lover", a quasi-parody of <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' "<a href="I%20Wanna%20Be%20Your%20Man">I Wanna Be Your Man</a>", finally appeared on the 1985 box set retrospective, "<a href="Biograph%20%28album%29">Biograph</a>". Also attempted were two takes of "Medicine Sunday", a song that later evolved into "<a href="%23Temporary%20Like%20Achilles">Temporary Like Achilles</a>".

On November 30, the Hawks joined Dylan again at Studio A, but drummer <a href="Bobby%20Gregg">Bobby Gregg</a> replaced Levon Helm, who had tired of playing in a backing band and quit. They began work on a new composition, "Freeze Out", which was later retitled "<a href="Visions%20of%20Johanna">Visions of Johanna</a>", but Dylan wasn't satisfied with the results. One of the November 30 recordings was eventually released on "" in 2005. At this session, they completed "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?" The song was released as a single in December, but only reached number 58 on the American charts.

Dylan spent most of December in California, performing a dozen concerts with his band, and then took a break through the third week in January following the birth of his son <a href="Jesse%20Dylan">Jesse</a>. On January 21, 1966, he returned to Columbia's Studio A to record another long composition, "<a href="She%27s%20Your%20Lover%20Now">She's Your Lover Now</a>", accompanied by the Hawks (this time with Sandy Konikoff on drums). Despite nineteen takes, the session failed to yield any complete recordings. Dylan did not attempt the song again, but one of the outtakes from the January 21 session finally appeared 25 years later on "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Volumes%201%E2%80%933%20%28Rare%20%26amp%3B%20Unreleased%29%201961%E2%80%931991">The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991</a>". (Although the song breaks down at the start of the last verse, Columbia released it as the most complete take from the session.)

Around this time, Dylan became disillusioned about using the Hawks in the studio. He recorded more material at Studio A on January 25, backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Rick Danko (or <a href="Bill%20Lee%20%28musician%29">Bill Lee</a>), guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist <a href="Paul%20Griffin%20%28musician%29">Paul Griffin</a>, and organist Al Kooper. Two more new compositions were attempted: "<a href="Leopard-Skin%20Pill-Box%20Hat">Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat</a>" and "<a href="One%20of%20Us%20Must%20Know%20%28Sooner%20or%20Later%29">One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)</a>". Dylan was satisfied with "One of Us Must Know"; the January 25 take was released as a <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a> a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album.

Another session took place on January 27, this time with Robertson, Danko, Kooper and Gregg. Dylan and his band recorded "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" and "One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)" again, but Dylan was not satisfied with the recorded performance of either song. Also at this session Dylan attempted a rough performance of "<a href="I%27ll%20Keep%20It%20with%20Mine">I'll Keep It with Mine</a>", a song which he had already recorded twice as a <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a>. The musicians added some tentative backing in a rendering biographer <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a> described as "cursory". The recording was ultimately released on "The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3" in 1991.

A shortage of new material and the slow progress of the sessions contributed to Dylan's decision to cancel three additional recording dates. Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic <a href="Robert%20Shelton%20%28critic%29">Robert Shelton</a>, "Oh, I was really down. I mean, in ten recording sessions, man, we didn't get one song ... It was the band. But you see, I didn't know that. I didn't want to think that".

Recognizing Dylan's dissatisfaction with the progress of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: "Grossman came up to me and said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a thing going here'". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's <a href="Music%20Row">Music Row</a> in February 1966.

In addition to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited <a href="harmonica">harmonica</a> player, guitarist and bassist <a href="Charlie%20McCoy">Charlie McCoy</a>, guitarist <a href="Wayne%20Moss">Wayne Moss</a>, guitarist and bassist <a href="Joe%20South">Joe South</a>, and drummer <a href="Kenny%20Buttrey">Kenny Buttrey</a>. At Dylan's request, Johnston removed the baffles—partitions separating the musicians so that there was "an ambience fit for an ensemble". Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston's re-arrangement of the studio, "as if we were on a tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you're ninety miles apart". Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics. Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions.

On the first Nashville session, on February 14, Dylan successfully recorded "Visions of Johanna", which he had attempted several times in New York. Also recorded was a take of "<a href="4th%20Time%20Around">4th Time Around</a>" which made it onto the album and a take of "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" which did not.

On February 15 the session began at 6 p.m. but Dylan simply sat in the studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4 a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and outlined the structure of the song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition "<a href="Sad%20Eyed%20Lady%20of%20the%20Lowlands">Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands</a>". Kenny Buttrey recalled, "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it ... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel ... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?" The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.

The next session began similarly—Dylan spent the afternoon writing lyrics, and the session continued into the early hours of February 17, when the musicians began to record "<a href="Stuck%20Inside%20of%20Mobile%20with%20the%20Memphis%20Blues%20Again">Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again</a>". After several musical revisions and false starts, the fourteenth take was the version selected for the album.

Most accounts of recording "Blonde on Blonde", including those by Dylan scholars <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a> and <a href="Michael%20Gray%20%28author%29">Michael Gray</a>, agree that there were two blocks of recording sessions: February 14–17 and March 8–10, 1966. This chronology is based on the logs and files kept by Columbia Records.

Dylan and the Hawks performed concerts in Ottawa, Montreal, and Philadelphia in February and March, and then Dylan resumed recording in Nashville on March 8. On that date, Dylan and the musicians recorded the take of "<a href="Absolutely%20Sweet%20Marie">Absolutely Sweet Marie</a>" that Dylan selected for the album. Historian <a href="Sean%20Wilentz">Sean Wilentz</a> observed that "with the sound of 'Sweet Marie', "Blonde on Blonde" entered fully and sublimely into what is now considered classic rock and roll". The same day saw the successful takes of "<a href="Just%20Like%20a%20Woman">Just Like a Woman</a>", and "<a href="Pledging%20My%20Time">Pledging My Time</a>", the latter "driven by Robertson's screaming guitar".

According to Wilentz the final recording session, on March 9–10, produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time. The first number to be recorded to Dylan's satisfaction was "<a href="Most%20Likely%20You%20Go%20Your%20Way%20and%20I%27ll%20Go%20Mine">Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine</a>", when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica, changing the sound of the song radically. Dylan and his band then quickly recorded "Temporary Like Achilles". The session atmosphere began to "get giddy" around midnight when Dylan roughed out "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" on the piano. Johnston recalled commenting; "That sounds like the damn <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> band". Dylan replied; "Can you get one?" Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler, the only additional musician required, and Dylan and the band, with McCoy again on trumpet, played a high-spirited version of the song.

In quick succession Dylan and the musicians then recorded "<a href="%23Obviously%205%20Believers">Obviously 5 Believers</a>" and a final take of "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" powered by Robertson's lead guitar. The session concluded with "<a href="I%20Want%20You%20%28Bob%20Dylan%20song%29">I Want You</a>" on which, as Wilentz notes, "Wayne Moss's rapid-fire <a href="sixteenth%20note">sixteenth note</a>s on the guitar" are an impressive element of the recording.

Al Kooper, who played keyboards on every track of "Blonde on Blonde", has contested the conventional account that there were two blocks of recording sessions in Nashville. In comments on Michael Gray's website, Kooper wrote: "There was only ONE trip to Nashville for Robbie and I, and ALL THE TRACKS were cut in that one visit", stating that Dylan merely broke for an outstanding concert. <a href="Charlie%20McCoy">Charlie McCoy</a> agreed with Kooper's version. Wilentz analyzed the recording of "Blonde on Blonde" in his book "Bob Dylan In America", concluding that the "official" documented version fits Dylan's known touring schedule, and notes that five of the eight songs first recorded after "Stuck Inside of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again", but none of those recorded earlier, include a <a href="Middle%20eight">middle-eight</a> section—Dylan's first extensive foray as a writer into that conventional structure".

Dylan mixed the album in Los Angeles in early April, before he departed on the Australian leg of his <a href="Bob%20Dylan%20World%20Tour%201966">1966 world tour</a>. Wilentz writes that it was at this point it became "obvious that the riches of the Nashville sessions could not fit onto a <a href="LP%20record">single LP</a>", and they had "produced enough solid material to demand an oddly configured double album, the first of its kind in contemporary popular music". According to producer Steve Berkowitz, who supervised the reissue of Dylan's LPs in <a href="Monaural">mono</a> as "<a href="The%20Original%20Mono%20Recordings">The Original Mono Recordings</a>" in 2010, Johnston told him that they carefully worked on the mono mix for about three or four days whereas the stereo mix was finished in about four hours.

Al Kooper recalled that both the album title, "Blonde on Blonde", and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What do you want to call this?' And [Bob] just like said them out one at a time ... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on "Brecht on Brecht", a stage production based on works by German playwright <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a> that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know it was all in good faith ... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't."


According to author Andy Gill, by starting his new album with what sounded like "a demented marching-band ... staffed by crazy people out of their mind on loco-weed", Dylan delivered his biggest shock yet for his former folkie fans. The elaborate puns on getting stoned combine a sense of paranoiac persecution with "nudge-nudge wink-wink bohemian hedonism". Heylin points out that the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> connotations of getting stoned made the Salvation Army-style musical backing seem like a good joke. The enigmatic title came about, Heylin suggests, because Dylan knew a song entitled "everybody must get stoned" would be kept off the airwaves. Heylin links the title to the <a href="Book%20of%20Proverbs">Book of Proverbs</a>, chapter 27, verse 15: "A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike." Released as a single on March 22, 1966, "Rainy Day Women" reached number two on the "Billboard" singles chart, and number seven in the UK.

Following the good-time fun of "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35", the <a href="Chicago%20blues">Chicago blues</a>-influenced "Pledging My Time" sets the somber tone that runs through the album. It draws on several traditional blues songs, including <a href="Elmore%20James">Elmore James</a>' recording of "<a href="It%20Hurts%20Me%20Too">It Hurts Me Too</a>". For critic <a href="Michael%20Gray%20%28author%29">Michael Gray</a>, the lines "Somebody got lucky but it was an accident" echo the lines "Some joker got lucky, stole her back again" from <a href="Robert%20Johnson">Robert Johnson</a>'s "<a href="Come%20On%20in%20My%20Kitchen">Come On in My Kitchen</a>", which is itself an echo of the <a href="Skip%20James">Skip James</a> 1931 recording "Devil Got My Woman". Gray suggests that "the gulping movements of the melodic phrases" derive from the melody of "<a href="Sitting%20on%20Top%20of%20the%20World">Sitting on Top of the World</a>", recorded by the <a href="Mississippi%20Sheiks">Mississippi Sheiks</a> in 1930. The couplet at the end of each verse expresses the theme: a pledge made to a prospective lover in hopes she "will come through, too". Besides Dylan's vocals and improvised harmonica breaks, the song's sound is defined by Robbie Robertson's guitar, Hargus "Pig" Robbins's blues piano and Ken Buttrey's snare drum rolls. The song was released in edited form as the B-side of "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" in March.


Considered by many critics as one of Dylan's masterpieces, "Visions of Johanna" proved difficult to capture on tape. Heylin places the writing in the fall of 1965, when Dylan was living in the <a href="Hotel%20Chelsea">Chelsea Hotel</a> with his wife <a href="Sara%20Dylan">Sara</a>. In the New York recording studio, on November 30, Dylan announced his epic composition: "This is called 'Freeze Out'." Gill notes that this working title captures the "air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched ... full of whispering and muttering." Wilentz relates how Dylan guided his backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to sketch out how he wanted it played, saying at one point, "it's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's "hard" is Robbie." Wilentz notes that, as Dylan quiets things down, he inches closer to what will appear on the album.

Ten weeks later, "Visions of Johanna" fell into place quickly in the Nashville studio. Kooper recalled that he and Robertson had become adept at responding to Dylan's vocal and also singled out Joe South's contribution of "this throbbing ... rhythmically amazing bass part". Gill comments that the song begins by contrasting two lovers, the carnal Louise, and "the more spiritual but unattainable" Johanna. Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection. For Heylin, the triumph of the song is in "the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way."

When Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25, 1966, he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on "Blonde on Blonde"s first side. With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: "At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half <a href="George%20Gershwin">Gershwin</a>, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension."

"One of Us Must Know" is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: "I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't have to take it so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all." "One of Us Must Know" was the first recording completed for "Blonde on Blonde" and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.

Andy Gill notes that the song displays a tension between the very direct tone of the chorus, the repeated phrase "I want you", and a weird and complex cast of characters, "too numerous to inhabit the song's three minutes comfortably", including a guilty undertaker, a lonesome organ grinder, weeping fathers, mothers, sleeping saviors, the Queen of Spades, and the "dancing child with his Chinese suit". Analyzing the evolution of the lyrics through successive drafts, Wilentz writes that there are numerous failures, "about deputies asking him his name ... lines about fathers going down hugging one another and about their daughters putting him down because he isn't their brother". Finally Dylan arrives at the right formula.

Heylin points out that the gorgeous tune illustrates what Dylan explained to a reporter in 1966: "It's not just pretty words to a tune or putting tunes to words ... [It's] the words and the music [together]—I can hear the sound of what I want to say." Al Kooper has said that of all the songs that Dylan had outlined to him in his hotel, this was his favorite, so Dylan delayed recording it to the very end of the Nashville sessions, "just to bug him". Released as a single in June 1966, shortly before the album "Blonde on Blonde", "I Want You" reached number 20 in the USA, and number 16 in the UK.

Recorded at the third Nashville session, this song was the culmination of another epic of simultaneous writing and recording in the studio. Wilentz describes how the lyrics evolved through a surviving part-typed, part-handwritten manuscript page, "which begins 'honey but it's just too hard' (a line that had survived from the very first New York session with the Hawks). Then the words meander through random combinations and disconnected fragments and images ('people just get uglier'; 'banjo eyes'; 'he was carrying a 22 but it was only a single shot'), before, in Dylan's own hand, amid many crossings-out, there appears 'Oh MAMA you're here IN MOBILE ALABAMA with the Memphis blues again'."

Inside the studio, the song evolved through several musical revisions. Heylin writes, "It is the song's arrangement, and not its lyrics, that occupies the musicians through the wee small hours." On the fifth take, released in 2005 on the "", midtake Dylan stumbles on the formula "Stuck "inside of" Mobile" on the fourth verse, and never goes back. The song contains two oft-quoted pieces of Dylan's philosophy: "Your debutante just knows what you need/ But I know what you want" and "here I sit so patiently/ Waiting to find out what price/ You have to pay to get out of/ Going through all these things twice".

"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" is a sarcastic satire on <a href="materialism">materialism</a>, fashion and <a href="fad">fad</a>dism. Done in Chicago-blues style, the song derives its melody and part of its lyrics from <a href="Lightnin%27%20Hopkins">Lightnin' Hopkins</a>'s "Automobile (Blues)". <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28music%20journalist%29">Paul Williams</a> writes that its caustic attitude is "moderated slightly when one realizes that jealous pique is the underlying emotion". In the lyrics, the narrator observes his former lover in various situations wearing her "brand new leopard-skin <a href="pill%20box%20hat">pill-box hat</a>", at one point finding his doctor with her and later spying her making love with a new boyfriend because she "forgot to close the garage door". In the closing lines, the narrator says he knows what her boyfriend really loves her for—her hat.

The song evolved over the course of six takes in New York, 13 in the first Nashville session, and then one try on March 10, the take used for the album. Dylan, who gets credit on the liner notes as lead guitarist, opens the song playing lead (on the center-right stereo channel); however, Robertson handles the solos with a "searing" performance (on the left stereo channel). A year following the recording, "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" became the fifth single released from "Blonde on Blonde", making it to number 81 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>.

According to Wilentz's analysis of the session's tapes, Dylan felt his way into the lyrics of one of his most popular songs, singing "disconnected lines and semi-gibberish" during the earlier takes. He was unsure what the person described in the song does that is just like a woman, rejecting "shakes", "wakes", and "makes mistakes". This exploration of female wiles and feminine vulnerability was widely rumored—"not least by her acquaintances among <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>'s <a href="The%20Factory">Factory</a> retinue"—to be about <a href="Edie%20Sedgwick">Edie Sedgwick</a>. The reference to Baby's penchant for "fog ... amphetamine and ... pearls" suggests Sedgwick or some similar debutante, according to Heylin.

Discussing the lyrics, literary critic <a href="Christopher%20Ricks">Christopher Ricks</a> detects a "note of social exclusion" in the line "I was hungry and it was your world". In response to the accusation that Dylan's depiction of female strategies is misogynistic, Ricks asks, "Could there ever be any challenging art about men and women where the accusation just didn't arise?" The song reached number 33 in the US.

A bright blues "stomper" about lovers parting, "Most Likely You Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine" is one of the more literal songs Dylan recorded in his 1965–66 period. The narrator has tired of carrying his lover and is going to let her "pass". As in "Just Like a Woman" and "Absolutely Sweet Marie", he waits until the end of each verse to deliver the punch line, which in this case comes from the title. "Most Likely You Go Your Way" was issued as a single a year later, in March 1967, on the B-side of "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat".

This slow-moving blues number is highlighted by Hargus "Pig" Robbins's "dusky barrelhouse piano" and Dylan's "brief wheeze of harmonica". In the song, the narrator has been spurned by his lover, who has already taken up with her latest boyfriend. Referring to his rival as "<a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>", the narrator senses the new suitor may end up being discarded as quickly as he was. The refrain that ends each of the main verses—"Honey, why are you so hard?"—is a <a href="double%20entendre">double entendre</a> Dylan had been wanting to work into a song.

This song, described as "up-tempo blues shuffle, pure <a href="Culture%20of%20Memphis%2C%20Tennessee%23Music">Memphis</a>" and an example of "obvious pop sensibility and compulsive melody", was recorded in four takes on March 7, 1966. Gill sees the lyrics as a series of sexual metaphors, including "beating on my trumpet" and keys to locked gates, many deriving from traditional blues. Nonetheless, the song contains what has been termed "one of the most oft-repeated of Dylan's life lessons", the thought that "to live outside the law you must be honest", which was later invoked in many bohemian and <a href="Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">counter-cultural</a> contexts.

When <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> released their sixth studio album, "<a href="Rubber%20Soul">Rubber Soul</a>", in December 1965, <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>'s song "<a href="Norwegian%20Wood%20%28This%20Bird%20Has%20Flown%29">Norwegian Wood</a>" attracted attention for the way in which Lennon disguised his account of an illicit affair in cryptic, Dylanesque language. Dylan sketched out a response to the song, also in 3/4 time, copying the tune and circular structure, but taking Lennon's tale in a darker direction. Wilentz describes the result as sounding "like Bob Dylan impersonating John Lennon impersonating Bob Dylan".


"Obviously 5 Believers", "Blonde on Blonde"'s second-to-last track, is a roadhouse blues love song similar in melody and structure to <a href="Memphis%20Minnie">Memphis Minnie</a>'s "<a href="Chauffeur%20Blues">Me and My Chauffeur Blues</a>", and was described by Robert Shelton as "the best <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> song on the album". Recorded in the early morning hours of the March 9–10 Nashville session under the working title "Black Dog Blues", the song is driven by Robertson's guitar, Charlie McCoy's harmonica and <a href="Ken%20Buttrey">Ken Buttrey</a>'s drumming. After an initial breakdown, Dylan complained to the band that the song was "very easy, man" and that he didn't want to spend much time on it. Within four takes, the recording was done.

Written in the CBS recording studio in Nashville over the space of eight hours on the night of February 15–16, "Sad Eyed Lady" eventually occupied the whole of side four of "Blonde On Blonde". Critics have observed that "Lowlands" hints at "Lownds", and Dylan biographer <a href="Robert%20Shelton%20%28critic%29">Robert Shelton</a> wrote that this was a "wedding song" for <a href="Sara%20Dylan">Sara Lownds</a>, whom Dylan had married just three months earlier. In his <a href="paean">paean</a> to his wife, "<a href="Sara%20%28Bob%20Dylan%20song%29%23Sara">Sara</a>", written in 1975, Dylan amends history slightly to claim that he stayed "up for days in the Chelsea Hotel/ Writin' 'Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands' for you".

When Dylan played Shelton the song, shortly after recording it, he claimed, "This is the best song I've ever written." Around the same time, Dylan enthused to journalist <a href="Jules%20Siegel">Jules Siegel</a>, "Just listen to that! That's old-time religious carnival music!" However, in 1969, Dylan confessed to "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s editor, <a href="Jann%20Wenner">Jann Wenner</a>, "I just sat down at a table and started writing ... And I just got carried away with the whole thing ... I just started writing and I couldn't stop. After a period of time, I forgot what it was all about, and I started trying to get back to the beginning ["laughs"]."

Heard by some listeners as a hymn to an other-worldly woman, for Shelton "her travails seem beyond endurance, yet she radiates an inner strength, an ability to be reborn. This is Dylan at his most romantic." Wilentz comments that Dylan's writing had shifted from the days when he asked questions and supplied answers. Like the verses of <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>'s "<a href="The%20Tyger">Tyger</a>", Dylan asks a series of questions about the "Sad Eyed Lady" but never supplies any answers.

The following outtakes were recorded during the "Blonde on Blonde" sessions.
In 2015, Dylan released Volume 12 of his Bootleg Series, "", in three different formats. The 18-disc "Collector's Edition" was described as including "every note recorded during the 1965–1966 sessions, every alternate take and alternate lyric." The 18 CDs contain every take of every song recorded in the studio during the "Blonde on Blonde" sessions, from October 5, 1965, to March 10, 1966.

The New York sessions comprise: two takes of "Medicine Sunday", one take of "Jet Pilot", twelve takes of "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?", seven takes of "I Wanna Be Your Lover", fourteen takes of "Visions of Johanna", sixteen takes of "She's Your Lover Now", four takes of "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat", twenty-four takes of "One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)", one take of "I'll Keep It with Mine", and one take of "Lunatic Princess".

The Nashville sessions comprise: twenty takes of "Fourth Time Around", four takes of "Visions of Johanna", fourteen takes of "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat", four takes of "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands", fifteen takes of "Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again", three takes of "Absolutely Sweet Marie", eighteen takes of "Just Like a Woman", three takes of "Pledging My Time", six takes of "Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)", four takes of "Temporary Like Achilles", four takes of "Obviously Five Believers", five takes of "I Want You", and one take of "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35". The 18 CDs also contain brief recordings of guitar and keyboard inserts.

Describing the process of listening to all these alternative versions, <a href="Neil%20McCormick">Neil McCormick</a> wrote: ""The Cutting Edge" allows fans to bear witness to perhaps the most astonishing explosion of language and sound in rock history, a new approach to song being forged before our very ears."

The cover photo of "Blonde on Blonde" shows a 12-by-12 inch close-up portrait of Dylan. The <a href="double%20album">double album</a> <a href="gatefold">gatefold</a> sleeve opens to form a 12-by-26 inch photo of the artist, at three quarter length. The artist's name and the album's title only appear on the spine. A sticker was applied to the shrink wrap to promote the release's two hit singles, "I Want You" and "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35".

The cover shows Dylan in front of a brick building, wearing a suede jacket and a black and white checkered <a href="scarf">scarf</a>. The jacket is the same one he wore on his next two albums, "<a href="John%20Wesley%20Harding%20%28album%29">John Wesley Harding</a>" and "<a href="Nashville%20Skyline">Nashville Skyline</a>". The photographer, <a href="Jerry%20Schatzberg">Jerry Schatzberg</a>, described how the photo was taken:
Research by rock historian Bob Egan suggests the location of the cover photo was at 375 West Street, at the extreme west of <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>. The original inside gatefold featured nine black-and-white photos, all taken by Schatzberg and selected for the sleeve by Dylan himself. A shot of actress <a href="Claudia%20Cardinale">Claudia Cardinale</a> from Schatzberg's portfolio was included but later withdrawn because it had been used without her authorization and Cardinale's representatives threatened to sue, making the original record sleeve a collector's item. Dylan included a self-portrait by Schatzberg as a credit to the photographer. The photos, for Gill, added up to "a shadowy glimpse of [Dylan's] life, including an enigmatic posed shot of Dylan holding a small portrait of a woman in one hand and a pair of pliers in the other: they all contributed to the album's air of reclusive yet sybaritic genius."

"Blonde on Blonde" reached the Top 10 in both the US and UK album charts, and also spawned a number of hits that restored Dylan to the upper echelons of the singles charts. In August 1967, the album was certified as a gold disc.

The album received generally favorable reviews. <a href="Pete%20Johnson%20%28rock%20critic%29">Pete Johnson</a> in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" wrote, "Dylan is a superbly eloquent writer of pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images." The editor of "<a href="Crawdaddy%21">Crawdaddy!</a>", <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28music%20journalist%29">Paul Williams</a>, reviewed "Blonde on Blonde" in July 1966: "It is a cache of emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready to become part of your reality. Here is a man who will speak to you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. All you have to do is listen."

To accompany the songbook of "Blonde on Blonde", <a href="Paul%20Nelson%20%28critic%29">Paul Nelson</a> wrote an introduction stating, "The very title suggests the singularity and the duality we expect from Dylan. For Dylan's music of illusion and delusion—with the tramp as explorer and the clown as happy victim, where the greatest crimes are lifelessness and the inability to see oneself as a circus performer in the show of life—has always carried within it its own inherent tensions ... Dylan in the end truly UNDERSTANDS situations, and once one truly understands anything, there can no longer be anger, no longer be moralizing, but only humor and compassion, only pity."

May 16, 1966 is commonly noted as the album's official release date. Michael Gray, author of "The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia", contended that the release date was actually around late June or early July. This coincides with the album's promotion in "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", which carried a full-page Columbia advertisement on June 25, selected the album as a "New Action LP" on July 9, and ran a review and article on July 16. In 2017, after viewing a Sony database of album releases, Heylin found that the release date was in fact June 20, 1966. This is supported by the fact that an overdub on "Fourth Time Around" was recorded in June. 

The album debuted on "Billboard"s <a href="Billboard%20200%23History">Top LP's</a> chart on July 23 at number 101—just six days before <a href="Bob%20Dylan%23Motorcycle%20accident%20and%20reclusion">Dylan's motorcycle accident</a> in Woodstock removed him from public view. By contrast, another contemporary LP which has an official 1966 release date of May 16, "<a href="Pet%20Sounds">Pet Sounds</a>" by <a href="the%20Beach%20Boys">the Beach Boys</a>, entered the "Billboard" LP chart less than two weeks after release on May 28 at number 105.

"Blonde on Blonde" has been described as rock's first studio <a href="double%20album">double LP</a> by a major artist, released just one week before "<a href="Freak%20Out%21">Freak Out!</a>", the double album by <a href="the%20Mothers%20of%20Invention">the Mothers of Invention</a>.

Twelve years after its release, Dylan said: "The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on individual bands in the "Blonde on Blonde" album. It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up." For critics, the double album was seen as the last installment in Dylan's trilogy of mid-1960s rock albums. As <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> wrote, "The three albums of this period—"<a href="Bringing%20It%20All%20Back%20Home">Bringing It All Back Home</a>" and "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>" both released in 1965, and "Blonde on Blonde" from 1966—used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn't approached before." <a href="Mike%20Marqusee">Mike Marqusee</a> has described Dylan's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as "a body of work that remains unique in popular music." For Patrick Humphries, "Dylan's body of work during the 14-months period ... stands unequalled in rock's 30-year history. In substance, style, ambition and achievement, no one has even come close to matching "Bringing It All Back Home", "Highway 61 Revisited" and "Blonde on Blonde"."

Dylan scholar Michael Gray wrote: "To have followed up one masterpiece with another was Dylan's history making achievement here ... Where "Highway 61 Revisited" has Dylan exposing and confronting like a laser beam in surgery, descending from outside the sickness, "Blonde on Blonde" offers a persona awash inside the chaos ... We're tossed from song to song ... The feel and the music are on a grand scale, and the language and delivery are a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial." Critic <a href="Tim%20Riley%20%28music%20critic%29">Tim Riley</a> wrote: "A sprawling abstraction of eccentric blues revisionism, "Blonde on Blonde" confirms Dylan's stature as the greatest American rock presence since <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>." Biographer Robert Shelton saw the album as "a hallmark collection that completes his first major rock cycle, which began with "<a href="Bringing%20It%20All%20Back%20Home">Bringing It All Back Home</a>"". Summing up the album's achievement, Shelton wrote that "Blonde on Blonde" "begins with a joke and ends with a hymn; in between wit alternates with a dominant theme of entrapment by circumstances, love, society, and unrealized hope ... There's a remarkable marriage of funky, bluesy rock expressionism, and <a href="Arthur%20Rimbaud">Rimbaud</a>-like visions of discontinuity, chaos, emptiness, loss, being 'stuck'."

That sense of crossing cultural boundaries was, for Al Kooper, at the heart of "Blonde on Blonde": "[Bob Dylan] was the quintessential New York hipster—what was "he" doing in Nashville? It didn't make any sense whatsoever. But you take those two elements, pour them into a <a href="test%20tube">test tube</a>, and it just exploded." For Mike Marqusee, Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with <a href="modernism">modernist</a> literary techniques: "[Dylan] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere. 'Pledging My Time' and 'Obviously 5 Believers' adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid-fifties (both begin with the ritual <a href="Delta%20blues">Delta</a> invocation of "early in the mornin"). Yet like 'Visions of Johanna' or 'Memphis Blues Again', these songs are beyond category. They are allusive, repetitive, jaggedly abstract compositions that defy reduction."

"Blonde on Blonde" has been consistently highly placed in polls of the greatest albums of all time. In 1974, the writers of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" voted "Blonde on Blonde" the number-two album of all time. Demonstrating the transitory nature of such polls, in 1997 the album was placed at number 16 in a "Music of the Millennium" poll conducted by <a href="HMV%20Group">HMV</a>, <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" and <a href="Classic%20FM%20%28UK%29">Classic FM</a>. In 2006, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">TIME</a>" magazine included the record on their 100 All-TIME Albums list. In 2003, the album was ranked number nine on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine's list of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>". In 2004, two songs from the album also appeared on the magazine's list of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>": "Just Like a Woman" ranked number 230 and "Visions of Johanna" number 404. (When "Rolling Stone" updated this list in 2010, "Just Like a Woman" dropped to number 232 and "Visions of Johanna" to number 413.) The album was additionally included in <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>'s "Basic Record Library" of 1950s and 1960s recordings—published in "" (1981)—and in critic Robert Dimery's book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

BAE Systems

BAE Systems plc is a British <a href="Multinational%20corporation">multinational</a> <a href="arms%20industry">defence</a>, <a href="Information%20security">security</a>, and <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> company. Its headquarters are in London in the United Kingdom with operations worldwide. It is the largest defence contractor in Europe and among the world's largest defence companies; it was ranked as the third-largest based on applicable 2017 revenues. Its largest operations are in the United Kingdom and United States, where its <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Inc.">BAE Systems Inc.</a> subsidiary is one of the six largest suppliers to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">US Department of Defense</a>. Other major markets include Australia, India, and Saudi Arabia, which account for about 20% of BAE's overall sales. It is the biggest manufacturer in Britain. The company was formed on 30 November 1999 by the <a href="British%20pound%20sterling">£</a>7.7 billion merger of two British companies: <a href="Marconi%20Electronic%20Systems">Marconi Electronic Systems</a> (MES) – the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the <a href="General%20Electric%20Company%20plc">General Electric Company plc</a> (GEC) – and <a href="British%20Aerospace">British Aerospace</a> (BAe) – an aircraft, munitions and naval systems manufacturer.

BAE Systems is the successor to various aircraft, shipbuilding, armoured vehicle, armaments and defence electronics companies, including the <a href="Marconi%20Company">Marconi Company</a>, the first commercial company devoted to the development and use of radio; <a href="Avro">A.V. Roe and Company</a>, one of the world's first aircraft companies; <a href="de%20Havilland">de Havilland</a>, manufacturer of the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Comet">Comet</a>, the world's first commercial jet airliner; <a href="British%20Aircraft%20Corporation">British Aircraft Corporation</a>, co-manufacturer of the <a href="Concorde">Concorde</a> supersonic transport; <a href="Supermarine">Supermarine</a>, manufacturer of the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a>; <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow Shipbuilders</a>, builder of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s <a href="Havock%20class%20destroyer">first destroyers</a>; <a href="Fairfield%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering%20Company">Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company</a>, pioneer of the <a href="triple-expansion%20engine">triple-expansion engine</a> and builder of the world's first <a href="Invincible-class%20battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>; and <a href="Vickers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering">Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering</a>, builder of the Royal Navy's first <a href="Holland%20class%20submarine">submarines</a>. Since its formation it has made a number of acquisitions, most notably of <a href="United%20Defense">United Defense</a> and <a href="Armor%20Holdings">Armor Holdings</a> of the United States, and sold its shares in <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a>, <a href="Astrium">Astrium</a>, <a href="Alenia%20Marconi%20Systems">AMS</a> and <a href="Atlas%20Elektronik">Atlas Elektronik</a>.

BAE Systems is involved in several major defence projects, including the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II</a>, the <a href="Eurofighter%20Typhoon">Eurofighter Typhoon</a>, the and the s. BAE Systems is listed on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> and is a constituent of the <a href="FTSE%20100%20Index">FTSE 100 Index</a>.

BAE Systems was formed on 30 November 1999 by the £7.7 billion merger of British Aerospace (BAe) and Marconi Electronic Systems (MES). As a result, BAE Systems is the successor to many of the most famous British aircraft, defence electronics and warship manufacturers. Predecessor companies built the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Comet">Comet</a>, the world's first commercial jet airliner; the <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20Harrier">Harrier</a> "jump jet", the world's first operational <a href="V/STOL">Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing</a> (VTOL) aircraft; the "groundbreaking" Blue Vixen radar carried by <a href="BAE%20Sea%20Harrier%23Specifications%20%28Sea%20Harrier%20FA2%29">Sea Harrier FA2s</a> and which formed the basis of the Eurofighter's <a href="Euroradar%20CAPTOR">CAPTOR</a> radar; and co-produced the iconic <a href="Concorde">Concorde</a> supersonic airliner with <a href="A%C3%A9rospatiale">Aérospatiale</a>.

British Aerospace was a civil and <a href="military%20aircraft">military aircraft</a> manufacturer, as well as a provider of military land systems. The company had emerged from the massive consolidation of UK aircraft manufacturers since World War II. British Aerospace was formed on 29 April 1977 by the nationalisation and merger of The <a href="British%20Aircraft%20Corporation">British Aircraft Corporation</a> (BAC), the <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley">Hawker Siddeley Group</a> and <a href="Scottish%20Aviation">Scottish Aviation</a>. Both BAC and Hawker Siddeley were themselves the result of various mergers and acquisitions.

Marconi Electronic Systems was the defence subsidiary of British engineering firm The General Electric Company (GEC), dealing largely in military <a href="system%20integrator">systems integration</a>, as well as naval and land systems. Marconi's heritage dates back to <a href="Guglielmo%20Marconi">Guglielmo Marconi</a>'s Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company, founded in 1897. GEC purchased <a href="English%20Electric">English Electric</a> (which included Marconi) in 1968 and thereafter used the Marconi brand for its defence businesses (as GEC-Marconi and later Marconi Electronic Systems). GEC's own defence heritage dates back to World War I, when its contribution to the war effort included radios and bulbs. World War II consolidated this position, as the company was involved in important technological advances, notably the <a href="cavity%20magnetron">cavity magnetron</a> for <a href="radar">radar</a>. Between 1945 and 1999, GEC-Marconi/Marconi Electronic Systems became one of the world's most important <a href="defence%20contractor">defence contractor</a>s. GEC's major defence related acquisitions included <a href="Associated%20Electrical%20Industries">Associated Electrical Industries</a> in 1967, <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders%20Limited">Yarrow Shipbuilders</a> in 1985, <a href="Plessey">Plessey</a> companies in 1989, parts of <a href="Ferranti">Ferranti</a>'s defence business in 1990, the rump of <a href="Ferranti">Ferranti</a> when it went into receivership in 1993/1994, <a href="Vickers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering">Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering</a> in 1995 and <a href="Kvaerner%20Govan">Kværner Govan</a> in 1999. In June 1998, MES acquired <a href="Tracor">Tracor</a>, a major American defence contractor, for £830 million (approx. US$1.4 billion c. 1998).

The 1997 merger of American corporations <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas">McDonnell Douglas</a>, which followed the forming of <a href="Lockheed%20Martin">Lockheed Martin</a>, the world's largest defence contractor in 1995, increased the pressure on European defence companies to consolidate. In June 1997 British Aerospace Defence managing director <a href="John%20Weston%20%28businessman%29">John Weston</a> commented "Europe... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S.". European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company.

As early as 1995 British Aerospace and the German aerospace and defence company <a href="DaimlerChrysler%20Aerospace">DaimlerChrysler Aerospace</a> (DASA) were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company. The two companies envisaged including Aérospatiale, the other major European aerospace company, but only after its privatisation. The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, Aérospatiale and <a href="Construcciones%20Aeron%C3%A1uticas">Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA</a> into an integrated company; in this aim British Aerospace and DASA were united against the various objections of Aérospatiale. As well as Airbus, British Aerospace and DASA were partners in the <a href="Panavia%20Tornado">Panavia Tornado</a> and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft projects. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998, just as French participation became more likely with the announcement that Aérospatiale was to merge with <a href="Matra">Matra</a> and emerge with a diluted French government shareholding. A merger was agreed between British Aerospace chairman <a href="Richard%20Evans%20%28businessman%29">Richard Evans</a> and DASA CEO <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20E.%20Schrempp">Jürgen Schrempp</a> in December 1998.

Meanwhile, GEC was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation. Reporting the appointment of George Simpson as GEC managing director in 1996, "The Independent" had said "some analysts believe that Mr Simpson's inside knowledge of BAe, a long-rumoured GEC bid target, was a key to his appointment. GEC favours forging a national 'champion' defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations." When GEC put MES up for sale on 22 December 1998, British Aerospace abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. The merger of British Aerospace and MES was announced on 19 January 1999. Evans stated that in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA. The merger created a <a href="vertically%20integrated">vertically integrated</a> company which "The Scotsman" described as "[a combination of British Aerospace's] contracting and platform-building skills with Marconi's coveted electronics systems capability", for example combining the manufacturer of the Eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircraft's electronic systems; British Aerospace was MES' largest customer. In contrast, DASA's response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with <a href="A%C3%A9rospatiale">Aérospatiale</a> to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (<a href="EADS">EADS</a>), a <a href="horizontal%20integration">horizontal integration</a>.

Seventeen undertakings were given by BAE Systems to the <a href="Department%20of%20Trade%20and%20Industry%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Trade and Industry</a> which prevented a reference of the merger to the <a href="Monopolies%20and%20Mergers%20Commission">Monopolies and Mergers Commission</a>. These were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender sub-contracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries. Another condition was the "<a href="Chinese%20wall">firewalling</a>" of former British Aerospace and MES teams on defence projects such as the <a href="Joint%20Strike%20Fighter%20Program">Joint Strike Fighter</a> (JSF). In 2007 the government, on advice from the <a href="Office%20of%20Fair%20Trading">Office of Fair Trading</a>, announced it had agreed to release BAE Systems from ten of the undertakings due to "a change in circumstances".

BAE Systems inherited the UK government owned <a href="golden%20share">"golden" share</a> that was established when British Aerospace was privatised. This unique share prevents amendments of certain parts of the company's <a href="Articles%20of%20Association%20%28law%29">Articles of Association</a> without the permission of the Secretary of State. These Articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than 15% of the company's shares.

British Aerospace's head office was in Warwick House, Farnborough Aerospace Centre in <a href="Farnborough%2C%20Hampshire">Farnborough, Hampshire</a>. BAE Systems retains this but the <a href="registered%20office">registered office</a>, and base for the senior leadership team, is in the <a href="City%20of%20Westminster">City of Westminster</a>.

BAE Systems' first annual report identified Airbus, support services to militaries and integrated systems for air, land and naval applications as key areas of growth. It also stated the company's desire to both expand in the US and participate in further consolidation in Europe. BAE Systems described 2001 as an "important year" for its European joint ventures, which were reorganised considerably. The company has described the rationale for expansion in the US; "[it] is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the Western European nations combined. Importantly, US investment in research and development is significantly higher than in Western Europe." When <a href="Dick%20Olver">Dick Olver</a> was appointed chairman in July 2004 he ordered a review of the company's businesses which ruled out further European acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a "strategic bias" for expansion and investment in the US. The review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and, with two acquisitions in 2004 and 2005, BAE moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world. This shift in strategy was described as "remarkable" by the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>". Between 2008 and early 2011 BAE acquired five cyber security companies in a shift in strategy to take account of reduced spending by governments on "traditional defence items such as warships and tanks".

In 2000 <a href="Matra%20Marconi%20Space">Matra Marconi Space</a>, a joint BAE Systems/Matra company, was merged with the space division of DASA to form <a href="Astrium">Astrium</a>. On 16 June 2003 BAE sold its 25% share to EADS for £84 million, however due to the lossmaking status of the company, BAE Systems invested an equal amount for "restructuring". In January 2001 Airbus Industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company. BAE Systems sold its 54% majority share of <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Canada">BAE Systems Canada</a>, an electronics company, in April for CA$310 (approx. £197 million as of December 2010). In November 2001, the company announced the closure of the Avro Regional Jet (<a href="BAe%20146">Avro RJ</a>) production line at <a href="Woodford%2C%20Cheshire">Woodford</a> and the cancellation of the Avro RJX, an advanced series of the aircraft family, as the business was "no longer viable". The final Avro RJ to be completed became the last British civil airliner. In November 2001 BAE sold its 49.9% share of <a href="Thomson%20Marconi%20Sonar">Thomson Marconi Sonar</a> to Thales for £85 million. A further step of European defence consolidation was the merger of BAE's share of <a href="Matra%20BAe%20Dynamics">Matra BAe Dynamics</a> and the missile division of Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) into <a href="MBDA">MBDA</a> in December. MBDA thus became the world's second largest missile manufacturer. Although EADS (now <a href="Airbus%20SE">Airbus SE</a>) was later reported to be interested in acquiring full control of MBDA, BAE said that, unlike Airbus, MBDA is a "core business".
In June 2002, BAE Systems confirmed it was in takeover discussions with <a href="TRW%20Inc.">TRW</a>, an American aerospace, automotive and defence business. This was prompted by <a href="Northrop%20Grumman">Northrop Grumman</a>'s £4.1 billion (approx. US$6 billion c. 2002) hostile bid for TRW in February 2002. A bidding war between BAE Systems, Northrop and <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a> ended on 1 June when Northrop's increased bid of £5.1 billion was accepted. On 11 December 2002, the company issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Nimrod%20MRA4">Nimrod MRA4</a> maritime reconnaissance/attack aircraft and the projects. On 19 February 2003 BAE took a charge of £750 million against these projects and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) agreed to pay a further £700 million of the cost. In 2000 the company had taken a £300 million "loss charge" on the Nimrod contract which was expected to cover "all the costs of completion of the current contract". The troubled Nimrod project would ultimately be cancelled as part of the <a href="Strategic%20Defence%20and%20Security%20Review%202010">2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review</a>.

The UK government, following a cabinet row described as "one of the most bitter Cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the <a href="Westland%20affair">Westland helicopter affair</a> in 1985", ordered 20 <a href="BAE%20Hawk">BAE Hawk</a> trainer aircraft with 24 options in July 2003 in a deal worth £800 million. The deal was significant because it was a factor in India's decision to finalise a £1 billion order for 66 Hawks in March 2004. Also in July 2003 BAE Systems and <a href="Finmeccanica">Finmeccanica</a> announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies, to be collectively known as <a href="Eurosystems">Eurosystems</a>. These companies would have pooled the avionics, <a href="C4ISTAR">C4ISTAR</a> and communications businesses of the two companies. However the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way led to a re-evaluation of the proposal; BAE Systems' 2004 Annual Report states that "recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed Eurosystems transaction with Finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model". The main part of this deal was the dissolution of AMS and the establishment of <a href="SELEX%20Sensors%20and%20Airborne%20Systems">SELEX Sensors and Airborne Systems</a>; BAE Systems sold its 25% share of the latter to Finmeccanica for €400 million (approx. £270 million c. 2007) in March 2007.

In May 2004, it was reported that the company was considering selling its shipbuilding divisions, <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Naval%20Ships">BAE Systems Naval Ships</a> and <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Submarines">BAE Systems Submarines</a>. It was understood that General Dynamics wished to acquire the submarine building facilities at <a href="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow-in-Furness</a>, while <a href="VT%20Group">VT Group</a> was said to be interested in the remaining yards on the <a href="River%20Clyde">Clyde</a>. Instead, in 2008 BAE Systems merged its Surface Fleet arm with the shipbuilding operations of VT Group to form <a href="BVT%20Surface%20Fleet">BVT Surface Fleet</a>, an aim central to the British Government's <a href="Defence%20Industrial%20Strategy">Defence Industrial Strategy</a>.
On 4 June 2004, BAE Systems outbid General Dynamics for <a href="Alvis%20Vickers">Alvis Vickers</a>, the UK's main manufacturer of armoured vehicles. Alvis Vickers was merged with the company's <a href="RO%20Defence">RO Defence</a> unit to form BAE Systems Land Systems. Recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to General Dynamics, BAE Systems executives soon identified the US defence company <a href="United%20Defense">United Defense Industries</a> (UDI), a major competitor to General Dynamics, as a main acquisition target. On 7 March 2005 BAE announced the £2.25 billion (approx. US$4.2 billion c. 2005) acquisition of UDI. UDI, now <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Land%20and%20Armaments">BAE Systems Land and Armaments</a>, manufactures combat vehicles, artillery systems, naval guns, missile launchers and precision guided munitions.

In December 2005, BAE Systems announced the sale of its German naval systems subsidiary, Atlas Elektronik, to <a href="ThyssenKrupp">ThyssenKrupp</a> and EADS. The sale was complicated by the requirement of the German government to approve any sale. The "Financial Times" described the sale as "cut price" because French company Thales bid €300 million, but was blocked from purchasing Atlas on national security grounds. On 31 January 2006 the company announced the sale of BAE Systems Aerostructures to <a href="Spirit%20AeroSystems%2C%20Inc.">Spirit AeroSystems, Inc</a>, having said as early as 2002 that it wished to dispose of what it did not regard as a "core business".

On 18 August 2006 Saudi Arabia signed a contract worth £6 billion to £10 billion for 72 Eurofighter Typhoons, to be delivered by BAE Systems. On 10 September 2006 the company was awarded a £2.5 billion contract for the upgrade of 80 <a href="Royal%20Saudi%20Air%20Force">Royal Saudi Air Force</a> Tornado IDSs. One of BAE Systems' major aims, as highlighted in the 2005 Annual Report, was the granting of increased technology transfer between the UK and the US. The F-35 (JSF) programme became the focus of this effort, with British government ministers such as <a href="Paul%20Drayson%2C%20Baron%20Drayson">Lord Drayson</a>, <a href="Defence%20Procurement%20Agency">Minister for Defence Procurement</a>, suggesting the UK would withdraw from the project without the transfer of technology that would allow the UK to operate and maintain F-35s independently. On 12 December 2006, Lord Drayson signed an agreement which allows "an unbroken British chain of command" for operation of the aircraft. On 22 December 2006 BAE received a £947 million contract to provide guaranteed availability of <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) Tornados.

On 7 May 2007 the company announced its subsidiary BAE Systems Inc. was to purchase <a href="Armor%20Holdings">Armor Holdings</a> for £2.3 billion (approx. US$4.5 billion c. 2007) and completed the deal on 31 July 2007. The company is a manufacturer of tactical wheeled vehicles and a provider of vehicle and individual armour systems and survivability technologies. BAE Systems (and British Aerospace previously) was a technology partner to the <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a> Formula One team from 1996 to December 2007. The partnership originally focused on McLaren's F1 car's aerodynamics, eventually moving on to carbon fibre techniques, wireless systems and fuel management. BAE Systems' main interest in the partnership was to learn about the high speed build and operations processes of McLaren.

The company announced the acquisition of <a href="Tenix%20Defence">Tenix Defence</a>, a major Australian defence contractor on 18 January 2008. The purchase was completed on 27 June for A$775 million (£373 million) making <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Australia">BAE Systems Australia</a> that country's largest defence contractor. The UK Ministry of Defence awarded BAE Systems a 15-year munitions contract in August 2008 worth up to £3 billion, and known as Munition Acquisition Supply Solution (MASS). The contract guarantees supply of 80% of the UK Armed Forces' ammunition and required BAE to modernise its munitions manufacturing facilities. BAE Systems expanded its intelligence and security business with the £531 million purchase of <a href="Detica">Detica Group</a> in July 2008. It continued this strategy with purchases of Danish cyber and intelligence company ETI for approximately $210 million in December 2010, and <a href="Norkom">Norkom Group PLC</a> the following month for €217 million. The latter provides counter fraud and anti-money laundering solutions to the global financial services industry where its software assists institutions to comply with regulations on financial intelligence and monitoring.

BAE Systems inherited British Aerospace's share of Airbus Industrie, which consisted of two factories at <a href="Broughton%2C%20Flintshire">Broughton</a> and <a href="Filton">Filton</a>. These facilities manufactured wings for the Airbus family of aircraft. In 2001 Airbus was incorporated as Airbus SAS, a <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20par%20actions%20simplifi%C3%A9e">joint stock company</a>. In return for a 20% share in the new company BAE Systems transferred ownership of its Airbus plants (known as <a href="Airbus%20UK">Airbus UK</a>) to the new company.

Despite repeated suggestions as early as 2000 that BAE Systems wished to sell its 20% share of Airbus, the possibility was denied by the company until on 6 April 2006 BBC News reported that it was indeed to sell its stake, then "conservatively valued" at £2.4 billion. Due to the slow pace of informal negotiations, BAE Systems exercised its <a href="put%20option">put option</a> which saw investment bank <a href="N%20M%20Rothschild%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Rothschild</a> appointed to give an independent valuation. Six days after this process began, Airbus announced delays to the <a href="Airbus%20A380">A380</a> with significant effects on the value of Airbus shares. On 2 June 2006 Rothschild valued the company's share at £1.87 billion, well below its own analysts' and even EADS' expectations. The BAE Systems board recommended that the company proceed with the sale. On 4 October 2006 shareholders voted in favour and the sale was completed on 13 October. BAE Systems' sale of its Airbus share saw the end of UK-owned involvement in civil airliner production. Airbus Operations Ltd (the former Airbus UK) continues to be the Airbus "Centre of Excellence" for wing production, employing over 9,500, but is entirely owned by the Airbus Group (formerly EADS).

In February 2010 BAE Systems announced a £592 million <a href="writedown">writedown</a> of the former Armor Holdings business following the loss of the <a href="Family%20of%20Medium%20Tactical%20Vehicles">Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles</a> contract in 2009. It was outbid by <a href="Oshkosh%20Corporation">Oshkosh Corporation</a> for the £2.3 billion ($3.7 billion) contract. Land and Armaments had been the "star performer" of BAE Systems' subsidiaries, growing from sales of £482 million in 2004 to £6.7 billion in 2009.

BAE Systems inherited British Aerospace's 35% share of <a href="Saab%20AB">Saab AB</a>, with which it produced and marketed the <a href="JAS%2039%20Gripen">Gripen</a> fighter aircraft. In 2005 it reduced this share to 20.5% and in March 2010 announced its intention to sell the remainder. "The Times" stated that the decision brought "to an end its controversial relationship with the Gripen fighter aircraft". Several of the export campaigns for the aircraft were subject to allegations of bribery and corruption.

The company continued its move into support services in May 2010 with the purchase of the marine support company <a href="Atlantic%20Marine">Atlantic Marine</a> for $352 million. In September 2010 BAE Systems announced plans to sell the <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Platform%20Solutions">Platform Solutions</a> division of BAE Systems Inc., which the "Financial Times" said could yield as much as £1.3 billion. Despite "considerable expressions of interest", the sale was abandoned in January 2011. The purchases of s, the "Astute"-class submarines, and the <a href="Type%2026%20frigate">Type 26 frigate</a>s were all confirmed. A new generation of nuclear missile submarines, the <a href="Dreadnought-class%20submarine">"Dreadnought"-class</a>, was ordered in 2016.

BAE Systems sold the regional aircraft lease portfolio and asset management arm of its <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Regional%20Aircraft">BAE Systems Regional Aircraft</a> business in May 2011. This unit leases the <a href="BAe%20146">BAe 146</a>/Avro RJ family, <a href="BAe%20ATP">BAe ATP</a>, <a href="British%20Aerospace%20Jetstream">Jetstream</a> and <a href="BAe%20748">BAe 748</a>. The company retained the support and engineering activities of the business as part of the transaction.

In September 2011, BAE Systems began consultation with unions and workers over plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs, mostly in the company's military aircraft division.

In its 2012 half-year report, the company revealed a 10% decline in revenue in the six months up to 30 June due to falling demand for armaments. In May 2012 the governments of the UK and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement on an arms package which saw a £1.6 billion contract awarded to BAE for the delivery of 55 Pilatus PC-21 and 22 BAE Systems Hawk aircraft. The Sultanate of Oman ordered Typhoon and Hawk aircraft worth £2.5 billion in December 2012.

On 13 September 2012, it was reported that BAE Systems and <a href="EADS">EADS</a> had entered possible merger talks. In case of a potential tie-up, BAE shareholders would own 40% and EADS shareholders would own 60% of the new organisation. On 10 October 2012, the companies said the merger talks had been called off. The Guardian reported the reason for the collapse of the proposal was due to the German Government's concern about the "potential size of the French shareholding in the combined company, as well as disagreements over the location of the group's headquarters".

On 6 November 2013, BAE Systems announced that 1,775 jobs were to go at its yards in England and Scotland. Shipbuilding would also cease entirely in Portsmouth in 2014 with the loss of 940 jobs, and a further 835 jobs would be lost at Filton, near Bristol, and at the shipyards in Govan, Rosyth, and Scotstoun in Scotland.

In July 2014 it announced the acquisition of US intelligence capability, Signal Innovations Group Inc., to augment imagery and data analysis technologies in its Intelligence & Security business.

In August 2014, BAE was awarded a £248 million contract from the <a href="British%20government">British government</a> to build three new <a href="offshore%20patrol%20vessel">offshore patrol vessel</a>s.

In October 2014, BAE Systems won a £600 million contract from the British Ministry of Defence to maintain <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Portsmouth naval base</a> for five years.

On 9 October 2014, the company announced the loss of 440 management jobs across the country, with 286 of the job cuts in Lancashire. BAE said that the changes are to "make a more efficient and effective business". During 2014 BAE Systems acquired US-based <a href="cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> firm Silversky for $232.5 million.

During <a href="Theresa%20May">Theresa May</a>'s visit to Turkey in January 2017, BAE and <a href="Turkish%20Aerospace%20Industries">TAI</a> officials signed an agreement, worth about £100 million, for BAE to provide assistance in developing the <a href="TAI%20TFX">TAI TFX</a> aircraft. On 10 October 2017, BAE announced that it would lay off nearly 2,000 out of its approximately 35,000 employees in Britain, mainly due to an order shortage for the <a href="Eurofighter%20Typhoon">Eurofighter Typhoon</a> fighter.

On 21 January 2019, BAE Systems announced that the company would sell a 55% share of its UK land business to <a href="Rheinmetall">Rheinmetall</a> for £28.6 m subject to government approvals. The joint venture (JV) would be called Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) and be headquartered at BAE's existing facility in Telford, Shropshire. If approved, the JV will have a positive effect on the UK's Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) procurement, which could result in contracts for at least 500 <a href="Boxer%20%28armoured%20fighting%20vehicle%29">Boxer</a> vehicles to equip the UK's future strike brigades. BAE Systems and Rheinmetall are currently competitors in the UK's <a href="Challenger%202">Challenger 2</a> Life Extension Project (LEP), but according to BAE Systems the competition between the companies will continue, an agreement with Rheinmetall ensuring that the solution will be delivered from Telford regardless of the contract winner.

BAE Systems plays a significant role in the production of military equipment. In 2008, 95% of BAE Systems' total sales were military related.

It plays important roles in military aircraft production. The company's <a href="Eurofighter%20Typhoon">Typhoon</a> fighter and <a href="Panavia%20Tornado">Tornado</a> fighter-bomber are both front line aircraft of the RAF. The company is a major partner in the F-35 Lightning II programme. Its <a href="BAE%20Hawk">Hawk</a> advanced jet trainer aircraft has been widely exported. In July 2006, the British government declassified the <a href="BAE%20HERTI">HERTI</a> (High Endurance Rapid Technology Insertion), an <a href="Unmanned%20Aerial%20Vehicle">Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</a> (UAV) which can navigate autonomously. It is currently developing a <a href="sixth-generation%20jet%20fighter">sixth-generation jet fighter</a> aircraft for the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> marketed as the "<a href="BAE%20Systems%20Tempest">Tempest</a>". It is being developed by "Team Tempest" consisting of, UK Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Holdings">Rolls-Royce</a>, <a href="Leonardo%20S.p.A.">Leonardo S.p.A.</a> and <a href="MBDA">MBDA</a>, and is intended to enter service from 2035 replacing the <a href="Eurofighter%20Typhoon">Eurofighter Typhoon</a> aircraft in service with the RAF.

<a href="BAE%20Systems%20Land%20and%20Armaments">BAE Systems Land and Armaments</a> manufactures the <a href="M2%20Bradley">M2/M3 Bradley</a> fighting vehicle family, the US Navy <a href="Advanced%20Gun%20System">Advanced Gun System</a> (AGS), <a href="M113%20armoured%20personnel%20carrier">M113</a> armoured personnel carrier (APC), <a href="M109%20howitzer">M109 Paladin</a>, <a href="M777%20howitzer">M777 howitzer</a>, the British Army's <a href="Challenger%202%20tank">Challenger II</a>, <a href="Warrior%20Tracked%20Armoured%20Vehicle">Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle</a>, <a href="Panther%20Command%20and%20Liaison%20Vehicle">Panther Command and Liaison Vehicle</a>, and the <a href="SA80">SA80</a>.

Major naval projects include the nuclear submarine, <a href="Type%2026%20frigate">Type 26</a> frigate and .

BAE Systems defines its "principal markets" to be Australia, Saudi Arabia, the UK and the US.

BAE Systems is the predominant supplier to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD); in 2009/2010 BAE Systems companies in the list of Top 100 suppliers to the MoD received contracts totalling £3.98 billion, with total revenue being higher when other subsidiary income is included. In comparison, the second largest supplier is <a href="Babcock%20International%20Group">Babcock International Group</a> and its subsidiaries, with a revenue of £1.1 billion from the MoD. Oxford Economic Forecasting states that in 2002 the company's UK businesses employed 111,578 people, achieved export sales of £3 billion and paid £2.6 billion in taxes. These figures exclude the contribution of Airbus UK.

After its creation, BAE Systems had a difficult relationship with the MoD. This was attributed to deficient project management by the company, but also in part to the deficiencies in the terms of "fixed price contracts". CEO <a href="Michael%20Turner%20%28businessman%29">Mike Turner</a> said in 2006 "We had entered into contracts under the old competition rules that frankly we shouldn't have taken". These competition rules were introduced by <a href="Peter%20Levene%2C%20Baron%20Levene%20of%20Portsoken">Lord Levene</a> during the 1980s to shift the burden of risk to the contractor and were in contrast to "cost plus contracts" where a contractor was paid for the value of its product plus an agreed profit.

BAE Systems was operating in "the only truly open defence market", which meant that it was competing with US and European companies for British defence projects, while they were protected in their home markets. The US defence market is competitive, however largely between American firms, while foreign companies are excluded. In December 2005 the MoD published the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) which has been widely acknowledged to recognise BAE Systems as the UK's "national champion". The DIS identifies key industrial capabilities which must be maintained within the UK through long-term government commitments to support research spending and procurement. Of these capabilities, several are dominated by BAE Systems, including naval vessels and submarines, combat vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, general munitions (with the exception of certain "niche capabilities abroad") and <a href="network-enabled%20capability">network-enabled capability</a> (defined as C4ISTAR in the DIS). The company maintains an interest in future UAV technologies through its collaborative FLAVIIR research programme with <a href="Engineering%20and%20Physical%20Sciences%20Research%20Council">EPSRC</a>.

After the publication of the DIS BAE Systems CEO Mike Turner said "If we didn't have the DIS and our profitability and the terms of trade had stayed as they were... then there had to be a question mark about our future in the UK". Lord Levene said in the balance between value for money or maintaining a viable industrial base the DIS "tries as well as it can to steer a middle course and to achieve as much as it can in both directions. ...We will never have a perfect solution."

The attraction of MES to British Aerospace was largely its ownership of Tracor, a major American defence contractor.

BAE Systems Inc. now sells more to the US Department of Defense (DOD) than the UK MoD. The company has been allowed to buy important defence contractors in the US, however its status as a UK company requires that its US subsidiaries are governed by American executives under <a href="Special%20Security%20Arrangement">Special Security Arrangement</a>s. The company faces fewer impediments in this sense than its European counterparts, as there is a high <a href="Special%20Relationship%20%28US-UK%29">degree of integration</a> between the US and UK defence establishments. BAE Systems' purchase of <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20Aerospace%20Electronic%20Systems">Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems</a> in November 2000 was described by <a href="John%20Hamre">John Hamre</a>, CEO of the <a href="Center%20for%20Strategic%20and%20International%20Studies">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a> and former <a href="United%20States%20Deputy%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Deputy Secretary of Defense</a>, as "precedent setting" given the advanced and classified nature of many of that company's products.

The possibility of a merger between BAE Systems Inc. and major North American defence contractors has long been reported, including Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon.

<a href="BAE%20Systems%20Australia">BAE Systems Australia</a> is one of the largest defence contractors in Australia, having more than doubled in size with the acquisition of Tenix Defence in 2008. The Al Yamamah agreements between the UK and Saudi Arabia require "the provision of a complete defence package for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"; BAE Systems employs 5,300 people in the kingdom. <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Land%20Systems%20South%20Africa">BAE Systems Land Systems South Africa</a>, 75% owned by BAE Systems, is the largest military vehicle manufacturer in South Africa, and is currently taking part in the US <a href="MRAP">MRAP</a> programme. BAE Systems' interests in Sweden are a result of the purchases of <a href="Alvis%20plc">Alvis Vickers</a> and UDI, which owned Hägglunds and <a href="Bofors">Bofors</a> respectively; the companies are now part of <a href="BAE%20Systems%20AB">BAE Systems AB</a>.

As of 21 February 2018 BAE Systems listed the following as "significant" shareholders: <a href="AXA">AXA S.A.</a> and its group of companies 5.00%, <a href="Barclays">Barclays PLC</a> 3.98%, <a href="BlackRock">BlackRock, Inc.</a> 5.00%, <a href="Capital%20Group%20Companies">Capital Group Companies</a> 10.11%, <a href="Franklin%20Templeton%20Investments">Franklin Resources Inc.</a>, and affiliates 4.92%, <a href="Invesco">Invesco Limited</a> 4.97% and <a href="Silchester%20International%20Investors">Silchester International Investors LLP</a> 3.01%.

BAE Systems has its head office and its <a href="registered%20office">registered office</a> in <a href="City%20of%20Westminster">City of Westminster</a>, London. In addition to its central London offices, it has an office in <a href="Farnborough%2C%20Hampshire">Farnborough, Hampshire</a> that houses functional specialists and support functions.

From 1 January 2018 BAE divides its business into the following business groups:


BAE Systems' chairman is Sir <a href="Roger%20Carr%20%28businessman%29">Roger Carr</a>. The executive directors are <a href="Charles%20Woodburn">Charles Woodburn</a> (CEO), Peter Lynas and Jerry DeMuro. The non-executive directors are <a href="Harriet%20Green">Harriet Green</a>, <a href="Chris%20Grigg">Chris Grigg</a>, Nick Rose, Paula Rosput Reynolds, Ian Tyler, Revathi Advaithi and <a href="Elizabeth%20Corley">Elizabeth Corley</a>.

The company's first CEO, John Weston, was forced to resign in 2002 in a boardroom "coup" and was replaced by Mike Turner. "The Business" reported that Weston was ousted when non-executive directors informed the chairman that they had lost confidence in him. Further, it was suggested that at least one non-executive director was encouraged to make such a move by the MOD due to the increasingly fractious relationship between BAE Systems and the government. As well as the terms of the Nimrod contract, Weston had fought against the MOD's insistence that one of the first three Type 45 destroyers should be built by VT Group. "The Business" said he considered this "competition-policy gone mad".

It is understood that Turner had a poor working relationship with senior MOD officials, for example with former Defence Secretary <a href="Geoff%20Hoon">Geoff Hoon</a>. Significantly the first meeting between Olver and Hoon was said to have gone well; a MOD official commented "He is a man we can do business with. We think it is good to be taking a fresh look at things". It has been suggested that relations between Turner and Olver were tense. On 16 October 2007 the company announced that Mike Turner would retire in August 2008. "The Times" called his departure plans "abrupt" and a "shock", given previous statements that he wished to retire in 2013 at the age of 65. Despite suggestions that BAE Systems would prefer an American CEO due to the increasing importance of the United States defence market to the company and the opportunity to make a clean break from corruption allegations and investigations related to the <a href="Al%20Yamamah">Al Yamamah</a> contracts, the company announced on 27 June 2008 that it had selected the company's chief operating officer, Ian King, to succeed Turner with effect from 1 September 2008. The "Financial Times" noted that King's career at Marconi distances him from the British Aerospace-led Al Yamamah project.

In 2015 the company invested more than £11m in charities and not-for-profit organisations through company and employee donations to support its key areas of customer, education and heritage.

On 22 February 2017 BAE Systems announced that on that day Ian King had informed the Board that he would retire on 30 June 2017. It was confirmed that Charles Woodburn, currently Chief Operating Officer, would be appointed as Chief Executive from 1 July 2017. Woodburn joined BAE Systems in May 2016 as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Board Director, following over 20 years' international experience in senior management positions in the oil and gas industry.)

Financial information for the Company is as follows:

BAE Systems has been under investigation by the <a href="Serious%20Fraud%20Office%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Serious Fraud Office</a>, into the use of political corruption to help sell arms to Chile, Czech Republic, Romania, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Tanzania and Qatar. In response, BAE Systems' 2006 Corporate Responsibility Report states "We continue to reject these allegations... We take our obligations under the law extremely seriously and will continue to comply with all legal requirements around the world. In June 2007 <a href="Lord%20Woolf">Lord Woolf</a> was selected to lead what the BBC described as an "independent review... [an] ethics committee to look into how the defence giant conducts its arms deals". The report, "Ethical business conduct in BAE Systems plc – the way forward", made 23 recommendations, measures which the company has committed to implement. The finding stated that "in the past BAE did not pay sufficient attention to ethical standards in the way it conducted business", and was described by the BBC as "an embarrassing admission".

In September 2009, the Serious Fraud Office announced that it intended to prosecute BAE Systems for offences relating to overseas corruption. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" claimed that a penalty "possibly of more than" £500 million might be an acceptable settlement package. On 5 February 2010, BAE Systems agreed to pay criminal fines of £257 million (US$400 million) to the US and £30M to the UK. The UK had already massively benefited from £43 billion contract in tax receipts and jobs in the UK, and dropped an anti-corruption investigation into the <a href="Al-Yamamah%20arms%20deal">Al Yamamah contracts</a> later taken up by US authorities. Crucially, under a plea bargain with the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Justice">US Department of Justice</a>, BAE Systems was convicted of felony conspiracy to defraud the United States government and sentenced in March 2010 by US District Court Judge <a href="John%20D.%20Bates">John D. Bates</a> to pay a $400 million fine, one of the largest fines in the history of the DOJ. Judge Bates said the company's conduct involved "deception, duplicity and knowing violations of law, I think it's fair to say, on an enormous scale". BAE Systems did not directly admit to bribery, and is thus not internationally blacklisted from future contracts. Some of the £30M penalty the company will pay in fines to the UK will be paid ex gratia for the benefit of the people of Tanzania. On 2 March 2010 Campaign Against Arms Trade and The Corner House were successful in gaining a High Court injunction on the Serious Fraud Office's settlement with BAE Systems. The High Court may order a full review of the settlement.

Both BAE Systems and its previous incarnation British Aerospace have long been the subject of allegations of bribery in relation to its business in Saudi Arabia. The UK <a href="National%20Audit%20Office%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Audit Office</a> (NAO) investigated the Al Yamamah contracts and has so far not published its conclusions, the only NAO report ever to be withheld. The MOD has stated "The report remains sensitive. Disclosure would harm both international relations and the UK's commercial interests." The company has been accused of maintaining a £60 million Saudi <a href="slush%20fund">slush fund</a> and was the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). In November 2006, Saudi Arabia put pressure on the British government to end the SFO investigation by suspending negotiations over a new deal for seventy-two Typhoon fighter jets. On 14 December 2006 it was announced that the SFO was "discontinuing" its investigation into the company. It stated that representations to its Director and the <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General</a> <a href="Peter%20Goldsmith%2C%20Baron%20Goldsmith">Lord Goldsmith</a> had led to the conclusion that the wider public interest "to safeguard national and international security" outweighed any potential benefits of further investigation. The termination of the investigation has been controversial. In June 2007, the BBC's <a href="Panorama%20%28TV%20series%29">Panorama</a> alleged BAE Systems "paid hundreds of millions of pounds to the ex-Saudi ambassador to the US, <a href="Prince%20Bandar%20bin%20Sultan">Prince Bandar bin Sultan</a>" in return for his role in the Al Yamamah deals. In late June 2007 the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) began a formal investigation into BAE's compliance with anti-corruption laws. On 19 May 2008 BAE Systems confirmed that its CEO Mike Turner and non-executive director <a href="Nigel%20Rudd">Nigel Rudd</a> had been detained "for about 20 minutes" at two US airports the previous week and that the DOJ had issued "a number of additional subpoenas in the US to employees of BAE Systems plc and BAE Systems Inc as part of its ongoing investigation". "The Times" suggested that such "humiliating behaviour by the DOJ" is unusual toward a company that is co-operating fully.

A judicial review of the decision by the SFO to drop the investigation was granted on 9 November 2007. On 10 April 2008 the High Court ruled that the SFO "acted unlawfully" by dropping its investigation. "The Times" described the ruling as "one of the most strongly worded judicial attacks on government action" which condemned how "ministers 'buckled' to 'blatant threats' that Saudi cooperation in the fight against terror would end unless the ...investigation was dropped." On 24 April the SFO was granted leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the ruling. There was a two-day hearing before the Lords on 7 and 8 July 2008. On 30 July the House of Lords unanimously overturned the High Court ruling, stating that the decision to discontinue the investigation was lawful.

In September 2005 "The Guardian" reported that banking records showed that BAE Systems paid £1 million to <a href="Augusto%20Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>, the former Chilean dictator. "The Guardian" has also reported that "clandestine arms deals" have been under investigation in Chile and the UK since 2003 and that British Aerospace and BAE Systems made a number of payments to Pinochet advisers. In 2003, <a href="HMS%20Sheffield%20%28F96%29">HMS "Sheffield"</a> was sold to the <a href="Chilean%20Navy">Chilean Navy</a> for £27 million, however the government's profit from the sale was £3 million, after contracts worth £24 million were placed with BAE Systems for upgrade and refurbishment of the ship.

BAE Systems is alleged to have paid "secret offshore commissions" of over £7 million to secure the sale of <a href="HMS%20London%20%28F95%29">HMS "London"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Coventry%20%28F98%29">HMS "Coventry"</a> to the <a href="Romanian%20Navy">Romanian Navy</a>. The company received a £116 million contract for the refurbishment of the ships prior to delivery; however the British taxpayer only received the scrap value of £100,000 each from the sale.

BAE Systems ran into controversy in 2002 over the abnormally high cost of a radar system sold to <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. The sale was criticised by several opposition MPs and the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>; <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20International%20Development">Secretary of State for International Development</a> <a href="Clare%20Short">Clare Short</a> declared that BAE Systems had "ripped off" developing nations. In December 2010, leaked US diplomatic communications revealed that Edward Hoseah, the Tanzanian prosecutor investigating misconduct by BAE Systems, had confided in US diplomats that "his life may be in danger" and was being routinely threatened.

In January 2007, details of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into BAE Systems' sales tactics in regard to South Africa were reported, highlighting the £2.3 billion deal to supply <a href="Hawk%20trainers">Hawk trainers</a> and <a href="Gripen%20fighters">Gripen fighters</a> as suspect. In May 2011, as allegations of bribery behind South Africa's Gripen procurement continued, the company's partner <a href="Saab%20AB">Saab AB</a> issued strong denials of any illicit payments being made; however in June 2011 Saab announced that BAE Systems had made unaccounted payments of roughly $3.5 million to a consultant, this revelation prompted South African Opposition parties to call for a renewed inquiry. The Gripen's procurement by the Czech Republic was also under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office in 2006 over allegations of bribery.

In September 2003 "The Sunday Times" reported that BAE Systems had hired a private security contractor to collate information about individuals working at the <a href="Campaign%20Against%20Arms%20Trade">Campaign Against Arms Trade</a> and their activities. In February 2007, it was reported that the corporation had again obtained private confidential information from CAAT.

The company was reported in 2012 to have been the target of Chinese <a href="cyber%20espionage">cyber espionage</a> that may have stolen secrets related to the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II</a>.

In 2006, BAE Systems was excluded from the <a href="Portfolio%20%28finance%29">portfolio</a> of the <a href="The%20Government%20Pension%20Fund%20of%20Norway">government pension fund of Norway</a> "because they develop and/or produce central components for nuclear weapons". "According to the ethical guidelines for the [Norwegian] Government Pension Fund – Global, companies that produce weapons that through normal use may violate fundamental <a href="humanitarian%20principles">humanitarian principles</a> shall be excluded from the fund." BAE Systems is indirectly engaged in production of <a href="nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons</a> – through its 37.5% share of <a href="MBDA">MBDA</a> it is involved with the production and support of the <a href="Air-Sol%20Moyenne%20Port%C3%A9e">ASMP</a> missile, an air-launched nuclear missile which forms part of the <a href="Force%20de%20frappe">French nuclear deterrent</a>. The company is also the UK's only <a href="nuclear%20submarine">nuclear submarine</a> manufacturer and thus produces a key element of the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons capability. However, commentators pointed out Norway has bound their strategic defence to the UK's "since Napoleonic times", including both protection under the British nuclear deterrent as well as the joint NATO nuclear sharing policy.

BAE Systems was in 2003 initially criticised for its role in the production of <a href="cluster%20bombs">cluster bombs</a>, due to the long term risk for injury or death to civilians. Following the 2008 Oslo <a href="Convention%20on%20Cluster%20Munitions">Convention on Cluster Munitions</a> BAE Systems was among the first defence contractors to stop their manufacture and by 2012 the majority of the munitions had been destroyed.

Saudi Arabia is BAE's third biggest market. "The Independent" reported that "in 2014, British defence firm BAE won a contract worth £4.4bn to supply the Saudis with 72 fighter jets – some of which were <a href="Saudi%20Arabian-led%20intervention%20in%20Yemen%23Reports%20of%20war%20crimes">used to bomb Red Cross and MSF hospitals in Yemen</a>." The chairman of BAE Systems, Sir <a href="Roger%20Carr%20%28businessman%29">Roger Carr</a>, rejected criticism over BAE's continued work in Saudi Arabia, saying "We will stop doing it when they tell us to stop doing it. ... We maintain peace by having the ability to make war and that has stood the test of time."

Former Foreign Secretary <a href="Robin%20Cook">Robin Cook</a> said of his time in office that he "came to learn that the chairman of BAE appeared to have the key to the garden door to number 10. Certainly I never knew No 10 to come up with any decision which would be incommoding to BAE." As well as employing in-house lobbyists, BAE Systems also employs a lobbying agency called <a href="Portland%20Communications">Portland PR</a>; many of Portland PR's staff have worked at the upper echelons of both Labour and Conservative governments.

Albert Kesselring

Albert Kesselring (30 November 1885 – 16 July 1960) was a German "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" of the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. In a military career that spanned both World Wars, Kesselring became one of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>'s most skilful commanders, and one of the most highly decorated, being one of 27 soldiers awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%2C%20Swords%20and%20Diamonds">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds</a>. Nicknamed "Smiling Albert" by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> and "Uncle Albert" by his troops, he was one of the most popular generals of World War II with the <a href="wikt%3Arank%20and%20file">rank and file</a>.

Kesselring joined the <a href="Bavarian%20Army">Bavarian Army</a> as an <a href="officer%20cadet">officer cadet</a> in 1904, and served in the artillery branch. He completed training as a <a href="Observation%20balloon">balloon</a> observer in 1912. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, he served on both the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern</a> fronts and was posted to the <a href="General%20Staff">General Staff</a>, despite not having attended the <a href="War%20Academy%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria%29">War Academy</a>. Kesselring remained in the Army after the war but was discharged in 1933 to become head of the Department of Administration at the <a href="Reich%20Air%20Ministry">Reich Commissariat for Aviation</a>, where he was involved in the re-establishment of the aviation industry and the laying of the foundations for the "Luftwaffe", serving as its chief of staff from 1936 to 1938.

During World War II he commanded air forces in the invasions of <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20France">France</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> and <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation "Barbarossa"</a>. As Commander-in-Chief South, he was the German commander in the <a href="Mediterranean%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean theatre</a>, which included the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">operations in North Africa</a>. Kesselring conducted an uncompromising defensive <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">campaign against the Allied forces in Italy</a> until he was injured in an accident in October 1944. In the final campaign of the war, he commanded German forces on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29%23Invasion%20of%20Germany">Western Front</a>. He won the respect of his Allied opponents for his military accomplishments, but his record was marred by massacres committed by troops under his command in Italy.

After the war, Kesselring was tried for <a href="war%20crimes">war crimes</a> and <a href="death%20penalty">sentenced to death</a> for ordering the <a href="Ardeatine%20massacre">murder of 335 Italian civilians</a>. The sentence was subsequently <a href="clemency">commuted</a> to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a>. A political and media campaign resulted in his release in 1952, ostensibly on health grounds. He was one of only three "Generalfeldmarschalls" to publish his memoirs. The first part was entitled "Soldat bis zum letzten Tag" ("A Soldier to the Last Day"), the second "Gedanken zum Zweiten Weltkrieg" ("Thoughts on the Second World War.")

Albert Kesselring was born in <a href="Marktsteft">Marktsteft</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, on 30 November 1885, the son of Carl Adolf Kesselring, a schoolmaster and town councillor, and his wife Rosina, who was born a Kesselring, being Carl's second cousin. Albert's early years were spent in Marktsteft, where relatives had operated a brewery since 1688.
Graduating from the Christian Ernestinum Secondary School in <a href="Bayreuth">Bayreuth</a> in 1904, Kesselring joined the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> as an "<a href="Fahnenjunker">Fahnenjunker</a>" (<a href="officer%20cadet">officer cadet</a>) in the <a href="4th%20Royal%20Bavarian%20Division">2nd Bavarian Foot Artillery Regiment</a>. The regiment was based at <a href="Metz">Metz</a> and was responsible for maintaining <a href="Fortifications%20of%20Metz">its forts</a>. He remained with the regiment until 1915, except for periods at the Military Academy from 1905 to 1906, at the conclusion of which he received his commission as a "<a href="Leutnant">Leutnant</a>" (<a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>), and at the School of Artillery and Engineering in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> from 1909 to 1910.

Kesselring married Luise Anna Pauline (Liny) Keyssler, the daughter of an <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a> from Bayreuth, in 1910. The couple honeymooned in Italy. Their marriage was childless, but in 1913 they adopted Rainer, the son of Albert's second cousin Kurt Kesselring. In 1912, Kesselring completed training as a <a href="Observation%20balloon">balloon</a> observer in a dirigible section – an early sign of an interest in aviation. Kesselring's superiors considered posting him to the School of Artillery and Engineering as an instructor because of his expertise in "the interplay between tactics and technology".

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Kesselring served with his regiment in <a href="Lorraine%20%28region%29">Lorraine</a> until the end of 1914, when he was transferred to the <a href="1st%20Royal%20Bavarian%20Division">1st Bavarian Foot Artillery</a>, which formed part of the <a href="6th%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">Sixth Army</a>. On 19 May 1916, he was promoted to "<a href="Hauptmann">Hauptmann</a>" (<a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a>). In 1916 he was transferred again, to the <a href="6th%20Royal%20Bavarian%20Division">3rd Bavarian Foot Artillery</a>. He distinguished himself in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a>, using his tactical acumen to halt a British advance. For his services on the Western Front, he was decorated with the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> 2nd Class and 1st Class.

In 1917, he was posted to the <a href="General%20Staff">General Staff</a>, despite not having attended the <a href="War%20Academy%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria%29">Bavarian War Academy</a>. He served on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern Front</a> on the staff of the <a href="1st%20Bavarian%20Landwehr%20Division">1st Bavarian "Landwehr" Division</a>. In January 1918, he returned to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> as a staff officer with the II and III Bavarian Corps.

At the conclusion of the war, Kesselring was involved in the demobilisation (as mandated by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>) of III Bavarian Corps in the <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> area. A dispute with the leader of the local "<a href="Freikorps">Freikorps</a>" led to the issuance of an arrest warrant for his alleged involvement in a "<a href="putsch">putsch</a>" against the command of III Bavarian Corps and Kesselring was thrown into prison. He was soon released but his superior, Major Hans Seyler, censured him for having "failed to display the requisite discretion".

From 1919 to 1922, Kesselring served as a <a href="artillery%20battery">battery</a> commander with the 24th Artillery Regiment. He joined the "<a href="Reichswehr">Reichswehr</a>" on 1 October 1922 and was posted to the Military Training Department at the "Reichswehr" Ministry in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. He remained at this post until 1929, when he returned to Bavaria as commander of <a href="Military%20district%20%28Germany%29">Wehrkreis</a> VII in Munich. In his time with the "Reichswehr" Ministry, Kesselring was involved in the organisation of the army, trimming staff overheads to produce the best possible army with the limited resources available. He helped reorganise the Ordnance Department, laying the groundwork for the <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> efforts that would produce new weapons. He was involved in secret military manoeuvres held in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1924 and in the so-called Great Plan for a 102-division army, which was prepared in 1923 and 1924. After another brief stint at the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Reichswehr">Ministry of the Reichswehr</a>, Kesselring was promoted to "<a href="Oberstleutnant">Oberstleutnant</a>" (<a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a>) in 1930 and spent two years in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> with the 4th Artillery Regiment.

Against his wishes, Kesselring was discharged from the army on 1 October 1933 and appointed head of the Department of Administration at the Reich Commissariat for Aviation ("Reichskommissariat für die Luftfahrt"), the forerunner of the <a href="Reich%20Air%20Ministry">Reich Air Ministry</a> ("Reichsluftfahrtministerium"), with the rank of "<a href="Oberst">Oberst</a>" (<a href="colonel">colonel</a>). Since the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany from establishing an air force, this was nominally a civilian agency. The "Luftwaffe" would formally be established on 26 February 1935. As chief of administration, he had to assemble his new staff from scratch. He was involved in the re-establishment of the aviation industry and the construction of secret factories, forging alliances with industrialists and aviation engineers. He was promoted to "<a href="Generalmajor">Generalmajor</a>" (<a href="major%20general">major general</a>) in 1934 and "<a href="Generalleutnant">Generalleutnant</a>" (<a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant general</a>) in 1936. Like other generals of Nazi Germany, he received <a href="Bribery%20of%20senior%20Wehrmacht%20officers">personal monthly payments</a> from <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>; in Kesselring's case, <a href="German%20Reichsmark">RM</a> 6,000, a considerable sum at the time.
At the age of 48, he learned to fly. Kesselring believed that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial to being able to command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. 

Following the death of "Generalleutnant" <a href="Walther%20Wever%20%28General%29">Walther Wever</a> in an air crash, Kesselring became Chief of Staff of the "Luftwaffe" on 3 June 1936. In that post, Kesselring oversaw the <a href="German%20re-armament">expansion of the "Luftwaffe"</a>, the acquisition of new aircraft types such as the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a> and <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a>, and the development of <a href="Fallschirmj%C3%A4ger%20%28World%20War%20II%29">paratroops</a>.

Like many ex-Army officers, he tended to see air power in the <a href="Tactical%20bombing">tactical</a> role, providing support to land operations. In the historiography of the Luftwaffe Kesselring and <a href="Hans-J%C3%BCrgen%20Stumpff">Hans-Jürgen Stumpff</a> are usually blamed for neglecting <a href="strategic%20bombing">strategic bombing</a> while over-focusing on <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> for the army. However the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were actually <a href="Hugo%20Sperrle">Hugo Sperrle</a> and <a href="Hans%20Jeschonnek">Hans Jeschonnek</a>. The two men were long-time professional airmen involved in German air services since their early careers. The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations due to demands from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel like Kesselring. <a href="Interdiction">Interdiction</a> and close air support were operations that suited the Luftwaffe's pre-existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns. Moreover, many in the Luftwaffe command believed <a href="medium%20bomber">medium bomber</a>s to be sufficient in power for use in strategic bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; Britain and France.

Kesselring's main operational task during this time was the support of the <a href="Condor%20Legion">Condor Legion</a> in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. However, his tenure was marred by personal and professional conflicts with his superior, "General der Flieger" <a href="Erhard%20Milch">Erhard Milch</a>, and Kesselring asked to be relieved. The head of the "Luftwaffe", <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a>, acquiesced and Kesselring became the commander of Air District III in Dresden. On 1 October 1938, he was promoted to "<a href="General%20der%20Flieger">General der Flieger</a>" (air <a href="general">general</a>) and became commander of "<a href="Luftflotte%201">Luftflotte 1</a>", based in Berlin.

In the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">Polish campaign</a> that began <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Kesselring's "Luftflotte 1" operated in support of <a href="Army%20Group%20North">Army Group North</a>, commanded by "<a href="Colonel%20General%23Germany">Generaloberst</a>" <a href="Fedor%20von%20Bock">Fedor von Bock</a>. Although not under von Bock's command, Kesselring worked closely with Bock and considered himself under Bock's orders in all matters pertaining to the ground war. Kesselring strove to provide the best possible close air support to the ground forces and used the flexibility of air power to concentrate all available air strength at critical points, such as during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bzura">Battle of the Bzura</a>. He attempted to cut the Polish communications by making a series of air attacks against <a href="Bombing%20of%20Warsaw%20in%20World%20War%20II">Warsaw</a>, but found that even bombs could not ensure that bridges would be destroyed.

Kesselring was himself shot down over <a href="Poland">Poland</a> by the <a href="Polish%20Air%20Force">Polish Air Force</a>. In all, he would be shot down five times during World War II. For his part in the Polish campaign, Kesselring was personally awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> by Adolf Hitler.

Kesselring's "Luftflotte 1" was not involved in the preparations for the campaigns in the west. Instead it remained in the east on garrison duty, establishing new airbases and an <a href="Air%20Raid%20Precautions">Air Raid Precautions</a> network in <a href="General%20Government">occupied Poland</a>. However, after the <a href="Mechelen%20Incident">Mechelen Incident</a>, in which an aircraft made a forced landing in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> with copies of the German invasion plan, Göring relieved the commander of "<a href="Luftflotte%202">Luftflotte 2</a>", "General der Flieger" <a href="Hellmuth%20Felmy">Hellmuth Felmy</a>, of his command, and appointed Kesselring in his place. Kesselring flew to his new headquarters at <a href="M%C3%BCnster">Münster</a> the very next day, 13 January 1940. As Felmy's chief of staff, "Generalmajor" <a href="Josef%20Kammhuber">Josef Kammhuber</a>, had also been relieved, Kesselring brought his own chief of staff, "Generalmajor" Wilhelm Speidel, with him.

Arriving in the west, Kesselring found "Luftflotte 2" operating in support of von Bock's <a href="Army%20Group%20B">Army Group B</a>. He inherited from Felmy a complex air plan requiring on-the-minute timing for several hours, incorporating an <a href="Airborne%20forces">airborne operation</a> around <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> and <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> to seize airfields and bridges in the "fortress Holland" area. The paratroopers were "General der Flieger" <a href="Kurt%20Student">Kurt Student</a>'s airborne forces that depended on a quick link up with the mechanised forces. To facilitate this, Kesselring promised von Bock the fullest possible <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a>. Air and ground operations, however, were to commence simultaneously, so there would be no time to suppress the defending <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Air%20Force">Royal Netherlands Air Force</a>.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Battle of the Netherlands</a> commenced on 10 May 1940. While initial air operations went well, and the German fighters and bombers soon gained the upper hand against the small Dutch air force, the paratroopers ran into fierce opposition in the <a href="Battle%20for%20The%20Hague">Battle for The Hague</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rotterdam">Battle of Rotterdam</a>. On 14 May 1940, responding to a call for assistance from Student, Kesselring ordered the <a href="Rotterdam%20Blitz">bombing of Rotterdam</a> city centre. Fires raged out of control, destroying much of the city.

After the surrender of the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> on 14 May 1940, "Luftflotte 2" attempted to move forward to new airfields <a href="Battle%20of%20Belgium">in Belgium</a> while still providing support for the fast moving ground troops. The <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a> was going well, with "<a href="General%20der%20Panzertruppe">General der Panzertruppe</a>" <a href="Heinz%20Guderian">Heinz Guderian</a> forcing a crossing of the <a href="River%20Meuse">River Meuse</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sedan%20%281940%29">Sedan</a> on 13 May 1940. To support the breakthrough, Kesselring transferred "Generalleutnant" <a href="Wolfram%20von%20Richthofen">Wolfram von Richthofen</a>'s <a href="8th%20Air%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">VIII. "Fliegerkorps"</a> to "<a href="Luftflotte%203">Luftflotte 3</a>". By 24 May, the Allied forces had been cut in two, and the German Army was only from <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a>, the last channel port remaining in Allied hands. However, that day "Generaloberst" <a href="Gerd%20von%20Rundstedt">Gerd von Rundstedt</a> ordered a halt. In his memoirs, Kesselring described that decision as a "fatal error". It left the burden of preventing the Allied <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">evacuation of Dunkirk</a> to the air force, hampered by poor flying weather and staunch opposition from the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. For his role in the campaign in the west, Kesselring was promoted to "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" (<a href="field%20marshal">field marshal</a>) during the <a href="1940%20Field%20Marshal%20Ceremony">1940 Field Marshal Ceremony</a>.

Following the campaign in France, Kesselring's "Luftflotte 2" was committed to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>. "Luftflotte 2" was initially responsible for the bombing of southeastern England and the <a href="London">London</a> area but as the battle progressed, command responsibility shifted, with "Generalfeldmarschall" Hugo Sperrle's "Luftflotte 3" taking more responsibility for the night-time "Blitz" attacks while "Luftflotte 2" conducted the main daylight operations. Kesselring was involved in the planning of numerous raids, including the <a href="Coventry%20Blitz">Coventry Blitz</a> of November 1940.

Although earmarked for operations against the Soviet Union, "Luftflotte 2" remained in the west until May 1941. This was partly as a deception measure, and partly because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready in time for the actual commencement of <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation "Barbarossa"</a> on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at <a href="Bielany">Bielany</a>, a suburb of <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>.

"Luftflotte 2" operated in support of <a href="Army%20Group%20Centre">Army Group Centre</a>, commanded by Fedor von Bock, continuing the close working relationship between the two. Kesselring's mission was to gain <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a>, and if possible <a href="air%20supremacy">air supremacy</a>, as soon as possible while still supporting ground operations. For this he had a fleet of over 1,000 aircraft, about a third of the "Luftwaffe"'s total strength.

The German attack caught large numbers of <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a> aircraft on the ground. Faulty tactics – sending unescorted bombers against the Germans at regular intervals in tactically unsound formations – accounted for many more. Kesselring reported that in the first week of operations "Luftflotte 2" had accounted for 2,500 Soviet aircraft in the air and on the ground. Even Göring found these figures hard to believe and ordered them to be re-checked. As the ground troops advanced, the figures could be directly confirmed and were found to be too low. Within days, Kesselring was able to fly solo over the front in his <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20189">Focke-Wulf Fw 189</a>.

With air supremacy attained, "Luftflotte 2" turned to support of ground operations, particularly guarding the flanks of the armoured spearheads, without which the rapid advance was not possible. When enemy counterattacks threatened, Kesselring threw the full weight of his force against them. Now that the Army was convinced of the value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring now had to convince the Army that air support should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel <a href="Martin%20Fiebig">Martin Fiebig</a> as a special close air support commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.

In late 1941, "Luftflotte 2" supported the final German offensive against <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, codenamed <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow">Operation Typhoon</a>. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous, as Moscow had good all-weather airfields and opposition from both fighters and <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> guns was similar to that encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered ground operations from October on impeded air operations even more. Nonetheless, "Luftflotte 2" continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, close air support and air supply missions.

In November 1941, Kesselring was appointed <a href="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> South and was transferred to Italy along with his "Luftflotte 2" staff, which for the time being also functioned as his Commander-in-Chief South staff. Only in January 1943 did he form his headquarters into a true theatre staff and create a separate staff to control "Luftflotte 2". As a theatre commander, he was answerable directly to the "<a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</a>" (OKW) and commanded ground, naval and air forces, but this was of little importance at first as most German units were under Italian operational control.

Kesselring strove to organise and protect supply convoys in order to get the German-Italian "Panzer" Army the resources it needed. He succeeded in establishing local air superiority and <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%281940%29">neutralising Malta</a>, which provided a base from which British aircraft and submarines could interdict Axis convoys headed for North Africa. Without the vital supplies they carried, particularly fuel, the Axis forces in North Africa could not conduct operations. Through various expedients, Kesselring managed to deliver an increased flow of supplies to "Generaloberst" <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>'s "<a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>" in Libya. With his forces thus strengthened, Rommel prepared an attack on the British positions around <a href="Gazala">Gazala</a>, while Kesselring planned <a href="Operation%20Herkules">Operation Herkules</a>, an airborne and seaborne attack on Malta with the <a href="185%20Airborne%20Division%20Folgore">185 Airborne Division Folgore</a> and <a href="Ramcke%20Parachute%20Brigade">Ramcke Parachute Brigade</a>. Kesselring hoped to thereby secure the Axis <a href="line%20of%20communication">line of communication</a> with North Africa.

For the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">Battle of Gazala</a>, Rommel divided his command in two, taking personal command of the mobile units of the "<a href="Deutsches%20Afrika%20Korps">Deutsches Afrika Korps</a>" and <a href="Italian%20XX%20Motorized%20Corps">Italian XX Motorized Corps</a>, which he led around the southern flank of <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Neil%20Ritchie">Neil Ritchie</a>'s <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Eighth Army</a>. Rommel left the infantry of the Italian X and XXI Corps under "General der Panzertruppe" <a href="Ludwig%20Cr%C3%BCwell">Ludwig Crüwell</a> to hold the rest of the Eighth Army in place. This command arrangement went awry on 29 May 1942 when Crüwell was taken prisoner. Lacking an available commander of sufficient seniority, Kesselring assumed personal command of "Gruppe Crüwell". Flying his <a href="Fieseler%20Fi%20156">Fieseler Fi 156</a> Storch to a meeting, Kesselring was fired upon by a British force astride Rommel's line of communications. Kesselring called in an air strike by every available "Stuka" and <a href="Ground%20attack%20aircraft">"Jabo"</a>. His attack was successful; the British force suffered heavy losses and was forced to pull back.

Kesselring and Rommel had a disagreement over the latter's conduct in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bir%20Hakeim">Battle of Bir Hakeim</a>. Rommel's initial infantry assaults had failed to capture this vital position, the southern pivot of the British Gazala Line, which was held by the <a href="1st%20Free%20French%20Division">1st Free French brigade</a>, commanded by <a href="Marie%20Pierre%20Koenig">General Marie Pierre Koenig</a>. Rommel had called for air support but had failed to break the position, which Kesselring attributed to faulty coordination between the ground and air attacks. Bir Hakeim was evacuated on 10 June 1942. Kesselring was more impressed with the results of Rommel's successful <a href="Operation%20Compass%23Capture%20of%20Tobruk">assault on Tobruk</a> on 21 June, for which Kesselring brought in additional aircraft from Greece and Crete. For his part in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves and swords.

In the wake of the victory at Tobruk, Rommel persuaded Hitler to authorise an attack on Egypt instead of Malta, over Kesselring's objections. The parachute troops assembled for Operation "Herkules" were sent to Rommel. Things went well at first, with Rommel winning the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein%23Battle%20of%20Mersa%20Matruh">Battle of Mersa Matruh</a>, but just as Kesselring had warned, the logistical difficulties mounted and the result was the disastrous <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">First Battle of El Alamein</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20el%20Halfa">Battle of Alam el Halfa</a> and <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>. Kesselring considered Rommel to be a great general leading fast-moving troops at the corps level of command, but felt that he was too moody and changeable for higher command. For Kesselring, Rommel's nervous breakdown and hospitalisation for depression at the end of the African Campaign only confirmed this.

Kesselring was briefly considered as a possible successor to "Generalfeldmarschall" <a href="Wilhelm%20Keitel">Wilhelm Keitel</a> as Chief of Staff of the OKW in September 1942, with "General der Panzertruppe" <a href="Friedrich%20Paulus">Friedrich Paulus</a> replacing "Generaloberst" <a href="Alfred%20Jodl">Alfred Jodl</a> as Chief of the Operations Staff at OKW. The consideration demonstrated the high regard in which Kesselring was held by Hitler. Nevertheless, Hitler decided that neither Kesselring nor Paulus could be spared from their current posts. In October 1942, Kesselring was given direct command of all German armed forces in the theatre except Rommel's <a href="Panzer%20Army%20Africa">German-Italian "Panzer" Army</a> in North Africa, including "General der Infantrie" <a href="Enno%20von%20Rintelen">Enno von Rintelen</a>, the German liaison officer at "Commando Supremo", who spoke fluent Italian. Kesselring's command also included the troops in Greece and the Balkans until the end of the year, when Hitler created an army group headquarters under "Generalfeldmarschall" <a href="Wilhelm%20List">Wilhelm List</a>, naming him "List Oberbefehlshaber Südost".

<a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation "Torch"</a>, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, precipitated a crisis in Kesselring's command. He ordered <a href="Walther%20Nehring">Walther Nehring</a>, the former commander of the "Afrika Korps" who was returning to action after recovering from wounds received at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, to proceed to Tunisia to take command of a new corps (XC Corps). Kesselring ordered Nehring to establish a bridgehead in Tunisia and then to press west as far as possible so as to gain freedom to manoeuvre. By December, the Allied commander, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, was forced to concede that Kesselring had won the race; the final phase of "Torch" had failed and the Axis could only be ejected from Tunisia after a prolonged struggle.

With the initiative back with the Germans and Italians, Kesselring hoped to launch an offensive that would drive the Allies out of North Africa. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Kasserine%20Pass">Battle of the Kasserine Pass</a> his forces gave the Allies a beating, but in the end strong Allied resistance and a string of Axis errors stopped the advance. Kesselring now concentrated on shoring up his forces by moving the required tonnages of supplies from <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> but his efforts were frustrated by Allied aircraft and submarines. An <a href="Operation%20Vulcan">Allied offensive in April</a> finally broke through, leading to a collapse of the Axis position in Tunisia. Some 275,000 German and Italian prisoners were taken. In return, Kesselring had, however, held up the Allies in Tunisia for six months, forcing a postponement of the Allied invasion of Northern France from the middle of 1943 to the middle of 1944.

Kesselring expected that the Allies would next invade Sicily, as a landing could be made there under fighter cover from Tunisia and Malta. He reinforced the six coastal and four mobile Italian divisions there with two mobile German divisions, the <a href="33rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">15th "Panzergrenadier" Division</a> and the <a href="Fallschirm-Panzer%20Division%201%20Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">"Hermann Göring Panzer" Division</a>, both rebuilt after being destroyed in Tunisia. Kesselring was well aware that while this force was large enough to stop the Allies from simply marching in, it could not withstand a large scale invasion. He therefore pinned his hopes on repelling the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a> on an immediate counterattack, which he ordered Colonel <a href="Paul%20Conrath">Paul Conrath</a> of the "Hermann Göring Panzer" Division to carry out the moment the objective of the Allied invasion fleet was known, with or without orders from the island commander, "Generale d'Armata" <a href="Alfredo%20Guzzoni">Alfredo Guzzoni</a>.

Kesselring hoped that the Allied invasion fleet would provide good targets for <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s, but they had few successes. sank two American <a href="Landing%20Ship%2C%20Tank">LSTs</a> and with sank three vessels from a British convoy on 4–5 July, while sank a <a href="Liberty%20ship">Liberty ship</a> and a <a href="Tank%20ship">tanker</a> on 10 July. Pressure from the Allied air forces forced "Luftflotte 2", commanded since June by von Richthofen, to withdraw most of its aircraft to the mainland.

The Allied invasion of Sicily on 10 July 1943 was stubbornly opposed. A "<a href="Stuka">Stuka</a>" attacked and sank the ; a <a href="Bf%20109">Bf 109</a> destroyed an LST; and a Liberty ship filled with ammunition was bombed by <a href="Ju%2088">Ju 88</a>s and caught fire, later exploding without loss of life. Unaware that Guzzoni had already ordered a major counterattack on 11 July, Kesselring bypassed the chain of command to order the "Hermann Göring Panzer" Division to attack that day in the hope that a vigorous attack could succeed before the Americans could bring the bulk of their artillery and armoured support ashore. Although his troops gave the Americans "quite a battering", they failed to capture the Allied position.

Kesselring flew to Sicily himself on 12 July to survey the situation and decided that no more than a delaying action was possible and that the island would eventually have to be evacuated. Nonetheless, he intended to fight on and he reinforced Sicily with the <a href="29th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">29th "Panzergrenadier" Division</a> on 15 July. Kesselring returned to Sicily by <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a> on 16 July to give the senior German commander, "General der Panzertruppe" <a href="Hans-Valentin%20Hube">Hans-Valentin Hube</a>, his instructions. Unable to provide much more in the way of air support, Kesselring gave Hube command of the heavy <a href="flak">flak</a> units on the island, although this was contrary to "Luftwaffe" doctrine. In all, Kesselring managed to delay the Allies in Sicily for another month and the Allied conquest of the Sicily was not complete until 17 August.

Kesselring's evacuation of Sicily, which began a week earlier on 10 August, was perhaps the most brilliant action of the campaign. In spite of the Allies' superiority on land, at sea, and in the air, Kesselring was able to evacuate not only 40,000 men, but also 96,605 vehicles, 94 guns, 47 tanks, 1,100 tons of ammunition, 970 tons of fuel, and 15,000 tons of stores. He was able to achieve near-perfect coordination among the three services under his command while his opponent, Eisenhower, could not.

With the fall of Sicily, OKW feared that Italy would withdraw from the war, but Kesselring remained confident that the Italians would continue to fight. OKW regarded Kesselring and von Rintelen as too pro-Italian and began to bypass him, sending Rommel to northern Italy, and Student to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, where his I Parachute Corps was under OKW orders to occupy the capital in case of Italian defection. <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> was <a href="25%20Luglio">removed from power</a> on 25 July 1943 and Rommel and OKW began to plan for the occupation of Italy and the disarmament of the Italian Army. Kesselring remained uninformed of these plans for the time being.
On the advice of Rommel and Jodl, Hitler decided that the <a href="Italian%20Peninsula">Italian Peninsula</a> could not be held without the assistance of the Italian Army. Kesselring was ordered to withdraw from southern Italy and consolidate his Army Group C with Rommel's Army Group B in Northern Italy, where Rommel would assume overall command. Kesselring was slated to be posted to <a href="Norway">Norway</a>. Kesselring was appalled at the prospect of abandoning Italy. It would expose southern Germany to bombers operating from Italy; risk the Allies breaking into the Po Valley; and was completely unnecessary, as he was certain that Rome could be held until the summer of 1944. This assessment was based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of their air cover, which could only reach as far as <a href="Salerno">Salerno</a>. Kesselring submitted his resignation on 14 August 1943.

<a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> "<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">Obergruppenführer</a>" <a href="Karl%20Wolff">Karl Wolff</a>, the highest SS and police "<a href="F%C3%BChrer">Führer</a>" in Italy, intervened on Kesselring's behalf with Hitler. Wolff painted Rommel as "politically unreliable" and argued that Kesselring's presence in southern Italy was vital to prevent an early Italian defection. On Wolff's advice, Hitler refused to accept Kesselring's resignation.

Italy withdrew from the war on 8 September. Kesselring immediately moved to secure Rome, where he expected an Allied airborne and seaborne invasion. He ordered the <a href="3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">3rd "Panzergrenadier" Division</a> and <a href="2nd%20Parachute%20Division%20%28Germany%29">2nd Parachute Division</a> to close on the city, while a detachment made an unsuccessful attempt to seize the Italian Army staff at <a href="Monterotondo">Monterotondo</a> in a "<a href="coup%20de%20main">coup de main</a>". Kesselring's two divisions were faced by five Italian divisions, two of them armoured, but he managed to overcome the opposition, disperse the Italian forces and secure the city in two days.

All over Italy, the Germans <a href="Operation%20Achse">swiftly disarmed</a> Italian units. Rommel deported Italian soldiers, except for those willing to serve in German units, to Germany for forced labour, whereas Italian units in Kesselring's area were initially disbanded and their men permitted to go home. One Italian commander, General Gonzaga, refused German demands that his 222nd Coastal Division disarm, and was promptly shot. A significant part of the <a href="184%20Airborne%20Division%20Nembo">184 Airborne Division Nembo</a> went over to the German side, eventually becoming the basis of the <a href="4th%20Parachute%20Division%20%28Germany%29">4th Parachute Division</a>. On the Greek island of <a href="Kefalonia">Kefalonia</a> – outside Kesselring's command – some 5,000 Italian troops of the <a href="33%20Mountain%20Infantry%20Division%20Acqui">33 Mountain Infantry Division Acqui</a> were <a href="Massacre%20of%20the%20Acqui%20Division">massacred</a>. Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in Operation "Oak" ("<a href="Unternehmen%20Eiche">Unternehmen Eiche</a>"), a raid planned by Kurt Student and carried out by "<a href="Obersturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmbannführer</a>" <a href="Otto%20Skorzeny">Otto Skorzeny</a> on 12 September. The details of the operation were deliberately, though unsuccessfully, kept from Kesselring. "Kesselring is too honest for those born traitors down there" was Hitler's assessment.

Italy now effectively became an occupied country, as the Germans poured in troops. Italy's decision to switch sides created contempt for the Italians among both the Allies and Germans, which was to have far-reaching consequences.

Although his command was already "written off", Kesselring intended to fight. At the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy">Battle of Salerno</a> in September 1943, he launched a full-scale counterattack against the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20North">U.S. Fifth Army</a> landings there with "<a href="Generaloberst">Generaloberst</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Vietinghoff">Heinrich von Vietinghoff</a>'s <a href="10th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">Tenth Army</a>. The counterattack inflicted heavy casualties on the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied forces</a>, forced them back in several areas, and, for a time, made Allied commanders contemplate evacuation. The short distance from German airfields allowed "Luftflotte 2" to put 120 aircraft over the Salerno area on 11 September 1943. Using <a href="Fritz%20X">Fritz X</a> <a href="anti-ship%20missile">anti-ship missile</a>s, hits were scored on the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> and <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and , while a Liberty ship was sunk on 14 September and another damaged the next day. The offensive ultimately failed to throw the Allies back into the sea because of the intervention of Allied <a href="naval%20gunfire">naval gunfire</a> which decimated the advancing German units, stubborn Allied resistance and the advance of the British Eighth Army. On 17 September 1943, Kesselring gave Vietinghoff permission to break off the attack and withdraw.

Kesselring had been defeated but gained precious time. Already, in defiance of his orders, he was preparing a series of successive fallback positions on the <a href="Volturno%20Line">Volturno Line</a>, the <a href="Barbara%20Line">Barbara Line</a> and the <a href="Bernhardt%20Line">Bernhardt Line</a>. Only in November 1943, after a month of hard fighting, did the Allies reach Kesselring's main position, the <a href="Winter%20Line">Gustav Line</a>. According to his memoirs, Kesselring felt that much more could have been accomplished if he had had access to the troops held "uselessly" under Rommel's command.

In November 1943, Kesselring met with Hitler. Kesselring gave an optimistic assessment of the situation in Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Winter Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies reaching the <a href="Apennine%20Mountains">Northern Apennines</a> for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the <a href="Atlantic%20Wall">Atlantic Wall</a> and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of <a href="Army%20Group%20C">Army Group C</a>, a ground command. "I had always blamed Kesselring", Hitler later explained, "for looking at things too optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, and I have been justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, whom I have seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, and it is my opinion that military leadership without optimism is not possible."

The "Luftwaffe" scored a notable success on the night of 2 December 1943 when 105 Ju 88 bombers <a href="Air%20Raid%20on%20Bari">struck the port of Bari</a>. Skilfully using <a href="Chaff%20%28radar%20countermeasure%29">chaff</a> to confuse the Allied <a href="radar">radar</a> operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most destructive air raid on Allied shipping since the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. Burning oil and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port was put out of action for three weeks. Moreover, one of the ships sunk, <a href="SS%20John%20Harvey">SS "John Harvey"</a>, had been carrying <a href="mustard%20gas">mustard gas</a>, which enveloped the port in a cloud of poisonous vapours.

The first Allied attempt to break through the Gustav Line in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monte%20Cassino">Battle of Monte Cassino</a> in January 1944 met with early success, with the <a href="X%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British X Corps</a> breaking through the line held by the <a href="94th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">94th Infantry Division</a> and imperilling the entire Tenth Army front. At the same time, Kesselring was receiving warnings of an imminent Allied <a href="Amphibious%20warfare">amphibious</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Anzio">attack at Anzio</a>. Kesselring rushed his reserves, the 29th and <a href="90th%20Light%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">90th "Panzergrenadier" Divisions</a>, to the Cassino front. They were able to stabilise the German position there but left Rome poorly guarded.

Kesselring felt that he had been out-generalled when the Allies landed at Anzio.
Although taken by surprise, Kesselring moved rapidly to regain control of the situation, summoning "Generaloberst" <a href="Eberhard%20von%20Mackensen">Eberhard von Mackensen</a>'s <a href="14th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">Fourteenth Army</a> headquarters from northern Italy, the 29th and 90th "Panzergrenadier" Divisions from the Cassino front, and the <a href="23rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">26th "Panzer" Division</a> from Tenth Army. OKW chipped in some divisions from other theatres. By February, Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio but his forces were unable to crush the Allied <a href="beachhead">beachhead</a>, for which Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and von Mackensen for avoidable errors.

Meanwhile, costly fighting at <a href="Monte%20Cassino">Monte Cassino</a> in February 1944, brought the Allies close to a breakthrough into the <a href="Liri%20Valley">Liri Valley</a>. To hold the bastion of Monte Cassino, Kesselring brought in the <a href="1st%20Parachute%20Division%20%28Germany%29">1st Parachute Division</a>, an "exceptionally well trained and conditioned" formation, on 26 February. Despite heavy casualties and the expenditure of enormous quantities of ammunition, an Allied offensive in March 1944 failed to break the Gustav Line position.

On 11 May 1944 <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Sir Harold Alexander</a>, commanding the <a href="Allied%20Armies%20in%20Italy">Allied Armies in Italy</a>, launched <a href="Operation%20Diadem">Operation "Diadem"</a>, which finally broke through the Gustav Line and forced the Tenth Army to withdraw. In the process, a gap opened up between the Tenth and Fourteenth Armies, threatening both with encirclement. For this failure, Kesselring relieved von Mackensen of his command, replacing him with "General der Panzertruppe" <a href="Joachim%20Lemelsen">Joachim Lemelsen</a>. Fortunately for the Germans, <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark W. Clark</a>, commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, obsessed with the capture of Rome, failed to take advantage of the situation and the Tenth Army was able to withdraw to the next line of defence, the <a href="Trasimene%20Line">Trasimene Line</a>, where it was able to link up with the Fourteenth Army and then conduct a fighting withdrawal.

For his part in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves, swords and diamonds by Hitler at the <a href="Wolfsschanze">Wolfsschanze</a> near <a href="Rastenburg">Rastenburg</a>, <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a> on 19 July 1944. The next day, Hitler was the target of the <a href="20%20July%20plot">20 July plot</a>. Informed of this event that evening by Göring, Kesselring, like many other senior commanders, sent a telegram to Hitler reaffirming his loyalty.

Throughout July and August 1944, Kesselring fought a stubborn delaying action, gradually retreating to the formidable <a href="Gothic%20Line">Gothic Line</a> north of <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. There, he was finally able to halt the Allied advance. Casualties of the Gothic Line battles in September and October 1944 included Kesselring himself. On 25 October 1944, his car collided with an artillery piece coming out of a side road. Kesselring suffered serious head and facial injuries and did not return to his command until January 1945.

Kesselring, during the campaign, as far as he was able, attempted to avoid the destruction of many artistically important Italian cities, including Rome, Florence, <a href="Siena">Siena</a> and <a href="Orvieto">Orvieto</a>. In some cases, historic bridges – such as the <a href="Ponte%20Vecchio">Ponte Vecchio</a> (literally "Old Bridge") – were <a href="booby%20trap">booby trap</a>ped rather than blown up. However, other historic Florentine bridges were destroyed on his orders and, in addition to booby-trapping the old bridge, he ordered the demolition of the ancient historical central borough at its two ends, in order to delay the Allied advance across the <a href="River%20Arno">River Arno</a>. Kesselring supported the Italian declaration of Rome, Florence and <a href="Chieti">Chieti</a> as <a href="open%20city">open cities</a>. In the case of Rome, this was in spite of there being considerable tactical advantages to be had from defending the <a href="Tiber">Tiber</a> bridges. These declarations were never agreed to by the Allies as the cities were not demilitarised and remained centres of government and industry. Despite the repeated declarations of "open city", Rome was bombed more than fifty times by the Allies, whose air forces hit Florence as well. In practice, the open city status was rendered meaningless.

Kesselring tried to preserve the monastery of Monte Cassino by avoiding its military occupation even though it offered a superb observing point over the battlefield. Ultimately this was unsuccessful, as the Allies believed the monastery would be used to direct the German artillery against their lines. On the morning of 15 February 1944, 142 <a href="B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a>, 47 <a href="B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> and 40 <a href="B-26%20Marauder">B-26 Marauder</a> medium bombers deliberately dropped 1,150 tons of high explosives and incendiary bombs on the abbey, reducing the historic monastery to a smoking mass of rubble. Kesselring was aware that some artworks taken from Monte Cassino for safekeeping wound up in the possession of Hermann Göring. Kesselring had some German soldiers shot for looting. German authorities avoided giving the Italian authorities control over artworks because they feared that "entire collections would be sold to Switzerland". A 1945 Allied investigation reported that Italian cultural treasures had suffered relatively little war damage. Kesselring received regular updates on efforts to preserve cultural treasures and his personal interest in the matter contributed to the high proportion of art treasures that were saved.

On 22–23 March 1944, a 15-man American <a href="Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services">Office of Strategic Services</a> (OSS) Operational Group landed in <a href="inflatable%20boat">inflatable boat</a>s from <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> <a href="PT%20boats">PT boats</a> on the <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a>n coast as part of <a href="Operations%20Ginny%20I%20and%20II">Operation Ginny II</a>, a mission to blow up the entrances of two vital railway tunnels. Their boats were discovered and they were captured by a smaller group of Italian and German soldiers. On 26 March, they were executed under Hitler's "<a href="Commando%20Order">Commando Order</a>", issued after German soldiers had been shackled during the <a href="Dieppe%20Raid">Dieppe Raid</a>.

In Rome on 23 March 1944, 33 policemen of the <a href="SS%20Police%20Regiment%20Bozen">SS Police Regiment Bozen</a> from the <a href="German%20language">German</a>-speaking population of the Italian province of <a href="South%20Tyrol">South Tyrol</a> and three Italian civilians were killed by a bomb blast and the subsequent shooting. In response, Hitler approved the recommendation of von Mackensen, who was responsible for the sector including Rome, that ten Italians should be shot for each policeman killed. The task fell to SS "Obersturmbannführer" <a href="Herbert%20Kappler">Herbert Kappler</a> who, finding there were not enough condemned prisoners available, made up the numbers using Jewish prisoners and even civilians taken from the streets. The result was the <a href="Ardeatine%20massacre">Ardeatine massacre</a>.

The fall of Rome on 4 June 1944 placed Kesselring in a dangerous situation as his forces attempted to withdraw from Rome to the Gothic Line. That the Germans were especially vulnerable to <a href="Italian%20partisans">Italian partisans</a> was not lost on the British General <a href="Harold%20Alexander">Harold Alexander</a>, who appealed in a radio broadcast for Italians to kill Germans "wherever you encounter them". Kesselring responded by authorising the "massive employment of artillery, <a href="Granatwerfer%2042">grenade</a> and <a href="Minenwerfer">mine throwers</a>, <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured cars</a>, <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a>s and other technical combat equipment" against the partisans. On 17 June, he issued a directive, "New Measures for Combating Bandits" (<a href="Bandenbek%C3%A4mpfung">Bandenbekämpfung</a>), in which he blamed "bandits" for the deteriorating situation in Italy and authorised measures of "utmost severity", while extolling his troops to act irrespective of "mistaken" actions they may be responsible for. The order promised indemnity to soldiers who "exceed our normal restraint in the choice of severity of the methods against the partisans". He also authorised construction of transit camps to hold suspected partisans and civilians. Three days later, Kesselring issued a new order authorising reprisals against the civilian population and public executions of captured partisan leaders.

Subsequently, massacres were carried out by the "Hermann Göring Panzer" Division at <a href="Stia">Stia</a> in April, <a href="Civitella%20in%20Val%20di%20Chiana">Civitella in Val di Chiana</a> in June and Bucine in July 1944, by the 26th "Panzer" Division at Padule di <a href="Fucecchio">Fucecchio</a> on 23 August 1944, and by the <a href="16th%20SS%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">16th SS "Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS"</a> at <a href="Sant%27Anna%20di%20Stazzema%20massacre">Sant'Anna di Stazzema</a> in August 1944 and <a href="Marzabotto%20massacre">Marzabotto</a> in September and October 1944.
In August 1944 Kesselring was informed by <a href="Rudolf%20Rahn">Rudolf Rahn</a>, the German ambassador to the <a href="Italian%20Social%20Republic">RSI</a>, that Mussolini had filed protests about the killing of Italian citizens. In response, Kesselring issued another edict to his troops on 21 August, deploring incidents that had "damaged the German "Wehrmacht"'s reputation and discipline and which no longer have anything to do with reprisal operations" and launched investigations into specific cases that Mussolini cited. Between 21 July and 25 September 1944, 624 Germans were killed, 993 wounded and 872 missing in partisan operations, while some 9,520 partisans were killed.

Kesselring used the Jews of Rome as <a href="slave%20labour">slave labour</a> on the construction of fortifications – as he had earlier done with those of Tunis. When ordered to deport the Roman Jews, Kesselring resisted. He announced that no resources were available to carry out such an order. Hitler then transferred responsibility to the SS. About 2,000 Roman Jews were ultimately deported between October 1943 and June 1944, half of them on 16 October 1943. During the German occupation of Italy, the Germans were believed to have killed some 46,000 Italian civilians, including 7,000 Jews.

After he recovered from the car accident, Kesselring was summoned by Hitler to relieve "Generalfeldmarschall" Gerd von Rundstedt as <a href="OB%20West">OB West</a> on 10 March 1945, following the disastrous loss of the intact <a href="Ludendorff%20Bridge">Ludendorff Bridge</a> over the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Remagen">Battle of Remagen</a>. On arrival, he told his new staff, "Well, gentlemen, I am the new V-3", referring to the <a href="Vergeltungswaffe">Vergeltungswaffe</a> ("vengeance" weapons). Given the desperate situation of the Western Front, this was another sign of Kesselring's proverbial optimism. Kesselring still described as "lucid" Hitler's analysis of the situation, according to which the Germans were about to inflict a historical defeat upon the Soviets, after which the victorious German armies would be brought west to crush the Allies and sweep them from the continent. Therefore, Kesselring was determined to "hang on" in the west until the "decision in the East" came.

Kesselring endorsed Hitler's order that deserters should be hanged from the nearest tree. When a staff officer sought to make him aware of the hopelessness of the situation, Kesselring told him that he had driven through the entire army rear area and not seen a single hanged man.

The Western Front at this time generally followed the <a href="River%20Rhine">River Rhine</a> with two important exceptions: the American bridgehead over the Rhine at <a href="Remagen">Remagen</a>, and a large German <a href="Salients%2C%20re-entrants%20and%20pockets">salient</a> west of the Rhine, the <a href="Saarland">Saar</a>–<a href="Palatinate%20%28region%29">Palatinate</a> triangle. Consideration was given to evacuating the triangle, but OKW ordered it held. When Kesselring paid his first visit to the German <a href="1st%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">First</a> and <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">Seventh</a> Army headquarters there on 13 March 1945, the army group commander, "<a href="SS-Oberst-Gruppenf%C3%BChrer">Oberst-gruppenführer</a>" <a href="Paul%20Hausser">Paul Hausser</a>, and the two army commanders all affirmed the defence of the triangle could only result in heavy losses or complete annihilation of their commands. "General der Infanterie" <a href="Hans%20Felber">Hans Felber</a> of the Seventh Army considered the latter the most likely outcome. Nonetheless, Kesselring insisted that the positions had to be held.

The triangle was already under attack from two sides by Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Patton">George Patton</a>'s <a href="Third%20United%20States%20Army">Third Army</a> and Lieutenant General <a href="Alexander%20Patch">Alexander Patch</a>'s <a href="Seventh%20United%20States%20Army">Seventh Army</a>. The German position soon crumbled and Hitler reluctantly sanctioned a withdrawal. The First and Seventh Armies suffered heavy losses: around 113,000 Germans casualties at the cost of 17,000 on the Allied side. Nonetheless, they had avoided encirclement and managed to conduct a skilful delaying action, evacuating the last troops to the east bank of the Rhine on 25 March 1945.

As Germany was cut in two, Kesselring's command was enlarged to include Army Groups Centre, <a href="Army%20Group%20South">South</a> and South-East on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>, and Army Group C in Italy, as well as his own <a href="Army%20Group%20G">Army Group G</a> and <a href="Army%20Group%20Oberrhein%20%28Germany%29">Army Group Upper Rhine</a>. On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in Berlin. On 1 May, <a href="Karl%20D%C3%B6nitz">Karl Dönitz</a> was designated German President ("<a href="Reichspr%C3%A4sident">Reichspräsident</a>") and the <a href="Flensburg%20government">Flensburg government</a> was created. One of the new president's first acts was the appointment of Kesselring as Commander-in-Chief of Southern Germany, with plenipotentiary powers.

Meanwhile, Wolff and von Vietinghoff, now commander of Army Group C, had almost concluded a preliminary surrender agreement with the OSS chief in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <a href="Allen%20Dulles">Allen Dulles</a>. Known as <a href="Operation%20Sunrise%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Operation Sunrise</a>, these secret negotiations had been in progress since early March 1945. Kesselring was aware of them, having previously consented to them, although he had not informed his own staff. He did, however, later inform Hitler.

At first he did not accept the agreement and, on 30 April, relieved both Vietinghoff and his Chief of Staff, "Generalleutnant" <a href="Hans%20R%C3%B6ttiger">Hans Röttiger</a>, putting them at the disposition of the OKW for a possible court martial. They were replaced by General <a href="Friedrich%20Schulz">Friedrich Schulz</a> and "Generalmajor" Friedrich Wenzel respectively. The next morning, 1 May, Röttiger reacted by placing both Schulz and Wenzel under arrest, and summoning Lemelsen to take Schulz's place. Lemelsen initially refused, as he was in possession of a written order from Kesselring which prohibited any talks with the enemy without his explicit authorization. By this time, Vietinghoff and Wolff had concluded an armistice with the Allied Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Theatre, <a href="Field%20Marshal%20%28UK%29">Field Marshal</a> Alexander, which became effective on 2 May at 14:00. Lemelsen reached <a href="Bolzano">Bolzano</a>, and Schulz and Wenzel regained control, this time agreeing with the officers pushing for a quick surrender. The German armies in Italy were now utterly defeated by the Allies, who were rapidly advancing from <a href="Garmisch">Garmisch</a> towards <a href="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a>. Kesselring remained stubbornly opposed to the surrender, but was finally won over by Wolff on the late morning of 2 May after a two-hour phone call to Kesselring at his headquarters at <a href="Pullach">Pullach</a>.

North of the Alps, Army Group G followed suit on 6 May. Kesselring now decided to surrender his own headquarters. He ordered Hausser to supervise the SS troops to ensure that the surrender was carried out in accordance with his instructions. Kesselring then surrendered to an American major at <a href="Saalfelden">Saalfelden</a>, near <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>, in Austria on 9 May 1945. He was taken to see Major General <a href="Maxwell%20D.%20Taylor">Maxwell D. Taylor</a>, the commander of the <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">101st Airborne Division</a>, who treated him courteously, allowing him to keep his weapons and field marshal's baton, and to visit the Eastern Front headquarters of Army Groups Centre and South at <a href="Zeltweg">Zeltweg</a> and <a href="Graz">Graz</a> unescorted. Taylor arranged for Kesselring and his staff to move into a hotel at <a href="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a>. Photographs of Taylor and Kesselring drinking tea together created a stir in the United States. Kesselring met with General <a href="Jacob%20L.%20Devers">Jacob L. Devers</a>, commander of the <a href="Sixth%20United%20States%20Army%20Group">Sixth United States Army Group</a>, and gave interviews to Allied newspaper reporters.

In his post-war memoirs, Kesselring claimed he envisioned making a start on the rehabilitation of Germany following the end of the war. Instead, he was arrested. On 15 May 1945, Kesselring was taken to <a href="Mondorf-les-Bains">Mondorf-les-Bains</a> where his baton and decorations were taken from him and he was incarcerated. He was held in a number of American POW camps before being transferred to British custody in 1946. He testified at the <a href="Nuremberg%20Trials">Nuremberg trial</a> of Hermann Göring, but his offers to testify against Soviet, American, and British commanders were declined.

By the end of the war, for many Italians the name of Kesselring, whose signature appeared on posters and printed orders announcing draconian measures adopted by the German occupation, had become synonymous with the oppression and terror that had characterised the German occupation. Kesselring's name headed the list of German officers blamed for a long series of atrocities perpetrated by the German forces.

The <a href="Moscow%20Declaration">Moscow Declaration</a> of October 1943 promised that "those German officers and men and members of the Nazi party who have been responsible for or have taken a consenting part in the above atrocities, massacres and executions will be sent back to the countries in which their abominable deeds were done in order that they may be judged and punished according to the laws of these liberated countries and of free governments which will be erected therein." However, the British, who had been a driving force in moulding the war crimes trial policy that culminated in the Nuremberg Trials, explicitly excluded high-ranking German officers in their custody. Thus, Kesselring's conviction became "a legal "prerequisite" if perpetrators of war crimes were to be found guilty by Italian courts".

The British held two major trials against the top German war criminals who had perpetrated crimes during the Italian campaign. For political reasons it was decided to hold the trials in Italy, but a request by Italy to allow an Italian judge to participate was denied on the grounds that Italy was not an Allied country. The trials were held under the Royal Warrant of 18 June 1945, thus under British Military Law. The decision put the trials on a shaky legal basis, as foreign nationals were being tried for crimes against foreigners in a foreign country. The first trial, held in Rome, was of Mackensen and Mälzer for their part in the Ardeatine massacre. Both were sentenced to death on 30 November 1946.

Kesselring's own trial began in Venice on 17 February 1947. The British Military Court was presided over by <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major General</a> Sir <a href="Edmund%20Hakewill-Smith">Edmund Hakewill-Smith</a>, assisted by four lieutenant colonels. Colonel Richard C. Halse – who had already obtained the death penalty for von Mackensen and <a href="Kurt%20M%C3%A4lzer">Kurt Mälzer</a> – was the prosecutor. Kesselring's legal team was headed by <a href="Hans%20Laternser">Hans Laternser</a>, a skilful German lawyer who specialised in <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20law">Anglo-Saxon law</a>, had represented several defendants at the Nuremberg Trials, and would later go on to represent "Generalfeldmarschall" <a href="Erich%20von%20Manstein">Erich von Manstein</a>. Kesselring's ability to pay his legal team was hampered because his assets had been frozen by the Allies, but his legal costs were eventually met by friends in <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and relatives in <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>.

Kesselring was arraigned on two charges: the shooting of 335 Italians in the Ardeatine massacre and incitement to kill Italian civilians. Kesselring did not invoke the "<a href="Nuremberg%20defence">Nuremberg defence</a>". Rather, he maintained that the order to kill 10 Italian civilians for each German soldier killed by partisans was "just and lawful". On 6 May 1947 the Court found him guilty of both charges and sentenced him to death by firing squad, which was considered more honourable than hanging. The court left open the question of the legality of killing innocent persons in reprisals.

The planned major trial for the campaign of reprisals never took place, but a series of smaller trials was held instead in <a href="Padua">Padua</a> between April and June 1947 for SS "Brigadeführer" Willy Tensfeld, <a href="Captain%20Lieutenant">Kapitänleutnant</a> Waldemar Krummhaar, the 26th "Panzer" Division's "Generalleutnant" <a href="Eduard%20Crasemann">Eduard Crasemann</a> and SS "Gruppenführer" <a href="Max%20Simon">Max Simon</a> of the 16th SS "Panzergrenadier" Division "Reichsführer-SS". Tensfeld was acquitted; Crasemann was sentenced to 10 years; and Simon was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted. Simon's trial was the last held in Italy by the British. By 1949, British military tribunals had sentenced 230 Germans to death and another 447 to custodial sentences. None of the death sentences imposed between the end of 1946 and 1948 were carried out. A number of officers, all below the rank of General, including Kappler, were transferred to the Italian courts for trial. These applied very different legal standards to the British – ones which were often more favourable to the defendants. Ironically, in view of the repeated attempts by many senior "Wehrmacht" commanders to shift blame for atrocities onto the SS, the most senior SS commanders in Italy, Karl Wolff and <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>'s personal representative in Italy, SS "Standartenführer" <a href="Eugen%20Dollmann">Eugen Dollmann</a>, escaped prosecution.

The death verdict against Kesselring unleashed a storm of protest in the United Kingdom. Former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> immediately branded it as too harsh and intervened in favour of Kesselring. Field Marshal Alexander, now <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a>, sent a telegram to Prime Minister <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> in which he expressed his hope that Kesselring's sentence would be commuted. "As his old opponent on the battlefield", he stated, "I have no complaints against him. Kesselring and his soldiers fought against us hard but clean." Alexander had expressed his admiration for Kesselring as a military commander as early as 1943. In his 1961 memoirs Alexander paid tribute to Kesselring as a commander who "showed great skill in extricating himself from the desperate situations into which his faulty intelligence had led him". Alexander's sentiments were echoed by Lieutenant General Sir <a href="Oliver%20Leese">Oliver Leese</a>, who had commanded the British Eighth Army in the Italian campaign. In a May 1947 interview, Leese said he was "very sad" to hear of what he considered "British victor's justice" being imposed on Kesselring, an "extremely gallant soldier who had fought his battles fairly and squarely". <a href="William%20Sidney%2C%201st%20Viscount%20De%20L%27Isle">Lord de L'Isle</a>, who had been awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for gallantry at Anzio, raised the issue in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>.

The Italian government refused to carry out death sentences, as the death penalty had been abolished in Italy in 1944 and was regarded as a relic of Mussolini's <a href="Fascism">Fascist</a> regime. The Italian decision was very disappointing to the British government because the trials had partly been intended to meet the expectations of the Italian public. The War Office notified Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Harding%2C%201st%20Baron%20Harding%20of%20Petherton">Sir John Harding</a>, who had succeeded Alexander as commander of British forces in the Mediterranean in 1946, that there should be no more death sentences and those already imposed should be commuted. Accordingly, Harding commuted the death sentences imposed on von Mackensen, Mälzer and Kesselring to life imprisonment on 4 July 1947. Mälzer died while still in prison in February 1952, while von Mackensen, after having his sentence reduced to 21 years, was set free in October 1952. Kesselring was moved from <a href="Mestre">Mestre</a> prison near Venice to <a href="Wolfsberg%2C%20Carinthia">Wolfsberg, Carinthia</a>, in May 1947. In October 1947 he was transferred for the last time, to <a href="Werl%20Prison">Werl Prison</a>, in <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>.

In Kesselring's memoirs, he said that in Wolfsberg he was approached by a former SS major who had an escape plan prepared. According to Kesselring, he declined the offer on the grounds that it would be seen as a confession of guilt. Other senior Nazi figures did manage to escape from Wolfsberg to South America or Syria.

Kesselring resumed his work on a history of the war that he was writing for the <a href="US%20Army%27s%20Historical%20Division">US Army's Historical Division</a>. This effort, working under the direction of "Generaloberst" <a href="Franz%20Halder">Franz Halder</a> in 1946, brought together a number of German generals for the purpose of producing historical studies of the war, including <a href="Gotthard%20Heinrici">Gotthard Heinrici</a>, Heinz Guderian, <a href="Lothar%20Rendulic">Lothar Rendulic</a>, <a href="Hasso%20von%20Manteuffel">Hasso von Manteuffel</a> and <a href="Georg%20von%20K%C3%BCchler">Georg von Küchler</a>. Kesselring contributed studies of the war in Italy and North Africa and the problems faced by the German high command. Kesselring also worked secretly on his memoirs. The manuscript was smuggled out by Irmgard Horn-Kesselring, Rainer's mother, who typed it at her home.

An influential group assembled in Britain to lobby for his release from prison. Headed by <a href="Maurice%20Hankey%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hankey">Lord Hankey</a>, the group included politicians Lord de L'Isle and <a href="Richard%20Stokes">Richard Stokes</a>, Field Marshal Alexander and <a href="Admiral%20of%20the%20Fleet%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral of the Fleet</a> <a href="William%20Boyle%2C%2012th%20Earl%20of%20Cork">The Earl of Cork and Orrery</a>, and military historians <a href="Basil%20Liddell%20Hart">Basil Liddell Hart</a> and <a href="J.%20F.%20C.%20Fuller">J. F. C. Fuller</a>. Upon re-gaining the prime ministership in 1951, Winston Churchill, who was closely associated with the group, gave priority to the quick release of the war criminals remaining in British custody.

Meanwhile, in Germany, the release of military prisoners had become a political issue. With the establishment of <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> in 1949, and the advent of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> between the former Allies and the Soviet Union, it became inevitable that the German armed forces would be revived in some form, and there were calls for amnesty for military prisoners as a condition for German military participation in the Western Alliance. A media campaign gradually gathered steam in Germany. "<a href="Westdeutsche%20Allgemeine%20Zeitung">Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</a>" published an interview with Liny Kesselring and "<a href="Stern%20%28magazine%29">Stern</a>" ran a series about Kesselring and von Manstein entitled "Justice, Not Clemency". The pressure on the British government was increased in 1952, when the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany%20%28Federal%20Republic%29">German Chancellor</a> <a href="Konrad%20Adenauer">Konrad Adenauer</a> made it clear that West German ratification of the <a href="European%20Defence%20Community">European Defence Community</a> Treaty was dependent on the release of German military figures.

In July 1952, Kesselring was diagnosed with a cancerous growth in the throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty cigars per day but he quit smoking in 1925. Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, they were concerned that he might die in prison like Mälzer, which would be a public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.

In 1952, while still in the hospital, Kesselring accepted the honorary presidency of three veterans' organisations. The first was the "Luftwaffenring", consisting of "Luftwaffe" veterans. The "Verband deutsches Afrikakorps", the veterans' association of the "Afrika Korps", soon followed. More controversial was the presidency of the right-wing veterans' association, the "<a href="Stahlhelm%2C%20Bund%20der%20Frontsoldaten">Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten</a>". Leadership of this organisation tarnished his reputation. He attempted to reform the organisation, proposing that the new <a href="Flag%20of%20Germany">German flag</a> be flown instead of the old Imperial Flag; that the old "Stahlhelm" greeting "Front heil!" be abolished; and that members of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democratic Party of Germany</a> be allowed to join. The response was very unenthusiastic.

Kesselring's memoirs were published in 1953, as "Soldat bis zum letzten Tag" ("A Soldier to the Last Day"). They were reprinted in English as "A Soldier's Record" a year later. Although written while he was in prison, without access to his papers, the memoirs formed a valuable resource, informing military historians on topics such as the background to the invasion of the Soviet Union. When the English edition was published, Kesselring's contentions that the "Luftwaffe" was not defeated in the air in the Battle of Britain and that <a href="Operation%20Sea%20Lion">Operation "Sea Lion"</a>—the invasion of Britain—was thought about but never seriously planned were controversial. In 1955, he published a second book, "Gedanken zum Zweiten Weltkrieg" ("Thoughts on the Second World War").

Interviewed by the Italian journalist <a href="Enzo%20Biagi">Enzo Biagi</a> soon after his release in 1952, Kesselring defiantly described the Marzabotto massacre—in which almost 800 innocent Italian civilians had been killed—as a "normal military operation". Since the event was considered to be the worst massacre of civilians committed in Italy during World War II, Kesselring's definition caused outcry and indignation in the Italian Parliament. Kesselring reacted provocatively, claiming that he had "saved Italy" and that the Italians ought to build him "a monument". In response, on 4 December 1952, <a href="Piero%20Calamandrei">Piero Calamandrei</a>, an Italian jurist, soldier, university professor, and politician, who had been a leader of the Resistance, penned an antifascist poem, "Lapide ad ignominia" ("A Monument to Ignominy"). In the poem, Calamandrei stated that if Kesselring returned he would indeed find a monument, but one stronger than stone, composed of Italian Resistance fighters who "willingly took up arms, to preserve dignity, not to promote hate, and who decided to fight back against the shame and terror of the world".

After release from prison, Kesselring protested against what he regarded as the "unjustly smirched reputation of the German soldier". In November 1953, testifying at a war crimes trial, he warned that "there won't be any volunteers for the new German army if the German government continues to try German soldiers for acts committed in World War II". He enthusiastically supported the European Defence Community, and suggested that the "war opponents of yesterday must become the peace comrades and friends of tomorrow". On the other hand, he also declared that he found "astonishing" those who believe "that we must revise our ideas in accordance with democratic principles ... That is more than I can take."

In March 1954, Kesselring and Liny toured Austria ostensibly as private citizens. He met with former comrades-in-arms and prison-mates, some of them former SS members, causing embarrassment to the Austrian government, which ordered his deportation. He ignored the order and completed his tour before leaving a week later, as he had intended. His only official service was on the Medals Commission, which was established by <a href="President%20of%20Germany">President</a> <a href="Theodor%20Heuss">Theodor Heuss</a>. Ultimately, the commission unanimously recommended that medals should be permitted to be worn—but without the <a href="swastika">swastika</a>. He was an expert witness for the "Generals' Trials". The Generals' Trials were trials of German citizens before German courts for crimes committed in Germany, the most prominent of which was that of "Generalfeldmarschall" <a href="Ferdinand%20Sch%C3%B6rner">Ferdinand Schörner</a>.

Kesselring died in a <a href="sanatorium">sanatorium</a> in <a href="Bad%20Nauheim">Bad Nauheim</a> in West Germany, on 16 July 1960 at the age of 74, following a <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a>. He was given a quasi-military "Stahlhelm" funeral and buried in Bergfriedhof Cemetery in <a href="Bad%20Wiessee">Bad Wiessee</a>. Members of "Stahlhelm" acted as his pall bearers and fired a rifle volley over his grave. His former chief of staff, <a href="Siegfried%20Westphal%20%28general%29">Siegfried Westphal</a>, spoke for the veterans of North Africa and Italy, describing Kesselring as "a man of admirable strength of character whose care was for soldiers of all ranks". Josef Kammhuber spoke on behalf of the "Luftwaffe" and "<a href="Bundeswehr">Bundeswehr</a>", expressing the hope that Kesselring would be remembered for his earlier accomplishments rather than for his later activities. Also present were the former "SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer" <a href="Sepp%20Dietrich">Sepp Dietrich</a>, the ex-Chancellor <a href="Franz%20von%20Papen">Franz von Papen</a>, "Generalfeldmarschall" Ferdinand Schörner, "<a href="Grossadmiral">Grossadmiral</a>" and former "Reichspräsident" <a href="Karl%20D%C3%B6nitz">Karl Dönitz</a>, <a href="Otto%20Remer">Otto Remer</a>, SS "<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>" <a href="Joachim%20Peiper">Joachim Peiper</a>, and former Ambassador Rudolf Rahn.

In 2000, a memorial event was held in Bad Wiessee marking the fortieth anniversary of Kesselring's death. No representatives of the "Bundeswehr" attended, on the grounds that Kesselring was "not worthy of being part of our tradition". Instead, the task of remembering the "Generalfeldmarschall" fell to two veterans groups, the "Deutsche Montecassino Vereinigung" (German Monte Cassino Association) and the "Bund Deutscher Fallschirmjäger" (Association of German Paratroopers). To his ageing troops, Kesselring remained a commander to be commemorated.

Kesselring's "generalfeldmarschall"s baton was seized by a private serving as a scout with the <a href="2nd%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">US 2nd Armoured Division</a>, the first US division to enter Berlin, in July 1945. He was ordered to search castles that had been used by high-ranking German officers, and found the baton. It remained in his possession until his death in 1977, when it passed to his widow, and then to his son, who put it up for auction by Alex Cooper auctioneers in 2010. Expected to fetch between US $10,000 and $15,000, it was sold to a private bidder for $731,600.

The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., often referred to as just Brisco or Brisco County, is an American <a href="Weird%20West">weird western</a> television series created by <a href="Jeffrey%20Boam">Jeffrey Boam</a> and <a href="Carlton%20Cuse">Carlton Cuse</a>. It ran for 27 episodes on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox network</a> starting in the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">1993–94 season</a>. Set in the <a href="American%20Old%20West">American West</a> of 1893, the series follows its <a href="Brisco%20County%2C%20Jr.%20%28character%29">title character</a>, a <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a>-educated lawyer-turned-<a href="bounty%20hunter">bounty hunter</a> hired by a group of wealthy <a href="industrialist">industrialist</a>s to track and capture outlaw John Bly and his gang. <a href="Bruce%20Campbell">Bruce Campbell</a> plays Brisco, who is joined by a colorful group of supporting characters, including <a href="Julius%20Carry">Julius Carry</a> as fellow bounty hunter Lord Bowler and <a href="Christian%20Clemenson">Christian Clemenson</a> as stick-in-the-mud lawyer Socrates Poole.

While ostensibly a Western, the series routinely includes elements of the science fiction and <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> genres. Humor is a large part of the show; the writers attempted to keep the jokes and situations "just under over-the-top". A large number of episodes involve the Orb, a powerful device from the future. <a href="John%20Astin">John Astin</a> plays Professor Wickwire, an inventor who assists Brisco with <a href="anachronism">anachronistic</a> technology including diving suits, motorcycles, rockets, and airships. The search for new technology and progressive ideas, what the writers of the show called "The Coming Thing", is a central theme throughout the series.

"Brisco" was developed by Boam and Cuse at the request of Fox executive <a href="Bob%20Greenblatt">Bob Greenblatt</a>. Impressed by the duo's work on the script for "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>", Greenblatt suggested they develop a series that bore the tone and style of vintage <a href="Serial%20film">movie serials</a>. The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. "Brisco" was one of the last television shows to be filmed on the <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> Western backlot. <a href="Randy%20Edelman">Randy Edelman</a> composed the distinctive theme music, which has been reused by the <a href="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a> during its coverage of the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>.

During its broadcast run, "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr." garnered a small but dedicated following and was well received by critics. The series earned high ratings at the beginning of its season, but later episodes failed to attract a substantial number of viewers. Fox canceled the show at the end of its first and only season. In 2006, <a href="Warner%20Home%20Video">Warner Home Video</a> released a DVD set containing all 27 episodes. The series has been remembered fondly by critics, who praise its humor and unique blend of genres.

"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.", is set in a fictional <a href="American%20Old%20West">American Old West</a> of 1893. <a href="Robber%20baron%20%28industrialist%29">Robber barons</a> control the financial and industrial interests of the West from the boardrooms of San Francisco's Westerfield Club. The famous <a href="United%20States%20Marshals%20Service">U.S. Marshal</a> Brisco County, Sr. (<a href="R.%20Lee%20Ermey">R. Lee Ermey</a>) has apprehended a gang of outlaws and its leader, the notorious John Bly. While transporting them to stand trial, County is murdered and the gang escapes. Meanwhile, in a nearby mine, a group of shackled Chinese workers unearths "The Orb", a large golden globe studded with rods. A worker draws one of the rods from out of the Orb, then touches several of his co-workers with it. As each worker is touched with the rod he is imbued with superhuman strength which they use to break the iron chains binding them, thus freeing themselves. The murder of Brisco County, Sr., and the discovery of the Orb set into motion the major plots of the series.

Members of the Westerfield Club hire <a href="Brisco%20County%2C%20Jr.%20%28character%29">Brisco County, Jr.</a> (<a href="Bruce%20Campbell">Bruce Campbell</a>), the son of the slain U.S. Marshal, to track and re-capture Bly (<a href="Billy%20Drago">Billy Drago</a>) and his gang. The Westerfield Club's timid lawyer, Socrates Poole (<a href="Christian%20Clemenson">Christian Clemenson</a>) relays instructions and financial support to Brisco. Another bounty hunter, Lord Bowler (<a href="Julius%20Carry">Julius Carry</a>), who is known for his expert tracking skills, also hopes to capture Bly. Bitter over the elder County's fame, Bowler treats Brisco as a rival. The two men often find themselves reluctantly joining forces to achieve a common goal. Later in the series, Brisco and Bowler work together as partners and friends.

In the pilot episode, Brisco tracks John Bly's second-in-command, Big Smith (<a href="M.C.%20Gainey">M.C. Gainey</a>). In a battle on a train car, Brisco knocks Smith off the train and into a river; he is assumed dead until he reappears later in the series. Brisco, Bowler and Socrates hunt the rest of Bly's gang in subsequent episodes. All ten of the gang members are captured or killed, and Brisco's pursuit of Bly, who is seeking the Orb for its supernatural power, frequently puts him into contact with the object. Each encounter with the Orb reveals a fantastic effect on people who use it. In the episode "The Orb Scholar", Bly shoots Brisco and leaves him to die. Professor Ogden Coles, a scientist who studies the Orb, heals Brisco with the device. In the episode "Bye Bly", it is revealed that Bly is a fugitive from the distant future who has traveled to 1893 to steal the Orb. Bly plans to use the Orb to travel back to his time and rule the world. Instead, Brisco uses the Orb to travel through time to save Bowler's life. Brisco eventually kills Bly by stabbing him with a rod from the Orb causing Bly to disintegrate into a pile of ashes. Series creator and executive producer Carlton Cuse said that the Orb represents faith and that depending on the intentions of those who use it, the object rewards or punishes them accordingly.

The pilot episode introduces several characters who make recurring appearances throughout the series. Big Smith's moll Dixie Cousins (<a href="Kelly%20Rutherford">Kelly Rutherford</a>) is a saloon singer and con artist who has a brief romantic encounter with Brisco. In later episodes, Dixie becomes Brisco's primary love interest. In his first mission, Brisco also meets Professor Albert Wickwire (<a href="John%20Astin">John Astin</a>), an eccentric scientist who returns to help many times during the series. Wickwire's ideas and inventions play into Brisco's interest in technology and the future, something Brisco calls "The Coming Thing". Pete Hutter (<a href="John%20Pyper-Ferguson">John Pyper-Ferguson</a>) is a hapless mercenary working for Bly. He has a compulsive attachment to his "piece" (pistol), and given any opportunity will pontificate about topics such as art and philosophy. Pete appears throughout the series as a comic foil to trade barbs with the heroes. He appears to be killed three times during the series, but returns each time with a comic excuse for why he didn't die. The second half of the series includes many episodes with Whip Morgan (Jeff Phillips), a young <a href="cardsharp">cardsharp</a> whose attempts to assist Brisco and Bowler often end up causing trouble.

The show features classic <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Western</a> <a href="Motif%20%28narrative%29">motifs</a> such as <a href="train%20robberies">train robberies</a> and <a href="gunfighter">gunfighter</a> showdowns, in combination with atypical elements. Much of the series is devoted to the science fiction plot surrounding the Orb, and it is this mix of the Western genre with fantasy that has helped "Brisco" maintain its cult status. In almost every episode, the characters discover or are confronted by fantastic technology. In the pilot episode, Brisco and Professor Wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks. In the episode "Brisco For the Defense", Brisco uses a <a href="slide%20projector">slide projector</a> to show a trial jury <a href="fingerprint">fingerprint</a> evidence. Professor Wickwire returns many times in the series to assist with technology, including tinkering with motorcycles and rescuing the heroes with a helium-filled <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a>. Campbell told "<a href="Starlog">Starlog</a>" magazine, "It's kind of <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a> meets "<a href="The%20Wild%20Wild%20West">The Wild Wild West</a>"." The presence of futuristic technology in a <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> Western places the series in the <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> genre; it is one of the few such shows to have aired on prime-time television. At least one-third of the show's episodes contain steampunk or <a href="Weird%20West">Weird West</a> elements. Though "technology-out-of-time" frequently intrudes into the plots of "Brisco", the fantastic machines or methods rarely appear again. Some of these out-of-time technologies were archaic renderings of those prevalent in the 20th century, and two film researchers, Cynthia Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper, suggest that followers of the show may be puzzled that such inventions, so useful in their own lives, are not exploited further.

According to Cuse, the show was purposefully set in 1893, exactly 100 years before the series premiered in 1993. Brisco is meant to be aware of the imminent changes in society and technology and actively looks for them. The writers of the show, and also the character of Brisco, refer to this concept as "The Coming Thing". Elaborating on this theme, Campbell said, "Basically this show is about the turn of the century, when the Old West met the Industrial Era. Cowboys still chew tobacco and ride the range and states are still territories but, over the horizon, is the onset of electricity, the first autos and telephones. Brisco is in the middle of a transition from the past to the future." The collision of cowboy characters with puzzling technology and other <a href="anachronism">anachronism</a>s generates humor throughout the series. The writers made it a point to insert scenes mirroring the pop culture of the 20th century, from the apparent invention of the term "UFO" in the pilot episode to the appearance of a <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States">sheriff</a> who looks and acts like <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. Speaking about the humor of the show, Campbell said, "I would say 30 percent of each episode is being played for laughs. But it's not a winking at the camera, "<a href="Airplane%21">Airplane</a>"-type of humor. We're funny like "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20%28franchise%29">Indiana Jones</a>" is funny; the laughs come primarily from the wide variety of ridiculous, colorful characters that come in and out of this series."

Bruce Campbell went through five auditions for the role of Brisco before he was hired. In his first audition with the casting director, Campbell spontaneously did a standing flip. The stunt impressed the casting director so much that during each subsequent audition, Campbell was asked to do the flip again. In his final audition, Campbell assured the network executives that if hired for the role, he would work hard to make the show a success. In an interview, Campbell said, "It's every actor's dream to play a cowboy, so when this opportunity came up, I mean, yeah, where do I sign?" He added that working on "Brisco" provided him with acting opportunities he would not have otherwise had. Cuse said getting Campbell "was just one of those collisions between an actor and a script that was just perfect ... I can't imagine Brisco having ever existed without him." Writing in "Auxiliary Magazine", Luke Copping claimed that Brisco was Campbell's "last great" role before the actor fell into "a period of self-parody and overt camp that he did not redeem himself from until joining the cast of "<a href="Burn%20Notice">Burn Notice</a>"".

Christian Clemenson went to Harvard with Cuse but still went through the normal audition channels to get the part of Poole. Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, "The similarities between this show and "The Wild Wild West", and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It was one of my favorite shows growing up, and as soon as I saw that "Brisco County" was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything I have to do to get this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on "Brisco", Cuse said, "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".

Julius Carry saw great potential in the character of Bowler. He had researched black cowboys for a project in college and used that knowledge in his portrayal of Bowler. Carry said that Bowler was similar to the real-life black deputy U.S. Marshal <a href="Bass%20Reeves">Bass Reeves</a>, in that "Reeves always got his man and would often pull off incredible tricks to bring people in." Carry knew Clemenson from the time they worked together on the Western television pilot "Independence". He had no knowledge of Campbell, but approved of the choice for the leading man after watching "<a href="Army%20of%20Darkness">Army of Darkness</a>". He later told "Starlog", "I saw that he would be very good with the physical stuff and that he could deliver a one-liner. I knew the situation would be good." The original direction for Bowler was to have him constantly oppose Brisco, but as the series progressed the writers saw the good-natured chemistry between the actors and decided to make Brisco and Bowler a team. Bowler's race was never an issue in the show. According to Cary Darling, a television critic, this attitude is different from serious Westerns and "may hew more to the truth than one might think". He said historians have noted that black cowboys were common and that conflicts with white cowboys were rare.

Kelly Rutherford's portrayal of Dixie Cousins, with her emphasis on innuendo and subtext, has been described as "less Miss Kitty ("Gunsmoke") than Mae West". Rutherford said that playing Dixie allowed her to fulfill her "fantasy of being <a href="Madeline%20Kahn">Madeline Kahn</a> in "<a href="Blazing%20Saddles">Blazing Saddles</a>"". When John Astin was cast he was best known for his portrayal of <a href="Gomez%20Addams">Gomez Addams</a> in <a href="The%20Addams%20Family%20%281964%20TV%20series%29">"The Addams Family"</a>. Cuse said that he and the writers enjoyed paying homage to the television star of their childhoods: "For us, it was like, 'Oh wow, we get to meet John Astin in the guise of employing him on this show!

In 1989, "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>" was released in the cinemas. It was a commercial success, earning its producers US$115 million from domestic screenings. The action-packed story, unfolding in a manner reminiscent of Saturday matinee <a href="Serial%20film">movie serials</a>, about the adventures of an archaeologist was written by <a href="Jeffrey%20Boam">Jeffrey Boam</a>, with development and story help from <a href="Carlton%20Cuse">Carlton Cuse</a>; this film was their third collaboration, after "<a href="Lethal%20Weapon%202">Lethal Weapon 2</a>" and "<a href="Lethal%20Weapon%203">3</a>". According to Cuse, <a href="Bob%20Greenblatt">Bob Greenblatt</a>, an executive at <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox Broadcasting Company</a>, engaged him and Boam to develop a television series "because of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"". Greenblatt wanted a show that had a style similar to the "Indiana Jones" movies. Cuse started watching old serials and noticed that many fell into two genres: Westerns and science fiction. This gave Boam and Cuse the idea to combine the genres. They decided to emulate the serials' style; for example, each <a href="Act%20structure">act</a> within an episode begins with a <a href="Intertitle">title</a>, usually a <a href="pun">pun</a>, and ends with a <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>.

Boam and Cuse did not intend for the series to be historically accurate. Their aim was to create an action-adventure with a modern feel. Cuse told "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>", "We're not approaching this show as if we were doing a period piece. We see it as a contemporary program. Our characters just happen to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The "Indiana Jones" movies were period pieces too, but you never thought of them that way." Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, "In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn't even once have to shoot his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering." Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, <a href="Fox%20Entertainment%20Group">Fox Entertainment</a> chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell "isn't the next big television star, I'll eat my desk".

Cuse served as <a href="show%20runner">show runner</a> and head writer. Boam, who served as executive producer, also contributed scripts for the show. The writing staff included <a href="John%20Wirth%20%28television%20producer%29">John Wirth</a>, <a href="Brad%20Kern">Brad Kern</a>, Tom Chehak, <a href="David%20Simkins">David Simkins</a>, and <a href="John%20McNamara%20%28writer%29">John McNamara</a>. They followed Cuse's informal instruction that the tone of the show remain "just under over-the-top": the series would be humorous but not too <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">campy</a>. Every member of the staff participated in breaking down and analyzing the stories they conceived. Worth commented, "there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in the room and got translated to paper that worked when you put them on film. That doesn't always happen." Cuse described long hours writing the show, including several overnight sessions. Each episode of "Brisco" was filmed in seven days, so the turn-around time for scripts was one week. McNamara said that he became a "student of TV history" while writing for "Brisco", reviewing old episodes of "<a href="Maverick%20%28TV%20series%29">Maverick</a>" for inspiration on using humor in the Western genre. He said the writing team felt the television audience was ready for a "trans-genre form", because much of the audience grew up with "<a href="Lethal%20Weapon">Lethal Weapon</a>", "", and "<a href="The%20Wild%20Wild%20West">The Wild Wild West</a>". Researchers Lynnette Porter and Barry Porter acknowledge the writer's familiarity with <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>'s novel "<a href="Pudd%27nhead%20Wilson">Pudd'nhead Wilson</a>". Porter and Porter describe the novel as an "ancestor text", because the characters of Brisco and Bly both refer to it, and say that this type of <a href="Literary%20technique">literary device</a> is used again by Cuse in "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>".

One of the challenges the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production. Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized "pirate ship on wheels". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the <a href="production%20designers">production designers</a> could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said it was better to "shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it". He elaborated on this, saying, "if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go back from that, you'll always end up with more than if you start out with a pirate on a horse."

As the series progressed during its broadcast season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, "I think we did a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network." However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, "We were biting off more than we could chew... we were trying to do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously." By the final third of the series, the writers had wrapped up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.

"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.", was filmed primarily on the <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western <a href="backlot">backlot</a>, known as Laramie Street. It was one of the last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. <a href="Movie%20ranch">ranch</a> in <a href="Valencia%2C%20California">Valencia, California</a>; <a href="Bronson%20Canyon">Bronson Canyon</a> in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in <a href="Santa%20Clarita%2C%20California">Santa Clarita, California</a>. Some of the locomotive scenes from "Brisco" were filmed on location at <a href="Railtown%201897%20State%20Historic%20Park">Railtown 1897 State Historic Park</a> in <a href="Jamestown%2C%20California">Jamestown, California</a>. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create <a href="forced%20perspective">illusions of greater depth perspectives</a> is exhibited at the park.
Comet was portrayed by five horses, each with a different talent. The main horse was Copper, chosen by veteran <a href="Wrangler%20%28profession%29">wrangler</a> Gordon Spencer because it was calm and gentle. Campbell nicknamed the horse "Leadbelly" due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes. Another horse, Boss, was used for long-range shots, chase scenes, and elaborate stunts, such as leaps through windows. Ace was called in when the crew had to shoot scenes in which the horse reared. Near the end of the season, a horse named Comet was trained, its name chosen so that the horse would get used to hearing it on set. The "true show horse" was Strip, which was adept at doing tricks, such as lip movements, head nods, and hoof stamping. According to Spencer, all those stunts "as well as tying the knots and opening the door and going into rooms and all of that" were done by Strip. For these scenes, Spencer would stand off-camera and use a stick to signal Strip. Campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and filled it with grain to reward Strip after every take. No other horse had more scenes than Strip and Copper. With white colorings on his nose and legs, Strip's appearance was chosen for Brisco's steed; Copper and the other horses were touched up with "clown white" greasepaint to match Strip's markings.

<a href="Foley%20%28filmmaking%29">Foley</a> artist Casey Crabtree provided sounds for horse hoof movements, work that was praised by sounds effects industry expert <a href="David%20Yewdall">David Yewdall</a>. He said of Crabtree's work on "Brisco", "Her horses sounded so natural and real – their hooves, the sound of their hooves on the texture of the ground, the sound of saddle movement, bridle jingles – it was as good as anything I would want for a feature film, and this was episodic television." The make-up on many of "Brisco"'s episodes was done by veteran artist Mel Berns Jr.

Two props of the Orb were made. One of the prop Orbs was used for stunts and had retractable rods. A second version was manufactured from cast bronze, making it heavy: "You really didn't want to have to handle it", Campbell said. The rocket car seen in the pilot episode was built by special effects coordinator Kam Cooney and was a working vehicle with an internal combustion engine and throttle controls. Some items used in the show had been repurposed from older productions, and some would later be used in other shows. For example, the steam locomotive seen in the pilot episode was the same as the one used in "<a href="Back%20to%20the%20Future%20Part%20III">Back to the Future Part III</a>". Two of Carry's prop guns – rifles whose barrels were sawed-off in fashion of the <a href="Mare%27s%20Leg">Mare's Leg</a> – were later reused in the science fiction television series "<a href="Firefly%20%28TV%20series%29">Firefly</a>".

Stephen Graziano and <a href="Velton%20Ray%20Bunch">Velton Ray Bunch</a> composed original music for the series. 

Composed by <a href="Randy%20Edelman">Randy Edelman</a>, the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show's following; in the mid-1990s, <a href="NBC%20Sports">NBC Sports</a> had commissioned Edelman to compose theme music for its <a href="NFL%20on%20NBC">NFL coverage</a>. At the time, NBC had often used excerpts from film scores as theme music for its sports broadcasts, and had used a portion of Edelman's "<a href="Gettysburg%20%281993%20film%29">Gettysburg</a>" score for the <a href="Breeder%27s%20Cup">Breeder's Cup</a>. A portfolio Edelman sent NBC included the "Brisco" theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the <a href="1997%20World%20Series">1997 World Series</a>. Edelman said, "It was original, and it seemed to have the right spirit. It's got a very flowing melody, it's triumphant, and it has a certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all television things like this have, a 'button', an ending flourish that works really well if they need to chop it down into a 15-second thing." 

Cary Darling said that the "booming" theme song was "part "<a href="The%20Magnificent%20Seven">Magnificent Seven</a>", part <a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a> and as grand and wide as 'Big Sky Country' ".

"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.", premiered on the Fox network at 8:00 pm on Friday, August 27, 1993, with a two-hour pilot movie. To bolster viewer interest in the show, Fox rebroadcast the pilot two days later at 7:00 pm. Both airings of the pilot returned strong ratings. "Brisco's" ratings for the pilot and first episode were high, particularly with the demographic of adults aged 18–49. The series was aired in Canada, including on <a href="CIII-DT">Global Toronto</a> (channel 29).

The pilot movie was followed by 26 episodes, each 45 minutes long and airing at 8:00 pm on Fridays. Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushaw openly touted "Brisco" and its star Bruce Campbell. The network fully expected the show to be its breakout hit of the year, a distinction which eventually went to "Brisco"s follow-up, "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>". Hoping that more viewers would follow "Brisco" as it progressed, Fox approved producing an entire season of the show, despite post-pilot low ratings. Subsequent episodes failed to attract more viewers and the show was cancelled at end of its first and only season. After the series ended, Fox retransmitted the show on Sunday nights at 8:00 pm during July and August 1994. The show was later broadcast for a short time in <a href="television%20syndication">syndication</a>, airing on the U.S. cable channel <a href="Turner%20Network%20Television">TNT</a>.

As the season progressed, the ratings declined, greatly hurting the show's chances of being renewed. Writer John McNamara partially blamed "Brisco"s low ratings on its <a href="Friday%20night%20death%20slot">Friday 8:00 p.m. time slot</a>. He said not many people watch television at that time, so "fighting for numbers" then was "like being stuck on Normandy beach". Grushaw acknowledged the high quality of the show and the vocal support from its small fan base. "Obviously the viewers are very passionate about the show... and when you read some of the things they have to say, it gives you real pause", Grushaw told "USA Today" in 1994. By May of that year, Grushaw said renewing "Brisco" was a 50–50 call. At the end of its season, "Brisco" was one of the lowest rated shows of the year, and Fox confirmed its cancellation in June.

"Brisco"s writers were planning for another season before the show's cancellation. They had not penned the ending of the first season as a finale for the series and had broad ideas for the second season, which would have featured Brisco settling in as the sheriff of a small town. In his autobiography, Campbell mused, "To explain why a TV show is canceled is almost impossible. Ironically "Brisco", with its off-kilter humor, wouldn't have been developed on any other network, yet the appeal of 'Westerns' was still rural – not the side Fox's urban bread was buttered on."

Writer and supervising producer Brad Kern reflected on the show's cancellation, saying, "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I think that was the biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." Told of the show's success in the "TV Guide" "Save Our Shows" poll, Sandy Grushow said, "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." <a href="Kim%20Manners">Kim Manners</a>, director on nearly a third of the "Brisco" episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for "Brisco" was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on "The X-Files". Manners said, "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on "Brisco". Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, "Brisco" could have had a much longer life." Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt "Brisco"s chances of building an audience, saying, "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot – I mean people do still go bowling – few shows have succeeded in that slot."

In 2005, Kirthana Ramisetti of "Entertainment Weekly" posted that "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.", deserved to be released on DVD. Gord Lacey, the creator of the website <a href="TVShowsonDVD.com">TVShowsonDVD.com</a>, told the New York "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">Daily News</a>" that "Brisco" was among the five most requested shows on the site. Lacey spent several years lobbying industry contacts to get "Brisco" released on DVD. This led to correspondence with Cuse, who also wanted to get a DVD set produced. On July 18, 2006, <a href="Warner%20Home%20Video">Warner Home Video</a> released "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series" on DVD in Region 1, an 8-disc DVD set that contains all 27 episodes of the series. The release includes commentary tracks from Campbell and Cuse; an interactive menu of Brisco's signature references narrated by Campbell; "The History of Brisco County, Jr.", documentary; a feature called "A Reading from the Book of Bruce"; and another gallery hosted by Campbell focusing on the gadgets from the show.

In July 1993, "Brisco"s two-hour pilot was screened for television critics in Los Angeles. Initial critical reaction to the pilot was positive and focused on the humor and the science fiction plot points. "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"s Matt Roush enjoyed the campy humor and the cast of the show, saying it worked on many levels and would "please all but the family curmudgeon". Calling "Brisco" "one of the best shows of the fall season", Jennifer Stevenson of the "<a href="St.%20Petersburg%20Times">St. Petersburg Times</a>" praised the show's "intelligent, satirical asides". Kay Gardella wrote in the New York "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">Daily News</a>" that the pilot set itself "apart from others of genre" with its humorous script and sight gags. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" called "Brisco" "gratifying nonsense", and praised Campbell and the supporting cast for supplying humor without "going over the top". Some critics, such as Walter Goodman of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and David Hiltbrand of "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>", found the supporting characters "weakly cast" and not as strong as Campbell in the lead. Other reviewers praised the overall look of the show, such as Todd Everett of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", who approved of the "strong comic-book visual style" and the pilot's high production values. Writing in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", Tom Shales said that the pilot's production was "more movielike than serieslike".

The pilot's science-fiction plot elements were appreciated by "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine, which wrote favorably about the "<a href="millenarianism">millenarianism</a>" of the show, including Brisco's use of a rocket to travel on railroad tracks. While Rod Dreher of the "<a href="Washington%20Times">Washington Times</a>" liked the "nifty" Orb subplot, some critics responded negatively to the Orb. The "Washington Post"s Shales called the Orb "hokey supernatural bunk". Other reviewers complained generally about the broad mix of genres and number of subplots in the pilot. While "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>"s Jeff Jarvis roundly praised the quality of the pilot and called "Brisco" his favorite Fox show of 1993, he criticized the pilot for being "padded with outlaws and mysterious orbs". Diane Werts of "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" similarly said that "Brisco" "just about hits the bulls eye" with its "sharp wit" and "thrill a minute" action, although she noted that the pilot was over-packed with characters and subplots. Writing in "The New York Times", Goodman said, "The writers try everything, including some business involving raiders of a lost orb, without much of a payoff."

"<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s <a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> enjoyed the "nervy attempt to do something different with the TV Western" in the pilot and said that "Brisco County is less a satire of the Western's cliches than a revitalization of them." Writing in the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>", Greg Quill said that the pilot introduced "Brisco" as "a western in the loosest use of the term". Quill noted that the pilot includes "every cliche in the western movie arsenal", but that "everything, from characters to plot turns, is skewed away from the norm", and that the pilot episode rose above the level of western <a href="Parody">spoof</a> to become an "outrageously confident tribute to... the best of the genre".

During the broadcast run of "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.", "TV Guide" featured a positive review of the show in its Couch Critic column and wrote, "It's as funny as it is exciting, which is not an easy combo to pull off... it's fresh and funny and different, and that's why we like it." The magazine twice listed "Brisco" as a family-friendly TV program: "Back when some of us grew up, Westerns were synonymous with great family entertainment, but – let's be honest – some of them were dull as dust. Not this one. "Brisco" is a Western with a sense of humor, filled with impish action for kids and adults."

"<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" reviewed a host of Westerns from 1992 and 1993 and said that "Brisco" was "the most sheer fun of the bunch", calling it "a period piece with slick production values and a mix of drama and humor, fast pace and high camp". In an article on the 1993 television season, the "Toronto Star"s Greg Quill wrote that "Brisco" was a program that represented "American TV craft at the top of its form". In contrast, Elvis Mitchell of "<a href="Spin%20magazine">Spin</a>" magazine gave "Brisco" a scathing review, calling the show's premise a "tedious... rickety gimmick". Mitchell acknowledged the show's "quick reflexes", but said the humor was "uncomfortable" with a "cynical quickness". He added, ""Brisco County" relieves us of the burden of laughing. It spends too much time looking at itself in the mirror, admiring its own adorable dimpled half-smile."

Viewership figures for "Brisco" fell as its season progressed and in 1994, it was listed in "TV Guide"s annual "Save Our Shows" article. Readers were requested to write in and vote to save one of the four listed shows – one from each television network – that were in danger of being cancelled. "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.", won with 34.7 percent of the 72,000 votes cast. Cuse said the vote "reaffirms for me a feeling I've had – namely that the Nielsens aren't accurately reflecting people's interest in this show", adding that, given Fox's then relatively small share of the market, it was notable that the show got more votes than any of the programs from NBC, CBS, and ABC.

Writing in "USA Today", Matt Roush encouraged readers to watch the low-rated show, saying that families should watch it rather than "that interchangeable <a href="TGIF%20%28ABC%29">T.G.I.F.</a> tripe". He said, "Brisco is mighty lavish but even more mightily loony, happily saddled with broad sight gags and tortured puns." Bruce Fretts of "Entertainment Weekly" speculated that mainstream success eluded the show because of its mixing of genres. He said, ""Brisco" refuses to behave like a normal Western, mixing in sci-fi, slapstick, and... kung fu." "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>"'s Scott Williams praised "Brisco" for its "strong supporting cast" and "superb physical comedy and crisp dialogue". He said the show should have been a hit, but that the Friday night time slot hampered its ratings.

"Brisco" was criticized early on for the violence it portrayed; meant to be comical, a scene in the pilot in which four villains accidentally kill each other in a crossfire troubled critics instead. Cuse insisted that the show was still appropriate for children, saying, "I think we're very conscious of violence and I think we've made an effort to avoid violence in the pilot and in the future episodes". Halfway through the season, U.S. Senator <a href="Byron%20Dorgan">Byron Dorgan</a> singled out "Brisco" as the most violent show on television based on a study at Minnesota's <a href="Concordia%20University%2C%20Saint%20Paul">Concordia University</a>, in which students watched 132 hours of network and cable programming, during the week of September 28 to October 4, 1993. The students tallied each act of violence, and found that "Brisco" had 117 violent acts per hour. The study deemed "Brisco" more violent than the film "<a href="Beverly%20Hills%20Cop">Beverly Hills Cop</a>", which was also viewed for the study. Cuse called the criticism "patently ridiculous", noting that only one episode of the show was viewed, in which a boxing match takes place. Each punch and jab was counted as an act of violence. Cuse spoke out against legislation to curb television violence, saying that politicians were "chasing a false objective". He said it was the job of a show's producer to control the moral content of a television program and the parents' duty to monitor what their children watch.

The "Los Angeles Times" printed a story about Senator Dorgan's efforts to elicit a response from the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) with the title "Fox Tops Tally of Violence on Major TV Networks Media: Study of a week of prime-time shows also lists 'Brisco County' as bloodiest series. Senator wants FCC to issue report card, name sponsors". Cuse responded by writing a letter to the editor. In the letter, entitled "'Brisco County' Is a Family-Oriented Series", Cuse objected to the newspaper story title labeling "Brisco" as the "bloodiest series". He said that Senator Dorgan's press release did not mention blood and that the show's violence should be viewed in context. Cuse added the show had been listed as family friendly in other publications, and that he read every viewer letter sent regarding the show. "The overwhelming majority praise "Brisco County" for being a show that the entire family can watch together. After 15 original airings, I have not received one single letter criticizing the show on the grounds of violence or violent content." When the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">US Senate</a> discussed forcing broadcast and cable networks to regulate violent programming, Cuse said that self-regulation within the industry was a positive move. As he operated on his "own internal moral principles", the measures would not affect his week-to-week work.

Writing in "People" magazine in 1995, Craig Tomashoff said the cancellation of "Brisco" was "one of the tragedies going into [the 1994–1995] TV season". Tomashoff suggested that the show influenced <a href="UPN">UPN</a>'s "<a href="Legend%20%28TV%20series%29">Legend</a>", another Western series with comedy and science fiction elements. Reflecting on the show in the "<a href="Orange%20County%20Register">Orange County Register</a>" in 1996, critic Cary Darling lamented "Brisco"'s cancellation, saying that the show "stood way out from the rest of the broadcast pack". Darling reviewed the show, describing it as "a witty, multiracial Western that tempered its fisticuffs with fantasy, its innocence with irony, and its romantic vision of the Old West with an abiding New World faith in the future's infinite possibilities". Writing in "Entertainment Weekly", Ken Tucker called the show a "one season wonder" that was "ahead of its time".

When the series was released on DVD, critics remembered it fondly. "Video Librarian" called "Brisco" "criminally short-lived" and "wildly entertaining". Ken Tucker of "Entertainment Weekly" gave the series an "A-", calling the show "smart-alecky and witty, suspenseful and absurd". "IGN DVD" called the DVD set "impressive" and said that the series was "a satisfying show that hits its mark". "Auxiliary Magazine" called "Brisco" "one of the greatest sci-fi/Western epics in television history" and compared it favorably to the more well-known sci-fi/Western shows, "Firefly" and "The Wild Wild West". In its 2006 gift guide, the "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a>" gave "Brisco" a positive review, saying, "Folks, there are so few comic sci-fi/Westerns, they should be celebrated, not canceled prematurely."

Benjamin Tillman

Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847 – July 3, 1918) was an American politician of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> who served as <a href="Governor%20of%20South%20Carolina">Governor of South Carolina</a> from 1890 to 1894, and a <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> from 1895 until his death in 1918. A <a href="white%20supremacist">white supremacist</a> who opposed <a href="Civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights</a> for <a href="African%20Americans">black Americans</a>, Tillman led a paramilitary group of <a href="Red%20Shirts%20%28Southern%20United%20States%29">Red Shirts</a> during <a href="1876%20South%20Carolina%20gubernatorial%20election">South Carolina's violent 1876 election</a>. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, he frequently ridiculed black Americans, and boasted of having helped kill them during that campaign.

In the 1880s, Tillman, a wealthy landowner, became dissatisfied with the Democratic leadership and led a movement of white farmers calling for reform. He was initially unsuccessful, though he was instrumental in the founding of <a href="Clemson%20University">Clemson University</a> as an agricultural school. In 1890, Tillman took control of the state Democratic Party, and was elected governor. During his four years in office, 18 black Americans were <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynched</a> in South Carolina—the 1890s saw the most lynchings of any decade in South Carolina. Tillman tried to prevent lynchings as governor, but also spoke in support of the lynch mobs, alleging his own willingness to lead one. In 1894, at the end of his second two-year term, he was elected to the U.S. Senate by vote of the state legislature.

Tillman was known as "Pitchfork Ben" because of his aggressive language, as when he threatened to use a <a href="pitchfork">pitchfork</a> to prod that "bag of beef," President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>. Considered a possible candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in <a href="1896%20United%20States%20presidential%20election">1896</a>, Tillman lost any chance after giving a disastrous speech at <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">the convention</a>. He became known for his virulent oratoryespecially against black Americansbut also as an effective legislator. The first federal <a href="campaign%20finance">campaign finance</a> law, banning corporate contributions, is commonly called the <a href="Tillman%20Act">Tillman Act</a>. Tillman was repeatedly re-elected, serving in the Senate for the rest of his life. One of his legacies was <a href="Constitution%20of%20South%20Carolina">South Carolina's 1895 constitution</a>, which <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disenfranchised</a> most of the black majority and ensured white rule for more than half a century.

Benjamin Ryan Tillman Jr. was born on August 11, 1847, on the family plantation "Chester", near <a href="Trenton%2C%20South%20Carolina">Trenton</a>, in the Edgefield District, sometimes considered part of <a href="Upstate%20South%20Carolina">upcountry South Carolina</a>. His parents, Benjamin Ryan Tillman, Sr. and the former Sophia Hancock, were of English descent. In addition to being planters with 86 slaves, the Tillmans operated an inn. Benjamin Jr. was the last-born of seven sons and four daughters.

The Edgefield District was known as a violent place, even by the standards of <a href="Antebellum%20South">antebellum South Carolina</a>, where matters of personal honor might be addressed with a killing or duel. Before Tillman Sr.'s death from typhoid fever in 1849, he had killed a man and been convicted of rioting by an Edgefield jury. One of his sons died in a duel; another was killed in a domestic dispute. A third died in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>; a fourth of disease aged 15. Of Benjamin Jr.'s two surviving brothers, one died of <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> wounds after returning home, and the other, <a href="George%20Dionysius%20Tillman">George</a>, killed a man who accused him of cheating at gambling. Convicted of manslaughter, George continued to practice law from his jail cell during his two-year sentence, and was elected to the <a href="South%20Carolina%20Senate">state senate</a> while still incarcerated. He later served several terms in Congress.

From an early age, Ben showed a developed vocabulary. In 1860, he was sent to Bethany, a boarding school in Edgefield where he became a star student, and he remained there after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> began. In 1863, he came home for a year to help his mother pay off debts. He returned to Bethany in 1864, intending a final year of study prior to entering the South Carolina College (today, the <a href="University%20of%20South%20Carolina">University of South Carolina</a>). The South's desperate need for soldiers ended this plan, and in June 1864, still not yet 17, he withdrew from the academy, making arrangements to join a <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a> unit. These plans were scuttled as well when he fell ill at home. A cranial tumor led to the removal of his left eye, and it was not until 1866, months after Confederate forces had disbanded, that Ben Tillman was again healthy.

After the war, Ben Tillman, his mother, and his wounded brother James (who died in 1866) worked to rebuild Chester plantation. They signed the plantation's <a href="freedmen">freedmen</a> as workers. They were confronted with the circumstance of several men refusing to work for them and legally leaving the plantation. From 1866 to 1868, Ben Tillman went with several workers from the plantation to Florida, where a new cotton-planting belt had been established. The Tillmans purchased land there. Tillman was unsuccessful in Florida—after two marginal years, the 1868 crop was destroyed by caterpillars.

During his convalescence, Tillman had met Sallie Starke, a refugee from <a href="Fairfield%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina">Fairfield District</a>. They married in January 1868 and she joined him in Florida. The Tillmans returned to South Carolina, where the following year they settled on of Tillman family land, given to him by his mother. They would have seven children together: Adeline, Benjamin Ryan, Henry Cummings, Margaret Malona, Sophia Oliver, Samuel Starke, and Sallie Mae.

Tillman, though he was not very religious, was a frequent churchgoer as a young adult. He was a Christian, but did not identify with a particular sect; as a result, he never formally joined a church. His religious skepticism also led to his avoidance of any further churchgoing almost immediately following his becoming a politician.

Tillman proved an adept farmer, who experimented with <a href="crop%20diversification">crop diversification</a> and took his crops to market each Saturday in nearby <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta, Georgia</a>. In 1878, Tillman inherited from Sophia Tillman, and purchased at <a href="Ninety%20Six%2C%20South%20Carolina">Ninety Six</a>, some from his Edgefield holdings. Having inherited a large library from his uncle John Tillman, he spent part of his days reading. Although his workers were no longer slaves, Tillman continued to apply the whip to them. By 1876, Tillman was the largest landowner in Edgefield County. He rode through his fields on horseback like an antebellum <a href="plantation%20overseer">overseer</a>, and stated at the time that it was necessary that he do so to "drive the slovenly Negroes to work".

With the Confederacy defeated, South Carolina ratified a new constitution in 1865 that recognized the end of slavery, but basically left the pre-war elites in charge. African American freedmen, who were the majority of South Carolina's population, were given no vote, and their new freedom was soon restricted by <a href="Black%20Codes%20%28United%20States%29">Black Codes</a> that limited their civil rights and required black farm laborers to bind themselves with annual labor contracts. Congress was dissatisfied with this minimal change and required a new constitutional convention and elections with universal male suffrage. As African Americans generally favored the Republican Party at the time, that party controlled the biracial state legislature beginning with the 1868 elections. That campaign was marked by violence—19 Republican and <a href="Union%20League">Union League</a> activists were killed in <a href="South%20Carolina%27s%203rd%20congressional%20district">South Carolina's 3rd congressional district</a> alone.
In 1873, two Edgefield lawyers and former Confederate generals, <a href="Martin%20Gary">Martin Gary</a> and <a href="Matthew%20C.%20Butler">Matthew C. Butler</a>, began to advocate what became known as the "Edgefield Plan" or "Straightout Plan". They believed that the previous five years had shown it was not possible to outvote African Americans. Gary and Butler deemed compromises with black leaders to be misguided; they felt white men must be restored to their antebellum position of preeminent political power in the state. They proposed that white men form clandestine paramilitary organizations—known as "rifle clubs"—and use force and intimidation to drive the African American from power. Members of the new white groups became known as <a href="Red%20Shirts%20%28Southern%20United%20States%29">Red Shirts</a>. Tillman was an early and enthusiastic recruit for his local organization, dubbed the Sweetwater Sabre Club. He became a devoted protégé of Gary.

From 1873 to 1876, Tillman served as a member of the Sweetwater club, members of which assaulted and intimidated black would-be voters, killed black political figures, and skirmished with the African-American-dominated state militia. Economic coercion was used as well as physical force: most Edgefield planters would not employ black militiamen or allow them to rent land, and ostracized whites who did.

In 1874, a moderate Republican, <a href="Daniel%20Henry%20Chamberlain">Daniel Henry Chamberlain</a>, was elected South Carolina's governor, attracting even some Democratic votes. When Chamberlain sought re-election in 1876, Gary recruited <a href="Wade%20Hampton%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Wade Hampton III</a>, a Confederate war hero who had moved out of state, to return and run for governor as a Democrat. That election <a href="South%20Carolina%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201876">campaign of 1876</a> was marked by violence, of which the most notorious occurrence was what became known as the <a href="Hamburg%20massacre">Hamburg massacre</a>. It occurred in <a href="Hamburg%2C%20South%20Carolina">Hamburg</a>, a mostly black town across <a href="Savannah%20River">the river</a> from Augusta, in <a href="Aiken%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina">Aiken County</a>, bordering Edgefield County. The incident grew out of a confrontation on July 4 when a black militia marched in Hamburg and two white farmers in a buggy tried to ride through its ranks. Both sides filed criminal charges against the other, and dozens of armed out-of-uniform Red Shirts, led by Butler, traveled to Hamburg on the day of the hearing, July 8. Tillman was present, and the subsequent events were among his proudest memories.

The hearing never occurred, as the black militiamen, outnumbered and outgunned, refused to attend court. This upset the white mob, which expected an apology. Butler demanded that the militiamen give one, and as part of the apology, surrender their arms. Those who attempted to mediate found that neither Butler nor the armed men who backed him were interested in compromise. If the militiamen surrendered their arms, they would be helpless before the mob; if they did not, Butler and his men would use force. Butler brought additional men in from Georgia, and the augmented armed mob, including Tillman, went to confront the militiamen, who were barricaded in their drill room, above a local store. Shots were fired, and after one white man was killed, the rest stormed the room and captured about thirty of the militia. Five were murdered as having white enemies; among the dead was a town constable who had arrested white men. The rest were allowed to flee, with shots fired after them. At least seven black militiamen were killed in the incident. On the way home to Edgefield, Tillman and others had a meal to celebrate the events at the home of the man who had pointed out which African Americans should be shot.
Tillman later recalled that "the leading white men of Edgefield" had decided "to seize the first opportunity that the Negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach the Negroes a lesson" by "having the whites demonstrate their superiority by killing as many of them as was justifiable". Hamburg was their first such opportunity. Ninety-four white men, including Tillman, were indicted by a coroner's jury, but none was prosecuted for the killings. Butler blamed the deaths on intoxicated factory workers and Irish-Americans who had come across the bridge from Augusta, and over whom he had no control.

Tillman raised his profile in state politics by attending the 1876 state Democratic convention, which nominated Hampton as the party's candidate for governor. While Hampton presented a fatherly image, urging support from South Carolinians, black and white, Tillman led fifty men to <a href="Ellenton%2C%20South%20Carolina">Ellenton</a>, intending to join over one thousand rifle club members who <a href="Ellenton%20riot">slaughtered thirty militiamen</a>, with the survivors saved only by the arrival of federal authorities. Although Tillman and his men arrived too late to participate in those killings, two of his men murdered Simon Coker, a black state senator who had come to investigate reports of violence. They shot him as he knelt in final prayer.

On Election Day in November 1876, Tillman served as an election official at a local poll, as did two black Republicans. One arrived late and was scared off by Tillman. As there was as yet no secret ballot in South Carolina, Tillman threatened to remember any votes cast for the Republicans. That precinct gave 211 votes for the Democrats and 2 for the Republicans. Although almost two-thirds of those eligible to vote in Edgefield were African Americans, the Democrats were able to suppress the (Republican) African-American vote, reporting a win for Hampton in Edgefield County with over 60 percent of the vote. Bolstered by this result, Hampton gained a narrow victory statewide, at least according to the official returns. The Red Shirts used violence and fraud to create Democratic majorities that did not exist, and give Hampton the election.

Tillman biographer Stephen Kantrowitz wrote that the unrest in 1876 "marked a turning point in Ben Tillman's life, establishing him as a member of the political and military leadership". Historian <a href="Orville%20Vernon%20Burton">Orville Vernon Burton</a> stated that the violence "secured his prominence among the state's white political elite and proved to be the deathblow to South Carolina's Republican Reconstruction government." The takeover, by fraud and terror, of South Carolina's government became known to whites as the state's "<a href="Redeemers">Redemption</a>".

In 1909, Tillman addressed a reunion of Red Shirts in <a href="Anderson%2C%20South%20Carolina">Anderson, South Carolina</a>, and recounted the events of 1876:

Starting with the election of Hampton as governor in 1876, South Carolina was ruled primarily by the wealthy "<a href="Bourbon%20Democrat">Bourbon</a>" or "Conservative" planter class that had controlled the state before the Civil War. In the 1880s, though, the Bourbon class was neither as strong nor as populous as before. The agenda of the Conservatives had little to offer the farmer, and in the hard economic times of the early 1880s, there was discontent in South Carolina which gave some electoral success to the short-lived <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a>.

Having risen to the rank of captain in the rifle club before the end of the 1876 campaign, Tillman spent the next several years managing his plantations. He played a modest role in Edgefield's political and social life, and in 1881 was elected second in command of the <a href="Edgefield%20Hussars">Edgefield Hussars</a>, a rifle club that had been made part of the state militia. He supported Gary's unsuccessful candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1880, and after Gary's death in 1881, as a delegate to the 1882 Democratic state convention Tillman backed former Confederate general <a href="John%20Bratton">John Bratton</a> for the nomination, again unsuccessfully. By then, Tillman was dissatisfied with the Conservative leaders he had helped gain power; he believed they were ignoring the interests of farmers and of poor mill workers, and had been responsible for denying office to Gary—the former Red Shirt leader had twice sought to be senator, and once governor, and was each time denied. Tillman never forgot what he deemed the "betrayal" of Gary.

In an attempt to better conditions for the farmer (by which Tillman always meant white males only), in 1884 he founded the Edgefield Agricultural Club. It died for lack of members. Undeterred, Tillman tried again in January 1885, beginning the Edgefield County Agricultural Society. Its membership also dwindled, but Tillman was elected one of three delegates to the August joint meeting of the state <a href="The%20National%20Grange%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Patrons%20of%20Husbandry">Grange</a> and the state Agricultural and Mechanical Society at <a href="Bennettsville%2C%20South%20Carolina">Bennettsville</a>, and was invited to be one of the speakers.

When Tillman spoke at Bennettsville, he was not widely known except as the brother of Congressman George Tillman. Ben Tillman called for the state government to do more for farmers, and blamed politicians and lawyers in the pay of financial interests for agricultural problems, including the <a href="crop%20lien">crop lien</a> system that left many farmers struggling to pay bills. He assailed his listeners for letting themselves be duped by hostile interests, and told of the farmer who was elected to the legislature, only to be dazzled and seduced by the elite. According to an account the next day in the "Columbia Daily Register", Tillman's speech "electrified the assembly and was the sensation of the meeting". Lindsey Perkins, in his journal article on Tillman's oratory, wrote that "Tillman's losses in the agricultural depression of 1883–1898 forced him to begin thinking and planning economic reforms. The result was Bennettsville." Tillman later stated that he began his advocacy after a few bad years in the early 1880s forced him to sell some of his land. The speech was printed in several newspapers, and Tillman began to receive more invitations to speak. According to Zach McGhee in his 1906 article on Tillman, "from that day to this he has been the most conspicuous figure in South Carolina".

Within two months of the Bennettsville speech, Tillman was being talked of as a candidate for governor in 1886. He continued to speak to audiences, and was dubbed the "Agricultural Moses". He made political demands, such as primary elections to determine who would get the Democratic nomination (then <a href="tantamount%20to%20election">tantamount to election</a>) rather than the leaving the decision to the Bourbon-dominated state nominating convention. He principally promoted the establishment of a state college for the education of farmers, where young men could learn the latest techniques. Kantrowitz pointed out that the term "farmer" is flexible in meaning, allowing Tillman to overlook distinctions of class and unite most white men in predominantly rural South Carolina under a single banner. During these years, cartoonists began depicting Tillman with pitchfork in hand, symbolizing his agriculture-based roots and tendency to take jabs at opponents. This was a source of his nickname, "Pitchfork Ben".

Historian H. Wayne Morgan noted that "Ben Tillman's venom was not typical, but his general feeling represented that of southern dirt farmers." According to E. Culpepper Clark in his journal article on Tillman,
Tillman spoke widely in the state in 1885 and after, and soon attracted allies, including a number of Red Shirt comrades, such as Martin Gary's nephews <a href="Eugene%20B.%20Gary">Eugene B. Gary</a> and <a href="John%20Gary%20Evans">John Gary Evans</a>. He sought to mold local farmers' groups into a statewide organization to be a voice for agriculturalists. In April 1886, a convention called by Tillman met in <a href="Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina">Columbia</a>, the state capital. The goal of what became known as the Farmer's Association or Farmer's Movement was to control the state Democratic Party from within, and to gain reforms such as the agricultural college. He initially was unsuccessful, though he came within thirty votes of controlling the 1886 state Democratic convention. The lack of success caused Tillman, in late 1887, to announce his retirement from politics, though there was widespread speculation he would soon be back.

Tillman had met, in 1886, with <a href="Thomas%20G.%20Clemson">Thomas G. Clemson</a>, son-in-law of the late <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>, to discuss a bequest to underwrite the cost of the new agricultural school. Clemson died in 1888, and his will not only left money and land for the college, but made Tillman one of seven trustees for life, who had the power to appoint their successors. Tillman stated that this provision, which made the lifetime trustees a majority of the board, was intended to forestall any attempt by a future Republican government to admit African Americans. Clemson College (later <a href="Clemson%20University">Clemson University</a>) was authorized by the legislature in December 1888.

The Clemson bequest helped revitalize Tillman's movement. The targets of Tillman's oratory were again politicians in Columbia and the Conservative elements based in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a> and elsewhere in the <a href="South%20Carolina%20Lowcountry">lowcountry</a> of South Carolina. Through letters to newspapers and stump speeches, he decried the state government as a pit of corruption, stating that officials displayed "ignorance, extravagance and laziness" and that Charleston's <a href="The%20Citadel%2C%20The%20Military%20College%20of%20South%20Carolina">The Citadel</a> was a "military dude factory" that might profitably be repurposed as a school for women.

Governor <a href="John%20Peter%20Richardson%20III">John P. Richardson</a> had been elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought re-nomination, to be met with opposition from Tillman's farmers. As had been done to Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman was a highly talented stump speaker, and when given the opportunity to debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, a gambler and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, which turned down Tillman's demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson's nomination be made unanimous.

One factor that helped Tillman and his movement in the 1890 campaign was the organization of many South Carolina farmers under the auspices of the <a href="Farmers%27%20Alliance">Farmers' Alliance</a>. The Alliance, which had spread through much of the agricultural South and West since its origin in Texas, sought to get farmers to work together cooperatively and seek reform. From that organization would come the <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">People's Party</a> (better known as the Populists). Although the Populist Party played a significant role in the politics of the 1890s, it did not do so in South Carolina, where Tillman had already channeled agricultural discontent into an attempt to take over the Democratic Party. The Alliance in South Carolina generally backed Tillman, and its many local farmers' organizations gave Tillman new venues for his speeches.

In January 1890, Tillmanite leader <a href="George%20Washington%20Shell">George Washington Shell</a> published what came to be known as the "Shell Manifesto" in a Charleston newspaper, setting forth the woes of farmers under the Conservative government, and calling for them to elect delegates to meet in March to recommend a candidate for governor. Both Tillman supporters and Conservatives realized the purpose was to pre-empt the Democratic convention's choice, and fresh, acrimonious debate over the merits of Tillman and his methods began. He and his supporters were often attacked in the newspapers by the Conservatives, but such invective by the hated elites only tended to endear Tillman the more to the farmers who saw him as their champion. Conservatives were certain that once Tillman's voters understood how wealthy he was while speaking for debt-ridden farmers, they would abandon him; they did not.

At the "Shell Convention", state Representative <a href="John%20L.%20M.%20Irby">John L. M. Irby</a> nominated Tillman, stating "shame on the [Democratic] party for stabbing Gary, a man who had saved in us in '76 ... we could now make the amends honorable and choose B. R. Tillman". Although many delegates voted to make no endorsement, Tillman gained a narrow victory for the convention's recommendation. Tillman spent the summer of 1890 making speeches and debating two rivals (former general Bratton and <a href="South%20Carolina%20Attorney%20General">state Attorney General</a> <a href="Joseph%20H.%20Earle">Joseph H. Earle</a>) for the nomination, as the Democratic leadership watched with increasing consternation. Given Tillman's strength at the <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> level, he was likely to be the choice of the Democratic convention in September. Accordingly, the party's Bourbon-controlled state executive committee tried to use the brief August convention (called to set the rules for the September one) to change the nomination method to a primary, in which the anti-Tillman forces would unite behind a single candidate. When the August convention was held, the Tillmanites had a large majority, which they used to oust the executive committee and install one loyal to Tillman. The convention also passed a new party constitution calling for a primary, beginning in 1892. Tillman was duly nominated in September as the Democratic candidate for governor, with Eugene Gary as his running mate for lieutenant governor.

After the convention many Conservative Democrats, though not happy at Tillman's victory, acknowledged him as head of the state party. Those who submitted to Tillman's rule included Hampton and Butler, the state's two U.S. senators. In his campaign, Tillman promoted support for Clemson, establishment of a state women's college, reapportionment of the state legislature (then dominated by the lowcountry counties), and ending the influence of corporation lawyers in that body.

Those Democrats who could not abide Tillman's candidacy held an October meeting with 20 of South Carolina's 35 counties represented, and nominated <a href="Alexander%20Haskell">Alexander Haskell</a> for governor. The announcement that Haskell would run caused a closing of Democratic ranks against him, lest white unity be sundered. The "<a href="News%20and%20Courier">Charleston News and Courier</a>", not always a friend to Tillman, urged, "stand by the ticket, not for the ticket's sake, but for the party and the State". Even most Conservatives would not support a bolt from the party, and Kantrowitz suggested that Haskell and his supporters hated Tillman so much that his nomination caused them to commit political suicide. The Haskell campaign reached out to black voters, pledging that he would not disturb the limited political role played by African Americans in the state, a promise Tillman was unlikely to make.

During Tillman's five years of agricultural advocacy, he had rarely discussed the question of the African American. With blacks given control of one of South Carolina's seven congressional districts, the question of black influence in state politics seemed settled and did not play a significant role in the campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor. Haskell's appeals for support, added to speculation that Tillman was trying to form a biracial coalition through the Farmers' Alliance (which, though segregated, had a parallel organization for black farmers) made race an issue. Tillman boasted of his deeds at Hamburg and Ellenton, but it was Gary who made race the focus of his campaign. Urging segregation of railroad cars, Gary asked, "what white man wants his wife or sister sandwiched between a big bully buck and a saucy wench"?

Although Tillman fully expected to win, he warned that should he be defeated by ballot-box stuffing, there would be war. On Election Day, November 4, 1890, Tillman was elected governor with 59,159 votes to 14,828 for Haskell. With no Republican to support (none had run for governor since 1878), black leaders had been divided as to whether to endorse Haskell; in the end the only two counties won by him were in the lowcountry and heavily African-American. The losing candidate and his white supporters were quickly consigned to political oblivion, with some mocking them as "white Negroes".

Tillman was sworn in as governor in Columbia on December 4, 1890, before a crowd of jubilant supporters, the largest to see South Carolina's governor inaugurated since Hampton's swearing-in. In his inaugural address, Tillman celebrated his victory, "the citizens of this great commonwealth have for the first time in its history demanded and obtained for themselves the right to choose her Governor; and I, as the exponent and leader of the revolution which brought about the change, am here to take the solemn oath of office ... the triumph of democracy and white supremacy over mongrelism and anarchy, of civilization over barbarism, has been most complete."

Tillman made it clear he was not content that African Americans were allowed even a limited role in the political life of South Carolina:

The legislature, at Tillman's recommendation, reapportioned itself, costing <a href="Charleston%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston County</a> four of its twelve seats, and other lowcountry counties one each, with the seats going to the upcountry. Although Tillman sought to reduce public expenditures, he was not successful in doing so as his reform program required spending, and the legislature could find few savings to make. Construction of Clemson College was slowed, and subsidies for fairs were cut.

Among the matters before the new, Tillman-controlled legislature was who should fill the Senate seat held by Hampton, whose term expired in March 1891—until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. There was a call from many in the South Carolina Democratic Party to re-elect Hampton, who had played a major role in the state for the past thirty years, in war and peace. Tillman was embittered against Hampton for a number of slights, including the senator's neutrality in the race against Haskell. The legislature retired Hampton, who received only 43 of 157 votes, and sent Irby to Washington in his place. The ouster of Hampton was controversial, and remained so for decades afterwards; according to Simkins (writing in 1944), "to future generations of South Carolinians, Tillman's act was a ruthless violation of cherished traditions of which Hampton was a living symbol".

Tillman as governor initially took a strong stand against lynching. The Shell Manifesto, in reciting the ills of Conservative government, had blamed the Bourbons for encouraging lynching through bad laws and poor administration. Although Governor Richardson, Tillman's predecessor, had taken action to prevent such murders, they still occurred, with no one being prosecuted for them. In about half of the lynchings in South Carolina between 1881 and 1895, there were claims that the black victim had raped or tried to rape a white woman, though studies have shown that lynchings were tied to economic and social issues. More lynchings took place in South Carolina in the 1890s than in any other decade, and in Edgefield and several other counties, such killings outnumbered lawful executions.
During Tillman's first year in office there were no lynchings, compared with 12 in Richardson's last year, which Simkins attributed to Tillman's "vigorous attitude towards law enforcement". Tillman called out the militia multiple times to prevent lynchings, and corresponded with sheriffs, passing along information and rumors of contemplated lynchings. The governor pressed for a law requiring the segregation of railroad cars: opposed by railroad companies and the few black legislators, the bill passed the state <a href="South%20Carolina%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> but failed in the Senate. Tillman's calls to redistrict away the one congressional district dominated by African Americans, and for a constitutional convention to disenfranchise them also fell in the Senate, where the convention proposal failed to attract the necessary two-thirds majority. The only enactment that struck at the African American in Tillman's first term imposed a prohibitive tax on labor agents, who were recruiting local farm hands to move out of state.

In December 1891, soon after the first anniversary of Tillman's taking office, a black Edgefield man named Dick Lundy was charged with murdering the sheriff's son, and was taken from the jail and lynched. Tillman sent the state solicitor to Edgefield to investigate the matter, and ridiculed the coroner's jury verdict. As usual in cases of lynching, it stated the deceased had been killed by persons unknown. Tillman said, "the law received a wound for every bullet shot into Dick Lundy's body." The "News and Courier" opined that had he been present "with true Edgefield instinct, [Tillman] would probably have been hanging around on the edge of the mob".

In April 1893, Mamie Baxter, a fourteen-year-old girl in <a href="Denmark%2C%20South%20Carolina">Denmark</a>, <a href="Barnwell%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina">Barnwell County</a>, alleged that an African American unknown to her had attempted to attack her. About twenty black men were detained and paraded before her; she stated that Henry Williams looked something like the man she had seen. Placed on what passed for a trial by the mob that took him from the jail, Williams produced several respected white men to support his alibi. A majority of the mob voted against killing him, and Williams was returned to jail. More searches were made for Baxter's attacker. A suspect in the case, John Peterson, appealed to Tillman for protection, fearing he would be lynched if taken to Denmark, and stating he could prove his innocence. Tillman sent Peterson to Denmark with a single guard. He was taken by the mob, put on "trial", and after the mob found him guilty, was murdered. There was widespread outrage among both races across the country, both at the actions of the lynchers and at what Tillman had done. The governor said, in response, that he had assumed that, as the mob had been convinced by Williams' defense, it would allow Peterson to prove his innocence as well. He thereafter ignored the issue of the Denmark lynching.
There were five lynchings in South Carolina during Tillman's first term, and thirteen during his second. Tillman had to walk a narrow line in the debates over lynching, since most of his supporters believed in the collective right of white men in a community to dispense mob justice, especially in cases of alleged rape. Yet as governor, he was sworn to uphold the rule of law. He attempted to finesse the matter by seeking to appeal to both sides, demanding that the law be followed, but that he would, as he stated in 1892, "willingly lead a mob in lynching a Negro who had committed an assault on a white woman". Under criticism, he amended this to a willingness to lead the lynching of "a man of any color who assaults a virtuous woman of any color"—the adjective "virtuous" limiting the commitment, in Tillman's view, to assaults on white women.

During Tillman's second term, he had the legislature pass a bill to abolish elected local government, in favor of gubernatorial appointment of municipal and county officials. Tillman used this law to oust black officials even where that race held a voting majority. In September 1893, South Carolina was hit by storms. Tillman discouraged northerners from sending aid to African Americans, fearing it would result in "lazy, idle crowds [wanting to] draw rations, as in the days of the <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a> ... They cannot be treated as we would white people."

During the 1895 South Carolina state constitutional convention, however, Tillman supported a provision that permitted the removal from office of sheriffs who through negligence or connivance permitted a lynching. He also supported a provision that held the county where the lynching occurred liable for damages of $2,000 or more to be paid to the heirs of the victim.

The question of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition of alcohol</a> was a major issue in South Carolina during Tillman's governorship. Tillman opposed banning alcohol, but was careful to speak well of temperance advocates, many of whom were women. The concern Tillman had with alcohol issues was that they divided the white community, leaving openings for black Republicans to exploit.

In the 1892 election, South Carolinians passed a non-binding referendum calling for prohibition. Bills were introduced into both houses of the state legislature that December to accomplish this, and passed the House of Representatives. Before the House bill could be passed by the Senate, Tillman sent a proposal in the form of an amendment, with instructions to pass the amended bill, and enact nothing else on the subject. Based on a system that had been successful in <a href="Athens%2C%20Georgia">Athens, Georgia</a>, the bill banned the private sale of alcohol, setting up a system of <a href="South%20Carolina%20Dispensary">dispensaries</a> that would sell alcohol in sealed containers—sale by the drink, and consumption on the premises, would not be permitted. Both houses passed Tillman's amendment, though there was opposition both within and outside the legislature. The dispensary system went into effect on July 1, 1893.

The new law was met with considerable resistance, especially in the towns and cities, where Tillman had less support. Dozens of clandestine saloons opened, fueled by barrels of illicit liquor, often transported by railroad. Tillman appointed dispensary constables, who tried to seize such shipments, to be frustrated by the fact that the <a href="South%20Carolina%20Railroad">South Carolina Railroad</a> was in federal receivership, and state authorities could not confiscate goods entrusted to it. All of Tillman's constables were white, placing him at a disadvantage in dealing with the alcohol trade among African Americans. Some of the constables tried going <a href="undercover%20operation">undercover</a> by <a href="blackface">blacking their faces</a> like <a href="minstrel%20show">minstrels</a>; later, Tillman hired an African-American detective from Georgia.

The small city of <a href="Darlington%2C%20South%20Carolina">Darlington</a> became a center of the <a href="Rum-running">bootlegging</a> trade, with many illegal saloons. Tillman repeatedly warned the local mayor to crack down; when this did not occur, in April 1894, Tillman sent a train full of constables and other enforcement personnel to Darlington. They were repelled by gunfire, with dead on both sides. Tillman called out the state militia, which put down the unrest, though some units refused to serve. After the incident, Tillman disbanded the units of the militia that had refused his orders, and organized new companies to serve in their place. The Darlington riot divided the state politically as Tillman prepared to seek Butler's seat in the Senate, which would be filled by the legislature in December 1894.

Only weeks after the Darlington affair, the <a href="South%20Carolina%20Supreme%20Court">South Carolina Supreme Court</a> declared the act creating the dispensary system in violation of the state constitution on the grounds that the government had no right to run a profit-making business. The vote was 2–1, with Justice Samuel McGowan in the majority. McGowan was a <a href="lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">lame duck</a> in office; Lieutenant Governor Gary had been elected to fill his seat effective August 1, 1894. Tillman closed the dispensaries temporarily, resulting in prohibition in South Carolina, and fired the constables. He had taken the precaution, once the court agreed to take the dispensary case, of having the 1893 legislature pass a revised dispensary law. When Gary took the bench, the Tillmanites would have a majority on the state Supreme Court, and Tillman instructed trial justices not to hear challenges to the 1893 law until after August 1. Tillman kept the law suspended until then, afterwards reopening the dispensaries under that statute. The high court declared the 1893 act constitutional on October 8, 1894, 2–1, with Gary voting in the majority.

Elected with support from the Farmers' Alliance and as a result of agricultural protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.

Tillman spoke at the opening of Clemson College on July 6, 1893. He fulfilled his campaign promise to start a women's college. In 1891, the legislature passed a bill creating the South Carolina Industrial and Winthrop Normal College (today <a href="Winthrop%20University">Winthrop University</a>). He took a personal interest in the bidding by various towns around the state for the new school, and supported the successful candidate, the progressive town of <a href="Rock%20Hill%2C%20South%20Carolina">Rock Hill</a>, on the state's northern border. Rock Hill officials had offered land, cash, and building materials. The school, then admitting only white women, opened in October 1895, after Tillman had become a senator.

Tillman sought election to a second two-year term in 1892, presenting himself as a reforming alternative to the Conservatives. In the campaign, Tillman was a strong supporter of <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a> or <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a>, making silver <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> at the historic ratio to gold of 16:1. Such a policy would inflate the currency, and Tillman felt that would make it easier for the farmer to repay debts. The rhetoric of free silver suited Tillman as well, as he could make himself appear the champion of the farmer against the powerful interests that had committed the "<a href="Crime%20of%20%2773">Crime of '73</a>" (as silver supporters termed the act ending bimetallism in the United States).

Announcing that a primary for 1892, as had been prescribed two years before, was anti-reform, Tillman put off the first Democratic gubernatorial primary in the state until 1894. Thus, the nominee would be chosen by a convention, and mid-1892 saw a lengthy series of debates between Tillman and his challenger, former governor <a href="John%20C.%20Sheppard">John C. Sheppard</a>. The bitter campaign was marked by violence, often set off by provocative language from the candidates. According to Kantrowitz, Tillman "sought to prolong the confrontation, to take the crowd up to the edge of violence, demonstrating his identification with his farmers without quite provoking them to murder". When former senator Hampton attempted to speak on Sheppard's behalf, he was shouted down by Tillman partisans; opponents complained that Tillman's supporters had formed a mob, and that the governor was a true son of violent Edgefield.

As the likely Democratic presidential candidate for 1892, former president <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, was a staunch opponent of free silver, Tillman attacked Cleveland. Most of the South Carolina delegation, including Tillman, voted against Cleveland at <a href="1892%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">the convention</a>, but when the former president was nominated, the governor worked to deliver South Carolina for Cleveland by an overwhelming margin. Cleveland was elected, but the new president was offended by Tillman's earlier attacks, and denied the governor any role in patronage in South Carolina, entrusting it to Senator Matthew Butler and other remaining Conservatives. Tillman's inability to provide federal jobs for supporters made it more difficult for him to hold his coalition together. Tillman continued his verbal assaults, stating that Cleveland "is an old bag of beef and I am going to Washington with a pitchfork and prod him in his old fat ribs"—thus popularizing Tillman as "Pitchfork Ben".

During the 1892 campaign, Tillman called for the defeat in the Democratic primary for the legislature of most of the men elected as his supporters, urging the selection of more loyal men. Tillman urged the voters, "turn out this cattle, these driftwood legislators, and send me a legislature that will do what I say, and I'll show you reform." South Carolinians dutifully voted out their representatives as Tillman requested. Although no primary for governor was permitted, the delegates to the nominating convention were elected by the Democratic voters, and Tillman won an overwhelming victory over Sheppard, who took only 4 of 35 counties. The convention was mostly Tillmanite, and gave the governor an easy triumph. The Conservatives had agreed not to bolt the party, and Tillman won uncontested re-election.

Tillman had long seen a Senate seat as a logical next step once he concluded his time as governor. Senator Butler, whose term expired in March 1895, had soon after the 1890 election begun to shift his positions towards Tillman's, hoping to retain Conservative backing while appealing to the governor's supporters. The senator signed on to most demands of the Farmers' Alliance, and did not support the forces trying to prevent Tillman's re-nomination in 1892. Butler's seeming apostasy disheartened Conservatives, who did not bother to run candidates for the legislature in many counties in 1894, abandoning the field (and Butler's Senate seat) to the Tillmanites. The governor took nothing for granted, seeing to it that popular candidates, loyal to him, ran for the legislature. In addition to electing Tillman to the Senate, these legislators could help preserve his gubernatorial legacy, including the dispensary.

Butler was aware of the uphill struggle he faced, and called for a primary for senator, with all Democratic legislators committed to vote to elect the winner. Tillman, who had already finalized his plans to win in the legislature, refused. The series of debates that marked a campaign in South Carolina began on June 18, 1894. Butler believed he could still win by appealing to the electorate in the same manner as Tillman; the senator thought he understood the lessons of 1876 as well as anyone. In the debates, Butler and Tillman matched slander for slander, with Butler claiming that at Hamburg, when the shooting started, Tillman was "nowhere to be found". Tillman shot back that when Butler had testified before Congress about Hamburg, he had downplayed his role in the events. According to Kantrowitz, "their struggle over the legacy of 1876 was in part over who could more legitimately claim to have murdered" African Americans. Tillman's partisans shouted down Butler when he tried to speak at some debates. Although this tactic had been used by Butler and other Democrats against the Republicans in 1876, Butler now decried it as "not Christian civilization to howl anyone down".

Balked again, Butler attempted to turn the campaign personal, calling Tillman a liar and trying to strike him. Tillman warned that Butler's tactics risked sundering white unity, stating to a questioner who asked why he did not meet Butler's insults with violence, "Yes, I tell you, you cowardly hound, why I took them [the insults], and I'll meet you wherever you want to. I took them because I, as governor of the State, could not afford to create a row at a public meeting and have our people murder each other like dogs."

By early July, Butler had realized the futility of his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking much of the drama from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman was elected to the Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.

Throughout his time as governor, Tillman had sought a convention to rewrite South Carolina's Reconstruction-era constitution. His main purpose in doing so was to <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disenfranchise</a> African Americans. They opposed Tillman's proposal, as did others, who had seen previous efforts to restrict the franchise rebound against white voters. Tillman was successful in getting the legislature to place a referendum for a constitutional convention on the November 1894 general election ballot. It passed by 2,000 votes statewide, the narrow margin gained, according to Kantrowitz, most likely through fraud. <a href="John%20Gary%20Evans">John Gary Evans</a> was elected Tillman's successor as governor.

Opponents sued in the courts to overturn the referendum result; they were unsuccessful. During the convention, Tillman hailed it as "a fitting capstone to the triumphal arch which the common people have erected to liberty, progress, and Anglo-Saxon civilization since 1890". To assure white unity, Tillman allowed the election of Conservatives as about a third of delegates. The convention assembled in Columbia in September 1895, consisting of 112 Tillmanites, 42 Conservatives, and six African Americans. Tillman called black disenfranchisement "the sole cause of our being here".

Tillman was the dominant figure of the convention, chairing the Committee on the Rights of Suffrage, which was to craft language to accomplish the disenfranchisement. Constrained by the requirement of the federal <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a> that men of all races be allowed to vote, the committee sought language that though superficially nondiscriminatory would operate or could be used to take the vote from most African Americans.

Tillman spoke to the convention on October 31. In addition to supporting the provisions of the draft document, he recalled 1876:

The adopted provisions, which came into force after the new constitution was ratified by the convention in December 1895, set a maze of obstacles before prospective voters. Voters had to be a resident of the state two years, the county one year, and the precinct for four months. Many African Americans were itinerant laborers, and this provision disproportionately affected them. A <a href="poll%20tax%20%28United%20States%29">poll tax</a> had to be paid six months in advance of the election, in May when laborers had the least cash. Each registrant had to prove to the satisfaction of the county board of elections that he could read or write a section of the state constitution (in a literacy or comprehension test), or that he paid taxes on property valued at $300 or more. This allowed white registrars ample discretion to disenfranchise African Americans. Illiterate whites were shielded by the "understanding" clause, that allowed, until 1898, permanent registration to citizens who could "understand" the constitution when read to them. This also allowed officials great leeway to discriminate. Even if an African American maneuvered past all of these blocks, he still faced the manager of the polling place, who could demand proof he had paid all taxes owed—something difficult to show conclusively. Conviction of one of a long list of crimes that whites believed prevalent among African Americans was made the cause of permanent disenfranchisement, including bigamy, adultery, burglary, and arson. Convicted murderers not in prison had their franchise undisturbed.

By early 1896, many in the Democratic Party were bitterly opposed to President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then in the third year of a deep recession, the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>. Cleveland was a firm supporter of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the <a href="Sherman%20Silver%20Purchase%20Act">Sherman Silver Purchase Act</a>, which he believed had helped cause it. <a href="John%20Sherman">Sherman</a>'s act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the <a href="Pullman%20strike">Pullman strike</a>, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.
From the time of his swearing-in in December 1895 (when Congress began its annual session), Tillman was seen as the voice of the dissatisfied in the nation; the "<a href="New%20York%20Press%20%28historical%29">New York Press</a>" stated Tillman would voice the concerns of "the masses of the people of South Carolina far more faithfully than did the Bourbon politician Butler". He shocked the Senate with dramatic attacks on Cleveland, calling the president "the most gigantic failure of any man who ever occupied the White House, all because of his vanity and obstinacy". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" deemed Tillman "a filthy baboon, accidentally seated in the Senate chamber".

Tillman believed that the nation was on the verge of major political change, and that he could be elected president in 1896, uniting the silver supporters of the South and West. He was willing to consider a third party bid if Cleveland kept control of the Democratic Party, but felt the Populists, by allowing African Americans to seek office, had destroyed their credibility among southern whites. The stinging oratory of the South Carolina senator brought him national prominence, and with the <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1896 Democratic National Convention</a> in Chicago likely to be controlled by silver supporters, Tillman was spoken of as a possible presidential candidate along with others, such as former Missouri representative <a href="Richard%20P.%20Bland">Richard P. Bland</a>, Texas Governor <a href="James%20Hogg">James Hogg</a>, and former Nebraska congressman <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>.

Tillman was his state's <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a> candidate, and its representative on the Committee on Resolutions (often called "the Platform Committee"). The platform had the support of the pro-silver majority of the committee, but the gold minority, led by New York Senator <a href="David%20B.%20Hill">David B. Hill</a>, opposed its support of free silver, and wanted to take the disagreement to the convention floor. With one hour and fifteen minutes allocated to each side, Tillman and Bryan were selected as the speakers in favor of the draft platform. Bryan asked Tillman if he wanted to open or close the debate; the senator wanted to close, but sought fifty minutes to do so. The Nebraskan replied that Hill would oppose such a long closing address, and Tillman agreed to open the debate, with Bryan to close it.

When the platform debate began in the <a href="Chicago%20Coliseum">Chicago Coliseum</a> on the morning of July 9, 1896, Tillman was the opening speaker. Although met with applause and shouts of his name, he "spoke in the same manner that had won him success in South Carolina, cursing, haranguing his enemies, and raising the specter of sectionalism. He, however, thoroughly alienated the national audience". According to Richard Bensel in his study of the 1896 convention, Tillman gave "by far, the most divisive speech of the convention, an address that embarrassed the silver wing of the party as much as it enraged the hard-money faction". He deemed silver a sectional issue, pitting the wealthy East against the oppressed South and West. This upset delegates, who wished to view silver as a patriotic, national issue, and some voiced their dissent, disagreeing with Tillman. The senator alternately offended, confused, and bored the delegates, who shouted for Tillman to stop even though less than half of his time had expired. Beset by shouting delegates and one of the convention bands, which unexpectedly appeared and began to play, Tillman nevertheless pressed on, "the audience might just as well understand that I am going to have my say if I stand here until sundown." By the time he had his say, he had "effectively destroyed his chances to become a national candidate". With Tillman's candidacy stillborn (only his home state voted for him), Bryan seized the opportunity to deliver an address in support of silver that did not rely on sectionalism. His <a href="Cross%20of%20Gold%20speech">Cross of Gold speech</a> won him the presidential nomination.
After Tillman returned from Chicago to South Carolina, he suggested he had delivered an intentionally radical speech so as to allow Bryan to look statesmanlike by comparison. This interpretation was mocked by his enemies. Tillman is not known to have otherwise discussed his feelings at the failure of his presidential bid, and the political grief was likely overwhelmed by personal sadness a week after the convention when his beloved daughter Addie died, struck by lightning on a North Carolina mountain. Tillman campaigned for Bryan, but was a favorite target of cartoonists denigrating the Democratic candidate and supporting the Republican, former Ohio governor <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>. Bryan had also been nominated by the Populists, who selected their own vice presidential candidate, Georgia's <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Watson">Thomas E. Watson</a>. Tillman was active in efforts to get Watson to withdraw, having a 12-hour meeting with the candidate, apparently without result. Tillman traveled widely to speak on Bryan's behalf, and drew large crowds, but his speeches were of little significance. Despite undertaking <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">an arduous campaign</a>, Bryan lost the election. Simkins suggested that Tillman, by helping forge an image of the Democratic Party as anarchic, contributed to Bryan's defeat.

Kantrowitz deemed Tillman "the Senate's wild man", who applied the same techniques of accusation and insinuation that had served him well in South Carolina. In 1897, Tillman accused the Republicans, "I certainly do not want to attack any member of the committee who does not deserve to be attacked [but] nobody denies that there have been rooms occupied for two months by the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee at the Arlington Hotel ... in easy reach of the sugar trust". Simkins, though, opined that Tillman's speeches in the Senate were only inflammatory because of his injection of personalities, and if that is disregarded, his speeches, when read, come across as well-reasoned and even conservative.

In 1902, Tillman accused his junior colleague from South Carolina, <a href="John%20L.%20McLaurin">John L. McLaurin</a>, of corruption in a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the <a href="Sergeant%20at%20Arms%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">Sergeant at Arms</a> and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.

The fracas with McLaurin caused President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who had succeeded the <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">assassinated McKinley</a> in 1901, to withdraw an invitation to dinner at the White House. Tillman never forgave this slight, and became a bitter enemy of Roosevelt. Tillman was inclined to oppose Roosevelt anyway, who soon after becoming president had dined at the White House with <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a>, an African American, provoking Tillman to say, "the action of President Roosevelt in entertaining that nigger will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they learn their place again."

Tillman believed, and often stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white domination or extermination. He was reluctant to undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina in late 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington</a>, but white supremacists <a href="Wilmington%20insurrection%20of%201898">took it over by force</a>. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in <a href="Phoenix%20election%20riot">Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation</a>, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.

Beginning in 1901, Tillman joined the <a href="Chautauqua">Chautauqua</a> circuit, giving well-paid speeches throughout the nation. Tillman's reputation, both for his views and his oratory, attracted large crowds. Tillman informed them that African Americans were inferior to the white man, but were not baboons, though some were "so near akin to the monkey that scientists are yet looking for the missing link". Given that in Africa, they were an "ignorant and debased and debauched race" with a record of "barbarism, savagery, cannibalism and everything that is low and degrading", it was the "quintessence of folly" to believe that the black man should be placed on an equal footing with his white counterpart. Tillman "embraced segregation as divinely imperative".

Tillman told the Senate, "as governor of South Carolina, I proclaimed that, although I had taken the oath of office to support the law and enforce it, I would lead a mob to lynch any man, black or white, who ravished a woman, black or white." He told his colleagues, "I have three daughters, but, so help me God, I had rather find either one of them killed by a tiger or a bear [and die a virgin] than to have her crawl to me and tell me the horrid story that she had been robbed of the jewel of her womanhood by a black fiend." In 1907, he told the senators about the <a href="Ellenton%20riot%20of%201876">Ellenton riot of 1876</a>, "it was then that we shot them; it was then that we killed them; it was then that we stuffed the ballot-boxes." 

As South Carolina's economy changed in the early 20th century, with textile mills being built, Tillman complained that some African Americans were evading the supervision they would have on the farm, fearing the threat to white women. He admitted that it would be unjust to kill all of these workers, "because we might kill some innocent men, but we can keep them on the chain gang".

Tillman was an early and fervent backer of <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">war with Spain</a> in 1898. However, he opposed taking the Spanish colonies such as Puerto Rico and the Philippines, both because he considered it wrong to annex people to the United States without their consent, and out of opposition to adding territories with large numbers of non-whites. Tillman mocked the Republicans, most of whom supported annexation rather than self-determination, stating that it was that party that since 1860 had claimed "that all men, including the Negro, are free and equal," and was annoyed when they refused to admit their positions were inconsistent.

In 1906, Roosevelt backed the <a href="Hepburn%20Act">Hepburn Bill</a>, imposing railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially wanted nothing to do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader <a href="Nelson%20Aldrich">Nelson Aldrich</a> entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.

This activity caused a public reassessment of Tillman, who was best known for giving speeches that shocked the North and made even southerners cringe. Writers suggested he was merely presenting an image as "Pitchfork Ben", that he could turn on and off as needed. He came to be regarded in the North as acceptable and even respectable, with some suggesting he had matured during his time in the Senate. "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>" compared Tillman with a coconut, hard, rough, and shaggy on the outside, but within, "the milk of human kindness".

Tillman was the primary sponsor of the <a href="Tillman%20Act">Tillman Act</a>, the first federal <a href="campaign%20finance%20reform">campaign finance reform</a> law, which was passed in 1907 and which banned corporate contributions in federal political campaigns. Justice <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a> has suggested that Tillman's motivation in introducing this legislation was to reduce the power of corporations which tended to favor Republicans and African Americans.

When Tillman entered the Senate in 1895, he was opposed to expansion of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, fearing the expenditure would cause the issuance of bonds by the president, which he felt would only enrich the wealthy. Tillman sat on the Senate <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Committee on Naval Affairs</a>, and soon came to understand that South Carolina could benefit from naval appropriations steered towards her. A flow of federal funds to his home state resulted, beginning in 1900, followed by the establishment, in 1909, of the <a href="Charleston%20Naval%20Shipyard">Charleston Naval Shipyard</a>. Once Democrats took control of the Senate for the first time in Tillman's tenure, in 1913, he became chairman of the committee and allied with others from the southeast (such as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Navy Secretary</a> <a href="Josephus%20Daniels">Josephus Daniels</a>, a North Carolinian) to see that the bulk of naval appropriations would be spent there. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (57th through 59th Congresses) and on the Committee on <a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a> of Indians (61st and 62nd Congresses). Strokes in 1908 and 1910 decreased his influence and ability in the Senate; his seniority entitled him to become <a href="Senate%20Appropriations%20Committee">Senate Appropriations Committee</a> chairman in 1913, but his health did not permit it.
President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> was inaugurated in 1913, the first Democrat to hold the office since Cleveland. Tillman supported Wilson's legislation in the Senate, except on <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>, where he was a strong opponent. He was uneasy when Wilson's <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>, Bryan, tried to prevent war through treaty-making, describing the former presidential candidate as the "evangel of peace at any price". When the United States entered <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Tillman was a strong supporter, seeing the conflict as democratic nations against German "slaves ... and not free men at all". Although he urged vigilance against spies, once he was satisfied that the accusations against German-born <a href="Friedrich%20Johannes%20Hugo%20von%20Engelken">Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken</a>, president of the <a href="Federal%20Land%20Bank">Federal Land Bank</a> at Columbia, were unfounded, he spoke in support of the man.

Tillman had been re-elected in 1901 and 1907. By 1912, the Democratic nominee, who would be elected by the overwhelming Democratic majority in the legislature, was determined by a primary. A primary was also used for governor, and Tillman ran at the same time as Governor <a href="Cole%20Blease">Cole Blease</a>, who also sought re-election. Blease, also an outspoken white supremacist, had entered politics as a Tillmanite legislator in 1890, and breaking from him, adopted similar techniques to Tillman's to appeal to poor farm workers and mill hands. Tillman faced two opponents in his re-nomination bid—his control over South Carolina politics had deteriorated over the years, and he had moved towards the Conservatives. He had not endorsed Blease in 1910. The two men reached an agreement that Tillman would remain neutral in the governor's race in 1912, but Tillman became convinced Blease could not win against former state chief justice <a href="Ira%20B.%20Jones">Ira B. Jones</a>. Both sides claimed to have letters from Tillman endorsing their candidate, but three days before the primary, Tillman condemned Blease and endorsed Jones. Blease, outraged, alleged betrayal, accused Tillman of "insane jealousy", and said of the senator, "possibly his mind has become more diseased of late than it was when I had my last talk with his confidential physician". Both men were re-elected.

The <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment</a>, ratified in 1913, gave the people the right to elect senators, but this made little difference in South Carolina, where the Democratic primary remained decisive. Tillman in 1914 announced plans to retire when his term expired in 1919, but the war and the threat that Blease would win the open seat caused him to announce his candidacy for a fifth term in March 1918. Tillman remained for the most part in Washington, and did not campaign, but came to Columbia for the state Democratic convention in May to discredit rumors about his health, which was indeed poor. He got Wilson to persuade one of his rivals, Congressman <a href="Asbury%20F.%20Lever">Asbury F. Lever</a>, to abandon the race, and considered how to do the same to Blease. These plans had not yet come to fruition when Tillman was stricken by a <a href="cerebral%20hemorrhage">cerebral hemorrhage</a> at the end of June, and died July 3, 1918 in Washington, D.C. He is buried in Ebenezer Cemetery, <a href="Trenton%2C%20South%20Carolina">Trenton, South Carolina</a>.

Tillman's death generated a large number of tributes to him in the Senate, which were afterwards collected in book form. One copy came into the hands of Blease, who was angry that Tillman was being lauded, and stated that the late senator was not what he had seemed. He wrote in front of the volume, "Don't believe me, but look up his life & see."

According to Orville Burton, "Tillman's legacy for South Carolina and the nation is controversial and disturbing. White and black South Carolinians interpret Tillman's accomplishments in contradictory ways." A national hero to white supremacists, according to an article on Tillman for "<a href="The%20Journal%20of%20Blacks%20in%20Higher%20Education">The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education</a>", "for African Americans, he was the 'devil incarnate. No African American was elected to Congress under the 1895 constitution until the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, nor were any elected to statewide or county office after 1900.

Simkins, a son of Edgefield, while recognizing faults in Tillman's racial policies, stated that "no South Carolinian, with the single exception of Calhoun, has ever made a profounder impression on his generation than Tillman." The late senator's supporters and protégés remained long in South Carolina, encouraging a view of Tillman as a great man in state and national history. <a href="James%20F.%20Byrnes">James F. Byrnes</a>, for example, repeated Tillman's themes of race war on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1919. In 1940, Byrnes, by then a senator and soon to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, dedicated a statue of Tillman outside the <a href="South%20Carolina%20State%20House">South Carolina State House</a> and called him the state's "first New Dealer". Protestors have since asked for that statue to be removed. Others who knew and at one time admired Tillman included <a href="Strom%20Thurmond">Strom Thurmond</a>, son of Tillman's Edgefield attorney, who saw and was inspired by Tillman's campaigning style as a boy. Other southerners were highly negative: <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> said of Tillman, "He might have been president. I'd like to sit down with him and ask how it was to throw it away for the sake of hating."
Simkins noted that Tillman "rose above the handicap of his radical views, his obstreperousness, and the insularity of his issues to become a considerable force in national politics". Historian I. M. Newby deemed Tillmanism the closest thing to a mass movement in the history of white South Carolinians, and one that dominated the state for a generation. "To students of black history and racial equality its most striking features are the extent to which it expressed the desire of white Carolinians to dominate blacks and the fact that much of its unity and force derived from its antiblack racial policies." Tillman's movement took power from the Bourbon Democrats in South Carolina, but a greater price was paid, electorally and in lives, by African Americans.

In 1962, Main Building on the campus of Winthrop College was renamed <a href="Tillman%20Hall">Tillman Hall</a> in his honor. Clemson University also has a Tillman Hall, though efforts have been made to change the name. Kantrowitz argued that Tillman deserves little credit for what have become important southern schools, integrated and coeducational:

HMS Ark Royal (91)

HMS "Ark Royal" (<a href="pennant%20number">pennant number</a> 91) was an <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> that served during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

Designed in 1934 to fit the restrictions of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, "Ark Royal" was built by <a href="Cammell%20Laird">Cammell Laird and Company Ltd.</a> at <a href="Birkenhead">Birkenhead</a>, England, and completed in November 1938. Her design differed from previous aircraft carriers. "Ark Royal" was the first ship on which the hangars and <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> were an integral part of the hull, instead of an add-on or part of the <a href="wikt%3Asuperstructure">superstructure</a>. Designed to carry a large number of aircraft, she had two hangar deck levels. She served during a period that first saw the extensive use of naval air power; several carrier tactics were developed and refined aboard "Ark Royal".

"Ark Royal" served in some of the most active naval theatres of the Second World War. She was involved in the first aerial and U-boat kills of the war, <a href="Allied%20campaign%20in%20Norway">operations off Norway</a>, the <a href="Last%20battle%20of%20the%20battleship%20Bismarck">search for the German battleship</a> , and the <a href="Malta%20Convoys">Malta Convoys</a>. "Ark Royal" survived several near misses and gained a reputation as a 'lucky ship'. She was torpedoed on 13 November 1941 by the German submarine and sank the following day; one of her 1,488 crew members was killed. Her sinking was the subject of several inquiries; investigators were keen to know how the carrier was lost, in spite of efforts to save the ship and tow her to the naval base at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. They found that several design flaws contributed to the loss, which were rectified in new British carriers.

The wreck was discovered in December 2002 by an American underwater survey company using sonar mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle, under contract from the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> for the filming of a documentary about the ship, at a depth of about 1000 metres and approximately from Gibraltar.

In 1923, the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> prepared a 10-year building programme which included an aircraft carrier and 300 aircraft for the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a>. The economic downturn following the First World War caused it to be postponed. In 1930, the Director of Naval Construction, Sir Arthur Johns, began to update the plans for the carrier by incorporating recently developed technology. His aim was to increase the number of aircraft carried by shortening the landing and take-off distances of aircraft using <a href="Arresting%20gear">arrestor gear</a> and <a href="Aircraft%20catapult">compressed steam catapults</a> respectively, which would make more deck space available for storage and aircraft preparation. Along with the inclusion of two hangar decks, this allowed "Ark Royal" to carry up to 72 aircraft, although the development of larger and heavier aircraft during the carrier's construction meant that the actual number carried was between 50 and 60. Ark Royal featured an enclosed hangar design where the flight deck was the 'strength deck' and was strongly built with .75in (19mm) thick Ducol steel plating.[2] The two hangar decks were thus enclosed within the hull girder, which also gave splinter protection to the hangars. The machinery spaces were protected by <a href="belt%20armour">belt armour</a>. Three lifts moved aircraft between the hangars and the flight deck.
Another feature was the length and height of the flight deck. At , the flight deck was longer than the keel; the latter dictated by the length of Royal Navy drydocks in <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. Due to the twin hangar decks, the flight deck rose to above the waterline.

The <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington</a> and <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval treaties</a> had restricted warship tonnage for a number of nations after the end of the great war and were both to expire by the end of 1936. With a potential naval arms race developing between Britain, Japan and Italy, the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Government">British government</a> sought a <a href="Second%20London%20Naval%20Treaty">second treaty</a>, which included limiting the maximum displacement of an aircraft carrier to . "Ark Royal" would have to fit this anticipated limit; to conserve weight, armour plating was limited to the belt, engine rooms, and <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a>, while <a href="welding">welding</a> instead of <a href="rivet">rivet</a>ing 65% of the hull saved . Installation of an <a href="armoured%20flight%20deck">armoured flight deck</a> was not possible, as the weight would have placed "Ark Royal" above the proposed limit, while reducing her endurance and stability. The ship was designed with a three layer <a href="side%20protection%20system">side protection system</a> based upon a void-liquid-void scheme very similar to that used on the <a href="King%20George%20V-class%20battleship%20%281939%29%23Underwater%20protection">"King George V"-class</a> battleships, and was designed to protect against torpedoes with up to a warhead.

The ship was fitted with six boilers, which powered three Parsons geared turbines. The turbines were connected via three driveshafts to three propellers in diameter, to produce a maximum theoretical speed of . Speed was important, as with catapults and arrestor gear, "Ark Royal" would have to turn into the wind to launch and recover aircraft. To avoid endangering other ships with the frequent course changes associated with flight operations, "Ark Royal" would have to break away from accompanying ships, and catch up on completion. Additionally, as the carrier was not armed for ship-to-ship combat, speed was her main protection against enemy warships.

The deteriorating international situation by 1933, typified by Germany's rearmament and the expansion of Japan and Italy, convinced the British to announce funds for the carrier's construction in the 1934 budget proposals. The plans were finished by November 1934 and were tendered in February 1935 to <a href="Cammell%20Laird">Cammell Laird and Company Ltd.</a>, which calculated the cost of the hull at <a href="British%20pound">£</a>1,496,250 () and the main machinery at approximately £500,000 (equivalent to £31,850,000 in 2016). The overall cost was estimated to be over £3 million, making "Ark Royal" the most expensive ship ordered by the Royal Navy. Construction began on Job No. 1012 when "Ark Royal"s keel was laid down on 16 September 1935.
"Ark Royal" spent nearly two years in the builder's yard before being launched on 13 April 1937 by <a href="Maud%20Hoare%2C%20Viscountess%20Templewood">Lady Maud Hoare</a>, wife of <a href="Samuel%20Hoare%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Templewood">Sir Samuel Hoare</a>, then <a href="Lord%20Commissioner%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>. The bottle of champagne thrown against "Ark Royal"s bows did not smash until the fourth attempt. The carrier spent a year <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a>, was handed over to her first commander, <a href="Arthur%20John%20Power">Captain Arthur Power</a>, on 16 November 1938, and was commissioned on 16 December. Although intended for the Far East, events in Europe during the carrier's construction, including the <a href="Second%20Italo-Abyssinian%20War">Italian invasion of Abyssinia</a> in 1935 and the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> in 1936, caused the Admiralty to mark her for deployment with the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean Fleets</a>. After her crew joined at the end of 1938, "Ark Royal" underwent <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s to prepare for service, during which the carrier proved capable of sailing above her theoretical speed, reaching over and in trials during May 1938 "Ark Royal" achieved with at a deep displacement of .

"Ark Royal"s armament was designed with <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft warfare</a> in mind, as aircraft were expected to be the main threat; ships and submarines could be outrun or dealt with by escorts. Her main armament was sixteen <a href="QF%204.5%20inch%20naval%20gun">quick-firing</a> <a href="dual%20purpose%20gun">dual purpose gun</a>s in eight double turrets, four on each side of the hull, controlled by four <a href="Gun%20Director">Director</a>s using the <a href="High%20Angle%20Control%20System">High Angle Control System</a>. The original design placed the turrets low on the hull, but was later altered to locate them just below the flight deck, which increased each turret's <a href="Field%20of%20fire%20%28weaponry%29">field of fire</a>. Six 8-barrelled <a href="QF%202-pounder%20naval%20gun">2-pounder () "pom-pom" gun</a>s were located on the flight deck, in front of and behind the superstructure island, while eight 4-barrelled machine guns were installed on small projecting platforms to the front and rear of the flight deck.

Sixteen <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> squadrons were posted aboard "Ark Royal" during her career; an average of five squadrons at any time. On entering service, most of "Ark Royal"s squadrons were equipped with either <a href="Blackburn%20Skua">Blackburn Skua</a>s—used as fighters and dive bombers—or <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a>, for reconnaissance and torpedo bombing. From April 1940, squadrons equipped with Skuas were upgraded to <a href="Fairey%20Fulmar">Fairey Fulmar</a>s; like their predecessors, these were used as fighters and bombers. On occasion, the carrier operated <a href="Blackburn%20Roc">Blackburn Roc</a> fighter-bombers (from April 1939 – October 1940) and <a href="Fairey%20Albacore">Fairey Albacore</a> torpedo bombers (during October 1941); these were replacement aircraft used to boost squadron numbers. In June 1940, "Ark Royal" was host to <a href="701%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">701 Naval Air Squadron</a>, a training squadron which operated <a href="Supermarine%20Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a> reconnaissance <a href="amphibious%20aircraft">amphibians</a>.

The outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939 had been presaged by Germany's <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> fleet taking up positions off the British coast, where they could intercept British shipping. Within hours of the war starting, the passenger ship was torpedoed by , the first of over 65,000 tons of shipping sunk by U-boats during the first week of the war. "Ark Royal" was deployed with the Home Fleet in the <a href="Western%20Approaches">North Western Approaches</a> as part of a "hunter-killer" group, consisting of a flotilla of destroyers and other anti-submarine vessels grouped around an aircraft carrier; either , or "Ark Royal". Carrier-borne aircraft could increase the area searched for U-boats, but made the carriers tempting targets.

On 14 September, "Ark Royal" received a distress call from , which was away under pursuit from the surfaced "U-30". "Ark Royal" launched aircraft to aid the merchant ship, but was spotted by , which launched two torpedoes. Lookouts spotted the torpedo tracks and "Ark Royal" turned towards the attack, reducing her cross-section and causing the torpedoes to miss and explode harmlessly astern. Three <a href="E%20and%20F-class%20destroyer">F-class destroyer</a>s escorting the carrier began to <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a> "U-39", and forced her to the surface. The German crew abandoned ship before "U-39" sank—the first U-boat lost during the war. "Ark Royal"s aircraft reached "Fanad Head", which was in the hands of a German boarding party. The Skuas unsuccessfully attacked "U-30": two crashed when caught by the blast of their own bombs. The U-boat escaped after rescuing the boarding party and the pilots of the downed aircraft (both observers had drowned), and torpedoing the "Fanad Head".

"Ark Royal" returned to base in <a href="Loch%20Ewe">Loch Ewe</a>, where she and her crew were inspected by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. The sinking of "U-39" was hailed as important to morale. However, the failed attack on "Ark Royal", and the successful attack on "Courageous" on 17 September, convinced the Admiralty it was too dangerous to risk aircraft carriers in this way, and carrier-centred hunter-killer groups were abandoned.

On 25 September, "Ark Royal" helped rescue the submarine , which had been damaged by German warships off Horn Reefs, in the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>. While returning to port with "Spearfish" and the battleships and on 26 September, the ships were located by three "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" <a href="Dornier%20Do%2018">Dornier Do 18</a> <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>s. "Ark Royal" launched three <a href="Blackburn%20Skua">Blackburn Skua</a>s to disperse them; one Dornier was shot down in the first British aerial kill of the war.

The air commander aboard "Ark Royal"—aware that the surviving Dorniers would report the location of the British ships—ordered the aircraft to be secured and the anti-aircraft weapons readied. Four <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Junkers Ju 88</a> <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s of the "Luftwaffe" bomber wing <a href="KG%2030">KG 30</a> soon appeared: three were driven away by anti-aircraft fire, but the fourth launched a bomb at the carrier. "Ark Royal" turned hard to starboard, heeling over and avoiding the bomb, which landed in the ocean off her starboard bow and sent a spout of water over the ship. The German pilots did not see if the carrier had been hit, and a reconnaissance flight later located the two battleships, but not "Ark Royal". Based on this information, the Germans incorrectly claimed that "Ark Royal" had sunk. To prove the German propaganda false before it had a negative effect on Britain's allies, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> personally reassured United States President <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> that the carrier was undamaged and invited the US naval attaché to view "Ark Royal" in dock. The British naval attaché in Rome was instructed to assure Italian Prime Minister <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> that the ship was still in service. This was an embarrassment for <a href="Goebbels">Goebbels</a> and <a href="Nazi%20propaganda">Nazi propaganda</a>.

In October 1939, "Ark Royal" was redeployed to <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a> to operate off the African coast in the hunt for the German <a href="commerce%20raider">commerce raider</a> . The carrier was assigned to <a href="Force%20K">Force K</a>, and sailed with the battlecruiser to the South Atlantic. On 9 October, aircraft from "Ark Royal" spotted the <a href="German%20tanker%20Altmark">German tanker "Altmark"</a>, which supplied "Graf Spee". The tanker was disguised as the US vessel "Delmar", which fooled the British into passing her by. On 5 November, "Ark Royal" captured the German merchant , which was attempting to reach Germany. The ship was later taken into British service as a cargo ship and renamed "Empire Ability". Several neutral merchant ships were also spotted by the carrier's aircraft, twice causing crews to believe they were under attack and abandon ship. A note explaining the situation was dropped in a bag to a Norwegian vessel's crew, and they re-boarded; an attempt to repeat this exercise with a Belgian crew failed when the bag was dropped down the ship's funnel.

By this time, "Graf Spee" had put into <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> to repair damage received during the <a href="battle%20of%20the%20River%20Plate">battle of the River Plate</a>. Two Royal Navy cruisers followed the raider, and patrolled the harbour entrance while reporting "Graf Spee"s position to the fleet. "Ark Royal" and "Renown" were dispatched to join the British ships outside the harbour, but as they were 36 hours away, the British naval attaché came up with a plan to make the Germans believe that the two capital ships had already arrived. An order for fuel for "Ark Royal" was placed at <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, west of Montevideo. This was leaked to the press, passed on to the German embassy in Montevideo, and given to "Graf Spee"s captain, <a href="Hans%20Langsdorff">Hans Langsdorff</a>. This contributed to Langsdorff's decision to scuttle his ship.

With "Graf Spee" sunk, "Ark Royal" remained in the Atlantic for a short time before escorting the damaged <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> back to <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport Dockyard</a>, where they arrived in February. Following this, "Ark Royal" proceeded to <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> to take on supplies and personnel, before sailing to <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. On arrival, she transferred her Blackburn Skuas to <a href="RNAS%20Hatston">Naval Air Station "Hatston"</a> to strengthen the anchorage's defences. "Ark Royal" was then assigned to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean Fleet</a> for exercises, departing Scapa Flow on 31 March 1940 and heading for <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> with the aircraft carrier . The carriers arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean on 8 April, but the exercises were cancelled a day later. The ships sailed to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> to await orders.

German forces had invaded Norway as part of <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">Operation "Weserübung"</a> on 9 April, and had secured sections of the coast. Attempts by the Royal Navy to operate in support of British troops were unsuccessful; air attacks had overwhelmed the ships, sinking and nearly sinking . Realising that the British ships required air cover, but aware that the Norwegian coast was outside the range of British land-based aircraft, the Admiralty recalled "Ark Royal" and "Glorious" from the Mediterranean on 16 April.

"Ark Royal" and "Glorious" arrived at Scapa Flow on 23 April 1940 and were immediately redeployed as part of Operation DX. Sailing to Norway with the cruisers and and screened by the destroyers , , , , and , this was the first time the Royal Navy had deployed carriers with the primary purpose of providing fighter protection for other warships. The ships took up position on 25 April off the coast; "Ark Royal" positioned offshore to reduce the chance of air attacks. The carrier's aircraft conducted anti-submarine patrols, provided fighter support for other ships, and carried out strikes against shipping and shore targets. "Ark Royal" returned to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and replace lost and damaged aircraft, before heading back on the same day with the battleship as escort. During the return, "Ark Royal" came under air attack from German Junkers <a href="Ju%2088">Ju 88</a> and Heinkel <a href="He%20111">He 111</a> bombers operating from Norway. The carrier was undamaged, and resumed position on 29 April.
By this point, the British high command had realised that they could not hold the Germans in southern Norway. The evacuation of Allied troops from <a href="Molde">Molde</a> and <a href="%C3%85ndalsnes">Åndalsnes</a> began, with "Ark Royal" providing air cover from 30 April. On 1 May, the Germans tried to sink the carrier, with numerous air attacks through the day. "Ark Royal"s fighters and a heavy anti-aircraft barrage drove off the enemy, and although several bombs were dropped at the carrier, none impacted. The evacuation was completed on 3 May, and the carrier was recalled to Scapa Flow to refuel and rearm before returning to Norway. While in port, Captain Arthur Power left the ship for a promotion to the Admiralty, and was replaced by Captain <a href="Cedric%20Holland">Cedric Holland</a>. On return to Norway, "Ark Royal" was told to provide air cover for operations around <a href="Narvik">Narvik</a>, including the landing of French troops on 13 May. She was joined on 18 May by the carriers "Glorious" and "Furious".

Despite these efforts, it was clear by the end of May that French forces were on the verge of collapse and Norway was a sideshow compared to the German advance to the English Channel. <a href="Operation%20Alphabet">Operation Alphabet</a> was instigated to move Allied troops from Narvik to Britain. "Ark Royal" and "Glorious"—screened by the destroyers , , , , and —sailed from Scapa Flow on 1 June to cover the evacuation, which commenced the next day. "Ark Royal" carried out air patrols and bombing raids from 3–6 June, before redeploying to Narvik on 7 June. Disaster struck the next day, when "Glorious", escorted by "Acasta" and "Ardent", were detached to return to Britain. The three ships were attacked and sunk by the German battlecruisers and . A search by "Ark Royal"s aircraft failed to locate the German ships, which had returned to <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>.

The last evacuation convoy left Narvik on 9 June. Before the British ships could withdraw, a raid on Trondheim located "Scharnhorst". An attack by "Ark Royal"s Skuas took place at midnight on 13 June. The attack was a disaster: the escort destroyers and collided while "Ark Royal" was launching aircraft in fog and returned to England for repairs, eight of the fifteen attacking Skuas were shot down, while "Scharnhorst" escaped damage. "Ark Royal" returned to Scapa Flow the following day, and was reassigned to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean Fleet</a>.

"Ark Royal" left Scapa Flow with the battlecruiser and three destroyers, arriving at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 23 June 1940. Here she joined <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a>, under <a href="James%20Fownes%20Somerville">Sir James Somerville</a>. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">capitulation of France</a> there was concern that a French fleet at <a href="Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir">Mers-el-Kébir</a> might fall under Axis control and tip the balance of power in the Mediterranean, affecting the whole war. "Ark Royal"s captain, Cedric Holland, had been the British naval attaché in Paris, and was sent to negotiate the surrender or scuttling of the French fleet. Force H was deployed outside the harbour, and when the French admirals refused to agree to the offered terms, opened fire on the French ships. During the <a href="attack%20on%20Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir">attack on Mers-el-Kébir</a>, "Ark Royal"s aircraft provided targeting information for the British ships. The French battleship escaped, despite attacks by Swordfish from "Ark Royal". Two days after the attack, aircraft from "Ark Royal" incapacitated the French battleship , which had been beached in the initial attack.
Having reduced the possibility of a French challenge in the Mediterranean, Force H prepared for attacks on Italian targets, and sailed from Gibraltar on 8 July. The force was attacked by Italian bombers within eight hours of departing, and although Force H escaped damage, Somerville cancelled the raids and ordered the fleet to Gibraltar. During July, the British colony of <a href="Malta">Malta</a> came under attack from the Italian air force, with Force H ordered to deliver <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s to reinforce the island's air defences. Force H was deployed from 31 July – 4 August, with the carrier used to deliver the aircraft, while "Ark Royal" provided air cover for the fleet. On 2 August, "Ark Royal" launched a successful air attack against the Italian air base at <a href="Cagliari">Cagliari</a>.

Force H remained at Gibraltar until 30 September, when it escorted reinforcements for <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Admiral Andrew Cunningham's</a> fleet to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. En route, diversionary attacks were planned on Italian air bases at <a href="Elmas">Elmas</a> and Cagliari to direct attention from both the reinforcement operation and a supply <a href="Malta%20Convoy">convoy sailing to Malta</a>. The attacks were successfully carried out on 1 October, and the fleet reached Alexandria without significant attention from the Italian air force. From Alexandria, "Ark Royal" was detached and sent to West Africa to support British attempts to encourage <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> colonies to switch allegiance to the <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a>. During negotiations, several Free French aircraft flew from "Ark Royal", but their aircrews were arrested at <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>. Negotiations failed, and bombers from "Ark Royal" were directed against military installations during the unsuccessful British attempt to <a href="battle%20of%20Dakar">take Dakar by force</a>. Following this, "Ark Royal" returned to Britain for refit, docking in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on 8 October after being escorted by , and . The refit—which lasted until 3 November—included repairs to her machinery and the installation of a new flight deck barrier.
Following refit, "Ark Royal"—accompanied by , , and —sailed for Gibraltar, arriving on 6 November. They were deployed with the rest of Force H to escort convoys from Gibraltar to Alexandria and Malta, performing several runs before being assigned to <a href="Operation%20Collar%20%28Convoy%29">Operation Collar</a>, one of 35 <a href="Malta%20Convoys">convoys to support Malta</a> between 1940 and 1942, on 25 November. An Italian fleet—led by the battleships and —was dispatched to intercept the convoy. The Italian fleet was detected by a reconnaissance aircraft from "Ark Royal" and the carrier launched Swordfish torpedo bombers while the capital ships of Force H turned to meet the enemy. During the engagement, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Spartivento">Battle of Cape Spartivento</a>, the Italian destroyer was damaged, although it is uncertain if torpedoes from the bombers or British gunfire were responsible. The British mistook "Lanciere" for a cruiser, while the Italian commanders received incorrect reports that the cruiser had been hit. British attacks failed to damage any other Italian ships or sink the disabled destroyer, and a retaliatory attack by the Italian air force saw "Ark Royal" as the subject of multiple bombing runs, none of which hit. The battle had no clear result, although the British convoy reached its destination unscathed.

On 14 December 1940, "Ark Royal" and Force H were redeployed from Gibraltar to the Atlantic to search the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> for <a href="commerce%20raider">commerce raider</a>s. "Ark Royal" returned to the Mediterranean on 20 December, and escorted the battleship and merchant ships from Malta until 27 December. Force H then became involved in <a href="Operation%20Excess">Operation Excess</a>, a plan to move convoys through the Mediterranean to support the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Force">Western Desert Force</a>, which was trying to push Italian land forces from Egypt into Libya. Over the next month, British control of the Mediterranean theatre was weakened, particularly by the entry of the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" and the near-loss of the aircraft carrier . The <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean Fleet</a> was under pressure from Axis forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, while the British port at Gibraltar was likely to be lost if the Spanish chose to ally with the Germans instead of remaining <a href="Non-belligerent">out of the war</a>. To relieve the Mediterranean Fleet, while demonstrating British strength to the Spanish, the Admiralty and Admiral Cunningham planned to use "Ark Royal"s Swordfish bombers in raids against Italian targets, supported by bombardment from heavy fleet units. The first bombing, on 2 January against the Tirso Dam in <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, was unsuccessful, but "Ark Royal"s Swordfish bombers were more successful on 6 January, when they bombed the port city of <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>. The carrier's aircraft also covered the battlecruiser "Renown" and battleship "Malaya" while they shelled the port. On 9 January, "Ark Royal" launched aircraft to bomb an oil refinery at <a href="La%20Spezia">La Spezia</a>, and to lay mines in the harbour. Both operations were successful.

In early February 1941, the battleships and headed into the Atlantic on the orders of Grand Admiral <a href="Erich%20Raeder">Erich Raeder</a>, commander of the German Navy. They were to disrupt Allied shipping and draw capital ships from other areas. On 8 March, Force H and "Ark Royal" were ordered to the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> to search for the battleships, and to cover convoys crossing from the United States. "Ark Royal" used her aircraft to search for captured ships returning to Germany under the control of <a href="prize%20crew">prize crew</a>s. Three ships were located on 19 March: two scuttled themselves, while the third—SS "Polykarp"—was recaptured.

On the evening of 21 March 1941 a <a href="Fairey%20Fulmar">Fairey Fulmar</a> from "Ark Royal" stumbled across "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" at sea. Because of a radio malfunction, the crew had to return to "Ark Royal" to report, by which time the German ships had escaped under fog. The next day, "Ark Royal" re-established air patrols in the hope of re-locating the raiders. During the day, a catapult malfunction destroyed a <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a>; flinging the fuselage into the sea ahead of the carrier. Unable to stop, "Ark Royal" ran over the Swordfish and was overhead when the aircraft's depth charges detonated. "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" reached <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> without British harassment, while "Ark Royal" returned to Gibraltar for repairs, arriving on 24 March.

"Ark Royal" spent April alternating between covering convoys and delivering aircraft to Malta and forays into the Atlantic to hunt commerce raiders. By May 1941, <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>'s "<a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>" were driving through North Africa towards the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>, pushing the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Force">Western Desert Force</a> before them. With British forces close to collapse and strategic locations threatened, the British High Command risked sending a reinforcement convoy across the Mediterranean to Alexandria. The convoy consisted of five large transport ships, escorted by "Ark Royal", the battlecruiser "Renown", the battleship , the cruisers , , , and , and screened by destroyers of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. Prior to "Ark Royal"s departure, Captain Holland left to recuperate from stress and poor health, and was replaced by Captain <a href="Loben%20Edward%20Harold%20Maund">Loben Maund</a>. The convoy left Gibraltar on 6 May, and was detected by Italian aircraft. The convoy—limited to and escorted by so many capital ships—was such a tempting target that Italian and German aircraft were mobilised.

The British convoy came under air attack on 8 May, first by the Italian air force, then German "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>". Over the day, 12 of "Ark Royal"s Fairey Fulmars (the maximum number available) drove off over 50 aircraft, with the assistance of targeting information from "Sheffield"s radar and anti-aircraft fire from the escorts. During the initial waves, one Fulmar was lost, killing Flight Lieutenant Rupert Tillard and Lieutenant Mark Somerville; another was destroyed with the aircrew recovered, while several others were damaged. Consequently, only seven were able to face the main "Luftwaffe" force of 34 aircraft, while an attack just before dark was driven off by two aircraft and heavy fire from the ships. The convoy survived without serious damage: the only casualties were to mines, with the "Empire Song" sunk and "New Zealand Star" damaged but able to reach port. "Ark Royal" underwent another aerial attack on 12 May, during her return to Gibraltar. Later that month, she and fellow aircraft carrier "Furious" delivered <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s to support Malta.

On 18 May 1941, the German battleship and heavy cruiser began <a href="Operation%20Rhein%C3%BCbung">Operation Rheinübung</a> by breaking into the Atlantic to raid shipping. After sinking the battlecruiser "Hood" and damaging the battleship during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Denmark%20Strait">Battle of the Denmark Strait</a>, "Bismarck" shook off her pursuers and headed for the French Atlantic coast. "Ark Royal", "Renown", and "Sheffield"—accompanied by , , , , , and —were dispatched to the Atlantic on 23 May to search for the battleship. On 26 May, a Swordfish from "Ark Royal" located "Bismarck" and began to shadow her, while the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> was mobilised to pursue.
At the time of detection, the British ships were away and would not catch "Bismarck" before she reached <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a>. Fifteen Swordfish bombers were armed with torpedoes and sent to delay the ship. "Sheffield", also shadowing "Bismarck", was between "Ark Royal" and "Bismarck". The aircraft mistook the British cruiser for their target and fired torpedoes. The torpedoes were fitted with unreliable magnetic detonators, which caused most to explode on contact with the water, while "Sheffield" evaded the rest. After realising his mistake, one of the pilots signalled 'Sorry for the kipper' to "Sheffield".

On return to the carrier, the Swordfish were re-armed with contact-detonator warhead torpedoes, and launched at 19:15 for a second attack; locating and attacking "Bismarck" just before sunset. Three torpedoes hit the battleship: two detonated forward of the engine rooms, while the third struck the starboard steering compartment and jammed her rudder in a 15° port turn. "Bismarck" was forced to sail in circles until a combination of alternating propeller speeds was found which would keep her on a reasonably steady course which, in the prevailing <a href="Beaufort%20scale">force 8 wind</a> and <a href="sea%20state">sea state</a>, forced her to sail towards the British warships with almost no manoeuvring capability. The German battleship suffered heavy attack during the night of 26–27 May, and sank at 10:39 hours on 27 May.

"Ark Royal" and the ships of Force H returned to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from the sinking of the battleship "Bismarck", the <a href="Mediterranean%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">war in the Mediterranean</a> was going against the Allies. <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Crete">Crete</a> had fallen to the Axis Powers, and the "<a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>" was preparing to launch a final push into <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Malta remained an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks, and could no longer be supplied from the east since the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">fall of Crete</a>.

"Ark Royal" was pressed into service, delivering aircraft to Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of <a href="Operation%20Substance">Operation Substance</a> in July and <a href="Operation%20Halberd">Operation Halberd</a> in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing as much as ⅓ of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> decided to send a flotilla of <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, against the advice of "Großadmiral" Raeder.

On 10 November 1941, "Ark Royal" ferried more aircraft to Malta before returning to Gibraltar. Admiral Somerville had been warned of U-boats off the Spanish coast, and reminded Force H to be vigilant. Also at sea was <a href="Friedrich%20Guggenberger">Friedrich Guggenberger</a>'s , which had received a report that Force H was returning to Gibraltar.

On 13 November, at 15:40, the sonar operator aboard the destroyer detected an unidentified sound, but assumed it was the propellers of a nearby destroyer. One minute later, "Ark Royal" was struck amidships by a torpedo, between the fuel bunkers and bomb store, and directly below the bridge island. The explosion caused "Ark Royal" to shake, hurled loaded torpedo-bombers into the air, and killed Able Seaman Edward Mitchell. A hole was created on the ship's bottom and on the starboard side below the water-line by the torpedo, which was judged to have run deep, striking the bilge keel where it detonated, inboard of the side protection system. The hit caused flooding of the starboard boiler room, main <a href="Telephone%20switchboard">switchboard</a>, oil tanks, and over of the ship's starboard bilge. The starboard power train was knocked out, causing the rear half of the ship to lose power, while communications were severed shipwide.
Immediately after the torpedo strike, Captain Maund ordered the engines to full stop, but discovered that communications were down and had to send a runner to the engine room. The ship's continued motion enlarged the hole in the hull, and by the time "Ark Royal" stopped she had taken on a great deal of water and begun to <a href="List%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> to starboard, reaching 18° from centre within 20 minutes. Considering the list of the carrier, and the fact that other carriers, including "Courageous" and "Glorious", had sunk rapidly with heavy loss of life, Maund gave the order to abandon ship. The crew were assembled on the flight deck to determine who would remain on board to try to save the ship while "Legion" came alongside to take off the rest. As a result, comprehensive <a href="damage%20control">damage control measures</a> were not initiated until 49 minutes after the attack. The flooding spread unchecked, exacerbated by covers and hatches left open during evacuation of the lower decks.

Water spread to the centreline boiler room, which started to flood from below, and power was lost shipwide when the boiler uptakes became choked; "Ark Royal" had no backup diesel generators. About half an hour after the explosion, the carrier appeared to stabilise. Admiral Somerville, determined to save "Ark Royal", ordered damage control parties back to the carrier before taking the battleship "Malaya" to Gibraltar to organise salvage efforts. The damage control parties re-lit a boiler, restoring power to the bilge pumps. The destroyer came alongside to provide power and additional pumps, while Swordfish aircraft from Gibraltar flew overhead to supplement anti-submarine patrols. The tug <a href="Thames%20%28tug%29">"Thames"</a> arrived from Gibraltar at 20:00 and attached a tow line to "Ark Royal", but the flooding had caused the ship to list more severely. Rising water reached the boiler room fan flat, an uninterrupted compartment running the width of the ship. This forced the shutdown of the restored boiler.
The list reached 20° between 02:05 and 02:30, and when 'abandon ship' was declared again at 04:00, had reached 27°. "Ark Royal"s complement had been evacuated to "Legion" by 04:30; with the exception of Mitchell, there were no fatalities. The 1,487 officers and crew were transported to Gibraltar. The list reached 45° before "Ark Royal" capsized and sank at 06:19 on 14 November. Witnesses reported the carrier rolling to 90°, where she remained for three minutes before inverting. "Ark Royal" then broke in two, the aft sinking within a couple of minutes, followed by the bow.

Following the sinking, a <a href="Board%20of%20Inquiry">Board of Inquiry</a> was established to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Captain Loben Maund was <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led in February 1942 for negligence. He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage. The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high standard was being expected of Maund, and that he was primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.

The Bucknill Committee, which had been set up to investigate the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: "Ark Royal" depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the <a href="Illustrious-class%20aircraft%20carrier">"Illustrious"-</a> and <a href="Implacable-class%20aircraft%20carrier">"Implacable"-class carrier</a>s, under construction at the time.

The Board of Inquiry closed its report with the observation that "Ark Royal" had sunk east of <a href="Europa%20Point">Europa Point</a>, the southernmost tip of Gibraltar. This was accepted as the wreck location for 60 years.

The location of the wreck was undetermined until mid-December 2002, when the wreck was discovered by an underwater survey company, C & C Technologies, Inc, using a sonar-equipped autonomous underwater vehicle, from Gibraltar, at about 1000 metres depth. The company had been contracted by the BBC as part of a documentary on <a href="maritime%20archaeology">maritime archaeology</a> related to major battles of the Royal Navy. The "Ark Royal" wreck lies scattered across the seafloor; of the bow is separate from the rest of the ship's hull. A large debris field, which includes the remains of the funnel and bridge island, parts of the ship that came loose as the carrier sank, and aircraft from the hangars, lay between the two hull sections. Analysis revealed that the port side of the ship hit the seabed first.

The wreck was found further east than expected. Researchers originally thought the wreck had been carried by <a href="Ocean%20current">currents</a> farther into the Mediterranean as she sank – that the ship had travelled eastwards underwater before reaching the seabed. The presence near the hull pieces of other debris, including a Swordfish bomber that was tipped off the flight deck before the ship rolled, proved this false. If the current had pushed the hull pieces any significant distance sideways as they sank, debris would have been spread over a much wider area. It seems though that eastward currents had affected her progress towards Gibraltar during the time she was under tow.

Study of the wreck also showed that restarting the engines to provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull, adding to the flooding. Once power was then lost, it was impossible to prevent the ship from sinking — her fate was more the result of design flaws than of the actions of her captain.

a. The <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> (signed in February 1922) imposed a limit of 135,000 tons on total British aircraft carrier tonnage, with no one ship allowed to exceed 33,000 tons, and only two to exceed 27,000 tons. The <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval Treaty</a> (signed in April 1930) prevented signatories from constructing new capital ships, or converting existing capital ships into aircraft carriers, until 1937.

White-bellied sea eagle

The white-bellied sea eagle ("Haliaeetus leucogaster"), also known as the white-breasted sea eagle, is a large <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> <a href="bird%20of%20prey">bird of prey</a> in the family <a href="Accipitridae">Accipitridae</a>. Originally <a href="species%20description">described</a> by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> in 1788, it is closely related to <a href="Sanford%27s%20sea%20eagle">Sanford's sea eagle</a> of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, and the two are considered a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a>. A distinctive bird, the adult white-bellied sea eagle has a white head, breast, under-wing <a href="covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a> and tail. The upper parts are grey and the black under-wing flight feathers contrast with the white coverts. The tail is short and wedge-shaped as in all "<a href="sea%20eagle">Haliaeetus</a>" <a href="species">species</a>. Like many raptors, the female is slightly larger than the male, and can measure up to long with a wingspan of up to , and weigh . Immature birds have brown <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, which is gradually replaced by white until the age of five or six years. The call is a loud goose-like honking.

Resident from <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> through <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> to <a href="Australia">Australia</a> on coasts and major waterways, the white-bellied sea eagle breeds and hunts near water, and fish form around half of its diet. Opportunistic, it consumes carrion and a wide variety of animals. Although rated as "Least Concern" globally, it has declined in parts of southeast Asia such as Thailand, and southeastern Australia. It is ranked as "Threatened" in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and "Vulnerable" in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. Human disturbance to its habitat is the main threat, both from direct human activity near nests which impacts on breeding success, and from removal of suitable trees for nesting. The white-bellied sea eagle is revered by <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">indigenous people</a> in many parts of Australia, and is the subject of various folk tales throughout its range.

The white-bellied sea eagle was first described by the German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> in 1788, although <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> had made notes on the species in 1781, from a specimen obtained in February 1780 at <a href="Panaitan">Princes Island</a> off the westernmost cape of <a href="Java">Java</a> during <a href="James%20Cook">Captain Cook's</a> last voyage. Its <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "leuko-" 'white', and "gaster" 'belly'. Its closest relative is the little-known <a href="Sanford%27s%20sea%20eagle">Sanford's sea eagle</a> of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. These form a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a>, and as is usual in other sea eagle superspecies, one (the white-bellied sea eagle) has a white head, as opposed to the other species' dark head. The bill and eyes are dark, and the <a href="Talon%20%28anatomy%29">talons</a> are dark yellow as in all Southern Hemisphere sea eagles. Both these species have at least some dark colouration in their tails, though this may not always be clearly visible in the white-bellied sea eagle. The <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> sequences of the <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome b</a> <a href="gene">gene</a> of the two sea eagles were among those analysed in a 1996 study. Although they differ greatly in appearance and <a href="ecology">ecology</a>, their <a href="genetic%20divergence">genetic divergence</a> of 0.3% indicates that the ancestors of the two forms might have diverged as recently as 150,000 years ago. The study authors conclude that although the genetic divergence is more consistent with subspecies, the distinctness in appearance and behaviour warrants the two being retained as separate species. <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">Mitochondrial</a> sequence of the cytochrome b locus differs very slightly from that of Sanford's sea eagle suggesting a relatively recent divergence after <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>-based white-bellied sea eagles colonised the Solomon Islands.

The white-bellied sea eagle's affinities beyond the Sanford's sea eagle are a little less clear; <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> data indicate that it is one of four species of tropical sea eagle (along with the <a href="African%20fish%20eagle">African fish eagle</a> and the <a href="Madagascar%20fish%20eagle">Madagascar fish eagle</a>), while <a href="allozyme">allozyme</a> data indicate it might have a closer relationship with the sea eagles of the northern hemisphere. A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> to the four fish eagles (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus "<a href="Ichthyophaga">Ichthyophaga</a>").

As well as white-bellied sea eagle and white-breasted sea eagle, other recorded names include white-bellied fish-hawk, white-eagle, and grey-backed sea eagle.

The white-bellied sea eagle has a white head, rump and underparts, and dark or slate-grey back and wings. In flight, the black flight <a href="feathers">feathers</a> on the <a href="wing">wing</a>s are easily seen when the bird is viewed from below. The large, hooked bill is a leaden blue-grey with a darker tip, and the <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irides</a> are dark brown. The <a href="cere">cere</a> is also lead grey. The legs and feet are yellow or grey, with long black talons (claws). Unlike those of eagles of the genus "<a href="Aquila%20%28genus%29">Aquila</a>", the legs are not feathered. The sexes are similar. Males are long and weigh . Females are slightly larger, at and . The <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a> ranges from . A 2004 study on 37 birds from Australia and Papua New Guinea (3 °S to 50 °S) found that birds could be sexed reliably on size, and that birds from latitudes further south were larger than those from the north. There is no seasonal variation in <a href="plumage">plumage</a>. The <a href="Moulting%23Birds">moulting</a> pattern of the white-bellied sea eagle is poorly known. It appears to take longer than a year to complete, and can be interrupted and later resumed from the point of interruption.

The wings are modified when gliding so that they rise from the body at an angle, but are closer to horizontal further along the wingspan. In silhouette, the comparatively long neck, head and beak stick out from the front almost as far as the tail does behind. For active flight, the white-bellied sea eagle alternates strong deep wing-beats with short periods of gliding.

A young white-bellied sea eagle in its first year is predominantly brown, with pale cream-streaked plumage on their head, neck, nape and rump areas. The plumage becomes more infiltrated with white until it acquires the complete adult plumage by the fourth or fifth year. The species breeds from around six years of age onwards. The lifespan is thought to be around 30 years.

The loud goose-like honking call is a familiar sound, particularly during the <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a>; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry on for some time when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist <a href="David%20Fleay">David Fleay</a> observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, in stark contrast to the relatively quiet calls of the <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a>.

Adult white-bellied sea eagles are unmistakable and unlikely to be confused with any other bird. Immature birds can be confused with wedge-tailed eagles. However, the plumage of the latter is darker, the tail longer, and the legs feathered. They might also be confused with the <a href="black-breasted%20buzzard">black-breasted buzzard</a> ("Hamirostra melanosternon"), but this species is much smaller, has white patches on the wings, and has a more undulating flight. In India, the <a href="Egyptian%20vulture">Egyptian vulture</a> has white plumage, but is smaller and has a whiter back and wings. The white tail of the white-bellied sea eagle in flight distinguishes it from other species of large eagles. In the Philippines, it can be confused with the <a href="Philippine%20eagle">Philippine eagle</a>, which can be distinguished by its crest; immature white-bellied sea eagles resemble immature <a href="grey-headed%20fish%20eagle">grey-headed fish eagle</a>s, but can be identified by their more wholly dark brown underparts and flight feathers, and wedge-shaped tail.

The white-bellied sea eagle is found regularly from <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> (sometimes north to <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, and in the past in the <a href="Lakshadweep">Lakshadweep</a> Islands) eastwards in India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka in southern Asia, through all of coastal <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> including Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>, the main and offshore islands of the Philippines, and southern China including <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="Hainan">Hainan</a> and <a href="Fuzhou">Fuzhou</a>, eastwards through <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and the <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a>, and Australia. In the northern Solomons it is restricted to <a href="Nissan%20Island">Nissan Island</a>, and replaced elsewhere by Sanford's sea eagle. In <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, where it is otherwise scarce, it is locally more common at <a href="Corner%20Inlet">Corner Inlet</a> and <a href="Gippsland%20Lakes">Gippsland Lakes</a>. Similarly in South Australia, it is most abundant along the north coast of <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>. The range extends to the islands of <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a> and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, and it is thought able to move between the islands and the mainland. There is one unconfirmed record from <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe Island</a> and several from New Zealand.

They are a common sight in coastal areas, but may also be seen well inland (It is reportedly seen at the Panna Tiger Reserve in central India, nearly away from the sea shore) The white-bellied sea eagle is generally sedentary and <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a>, although it may travel long distances. They have been reported travelling upriver to hunt for flying foxes ("<a href="Pteropus">Pteropus</a>"). Populations in inland Australia move around as inland bodies of water appear and then dry up. In one instance, a pair came to breed at Lake Albacutya in northwestern Victoria after the lake had been empty for 30 years. The species is easily disturbed by humans, especially when nesting, and may desert nesting sites as a result. It is found in greater numbers in areas with little or no human impact or interference.

The white-bellied sea eagle is generally territorial; some birds form permanent pairs that inhabit territories throughout the year, while others are nomadic. The species is monogamous, with pairs remaining together until one bird dies, after which the surviving bird quickly seeks a new mate. This can lead to some nest sites being continuously occupied for many years (one site in <a href="Mallacoota%2C%20Victoria">Mallacoota</a> was occupied for over fifty years). Immature birds are generally dispersive, with many moving over away from the area they were raised. One juvenile raised in <a href="Cowell%2C%20South%20Australia">Cowell, South Australia</a> was reported away at <a href="Fraser%20Island">Fraser Island</a> in Queensland. A study of the species in <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a> showed increases in the numbers of immature and subadult birds in autumn, although it was unclear whether these were locally fledged or (as was considered more likely) an influx of young birds born and raised elsewhere in Australia. Birds are often seen perched high in a tree, or soaring over waterways and adjacent land. They are most commonly encountered singly or in pairs. Small groups of white-bellied sea eagles sometimes gather if there is a plentiful source of food such as a carcass or fish offal on a ship. Much of the white-bellied sea eagle's behaviour, particularly breeding, remains poorly known.

The breeding season varies according to location—it has been recorded in the dry season in the <a href="Trans%20Fly%20savanna%20and%20grasslands">Trans-Fly region</a> and <a href="Central%20Province%20%28Papua%20New%20Guinea%29">Central Province</a> of Papua New Guinea, and from June to August in Australia. A pair of white-bellied sea eagles performs skilful displays of flying before copulation: diving, gliding and chasing each other while calling loudly. They may mirror each other, flying apart and copying each other swooping and swerving. A talon-grappling display has been recorded where the pair will fly high before one flips upside down and tries to grapple the other's talons with its own. If successful, the two then plunge cartwheeling before separating as they approach the ground. This behaviour has also been recorded as an aggressive display against a wedge-tailed eagle.

The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses tall trees or man-made pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought where there is a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which can be used as a perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or <a href="whistling%20kite">whistling kite</a>s have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55 mm, they are <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubated</a> over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-<a href="altricial">altricial</a>, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to <a href="Fledge">fledging</a> (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.

The white-bellied sea eagle is an opportunistic carnivore and consumes a wide variety of animal prey, including <a href="carrion">carrion</a>. It often catches a fish by flying low over the water and grasping it in its talons. It prepares for the strike by holding its feet far forward (almost under its chin) and then strikes backwards while simultaneously beating its wings to lift upwards. Generally only one foot is used to seize prey. The white-bellied sea eagle may also dive at a 45 degree angle from its perch and briefly submerge to catch fish near the water surface. While hunting over water on sunny days, it often flies directly into the sun or at right angles to it, seemingly to avoid casting shadows over the water and hence alerting potential prey.
The white-bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals, such as fish, turtles and sea snakes, but it takes birds, such as <a href="little%20penguin">little penguin</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20coot">Eurasian coot</a>s and <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s, and mammals (including <a href="flying%20fox">flying fox</a>es) as well. In the <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a> it has been reported feeding on two species of possum, the <a href="northern%20common%20cuscus">northern common cuscus</a> and <a href="common%20spotted%20cuscus">common spotted cuscus</a>. It is a skilled hunter, and will attack <a href="prey">prey</a> up to the size of a <a href="swan">swan</a>. They also feed on carrion such as dead sheep, birds and fish found along the waterline, as well as raiding fishing nets and following cane harvesters.

They harass smaller raptors such as <a href="swamp%20harrier">swamp harrier</a>s, <a href="whistling%20kite">whistling kite</a>s, <a href="brahminy%20kite">brahminy kite</a>s and <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s, forcing them to drop any food that they are carrying. Other birds victimised include <a href="silver%20gull">silver</a> and <a href="Pacific%20gull">Pacific gull</a>s, <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s and <a href="Australasian%20gannet">Australasian gannet</a>s. There is one record of a white-bellied sea eagle seizing a gannet when unsuccessful in obtaining its prey. They may even steal food from their own species, including their mates. The white-bellied sea eagle attacks these birds by striking them with outstretched talons from above or by flying upside down underneath the smaller predator and snatching the prey, all the while screeching shrilly. <a href="Arctocephalus%20forsteri">Southern fur seals</a> have also been targeted for their fish.

White-bellied sea eagles feed alone, in pairs, or in family groups. A pair may cooperate to hunt. Prey can be eaten while the bird is flying or when it lands on a raised platform such as its nest. The white-bellied sea eagle skins the victim as it eats it. It is exceptionally efficient at digesting its food, and disgorges only tiny pellets of fragmented bone, fur and feathers.

A 2006 study of inland bodies of water around Canberra where wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles share territories showed little overlap in the range of prey taken. Wedge-tailed eagles took rabbits, various <a href="Macropodidae">macropods</a>, terrestrial birds such as cockatoos and parrots, and various passerines including <a href="Australian%20magpie">magpie</a>s and <a href="European%20starling">starling</a>s. White-bellied sea eagles caught fish, water-dwelling reptiles such as the <a href="eastern%20long-necked%20turtle">eastern long-necked turtle</a> and <a href="Australian%20water%20dragon">Australian water dragon</a>, and waterbirds such as ducks, <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s and <a href="Eurasian%20coot">coot</a>s. Both species preyed on the <a href="maned%20duck">maned duck</a>. Rabbits constituted only a small fraction of the white-bellied sea eagle's diet. Despite nesting near each other, the two species seldom interacted, as the wedge-tailed eagles hunted away from water and the white-bellied sea eagles foraged along the lake shores. However, conflict with wedge-tailed eagles over nesting sites in remnant trees has been recorded in Tasmania.

The white-bellied sea eagle is listed as being of "Least Concern" by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>. There are an estimated 10 thousand to 100 thousand individuals, although there seems to be a decline in numbers. They have become rare in Thailand and some other parts of southeast Asia. They are relatively abundant in Hong Kong, where the population increased from 39 to 57 birds between 2002 and 2009. A field study on Kangaroo Island in South Australia showed that nesting pairs in areas of high human disturbance (as defined by clearing of landscape and high human activity) had lower breeding success rates. In the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a> in South Australia, nests have been vacated as human activities have encroached on the eagles' territories. Elsewhere, the clearing of trees suitable for nesting has seen it largely disappear locally, such as the removal of stands of "<a href="Casuarina%20equisetifolia">Casuarina equisetifolia</a>" in <a href="Visakhapatnam%20district">Visakhapatnam district</a> in <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> in India. In India, nest densities of about one per 4.32 km of coastline have been noted in <a href="Sindhudurg%20district">Sindhudurg</a> and one per 3.57 km (45 nests along 161 km) in <a href="Ratnagiri%20district">Ratnagiri district</a> of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. They also nest on <a href="Netrani%20Island">Netrani Island</a>, where about a 100 birds were noted in 1875 (then known as Pigeon Island) by <a href="Allan%20Octavian%20Hume">Allan Octavian Hume</a> who noted that this was perhaps the largest breeding colony of the species. In 2000, the disturbance to the island from torpedo-firing exercises conducted by the Indian navy was noted as a threat. Nearly 100 nests have been noted in 2004 on this island.

<a href="DDT">DDT</a> was a widely used pesticide in agriculture that was found to have significant adverse effects on wildlife, particularly egg thinning and subsequent breakage in birds of prey. A review of DDT's impact on Australian raptors between 1947 and 1993 found that the average egg-shell thickness had decreased by 6%. This average level of thinning was not thought likely to result in significantly more breakage overall, however individual clutches that had been even thinner might have broken. The white-bellied sea eagle was one of the more affected species, probably due to its feeding in areas heavily treated with pesticide such as swamps. DDT use peaked in 1973, but was no longer approved after 1987 and its use had effectively ceased by 1989.

The white-bellied sea eagle is listed under the "marine" and "migratory" categories which give it protected status under Australia's federal <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>. As a mainly coastal species, it is vulnerable to habitat destruction in Australia's increasingly populated and urbanised coastal areas, particularly in the south and east of the country, where it appears to have declined in numbers. However, there may have been an increase in population inland, secondary to the creation of reservoirs, dams and weirs, and the spread of the introduced <a href="common%20carp">common carp</a> ("Cyprinus carpio"). However, it is rare along the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> where it was once common. It is also listed as "Threatened" under <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria's</a> <a href="Flora%20and%20Fauna%20Guarantee%20Act%20%281988%29">Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988)</a>, with possibly fewer than 100 breeding pairs remaining in the state. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the white-bellied sea eagle is listed as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>".

There are fewer than 1000 adult birds in Tasmania, where the species is listed as "Vulnerable" under Schedule 3.1 of the Tasmanian <a href="Threatened%20Species%20Protection%20Act%201995">Threatened Species Protection Act 1995</a>. In Tasmania it is threatened by nest disturbance, loss of suitable nesting habitat, shooting, poisoning, trapping, and collision with power lines and wind turbines, as well as entanglement and environmental pollution. Estuaries are a favoured habitat, and these are often subject to environmental disturbance. white-bellied sea eagles have been observed to increase their hunting ranges to include salmon fish farms, but the effect of this on breeding success is unknown.

The white-bellied sea eagle was important to different tribes of indigenous people across Australia. The guardian animal of the <a href="Wreck%20Bay%20Village%2C%20Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Wreck Bay</a> aboriginal community, it is also the official emblem of the <a href="Booderee%20National%20Park%20and%20Botanic%20Gardens">Booderee National Park and Botanic Gardens</a> in the <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay Territory</a>. The community considered localities around Booderee National Park to be connected with it. A local Sydney name was "gulbi", and the bird was the <a href="totem">totem</a> of Colebee, the late 18th century indigenous leader of the <a href="Cadigal">Cadigal</a> people. The white-bellied sea eagle is important to the Mak Mak people of the floodplains to the southwest of <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> in the northern Territory, who recognised its connection with "good country". It is their totem and integrally connected to their land. The term "Mak Mak" is their name for both the species and themselves. The <a href="Umbrawarra%20Gorge%20Nature%20Park">Umbrawarra Gorge Nature Park</a> was a <a href="Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29">Dreaming</a> site of the bird, in this area known as "Kuna-ngarrk-ngarrk". It was similarly symbolic to the Tasmanian indigenous people—"Nairanaa" was one name used there.

Known as "Manulab" to the people of <a href="Nissan%20Island">Nissan Island</a>, the white-bellied sea eagle is considered special and killing it is forbidden. Its calls at night are said to foretell danger, and seeing a group of calling eagles flying overhead is a sign that someone has died. Local Malay folk tales tell of the white-bellied sea eagle screaming to warn the shellfish of the turning of tides, and a local name "burung hamba siput" translates as "slave of the shellfish". Called "Kaulo" in the recently extinct <a href="Aka-Bo%20language">Aka-Bo language</a>, the white-bellied sea eagle was held to be the ancestor of all birds in one <a href="Andaman%20Islands">Andaman Islands</a> folk tale. On the Maharashtra coast, their name is "kakan" and its call is said to indicate the presence of fish in the sea. They sometimes nest on coconut trees. Owners of the trees destroy the nest to avoid attacks when harvesting the coconuts.

The white-bellied sea eagle is featured on the $<a href="Singapore%20Bird%20Series%20currency%20notes">10,000 Singapore</a> note, which was introduced into circulation on 1 February 1980. It is the emblem of the Malaysian state of <a href="Selangor">Selangor</a>. Malay magnate <a href="Loke%20Wan%20Tho">Loke Wan Tho</a> had a tower built for the sole purpose of observing a white-bellied sea eagle nest in the palace gardens of <a href="Istana%20Bukit%20Serene">Istana Bukit Serene</a> in <a href="Johor%20Bahru">Johor Bahru</a>. Taken in February 1949, the resulting photographs appeared in "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" in 1954. The bird is the emblem of the <a href="Manly-Warringah%20Sea%20Eagles">Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles</a> rugby league team, chosen at the club's inception in 1947. From 2010, a nesting pair of white-bellied sea eagles have had their attempts at raising chicks filmed live on "EagleCam", with footage on display at the nearby Birds Australia Discovery Centre in <a href="Sydney%20Olympic%20Park%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Sydney Olympic Park, New South Wales</a>. After raising one brood, however, their nest collapsed in February 2011. The story attracted statewide attention.

USS Saratoga (CV-3)

USS "Saratoga" (CV-3) was a built for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during the 1920s. Originally designed as a <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>, she was converted into one of the Navy's first aircraft carriers during construction to comply with the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922. The ship entered service in 1928 and was assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a> for her entire career. "Saratoga" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>, , were used to develop and refine carrier tactics in a series of annual exercises before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. On more than one occasion these exercises included successful surprise attacks on <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. She was one of three prewar US fleet aircraft carriers, along with and , to serve throughout World War II.

Shortly after the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, "Saratoga" was the centerpiece of the unsuccessful American effort to <a href="Battle%20of%20Wake%20Island">relieve Wake Island</a> and was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine a few weeks later. After lengthy repairs, the ship supported forces participating in the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a> and her aircraft sank the light carrier during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a> in August 1942. She was again torpedoed the following month and returned to the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> area after repairs were completed.

In 1943, "Saratoga" supported Allied forces involved in the <a href="New%20Georgia%20Campaign">New Georgia Campaign</a> and <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">invasion of Bougainville</a> in the northern Solomon Islands and her aircraft twice attacked the Japanese base at <a href="Bombing%20of%20Rabaul%20%28November%201943%29">Rabaul</a> in November. Early in 1944, her aircraft provided air support during the <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Marshall%20Islands%20campaign">Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign</a> before she was transferred to the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> for several months to support the <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">British Eastern Fleet</a> as it attacked targets in <a href="Java">Java</a> and <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>. After a brief refit in mid-1944, the ship became a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> for the rest of the year.

In early 1945, "Saratoga" participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Battle of Iwo Jima</a> as a dedicated <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a> carrier. Several days into the battle, she was badly damaged by <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> hits and was forced to return to the United States for repairs. While under repair, the ship, now increasingly obsolete, was permanently modified as a training carrier with some of her <a href="hangar">hangar</a> deck converted into classrooms. "Saratoga" remained in this role for the rest of the war and was then used to ferry troops back to the United States after the Japanese surrender in August. In mid-1946, the ship was a target for <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a> tests during <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second test.

"Saratoga" was <a href="USS%20Saratoga">the fifth US Navy ship</a> named after the 1777 <a href="Battle%20of%20Saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</a>, an important victory during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>. She was originally authorized in 1916 as a , but construction was placed on hold so that higher-priority <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine</a> vessels and merchant ships, needed to ensure the safe passage of men and materiel to <a href="Europe">Europe</a> during Germany's <a href="U-boat%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">U-boat campaign</a>, could be built. After the war the ship was extensively redesigned to incorporate improved boiler technology, <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulge">anti-torpedo bulge</a>s, and a general increase in armor protection based on British wartime experiences. Given the <a href="hull%20number">hull number</a> of CC-3, "Saratoga" was laid down on 25 September 1920 by <a href="New%20York%20Shipbuilding%20Corporation">New York Shipbuilding Corporation</a> of <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden, New Jersey</a>.

In February 1922, before the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Conference">Washington Naval Conference</a> concluded, the ship's construction was suspended when she was 28 percent complete. She was ordered to be converted to an aircraft carrier with the hull number CV-3 on 1 July 1922. Her displacement was reduced by a total of , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16-inch (406 mm) guns in four twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s (including their heavy <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s, armor, and other equipment). The main <a href="armor%20belt">armor belt</a> was retained, although it was reduced in height to save weight. The hull generally remained unaltered, as did the torpedo protection system, because they had already been built and it would have been too expensive to alter them.

The ship had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. "Saratoga" had a <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard displacement</a> of , and at deep load. At that displacement, she had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of .

Christened by Olive Doolittle, wife of <a href="Curtis%20D.%20Wilbur">Curtis D. Wilbur</a>, <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a>, "Saratoga" was launched on 7 April 1925 and commissioned on 16 November 1927, under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Harry%20E.%20Yarnell">Harry E. Yarnell</a>. She was nicknamed by her crew "Sister Sara" and, later, "Sara Maru". In 1942, the ship had a crew of 100 officers and 1,840 enlisted men, and an aviation group totaling 141 officers and 710 enlisted men. By 1945, her crew totaled 3,373, including her aviation group.

The ship's flight deck was long and had a maximum width of . Her flight deck was widened forward and extended aft during her refit in mid-1941. When built, her <a href="hangar">hangar</a> "was the largest single enclosed space afloat on any ship" and had an area of . It was long and no less than wide. Its minimum height was , and it was divided by a single <a href="fire%20curtain">fire curtain</a> just forward of the aft <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">aircraft elevator</a>. Aircraft repair shops, long, were aft of the hangar, and below them was a storage space for disassembled aircraft, long. "Saratoga" was fitted with two hydraulically powered elevators on her centerline. The forward elevator's dimensions were and it had a capacity of . The aft elevator had a capacity of only and measured . <a href="Avgas">Avgas</a> was stored in eight compartments of the torpedo protection system, and their capacity has been quoted as either or .
"Saratoga" was initially fitted with electrically operated <a href="arresting%20gear">arresting gear</a> designed by <a href="Carl%20Norden">Carl Norden</a> that used longitudinal wires intended to prevent the aircraft from being blown over the side of the ship, and transverse wires to slow the aircraft to a stop. This system was authorized to be replaced by the hydraulically operated <a href="Mark%20%28designation%29">Mk</a> 2 system, without longitudinal wires, on 11 August 1931. Four improved Mk 3 units were added in 1934, giving the ship a total of eight arresting wires and four <a href="safety%20barrier">barriers</a> intended to prevent aircraft from crashing into parked aircraft on the ship's bow. When the forward flight deck was widened, an additional eight wires were added there to allow aircraft to land over the bow if the landing area at the stern was damaged. The ship was built with a , <a href="flywheel">flywheel</a>-powered, F Mk II <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a>, also designed by Norden, on the starboard side of the bow. This catapult was strong enough to launch a aircraft at a speed of . It was intended to launch <a href="seaplanes">seaplanes</a>, but was rarely used; a 1931 report counted only five launches of practice loads since the ship had been commissioned. It was removed some time after 1936.

Relatively few changes were made during the war to "Saratoga"s aircraft-handling equipment. Her crew removed her forward arresting wires in late 1943, although their hydraulic systems were not removed until her refit in mid-1944. At that time she received two Type H hydraulic catapults mounted in her forward flight deck to handle the heavier aircraft entering service. Before the war, plans were made to replace the aft elevator with a model, but manufacturing delays and operational demands prevented this from ever happening. By mid-1942, the increasing size and weight of naval aircraft exceeded the capacity of the aft elevator and it was locked in place. It was removed in March 1945 to save weight and the opening in the flight deck was plated over. The machinery for the forward elevator was scheduled to be upgraded before the war, but this was not done until mid-1944. A new, 44-by-48-foot lightweight forward elevator identical to those used in the carriers was installed in March 1945.

"Saratoga" was designed to carry 78 aircraft of various types, including 36 <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s, but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up spare aircraft in the unused spaces at the top of the hangar. In 1936, her air group consisted of 18 <a href="Grumman%20F2F">Grumman F2F</a>-1 and 18 <a href="Boeing%20F4B">Boeing F4B</a>-4 fighters, plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve. Offensive punch was provided by 20 <a href="Vought%20SBU%20Corsair">Vought SBU Corsair</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s with 10 spare aircraft and 18 <a href="Great%20Lakes%20BG">Great Lakes BG</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s with nine spares. Miscellaneous aircraft included two <a href="Grumman%20JF%20Duck">Grumman JF Duck</a> <a href="amphibious%20aircraft">amphibian</a>s, plus one in reserve, and three active and one spare <a href="Vought%20O2U%20Corsair">Vought O2U Corsair</a> observation aircraft. This amounted to 79 aircraft, plus 30 spares. In early 1945, the ship carried 53 <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">Grumman F6F Hellcat</a> fighters and 17 <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a> torpedo bombers.

The "Lexington"-class carriers used turbo-electric propulsion; each of the four propeller shafts was driven by two <a href="electric%20motor">electric motor</a>s. They were powered by four <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> <a href="turbo%20generator">turbo generator</a>s rated at . Steam for the generators was provided by sixteen <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s, each in its own individual compartment. Six <a href="electric%20generator">electric generator</a>s were installed in the upper levels of the two main turbine compartments to provide power to meet the ship's <a href="hotel%20load">hotel load</a> (minimum electrical) requirements.

The ship was designed to reach . She carried a maximum of of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, but only of that was usable, as the rest had to be retained as <a href="Sailing%20ballast">ballast</a> in the port fuel tanks to offset the weight of the <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23I">island</a> and main guns. Designed for a range of at a speed of , the ship demonstrated a range of at a speed of with of oil.

The Navy's <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a> was not convinced when the class was being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="8%26quot%3B/55%20caliber%20gun">Mk 9 eight-inch guns</a> in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> on the starboard side, two before the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but it is probable that firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.

The ship's heavy <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) armament consisted of twelve 25-caliber <a href="5%26quot%3B/25%20caliber%20gun%20%28United%20States%29">Mk 10 five-inch</a> guns which were mounted on single mounts, three each fitted on <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s on each side of the bow and stern. No light AA guns were initially mounted on "Saratoga", but two twin .50-caliber (12.7 mm) <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> mounts were installed in 1929. They were unsuccessful, but only the mount on the roof of Turret II was replaced by two .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns by 1934. During the ship's August 1941 <a href="wikt%3Aoverhaul">overhaul</a>, four 50-caliber <a href="3%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun">Mk 10 three-inch</a> AA guns were installed in the corner platforms. Another three-inch gun was added on the roof of the deckhouse between the funnel and the island. In addition, a number of .50-caliber machine guns were added on platforms mounted on her superstructure. The three-inch guns were just interim weapons until the quadruple <a href="1.1%26quot%3B/75%20caliber%20gun">1.1-inch</a> gun mount could be fielded, which occurred during a brief refit at the <a href="Bremerton%20Navy%20Yard">Bremerton Navy Yard</a> in late November 1941.

While receiving temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor in January 1942, "Saratoga"s eight-inch turrets, barbettes and ammunition hoists were removed; they were replaced by four twin 38-caliber <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">five-inch</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a> mounts in February at Bremerton. New barbettes were built and the ammunition hoists had to be returned from Pearl Harbor. The older 25-caliber five-inch guns were replaced at the same time by eight more dual-purpose guns in single mounts. As the new guns were heavier than the older ones, only two could be added to the corner gun platforms; the space formerly used by the third gun on each platform was used by an additional quadruple 1.1-inch mount. In addition 32 <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm cannon</a> were installed, six at the base of the funnel and the others distributed along the sides and rear of the flight deck. When the ship's repairs were completed in late May, her armament consisted of 16 five-inch guns, nine quadruple 1.1-inch gun mounts and 32 Oerlikon guns.

After the ship was again torpedoed in August 1942, her 1.1-inch gun mounts were replaced by an equal number of quadruple <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm">Bofors 40 mm</a> mounts while she was under repair at Pearl Harbor. Her light anti-aircraft armament was also increased to 52 Oerlikon guns at the same time. In January 1944 a number of her 20 mm guns were replaced by more Bofors guns, many of which were in the positions formerly occupied by the ship's boats in the sides of the hull. "Saratoga" mounted 23 quadruple and two twin 40 mm mountings as well as 16 Oerlikon guns when she completed her refit.

The two <a href="superfiring">superfiring</a> eight-inch turrets had a Mk 30 <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> at the rear of the turret for local control, but the guns were normally controlled by two Mk 18 <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control directors</a>, one each on the fore and aft spotting tops. A rangefinder was fitted on top of the <a href="pilothouse">pilothouse</a> to provide range information for the directors. Each group of three 5-inch guns was controlled by a Mk 19 director, two of which were mounted on each side of the spotting tops. Plans were made before the war to replace the obsolete Mk 19 directors with two heavier Mk 33 directors, one each on the fore and aft five-inch spotting tops, but these plans were cancelled when the dual-purpose guns replaced the main armament in early 1942.

"Saratoga" received a <a href="RCA">RCA</a> <a href="CXAM%20radar">CXAM-1</a> <a href="early%20warning%20radar">early warning radar</a> in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The <a href="Antenna%20%28radio%29">antenna</a> was mounted on the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary <a href="Conning%20tower">conning station</a> formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface <a href="fire-control%20radar">fire-control radar</a>s in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40 mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 early warning radar was mounted on the rear lip of the funnel during 1942. A SG surface-search radar was mounted on the foremast at the same time.

During the ship's refit in January 1944, her electronics were modernized. The CXAM was replaced by an SK model and the SC-1 was replaced by an SC-3. The forward SG was supplemented by an additional SG-1 mounted on a short mast at the aft end of the funnel. A lengthier overhaul in mid-1944 provided the opportunity to revise the radar arrangements. The SK radar was moved to the rebuilt foremast and the forward SG radar was replaced by an SG-1 mounted at the top of the foremast. An SM-1 fighter-control radar was mounted in the SK's former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height. The SC-3 was replaced by an SC-4 in early 1945.

The waterline <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> of the "Lexington"-class ships tapered in thickness from top to bottom and angled 11° outwards at the top. It covered the middle of the ships. Forward, the belt ended in a <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a> that also tapered from seven to five inches in thickness. Aft, it terminated at a seven-inch bulkhead. This belt had a height of . The third deck over the ships' machinery and <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> was armored with two layers of <a href="special%20treatment%20steel">special treatment steel</a> (STS) totaling in thickness; the steering gear was protected by two layers of STS that totaled on the flat and on the slope.

The gun turrets were protected only against splinters with of armor. The conning tower was armored with of STS, and it had a communications tube with two-inch sides running from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the third deck. The <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> defense system of the "Lexington"-class ships consisted of three to six medium steel <a href="Torpedo%20bulkhead">protective bulkheads</a> that ranged from in thickness. The spaces between them could be used as fuel tanks or left empty to absorb the detonation of a torpedo's <a href="warhead">warhead</a>.

While under repair after being torpedoed in January 1942, "Saratoga" received a bulge on the starboard side of her hull. This was primarily intended to increase the ship's buoyancy, improve stability and allow her full fuel capacity to be utilized. The bulge was estimated to increase her metacentric height by and decrease her speed by one-quarter of a knot. It was also used to store additional fuel oil and increased her capacity to a total of . At the same time, her funnel was shortened by and her tripod <a href="foremast">foremast</a> was replaced by a light pole mast to reduce her topweight.

All of these changes, including the lengthening of the flight deck, increased "Saratoga"s full-load displacement in 1945 to . Her overall length increased to and her beam, at the waterline, to , too wide to use the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>.

"Saratoga" was commissioned one month earlier than her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>, . As the ship was visually identical to "Lexington", her funnel was painted with a large black vertical stripe to help pilots recognize her. She began her <a href="shakedown%20cruise">shakedown cruise</a> on 6 January 1928 and five days later <a href="Marc%20A.%20Mitscher">Marc A. Mitscher</a> landed the first aircraft on board. Later that month, the rigid <a href="airship">airship</a> was refueled and resupplied when she moored to "Saratoga"s stern on 27 January. That same day, the ship sailed for the <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a> via the Panama Canal, although she was diverted briefly en route to carry <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a> to <a href="Corinto%20%28Nicaragua%29">Corinto</a>, Nicaragua, before joining the <a href="Battle%20Fleet">Battle Fleet</a> at <a href="San%20Pedro%2C%20California">San Pedro, California</a>, on 21 February. On 15 September, Captain <a href="John%20Halligan%2C%20Jr.">John Halligan, Jr.</a> relieved the newly promoted Rear Admiral Yarnell.
In January 1929, "Saratoga" participated in her first fleet exercise, <a href="Fleet%20Problem%20IX">Fleet Problem IX</a>, a simulated attack on the Panama Canal. These exercises tested the Navy's evolving doctrine and tactics for the use of carriers. The ship was detached from the fleet with only the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> as escort and made a wide sweep to the south to attack the canal, which was defended by the <a href="Scouting%20Fleet">Scouting Fleet</a> and "Lexington", from an unexpected direction. Although the carrier was spotted by two defending ships before she launched her air strike, her aircraft were deemed to have destroyed the <a href="canal%20lock">canal lock</a>s. "Saratoga" was "sunk" later the same day by an airstrike from "Lexington". Captain <a href="Frederick%20J.%20Horne">Frederick J. Horne</a> assumed command on 20 April. The following year, "Saratoga" and "Langley" were "disabled" by a surprise attack from "Lexington" in <a href="Fleet%20Problem%20X">Fleet Problem X</a> in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. "Saratoga" returned the favor shortly afterward in Fleet Problem XI, further demonstrating the vulnerability of carriers to aerial attack. Following the exercises, "Saratoga" participated in the <a href="Presidential%20Review">Presidential Review</a> at <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a> in May and then returned to San Pedro. Captain Frank McCrary relieved Horne on 5 September 1930.

"Saratoga" was assigned, together with "Lexington", to defend the west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931. While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys, the enemy forces succeeded in making a landing. All three carriers then transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers, including one in which "Saratoga" successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from a staged attack by "Lexington". <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Joseph%20M.%20Reeves">Joseph M. Reeves</a> baited a trap for "Lexington"s captain, <a href="Ernest%20J.%20King">Ernest J. King</a>, with a destroyer and scored a kill on "Lexington" on 22 March while the latter's aircraft were still searching for "Saratoga". The 1932 movie "<a href="Hell%20Divers">Hell Divers</a>" was filmed aboard the ship and starred <a href="Wallace%20Beery">Wallace Beery</a> and a young <a href="Clark%20Gable">Clark Gable</a> as a pair of competing aircraft gunners assigned to <a href="VFA-14%20%28U.S.%20Navy%29">VF-1B</a>.

During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, "Saratoga" and "Lexington" were able to launch an airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932, without being detected. The two carriers were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Blue Fleet and "Saratoga" were tasked to attack Hawaii and the West Coast defended by "Lexington" and the Black Fleet. On 15 March, "Lexington" caught "Saratoga" with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently judged sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. Captain George W. Steele assumed command on 11 July 1932. While en route from San Diego to San Pedro, the ship briefly ran aground off <a href="Sunset%20Beach%2C%20California">Sunset Beach, California</a> on 17 August. Captain Rufus F. Zogbaum, Jr. (son of the famous illustrator) relieved Steele, who was ordered to immediately retire, on 1 January 1933.

Before Fleet Problem XIV began the following month, the Army and the Navy conducted a joint exercise simulating a carrier attack on Hawaii. "Lexington" and "Saratoga" successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 31 January without being detected. During the actual fleet problem, the ship successfully attacked targets in and around <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> although she was damaged by opposing ships during the latter attack. Scenes from the 1933 <a href="Joe%20E.%20Brown%20%28comedian%29">Joe E. Brown</a> film comedy "Son of a Sailor" were filmed aboard "Saratoga" and featured flight deck musters of the ships' company. Fleet Problem XV returned to the Gulf of Panama and the Caribbean in April–May 1934; the participating ships of the Pacific Fleet remained in the Caribbean and off the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> for more training and maneuvers until they returned to their home bases in November. Captain <a href="Kenneth%20Whiting">Kenneth Whiting</a> relieved Zogbaum on 12 June, after the conclusion of the fleet problem.
Captain <a href="William%20F.%20Halsey">William F. Halsey</a> assumed command on 6 July 1935 after the conclusion of Fleet Problem XVI. From 27 April to 6 June 1936, she participated in a Fleet Problem in the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a> where she was "sunk" by opposing battlecruisers and later ruled to have been severely damaged by aircraft from . During Fleet Problem XVIII in 1937, "Saratoga", now under the command of naval aviation pioneer <a href="John%20H.%20Towers">John H. Towers</a>, covered an amphibious assault on <a href="Midway%20Atoll">Midway Atoll</a> and was badly "damaged" by "Ranger"s aircraft.

The 1938 Fleet Problem again tested the defenses of Hawaii and, again, aircraft from "Saratoga" and her sister successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 29 March. Later in the exercise, the two carriers successfully attacked San Francisco without being spotted by the defending fleet. Captain <a href="Albert%20Cushing%20Read">Albert Cushing Read</a> relieved Towers in July 1938. During <a href="Fleet%20Problem%20XX">Fleet Problem XX</a> in 1939, the carrier remained off the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> as part of Task Force (TF) 7 with the battleship and escorts under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a> to maintain a presence in the Pacific. From 2 April to 21 June 1940, she participated in <a href="Fleet%20Problem%20XXI">Fleet Problem XXI</a>, and her aircraft, together with those from "Lexington", "damaged" the carrier in an early phase of the exercise. Shortly before the end of the fleet problem, Captain <a href="A.%20H.%20Douglas">Archibald Douglas</a> replaced Read as commanding officer.

From 6 January to 15 August 1941, "Saratoga" underwent a long-deferred modernization at the Bremerton Navy Yard that included the widening of her flight deck at her <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> and the installation of additional <a href="antiaircraft%20gun">antiaircraft gun</a>s and a CXAM-1 radar. The ship began a refit a few days later that lasted until late November, further revising the anti-aircraft armament and added a FC radar.

When the Japanese <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attacked Pearl Harbor</a> on 7 December 1941, "Saratoga" was entering <a href="San%20Diego%20Harbor">San Diego Harbor</a> to embark her air group, which had been training ashore while the ship was refitting. This consisted of 11 <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat</a> fighters of <a href="VF-3">VF-3</a> (under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20%28navy%29">Lieutenant</a> <a href="John%20Thach">Jimmy Thach</a>), 43 <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">Douglas SBD Dauntless</a> dive bombers of VB-3 and VS-3, and 11 <a href="Douglas%20TBD%20Devastator">Douglas TBD Devastator</a> torpedo bombers of VT-3. The ship also was under orders to load 14 Marine Corps <a href="Brewster%20F2A%20Buffalo">Brewster F2A-3 Buffalo</a> fighters of <a href="VMF-221">VMF-221</a> for delivery in <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>. The following morning the ship, now the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of Carrier Division One, commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="Aubrey%20Fitch">Aubrey Fitch</a>, sailed for Pearl Harbor. "Saratoga" arrived at Pearl on 15 December, refueled, and departed for <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a> the following day. The ship was assigned to Task Force (TF) 14 under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Frank%20Jack%20Fletcher">Frank Jack Fletcher</a>; VF-3 had been reinforced by two additional Wildcats picked up in Hawaii, but one SBD had been forced to <a href="Water%20landing">ditch</a> on 11 December.

She then rendezvoused with the <a href="seaplane%20tender">seaplane tender</a> , carrying reinforcements and supplies, and the slow <a href="replenishment%20oiler">replenishment oiler</a> . "Saratoga"s task force was delayed by the necessity to refuel its escorting destroyers on 21 December, before reaching the island. This process was prolonged by heavy weather, although the task force could still reach Wake by 24 December as scheduled. After receiving reports of heavy Japanese carrier <a href="airstrike">airstrike</a>s, and then troop landings, TF 14 was recalled on 23 December, and Wake <a href="Battle%20of%20Wake%20Island">fell the same day</a>. On the return voyage, "Saratoga" delivered VMF-221 to Midway on 25 December. The ship arrived at Pearl on 29 December and Fletcher was replaced as commander of Task Force 14 by Rear Admiral <a href="Herbert%20F.%20Leary">Herbert F. Leary</a> the following day. Leary made "Saratoga" his flagship and Fitch was transferred to a shore command that same day. The task force put to sea on 31 December and patrolled in the vicinity of Midway.

"Saratoga", about southwest of Pearl Harbor on 11 January 1942, was heading towards a rendezvous with USS "Enterprise" when she was hit by a torpedo fired by the <a href="Junsen%20type%20submarine%23Junsen%20II%20.28I-6%20class.29">"I-6"</a>. The explosion flooded three of her boiler rooms, reduced her speed to a maximum of and killed six of her crewmen. The ship's <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> was soon corrected and she reached Pearl two days later. While undergoing temporary repairs there, her four twin eight-inch gun turrets were removed for installation in <a href="shore%20battery">shore batteries</a> on Oahu. "Saratoga" then sailed to the Bremerton Navy Yard on 9 February for permanent repairs. She <a href="wikt%3Aembark">embarked</a> 10 Wildcats of the VF-2 Detachment and all of VS-3 with its Dauntlesses for self-protection on the voyage.

While under repair, the ship was modernized with an anti-torpedo bulge, her anti-aircraft armament was significantly upgraded and more radars were added. Douglas was relieved on 12 April and "Saratoga" was temporarily commanded by her <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a>, Commander <a href="Alfred%20M.%20Pride">Alfred M. Pride</a>, until Captain <a href="DeWitt%20Clinton%20Ramsey">DeWitt Ramsey</a> assumed command a month later. "Saratoga" departed from Bremerton on 22 May, bound for San Diego. She arrived there on 25 May and began loading aircraft and supplies while waiting for her task force commander, Admiral Fitch, to arrive from the South Pacific. On 30 May Admiral Nimitz, now <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">United States Pacific Fleet</a>, ordered Captain Ramsey to expedite his departure for Pearl Harbor, even if Fitch had not yet arrived. The ship sailed from San Diego on 1 June carrying 14 Wildcats of <a href="VF-2">VF-2</a> Detachment and 23 Dauntlesses of VS-3; in addition she carried four Wildcats, 43 Dauntlesses and 14 Avengers as cargo. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 June, the final day of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. After refuelling, "Saratoga" departed the following day with the mission to ferry replacement aircraft to the carriers that survived the battle. The ship carried a total of 47 Wildcats, 45 Dauntlesses, five Devastators and 10 Avengers, including her own air group. Admiral Fletcher (whose flagship "Yorktown" had been sunk during the battle) came aboard on 8 June and made "Saratoga" his flagship. The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 11 June and transferred 19 Dauntlesses, the five Devastators and all of the Avengers to them. When the ship reached Pearl on 13 June, Fletcher and his staff disembarked; Admiral Fitch rendezvoused with the ship the next day. He became commander of Task Force 11 on 15 June, when Nimitz reorganized his carriers. From 22 through 29 June, "Saratoga" ferried 18 Marine Dauntlesses of <a href="VMSB-231">VMSB-231</a> and 25 Army Air Corps <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Warhawk</a>s to Midway Island to replace the aircraft lost during the battle. Fletcher relieved Fitch as commander of TF 11 the following day.

In late June 1942, the Allies decided to seize bases in the southern <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> with the objective of denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. They also intended to use <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> and <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a> as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>. Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces. They fell under the command of the recently appointed <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Robert%20L.%20Ghormley">Robert L. Ghormley</a>, commander of the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Area">South Pacific Area</a>.

On 7 July, Task Force 11 departed Pearl for the <a href="Southwest%20Pacific">Southwest Pacific</a>; it consisted of "Saratoga", four heavy cruisers, , , and , and an escort of seven destroyers. Also assigned were three replenishment oilers and four fast transports converted from old four-stack destroyers. The carrier embarked 90 aircraft, comprising 37 Wildcats, 37 Dauntlesses and 16 Avengers. TF 11 and TF 18, centered around the carrier , rendezvoused south of <a href="Tongatapu">Tongatapu</a> on 24 July and they met the remaining forces, including "Enterprise"s TF 16, assigned to Operation Watchtower three days later south of the <a href="Fiji">Fiji Islands</a>. The entire force of 82 ships was organized as <a href="Task%20Force%2061">Task Force 61</a> and commanded by Fletcher. On 30 July, "Saratoga" and the other carriers provided air cover for <a href="amphibious%20landing">amphibious landing</a>s on <a href="Koro%20Island">Koro Island</a> and practiced air strikes as part of the rehearsals for the planned invasion of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and nearby islands.

The Allied force successfully reached the Solomon Islands without being detected by the Japanese because of thick fog and haze. "Saratoga" launched 24 Dauntlesses and a dozen Wildcats early on 7 August to attack targets on Guadalcanal. Her <a href="Air%20Group%20Commander">air group commander</a>, Commander <a href="Harry%20D.%20Felt">Harry D. Felt</a>, coordinated the attack over the island, which also included eight Wildcats from "Enterprise"s VF-6. The aircraft focused on the nearly complete airfield at Lunga and dispersed the two construction battalions building it. This allowed the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division">1st Marine Division</a> to capture it (renaming it <a href="Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Henderson Field</a>) without resistance. For the rest of the day, the carriers provided a <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a> (CAP) over the transports and themselves while their other aircraft provided air support for the Marines as needed.

The Japanese struck back quickly and launched 27 <a href="Mitsubishi%20G4M">Mitsubishi G4M</a> ("Betty") medium bombers, escorted by 17 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a> ("Zeke") fighters, against the Allied forces. Among the escorting pilots were several <a href="flying%20ace">aces</a> such as <a href="Junichi%20Sasai">Junichi Sasai</a>, <a href="Toshio%20Ota">Toshio Ota</a>, <a href="Hiroyoshi%20Nishizawa">Hiroyoshi Nishizawa</a>, and <a href="Sabur%C5%8D%20Sakai">Saburō Sakai</a>. Failing to spot the carriers, the bombers attacked the transports and their escorts, defended by eight Wildcats from "Saratoga"s VF-5. The Zeros shot down five Wildcats without losing any of their own, but the Americans shot down at least one G4M and damaged a number of others. The bombers failed to hit any Allied ships. About an hour later, nine <a href="Aichi%20D3A">Aichi D3A</a> ("Val") dive bombers attacked the transport groups. Also based in Rabaul, they were on a one-way mission with a minimal payload of two small bombs each because the distance to Guadalcanal exceeded their combat range; the pilots were expected to ditch at <a href="Shortland%20Island">Shortland Island</a> on the return leg where a Japanese seaplane tender could pick them up. By the time they arrived, the American CAP had been reinforced to 15 Wildcats from VF-5 and VF-6. Realizing that they had been spotted and that they could not reach the vulnerable transports before they were intercepted by the defending fighters, the Japanese attacked two of the escorting destroyers. They lightly damaged one destroyer with a direct hit, but the Americans shot down five of the attackers without loss to themselves.

The Japanese attacked the transports again the following day, but none of "Saratoga"s aircraft were involved. Concerned about his declining fuel reserves and worried about air and submarine attacks after losing 20% of his fighters, Fletcher requested permission from Ghormley to withdraw one day early to refuel. This was granted and Fletcher's carriers were mostly out of range by the morning of 9 August. This meant that they were out of strike range after a <a href="Battle%20of%20Savo%20Island">Japanese cruiser force sank four Allied cruisers that night</a>. The transports still lacked air cover, but the only Japanese airstrike of the day specifically targeted the carriers and ignored the transports entirely. Fletcher loitered southeast of the Solomons, waiting for the Japanese carriers that signals intelligence told him were en route to be spotted. He rendezvoused with the aircraft transport on 19 August and covered her approach to Guadalcanal. The ship was carrying Marine aircraft for Henderson Field and successfully flew them off the next day. Fletcher returned to the Solomons on 21 August after escorting "Long Island" to safety and remained in the vicinity for the next several days to provide cover for two transports resupplying the Marines. American aircraft shot down several Japanese reconnaissance aircraft during this time and the Japanese concluded that one or more American carriers were operating southeast of Guadalcanal.

The presence of American carriers nearby firmed up Japanese plans to land troops on Guadalcanal on 24 August, covered by the fleet carriers and and the light carrier . A force of Japanese <a href="troop%20transport">troop transport</a>s was detected on the morning of 23 August some north of Guadalcanal. Fletcher was not originally inclined to attack them until another force of two transports was spotted at <a href="Faisi">Faisi</a> later that morning. He changed his mind and ordered "Saratoga" to launch her airstrike of 31 Dauntlesses and six Avengers in the early afternoon at very long range. They could not locate the Japanese convoy in poor visibility because it had reversed course shortly after spotting the American reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft lacked the range to return to their carrier and they were ordered to land at Henderson Field and return the following morning.

The Japanese failed to locate the American carriers during the day and Vice Admiral <a href="Ch%C5%ABichi%20Nagumo">Chūichi Nagumo</a>, commander of the First Carrier Division, ordered "Ryūjō", escorted by the heavy cruiser and two destroyers, to attack Henderson Field, as per Admiral <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>'s orders. American aircraft located the "Ryūjō" task force the following morning as it approached within aircraft range of Guadalcanal, as well as other enemy ships, but failed to spot the fleet carriers. Fletcher delayed his attack until further reconnaissance aircraft failed to find the other Japanese carriers and his own aircraft returned from Henderson Field. In the meantime, "Ryūjō" had launched her own airstrike against Henderson Field, although they inflicted little damage while losing seven out of 21 aircraft during the attack.

"Saratoga" launched an airstrike against "Ryūjō"s task force in the early afternoon that consisted of 31 Dauntlesses and eight Avengers; the long range precluded fighter escort. While those aircraft were en route, a number of reconnaissance aircraft from "Enterprise" spotted and attacked the Japanese formation. They inflicted no damage and the Japanese CAP shot down one Avenger. "Saratoga"s aircraft sighted the carrier shortly afterward and attacked. They hit "Ryūjō" three times with bombs and one torpedo; the torpedo hit flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms. No aircraft from either "Ryūjō" or "Saratoga" were shot down in the attack. The carrier capsized about four hours later with the loss of 120 crewmen.

About an hour after "Saratoga" launched her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers. "Shōkaku" contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while "Zuikaku" launched nine D3As and six Zeros. Reconnaissance SBDs from "Enterprise" spotted the 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of "Shōkaku"s Zeros stayed behind to deal with the Dauntlesses as they attacked "Shōkaku". The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was garbled and the enemy's location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.

The first airstrike attacked the ships of TF 16 which was initially defended by fighters from VF-6. Once radar spotted the incoming Japanese aircraft, both carriers launched all available fighters. "Enterprise" was badly damaged by three bomb hits, but the Japanese lost 19 dive bombers and four Zeros to the defending fighters and anti-aircraft fire. They claimed to have shot down a dozen Wildcats although the Americans lost only five, of which three belonged to VF-5; some of the American losses were reportedly due to friendly anti-aircraft fire. In turn, the American fighters claimed to have shot down 52 Japanese aircraft, 15 more than the Japanese committed to the attack. The second Japanese airstrike failed to locate the American carriers.

Right before the Japanese attack, "Saratoga" launched a small airstrike of two Dauntlesses and five Avengers to clear her flight deck and these planes found and damaged the <a href="Japanese%20aircraft%20carrier%20Chitose">seaplane tender "Chitose"</a> with near misses that also destroyed three <a href="Mitsubishi%20F1M">Mitsubishi F1M</a> reconnaissance <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s. Two Avengers were forced to make emergency landings, but they shot down one Zero from "Shōkaku". After recovering their returning aircraft, the two American carriers withdrew, "Enterprise" for repairs and "Saratoga" to refuel the next day. Before the former departed for Tongatapu for temporary repairs, she transferred 17 Wildcats and six Avengers to "Saratoga" as replacements for the latter's losses.

Fletcher rendezvoused with TF 18 east of <a href="San%20Cristobal%20%28Solomon%20Islands%29">San Cristobal</a> on the evening of 26 August and transferred four Wildcats to "Wasp" the next day to bring the latter's fighters up to strength. TF 17, with the carrier , arrived on 29 August. Two days later, a torpedo from struck "Saratoga" on her starboard side, just aft of the island. The torpedo wounded a dozen of her sailors, including Fletcher, it flooded one fireroom, giving the ship a 4° list, and it caused multiple electrical <a href="short%20circuit">short circuit</a>s. These damaged "Saratoga"s turbo-electric propulsion system and left her dead in the water for a time. The heavy cruiser "<a href="USS%20Minneapolis%20%28CA-36%29">Minneapolis</a>" took "Saratoga" in tow while she launched her aircraft for <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a>, retaining 36 fighters aboard. By noon, the list had been corrected and she was able to steam under her own power later that afternoon.

"Saratoga" reached Tongatapu on 6 September and flew off 27 Wildcats for <a href="Efate">Efate</a> once she arrived. The ship received temporary repairs there and sailed for Pearl on 12 September, escorted by the battleship , "New Orleans" and five destroyers. Task Force 11 reached Pearl on 21 September and "Saratoga" entered <a href="drydock">drydock</a> the following day for more permanent repairs. Captain Ramsey was promoted on 27 September and replaced by Captain <a href="Gerald%20F.%20Bogan">Gerald F. Bogan</a>.

Task Force 11, now commanded by Rear Admiral Ramsey, sailed from Pearl Harbor, bound for <a href="Noum%C3%A9a">Nouméa</a>, <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, via <a href="Viti%20Levu">Viti Levu</a>, Fiji, on 12 November 1942 with "Saratoga" as his flagship. The other ships of the task force consisted of "New Orleans", the <a href="fleet%20oiler">fleet oiler</a> and six destroyers. The carrier had on board the Wildcats of VF-6, Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-6, and the Avengers of VT-3. The ships dropped anchor in <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> on 22 November, except for "New Orleans", which immediately left for Nouméa, escorted by two destroyers. The cruiser was replaced by the light <a href="anti-aircraft%20cruiser">anti-aircraft cruiser</a> on 29 November and the task force sailed for Nouméa on 1 December. After they arrived on 5 December, one of "Saratoga"s main turbines required repairs which lasted until 13 December.

On 23 January 1943, "Saratoga" launched 18 Wildcats of VF-3, 24 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3, and 17 Avengers of VT-3 for Henderson Field, retaining 16 Wildcats and 15 Dauntlesses for self-defense. The next day they attacked the Japanese airfield at <a href="Vila%2C%20Solomon%20Islands">Vila, Solomon Islands</a> after it had been bombarded by four Allied light cruisers. The aircraft returned to the carrier without loss later that afternoon. Captain Bogan slipped and badly injured himself on 29 March so Captain <a href="Henry%20M.%20Mullinnix">Henry M. Mullinnix</a> assumed command on 7 April.
With the withdrawal of "Enterprise" in early May, "Saratoga" became the only operational American fleet carrier in the South Pacific. Task Force 14, as her group was now known, was reinforced by the anti-aircraft cruiser on 3 May and by the British fleet carrier on 17 May. At this time Saratoga embarked 34 Wildcats of VF-5, 37 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3 and 16 Avengers of VT-8. Ramsey's force was intended to provide distant cover for the impending landings on <a href="New%20Georgia">New Georgia</a> and to prevent intervention by any Japanese carriers. The two carriers spent some weeks familiarizing each other with their capabilities and tactics and Ramsey decided to take advantage of each carrier's strengths. He ordered that the Avengers of <a href="832%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">832 Squadron</a> be exchanged for 24 Wildcats from VF-3 as "Victorious" had difficulty operating the large Avenger and the British carrier possessed better facilities for coordinating fighter operations than "Saratoga"; the latter retained a dozen Wildcats for self-defense and escort duties. Fortunately, Ramsey never got a chance to test his reorganization as the Japanese carriers made no effort to attack the American transports. Ramsey was relieved on 26 July and replaced by Rear Admiral <a href="Frederick%20C.%20Sherman">Frederick C. Sherman</a>. "Victorious" sailed on 31 July for home and left eleven Avengers behind as reserves for "Saratoga".

Carrier Air Group 12 was assigned to "Saratoga" in lieu of Carrier Air Group 3 and flew aboard on 1 August. It was composed of <a href="VF-12">VF-12</a>, VB-12 and VT-12; the fighter and dive bomber squadrons each had 36 aircraft and the torpedo bomber squadron had half that number. Grumman F6F Hellcats replaced the Wildcats formerly used. The task force was redesignated as <a href="Task%20Force%2038">Task Force 38</a> on 4 August and Captain <a href="John%20H.%20Cassady">John H. Cassady</a> relieved Mullinix on 22 August after the latter was promoted. The ship was based at <a href="Havannah%20Harbor">Havannah Harbor</a>, Efate and Espiritu Santo from August through November. While refueling at sea on the night of 12 October, "Saratoga" collided with the oiler , damaging three of her 20-millimeter guns on her port side. On 22 October, she was joined by the light aircraft carrier .

On 27 October, Task Force 38 provided air cover for the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Treasury%20Islands">invasion of the Treasury Islands</a>, part of the preliminary operations for the invasion of <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville Island</a> scheduled a few days later. On the morning of 1 November, "Saratoga"s aircraft neutralized Japanese airfields at the northern end of the island and on <a href="Buka%20Island">Buka Island</a>. They destroyed 15 Japanese aircraft while losing three Hellcats, one Dauntless, and two Avengers to all causes. While the task force was refuelling on 3–4 November, reconnaissance aircraft discovered Japanese cruisers massing at Rabaul and Admiral Halsey ordered Task Force 38 to attack them with maximal force before they could engage the transports at Bougainville. This translated into an attack group of 23 Avengers and 22 Dauntlesses, escorted by every available fighter on board the two carriers on 5 November; CAP over the carriers was provided by fighters flying from New Georgia. The <a href="Bombing%20of%20Rabaul%20%28November%201943%29">attack</a> caught the Japanese by surprise and badly damaged four heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and a destroyer for the loss of only nine aircraft to all causes.

"Saratoga" and "Princeton" attacked Rabaul again on 11 November in conjunction with three carriers of Task Group 50.3. They attacked first, but inflicted little damage due to poor visibility; the other carriers were more successful and further damaged the ships at Rabaul. Task Force 38 returned to Espiritu Santo on 14 November. Now known as Task Group 50.4, "Saratoga" and "Princeton" were tasked as the "Relief Carrier Group" for the offensive in the <a href="Gilbert%20Islands">Gilbert Islands</a>. As part of the preliminary operations, they attacked <a href="Nauru">Nauru</a> on 19 November, destroying two fighters and three G4Ms on the ground. As the carriers were withdrawing, they were unsuccessfully attacked by eight more G4Ms, shooting down half of their attackers. TF 50.2 was not attacked during the battle and "Saratoga" transferred a number of her aircraft to replace losses aboard the other carriers before departing for Pearl Harbor on 30 November. She arrived on 4 December and off-loaded her aircraft and stores before proceeding to San Francisco where she arrived on 9 December for a refit and augmentation of her anti-aircraft guns.

"Saratoga"s refit was completed on 2 January 1944 and she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 January. The ship, now the flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="Samuel%20Ginder">Samuel Ginder</a>, commander of Task Group 58.4, sailed from Pearl Harbor on 19 January with and "Princeton", to support the invasion of the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> scheduled to begin on 1 February. Her air group at this time consisted of 36 Hellcats of VF-12, 24 Dauntlesses of VB-12 and eight Avengers of VT-8. As part of the preliminary operations, aircraft from the Task Group attacked airfields at <a href="Wotje">Wotje</a> and <a href="Taroa">Taroa</a> on 29–31 January, radio stations at <a href="Rongelap%20Atoll">Rongelap</a> and <a href="Utirik%20Atoll">Utirik Atoll</a> on 1 February, and then attacked Engebi, the main island at <a href="Eniwetok%20Atoll">Eniwetok Atoll</a>, from 3 to 6 February, refuelled, and attacked Japanese defenses at Eniwetok again from 10 to 12 February. They provided air support during the entire <a href="Battle%20of%20Eniwetok">Battle of Eniwetok</a> which began on 17 February with landings at Engebi and continued until the islands were secured on 24 February. They then protected the Allied forces there until 28 February when land-based aircraft assumed that role.

On 4 March, "Saratoga" departed <a href="Majuro">Majuro</a> with an escort of three destroyers to reinforce the Eastern Fleet in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> and allow it to attack Japanese-controlled territory. She rendezvoused at sea on 27 March with the British force and arrived at <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a>, <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, on 31 March. During the next two weeks, the carriers conducted intensive training and rehearsing with the fleet carrier for an attack on the port city of <a href="Sabang%2C%20Indonesia">Sabang</a> (<a href="Operation%20Cockpit">Operation Cockpit</a>) scheduled for 19 April. For this operation, "Saratoga" mustered 27 Hellcats, 24 Dauntlesses and 18 Avengers. The carrier launched 24 Hellcats, 11 Avengers and 18 Dauntlesses while "Illustrious" contributed 17 <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a> bombers and 13 <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">Vought F4U Corsair</a> fighters. The attack caught the Japanese by surprise and there was no aerial opposition, so the escorts <a href="strafing">strafed</a> the airfield and destroyed 24 aircraft on the ground. The port facilities and <a href="Oil%20depot">oil storage tanks</a> were heavily damaged and one small freighter was sunk for the loss of one Hellcat to <a href="flak">flak</a>. The Japanese attempted to attack the fleet with three G4Ms as it was withdrawing, but the CAP shot down all three bombers. Sailing from Ceylon on 6 May, the task force attacked the <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a> at <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>, Java, on 17 May after refueling at <a href="Exmouth%20Gulf">Exmouth Gulf</a>, Australia. Little damage was inflicted on the refinery and only one small ship was sunk for the loss of one of VT-3's Avengers. "Saratoga" was relieved from its assignment with the British the next day and ordered back to Pearl.

The ship arrived at Pearl on 10 June and remained for several days before departing for Bremerton to begin an overhaul scheduled to last several months. Captain Cassady was relieved by Captain Thomas Sisson on 22 June although he was only briefly in command before Captain Lucian A. Moebus assumed command on 31 July. "Saratoga" completed her post-refit sea trials on 13 September and arrived at the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Alameda">Naval Air Station Alameda</a> on 16 September to begin loading 85 aircraft, 1500 passengers and cargo bound for Pearl Harbor. She departed San Francisco two days later and arrived on 24 September. The ship was assigned to Carrier Division 11 which was tasked to train <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a> pilots and to develop night tactics and doctrine. Rear Admiral <a href="Matthias%20Gardner">Matthias Gardner</a> made "Saratoga" his flagship on 10 October. Four days later, the ship was accidentally rammed by her <a href="plane%20guard">plane guard</a> destroyer , gashing the port side of her hull. Operations were immediately cancelled and she returned to port for temporary repairs. Permanent repairs were made during a brief refit during the first week of November. <a href="Carrier%20qualification">Carrier qualification</a> and other training continued through most of January 1945.

On 29 January 1945, "Saratoga" departed Pearl Harbor for <a href="Ulithi%20Atoll">Ulithi Atoll</a> to rendezvous with the "Enterprise" and form a night fighter task group (TG 58.5/<a href="Night%20Carrier%20Division%207">Night Carrier Division 7</a>) along with "Enterprise", to provide air cover for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">amphibious landings on Iwo Jima</a>. She arrived on 8 February with the 53 Hellcats and 17 Avengers of Carrier Air Group (Night) 53 aboard and sailed two days later.
The carrier force carried out diversionary strikes on the Japanese home islands on the nights of 16 and 17 February, before the landings began. "Saratoga" was assigned to provide fighter cover while the remaining carriers launched the strikes on Japan, but in the process, her fighters raided two Japanese airfields. The force fueled on 18 and 19 February, and the ship provided CAP over Iwo Jima on 19–20 February. The following day, "Saratoga" was detached with an escort of three destroyers to join the amphibious forces and carry out night patrols over Iwo Jima and nearby <a href="Chichi%20Jima">Chichi Jima</a>. Taking advantage of low cloud cover and "Saratoga"s weak escort, six Japanese planes scored five bomb hits on the carrier in three minutes; three of the aircraft also struck the carrier. "Saratoga"s flight deck forward was wrecked, her starboard side was holed twice and large fires were started in her hangar deck; she lost 123 of her crew dead or missing as well as 192 wounded. Thirty-six of her aircraft were destroyed. Another attack two hours later further damaged her flight deck. Slightly over an hour later, the fires were under control, and "Saratoga" was able to recover six fighters. The ship was sent to Bremerton for permanent repairs, arriving there on 16 March.
Because of "Saratoga"s age and the number of modern carriers in service, the Navy decided to modify her into a training carrier. The aft elevator and its machinery were removed, the opening was plated over and the forward elevator was replaced with a larger model. Part of the hangar deck was converted into classrooms. While the ship was still under repair Captain <a href="Frank%20Peak%20Akers">Frank Akers</a> assumed command on 27 April. The post-refit machinery trials on 12 May revealed some problems with one turbine, and an explosion in one 5-inch gun wounded eleven men and wrecked the mount. The full-power trials were completed on 20 May and a new mount was loaded aboard to be installed at Pearl. The ship sailed for NAS Alameda a few days later where she picked up 60 aircraft, 1,200 passengers and some trucks for delivery in Pearl. "Saratoga" arrived on 1 June and became the flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="Ralph%20F.%20Jennings">Ralph F. Jennings</a>, commander of Carrier Division 11. She resumed carrier qualification training on 3 June until she returned to the dockyard on 10 June for the installation of her replacement five-inch gun mount. Jennings transferred his flag to another carrier from 11 to 30 June. She continued training carrier pilots after the Japanese surrender until 6 September. Over the span of the ship's 17-year career, "Saratoga"s aviators landed on her deck 98,549 times, then the record for the most carrier landings. "Saratoga" received eight <a href="battle%20star">battle star</a>s for her World War II service. After the war, the ship took part in <a href="Operation%20Magic%20Carpet">Operation Magic Carpet</a>, the repatriation of American servicemen from the <a href="European%20Theater%20of%20Operations%20United%20States%20Army">European</a>, <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific</a>, and <a href="China%20Burma%20India%20Theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">Asian</a> theaters. She left Hawaii on 9 September with 3,712 Navy officers and enlisted men bound for the United States. In the course of the operation, she returned 29,204 veterans, the highest total for any individual vessel.

"Saratoga" was surplus to postwar requirements with the large numbers of "Essex"-class carriers in service, and she was assigned to <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> on 22 January 1946.

This was a test conducted at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> to evaluate the effect of the <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> on ships. Captain Stanhope Ring assumed command on 6 March, but was relieved on 2 June by Captain Donald MacMahan. The ship hosted comedian <a href="Jack%20Benny">Jack Benny</a>'s radio show on 21 April, while "Saratoga" was berthed in San Francisco before her departure for Bikini. She departed from pier 33 and headed out the Golden Gate on 1 May 1946.
Operation Crossroads began with the first blast (Test Able), an <a href="air%20burst">air burst</a> on 1 July 1946. "Saratoga" survived the explosion with only minor damage, including the ignition of the teak of her flight deck. A <a href="skeleton%20crew">skeleton crew</a> boarded "Saratoga" the following day to prepare her for the next test on 25 July. The ship was sunk by Test Baker, an underwater blast which was detonated under from the carrier. The force of the explosion lifted the vessel out of the water, knocked everything off her flight deck and knocked most of her funnel onto the flight deck. She was struck from the <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a> on 15 August 1946.

In recent years, the submerged wreck, the top of which is only below the surface, has become a <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> destination, one of only three carrier wrecks accessible to recreational divers (the others are the , in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, and , off <a href="Batticaloa">Batticaloa</a> in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.) After a hiatus of several years, dive trips resumed in 2011.

Tulip mania

Tulip mania (<a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>: "tulpenmanie") was a period in the <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Dutch Golden Age</a> during which contract prices for some <a href="bulbs">bulbs</a> of the recently introduced and fashionable <a href="tulip">tulip</a> reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded <a href="speculative%20bubble">speculative bubble</a>; although some researchers have noted that the "<a href="Kipper%20und%20Wipper">Kipper und Wipper</a>" (literally "Tipper and See-Saw") episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of <a href="debasement">debasement</a> of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown <a href="socio-economic">socio-economic</a> phenomenon than a significant <a href="economic%20crisis">economic crisis</a>. Historically, it had no critical influence on the <a href="prosperity">prosperity</a> of the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>, the world's <a href="Economic%20history%20of%20the%20Dutch%20Republic">leading economic</a> and <a href="Financial%20history%20of%20the%20Dutch%20Republic">financial power in the 17th century</a>. Also, from about 1600 to 1720 the Dutch had the highest <a href="per%20capita%20income">per capita income</a> in the world. The term "tulip mania" is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble when asset prices deviate from <a href="intrinsic%20value%20%28finance%29">intrinsic values</a>.

In Europe, formal <a href="futures%20market">futures market</a>s appeared in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, at the height of tulip mania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled <a href="Artisan">craftsworker</a>. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s, much of which come from biased and speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the <a href="Hyacinth%20%28plant%29">hyacinth</a>, also had high initial prices at the time of their introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost, thus lowering the risk to buyers.

The 1637 event was popularized in 1841 by the book "<a href="Extraordinary%20Popular%20Delusions%20and%20the%20Madness%20of%20Crowds">Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</a>", written by British journalist <a href="Charles%20Mackay%20%28author%29">Charles Mackay</a>. At one point 12 <a href="acre">acre</a>s (5 <a href="hectares">ha</a>) of land were offered for a "Semper Augustus" bulb. Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data is available to prove that a tulip-bulb bubble actually occurred.

The introduction of the tulip to Europe is usually attributed to <a href="Ogier%20Ghiselin%20de%20Busbecq">Ogier de Busbecq</a>, the ambassador of <a href="Ferdinand%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, to the Sultan of Turkey, who sent the first tulip bulbs and seeds to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> in 1554 from the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Tulip bulbs were soon distributed from Vienna to <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>, <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. Its popularity and cultivation in the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">United Provinces</a> (now the Netherlands) is generally thought to have started in earnest around 1593 after the <a href="Southern%20Netherlands">Southern Netherlandish</a> botanist <a href="Charles%20de%20l%27%C3%89cluse">Carolus Clusius</a> had taken up a post at the <a href="Leiden%20University">University of Leiden</a> and established the "<a href="Hortus%20Botanicus%20Leiden">hortus academicus</a>". He planted his collection of tulip bulbs and found they were able to tolerate the harsher conditions of the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>; shortly thereafter, the tulip began to grow in popularity.

The tulip was different from every other flower known to Europe at that time, with a saturated intense petal color that no other plant had. The appearance of the nonpareil tulip as a <a href="status%20symbol">status symbol</a> at this time coincides with the rise of newly independent Holland's trade fortunes. No longer the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>, its economic resources could now be channeled into commerce and the country embarked on <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">its Golden Age</a>. Amsterdam merchants were at the center of the lucrative <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">East Indies trade</a>, where one voyage could yield profits of 400%.
As a result, tulips rapidly became a coveted luxury item, and a profusion of varieties followed. They were classified in groups: the single-hued tulips of red, yellow, or white were known as "Couleren"; the multicolored "Rosen" (white streaks on a red or pink background); "Violetten" (white streaks on a purple or lilac background); and the rarest of all, the "Bizarden (Bizarres)", (yellow or white streaks on a red, brown or purple background). The multicolor effects of intricate lines and flame-like streaks on the petals were vivid and spectacular, making the bulbs that produced these even more exotic-looking plants highly sought-after. It is now known that this effect is due to the bulbs being infected with a type of tulip-specific <a href="mosaic%20virus">mosaic virus</a>, known as the "<a href="tulip%20breaking%20virus">tulip breaking virus</a>", so called because it "breaks" the one petal color into two or more.

Growers named their new varieties with exalted titles. Many early forms were prefixed "Admirael" ("admiral"), often combined with the growers' names: "Admirael van der Eijck", for example, was perhaps the most highly regarded of about fifty so named. "Generael" ("general") was another prefix used for around thirty varieties. Later varieties were given even more extravagant names, derived from <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> or <a href="Scipio%20Africanus">Scipio</a>, or even "Admiral of Admirals" and "General of Generals". Naming could be haphazard and varieties highly variable in quality. Most of these varieties have now died out.

Tulips grow from bulbs, and can be propagated through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The <a href="Tulip%20breaking%20virus">mosaic virus</a> spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus. In the Northern Hemisphere, tulips bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the <a href="spot%20market">spot market</a>) occurred during these months. During the rest of the year, "florists", or tulip traders, signed contracts before a <a href="civil%20law%20notary">notary</a> to buy tulips at the end of the season (effectively <a href="futures%20contract">futures contract</a>s). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were <a href="durable%20good">durable good</a>s. <a href="Short%20%28finance%29">Short selling</a> was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but futures contracts were deemed unenforceable, so traders could repudiate deals if faced with a loss.
As the flowers grew in popularity, professional growers paid higher and higher prices for bulbs with the virus, and prices rose steadily. By 1634, in part as a result of demand from the French, speculators began to enter the market. The contract price of rare bulbs continued to rise throughout 1636, but by November, the price of common, "unbroken" bulbs also began to increase, so that soon any tulip bulb could fetch hundreds of guilders. That year the Dutch created a type of formal <a href="Futures%20exchange">futures market</a> where contracts to buy bulbs at the end of the season were bought and sold. Traders met in "colleges" at taverns and buyers were required to pay a 2.5% "wine money" fee, up to a maximum of three guilders per trade. Neither party paid an initial <a href="margin%20%28finance%29">margin</a>, nor a <a href="mark-to-market">mark-to-market</a> margin, and all contracts were with the individual counter-parties rather than with the Exchange. The Dutch described tulip contract trading as "windhandel" (literally "wind trade"), because no bulbs were actually changing hands. The entire business was accomplished on the margins of Dutch economic life, not in the Exchange itself.

By 1636, the tulip bulb became the fourth leading export product of the Netherlands, after gin, herrings and cheese. The price of tulips skyrocketed because of speculation in tulip futures among people who never saw the bulbs. Many men made and lost fortunes overnight.

Tulip mania reached its peak during the winter of 1636–37, when some bulbs were reportedly changing hands ten times in a day. No deliveries were ever made to fulfil any of these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of tulips ground to a halt. The collapse began in <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused to show up at a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then suffering from an outbreak of <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>. The existence of the plague may have helped to create a culture of fatalistic risk-taking that allowed the speculation to skyrocket in the first place; this outbreak might also have helped to burst the bubble.

The lack of consistently recorded price data from the 1630s makes the extent of the tulip mania difficult to discern. The bulk of available data comes from anti-speculative pamphlets by "Gaergoedt and Warmondt" (GW) written just after the bubble. Economist Peter Garber collected data on the sales of 161 bulbs of 39 varieties between 1633 and 1637, with 53 being recorded by GW. Ninety-eight sales were recorded for the last date of the bubble, February 5, 1637, at wildly varying prices. The sales were made using several market mechanisms: futures trading at the colleges, spot sales by growers, notarized futures sales by growers, and estate sales. "To a great extent, the available price data are a blend of <a href="apples%20and%20oranges">apples and oranges</a>", according to Garber.

The modern discussion of tulip mania began with the book "<a href="Extraordinary%20Popular%20Delusions%20and%20the%20Madness%20of%20Crowds">Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</a>", published in 1841 by the Scottish journalist <a href="Charles%20Mackay%20%28author%29">Charles Mackay</a>; he proposed that crowds of people often behave irrationally, and tulip mania was, along with the <a href="South%20Sea%20Bubble">South Sea Bubble</a> and the <a href="Mississippi%20Company">Mississippi Company</a> scheme, one of his primary examples. His account was largely sourced from a 1797 work by <a href="Johann%20Beckmann">Johann Beckmann</a> titled "A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins". In fact, Beckmann's account, and thus Mackay's by derivation, was primarily sourced to three anonymous pamphlets published in 1637 with an anti-speculative agenda. Mackay's vivid book was popular among generations of economists and stock market participants. His popular but flawed description of tulip mania as a <a href="speculative%20bubble">speculative bubble</a> remains prominent, even though since the 1980s economists have debunked many aspects of his account.

According to Mackay, the growing popularity of tulips in the early 17th century caught the attention of the entire nation; "the population, even to its lowest dregs, embarked in the tulip trade". By 1635, a sale of 40 bulbs for 100,000 florins (also known as <a href="Dutch%20guilder">Dutch guilder</a>s) was recorded. By way of comparison, a ton of butter cost around 100 florins, a skilled laborer might earn 150–350 florins a year, and "eight fat swine" cost 240 florins. According to the <a href="International%20Institute%20of%20Social%20History">International Institute of Social History</a>, one florin in 1637 had the <a href="purchasing%20power">purchasing power</a> of <a href="Euro">€</a>11.51 in 2016.

By 1636, tulips were traded on the <a href="stock%20exchange">exchanges</a> of numerous Dutch towns and cities. This encouraged trading in tulips by all members of society; Mackay recounted people selling or trading their other possessions in order to speculate in the tulip market, such as an offer of of land for one of two existing "Semper Augustus" bulbs, or a single bulb of the "Viceroy" that, Mackay claimed, was purchased in exchange for a basket of goods (shown in table) worth 2,500 florins.

The increasing mania generated several amusing, if unlikely, anecdotes that Mackay recounted, such as a sailor who mistook the valuable tulip bulb of a merchant for an onion and grabbed it to eat. According to Mackay, the merchant and his family chased the sailor to find him "eating a breakfast whose cost might have regaled a whole ship's crew for a twelvemonth"; the sailor was jailed for eating the bulb. In fact, tulips are poisonous if prepared incorrectly, taste bad, and are considered to be only marginally edible even during famines.

People were purchasing bulbs at higher and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. Such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the <a href="stock%20market%20bubble">speculative bubble</a> burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth a fraction of the price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.

In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators sought help from the government of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held at the end of the crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.

According to Mackay, lesser tulip manias also occurred in other parts of Europe, although matters never reached the state they had in the Netherlands. He also claimed that the aftermath of the tulip price deflation led to a widespread economic chill throughout the Netherlands for many years afterwards.

Mackay's account of inexplicable mania was unchallenged, and mostly unexamined, until the 1980s. Research into tulip mania since then, especially by proponents of the <a href="efficient-market%20hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>, suggests that his story was incomplete and inaccurate. In her 2007 scholarly analysis "Tulipmania", Anne Goldgar states that the phenomenon was limited to "a fairly small group", and that most accounts from the period "are based on one or two contemporary pieces of <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> and a prodigious amount of <a href="plagiarism">plagiarism</a>". Peter Garber argues that the trade in common bulbs "was no more than a meaningless winter drinking game, played by a plague-ridden population that made use of the vibrant tulip market."

While Mackay's account held that a wide array of society was involved in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases it is not clear that tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never <a href="Realization%20%28finance%29">realized</a> for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.

There is no dispute that prices for tulip bulb contracts rose and then fell in 1636–37, but even a dramatic rise and fall in prices does not necessarily mean that an <a href="economic%20bubble">economic</a> or speculative bubble developed and then burst. For tulip mania to have qualified as an economic bubble, the price of tulip bulbs would need to have become unhinged from the <a href="Intrinsic%20value%20%28finance%29">intrinsic value</a> of the bulbs. Modern economists have advanced several possible reasons for why the rise and fall in prices may not have constituted a bubble, even though a Viceroy Tulip was worth upwards of five times the cost of an average house at the time.

The increases of the 1630s corresponded with a lull in the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>. In 1634/5 the German and Swedish armies lost ground in the South of Germany; then <a href="Cardinal-Infante%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria</a> moved north. After the <a href="Peace%20of%20Prague%20%281635%29">Peace of Prague</a> the French (and the Dutch) decided to support the Swedish and German protestants with money and arms against the Habsburg empire, and to occupy the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a> in 1636. Hence market prices (at least initially) were responding rationally to a rise in demand. The fall in prices was faster and more dramatic than the rise. Data on sales largely disappeared after the February 1637 collapse in prices, but a few other data points on bulb prices after tulip mania show that bulbs continued to lose value for decades thereafter.

Garber compared the available price data on tulips to <a href="hyacinth%20%28plant%29">hyacinth</a> prices at the beginning of the 19th century—when the <a href="hyacinth%20%28plant%29">hyacinth</a> replaced the tulip as the fashionable flower—and found a similar pattern. When hyacinths were introduced florists strove with one another to grow beautiful hyacinth flowers, as demand was strong. As people became more accustomed to hyacinths the prices began to fall. The most expensive bulbs fell to 1 to 2 percent of their peak value within 30 years. Garber also notes that, "a small quantity of prototype lily bulbs recently was sold for 1 million guilders ($US480,000 at 1987 exchange rates)", demonstrating that even in the modern world, flowers can command extremely high prices. Because the rise in prices occurred after bulbs were planted for the year, growers would not have had an opportunity to increase production in response to price.

Other economists believe that these elements cannot completely explain the dramatic rise and fall in tulip prices. Garber's theory has also been challenged for failing to explain a similar dramatic rise and fall in prices for regular tulip bulb contracts. Some economists also point to other factors associated with speculative bubbles, such as a <a href="Expansionary%20monetary%20policy">growth in the supply of money</a>, demonstrated by an increase in deposits at the <a href="Bank%20of%20Amsterdam">Bank of Amsterdam</a> during that period.

Earl Thompson argued in a 2007 paper that Garber's explanation cannot account for the extremely swift drop in tulip bulb contract prices. The annualized rate of price decline was 99.999%, instead of the average 40% for other flowers. He provided another explanation for Dutch tulip mania. The Dutch parliament had, since late 1636, been considering a decree (originally sponsored by Dutch tulip investors who had lost money because of a German setback in the Thirty Years' War) that changed the way tulip contracts functioned:
Before this parliamentary decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known in modern finance as a <a href="forward%20contract">forward contract</a>—was legally "obliged" to buy the bulbs. The decree changed the nature of these contracts, so that if the <a href="Spot%20price">current market price</a> fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into <a href="Option%20%28finance%29">options contracts</a>—contracts which were extremely favorable to the buyers.

Thompson argues that the "bubble" in the price of tulip bulb futures prior to the February 1637 decree was due primarily to buyers' awareness of what was coming. Although the final 3.5% strike price was not actually settled until February 24, Thompson writes, "as information ... entered the market in late November, contract prices soared to reflect the expectation that the contract price was now a call-option exercise, or strike, price rather than a price committed to be paid." Thompson concludes that "the real victims of the contractual conversion" were the investors who had bought futures contracts "prior" to November 30, 1636, on the incorrect assumption that their contracts would benefit from the February 1637 decree. In other words, many investors were making an "additional gamble with respect to the prices the buyers would eventually have to pay for their options"—a factor unrelated to the intrinsic value of the tulip bulbs themselves.

Using data about the specific payoffs present in the futures and options contracts, Thompson argued that tulip bulb contract prices hewed closely to what a rational economic model would dictate: "Tulip contract prices before, during, and after the 'tulipmania' appear to provide a remarkable illustration of efficient market prices."

The popularity of Mackay's tale has continued to this day, with new editions of "Extraordinary Popular Delusions" appearing regularly, with introductions by writers such as financier <a href="Bernard%20Baruch">Bernard Baruch</a> (1932), financial writer <a href="Andrew%20Tobias">Andrew Tobias</a> (1980), psychologist <a href="David%20J.%20Schneider">David J. Schneider</a> (1993), and journalist <a href="Michael%20Lewis%20%28author%29">Michael Lewis</a> (2008). At least six editions are currently in print.

Goldgar argues that although tulip mania may not have constituted an economic or speculative bubble, it was nonetheless traumatic to the Dutch for other reasons. "Even though the financial crisis affected very few, the shock of tulipmania was considerable. A whole network of values was thrown into doubt." In the 17th century, it was unimaginable to most people that something as common as a flower could be worth so much more money than most people earned in a year. The idea that the prices of flowers that grow only in the summer could fluctuate so wildly in the winter, threw into chaos the very understanding of "value".

Many of the sources telling of the woes of tulip mania, such as the anti-speculative pamphlets that were later reported by Beckmann and Mackay, have been cited as evidence of the extent of the economic damage. These pamphlets were not written by victims of a bubble, but were primarily religiously motivated. The upheaval was viewed as a perversion of the moral order—proof that "concentration on the earthly, rather than the heavenly flower could have dire consequences". Thus, it is possible that a relatively minor economic event took on a life of its own as a morality tale.

Nearly a century later, during the crash of the <a href="Mississippi%20Company">Mississippi Company</a> and the <a href="South%20Sea%20Company">South Sea Company</a> in about 1720, tulip mania appeared in satires of these manias. When <a href="Johann%20Beckmann">Johann Beckmann</a> first described tulip mania in the 1780s, he compared it to the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as <a href="Burton%20Malkiel">Burton Malkiel</a>'s "<a href="A%20Random%20Walk%20Down%20Wall%20Street">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</a>" (1973) and <a href="John%20Kenneth%20Galbraith">John Kenneth Galbraith</a>'s "A Short History of Financial Euphoria" (1990; written soon after the <a href="Black%20Monday%20%281987%29">crash of 1987</a>), used the tulip mania as a lesson in morality. Tulip mania again became a popular reference during the <a href="dot-com%20bubble">dot-com bubble</a> of 1995–2001.

In the 21st century, journalists have compared it to failure of the speculative dot-com bubble and the <a href="subprime%20mortgage%20crisis">subprime mortgage crisis</a>. 
In November 2013 Nout Wellink, former president of the Dutch Central Bank, described <a href="Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> as "worse than the tulip mania," adding, "At least then you got a tulip, now you get nothing."

Despite the mania's enduring popularity, <a href="Daniel%20Gross">Daniel Gross</a> of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" has said of economists offering <a href="Efficient-market%20hypothesis">efficient-market</a> explanations for the mania, that "If they're correct ... then business writers will have to delete Tulipmania from their handy-pack of bubble analogies."

Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)

Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by the English <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, released on 12 September 1975 through <a href="Harvest%20Records">Harvest Records</a> and <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, their first release for the latter. Based on material Pink Floyd composed while performing in Europe, "Wish You Were Here" was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975, at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> in London.

The album encompasses a variety of themes, including criticism towards the <a href="Music%20industry">music business</a>, alienation, as well as a tribute to founding member <a href="Syd%20Barrett">Syd Barrett</a>, who left seven years earlier due to his deteriorating mental health. Like their previous record, "<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>" (1973), Floyd used studio effects, synthesizers and brought in guest singers, including <a href="Roy%20Harper%20%28singer%29">Roy Harper</a>, who provided the lead vocals on "<a href="Have%20a%20Cigar">Have a Cigar</a>", and <a href="Venetta%20Fields">Venetta Fields</a>, who added backing vocals to "Shine On You Crazy Diamond". To promote the album, the band released the double A-side single "Have a Cigar" / "<a href="Welcome%20to%20the%20Machine">Welcome to the Machine</a>".

"Wish You Were Here" received mixed reviews from critics upon its initial release, who found its music to be uninspiring and inferior to their previous work. It has retrospectively received critical acclaim, hailed as one of the greatest albums of all time, and was cited by keyboardist Richard Wright and guitarist David Gilmour as their favorite Pink Floyd album. The album reached number one in the US and UK, and Harvest's parent company, EMI, was unable to keep up with the demand. Since then, the record has sold an estimated 13 million copies.

During 1974, Pink Floyd sketched out three new compositions, "<a href="Sheep%20%28song%29">Raving and Drooling</a>", "<a href="Dogs%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">You Gotta Be Crazy</a>" and "<a href="Shine%20On%20You%20Crazy%20Diamond">Shine On You Crazy Diamond</a>". These songs were performed during a series of concerts in France and England, the band's first tour since 1973's "<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>". As Pink Floyd had never employed a publicist and kept themselves distant from the press, their relationship with the media began to sour. Mason said later that a critical "<a href="NME">NME</a>" review of the band's new material, written by <a href="Syd%20Barrett">Syd Barrett</a> devotee <a href="Nick%20Kent">Nick Kent</a>, may have had influence in keeping the band together, as they returned to the studio in the first week of 1975.

"Wish You Were Here" is Floyd's second album with a conceptual theme written entirely by <a href="Roger%20Waters">Roger Waters</a>. It reflects his feeling that the camaraderie that had served the band was, by then, largely absent. The album begins with a long instrumental preamble and segues into the lyrics for "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier. Barrett is fondly recalled with lines such as "Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun" and "You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon".

"Wish You Were Here" is also a critique of the music business. "Shine On" crosses seamlessly into "<a href="Welcome%20to%20the%20Machine">Welcome to the Machine</a>", a song that begins with an opening door (described by Waters as a symbol of musical discovery and progress betrayed by a music industry more interested in greed and success) and ends with a party, the latter epitomising "the lack of contact and real feelings between people". Similarly, "<a href="Have%20a%20Cigar">Have a Cigar</a>" scorns record industry "fat-cats" with the lyrics repeating a stream of cliches heard by rising newcomers in the industry, and including the question "by the way, which one's Pink?" asked of the band on at least one occasion. The lyrics of the next song, "<a href="Wish%20You%20Were%20Here%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Wish You Were Here</a>", relate both to Barrett's condition, and to the dichotomy of Waters' character, with greed and ambition battling with compassion and idealism. The album closes with a reprise of "Shine On" and further instrumental excursions.

"I had some criticisms of "Dark Side of the Moon"…" noted <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a>. "One or two of the vehicles carrying the ideas were not as strong as the ideas that they carried. I thought we should try and work harder on marrying the idea and the vehicle that carried it, so that they both had an equal magic… It's something I was personally pushing when we made "Wish You Were Here"."

<a href="Alan%20Parsons">Alan Parsons</a>, EMI staff engineer for Pink Floyd's previous studio album, "The Dark Side of the Moon", had declined the band's offer to continue working with them. The group had worked with engineer Brian Humphries on "<a href="More%20%28soundtrack%29">More</a>", recorded at Pye Studios, and again in 1974 when he replaced an inexperienced concert engineer. Humphries was therefore the natural choice to work on the band's new material, although since a stranger to EMI's Abbey Road set-up he encountered some early difficulties. On one occasion, Humphries inadvertently spoiled the backing tracks for "Shine On", a piece that Waters and drummer <a href="Nick%20Mason">Nick Mason</a> had spent many hours perfecting, with <a href="echo">echo</a>. The entire piece had to be re-recorded.

The sessions for "Wish You Were Here" at Abbey Road's Studio Three lasted from January until July 1975, recording on four days each week from 2:30 pm until very late in the evening. The group found it difficult at first to devise any new material, especially as the success of "The Dark Side of the Moon" had left all four physically and emotionally drained. Keyboardist <a href="Richard%20Wright%20%28musician%29">Richard Wright</a> later described these sessions as "falling within a difficult period", and Waters recalled them as "torturous". Mason found the process of multi-track recording drawn out and tedious, while Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Gilmour was also becoming increasingly frustrated with Mason, whose failing marriage had brought on a general malaise and sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming. 

Humphries gave his point of view regarding these struggled sessions in a 2014 interview: “There were days when we didn’t do anything. I don’t think they knew what they wanted to do. We had a dartboard and an air rifle and we’d play these word games, sit around, get drunk, go home and return the next day. That’s all we were doing until suddenly everything started falling into place.”

After several weeks, Waters began to visualise another concept. The three new compositions from 1974's tour were at least a starting point for a new album, and "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for the new work. Mostly an instrumental twenty-minute-plus piece similar to "<a href="Echoes%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Echoes</a>", the opening four-note guitar phrase reminded Waters of the lingering ghost of former band-member Syd Barrett. Gilmour had composed the phrase entirely by accident, but was encouraged by Waters' positive response. Waters wanted to split "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", and sandwich two new songs between its two halves. Gilmour disagreed, but was outvoted three to one. "Welcome to the Machine" and "Have a Cigar" were barely veiled attacks on the music business, their lyrics working neatly with "Shine On" to provide an apt summary of the rise and fall of Barrett; "Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... that sort of indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd." "Raving and Drooling" and "You Gotta Be Crazy" had no place in the new concept, and were set aside until the following album, 1977's "<a href="Animals%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Animals</a>".

On 5 June 1975, on the eve of Pink Floyd's second US tour that year, Gilmour married his first wife, <a href="Ginger%20Gilmour">Ginger</a>. That day, the band were completing the mix of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" when an overweight man with shaven head and eyebrows entered carrying a plastic bag. Waters did not recognise him. Gilmour presumed he was an EMI staff member. Wright presumed he was a friend of Waters, but realised it was Barrett. Mason also failed to recognise him and was "horrified" when Gilmour identified him. In Mason's Pink Floyd memoir "", he recalled Barrett's conversation as "desultory and not entirely sensible". <a href="Storm%20Thorgerson">Storm Thorgerson</a> reflected on Barrett's presence: "Two or three people cried. He sat round and talked for a bit but he wasn't really there."

Waters was reportedly reduced to tears by the sight of his former bandmate. When fellow visitor <a href="Andrew%20King%20%28music%20manager%29">Andrew King</a> asked how Barrett had gained so much weight, Barrett said he had a large refrigerator in his kitchen and had been eating lots of pork chops. He mentioned that he was ready to help with the recording, but while listening to the mix of "Shine On", showed no signs of understanding its relevance to him. Barrett joined Gilmour's wedding reception in the EMI canteen, but left without saying goodbye. It was the last time the band members saw Barrett until his death in 2006. Barrett's appearance may have influenced the final version of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond"; a subtle refrain performed by Wright from "<a href="See%20Emily%20Play">See Emily Play</a>" is audible towards the end.

As in "The Dark Side of the Moon", the band used synthesizers such as the <a href="EMS%20VCS%203">EMS VCS 3</a> (on "Welcome to the Machine"), but softened with Gilmour's acoustic guitar and percussion from Mason. The beginning of "Shine On" contains remnants from a previous but incomplete studio recording by the band known as "<a href="Household%20Objects">Household Objects</a>". Wine glasses had been filled with varying amounts of fluid, and recordings were made of a wet finger circling the edge of each glass. These recordings were multi-tracked into chords, and used in the opening of "Shine On".

Jazz violinist <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Grappelli">Stéphane Grappelli</a> and classical violinist <a href="Yehudi%20Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a> were performing in another studio in the building, and were invited to record a piece for the new album. Menuhin watched as Grappelli played on the song "Wish You Were Here"; however, the band later decided his contribution was unsuitable and, until 2011, it was believed that the piece had been wiped. It turns out his playing was included on the album, but so low in the final mix that the band presumed it would be insulting to credit him. He was paid £300 for his contribution (equivalent to £ in 2019). <a href="Dick%20Parry">Dick Parry</a> again played saxophone, on "Shine On You Crazy Diamond". The opening bars of "Wish You Were Here" were recorded from Gilmour's car radio, with somebody turning the dial (the classical music heard is the finale of <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Fourth Symphony</a>).

Recording sessions had twice been interrupted by US tours (one in April and the other in June 1975), and the final sessions, which occurred after the band's performance at <a href="Concerts%20at%20Knebworth%20House">Knebworth</a>, proved particularly troublesome for Waters. He struggled to record the vocals for "Have a Cigar", requiring several takes to perform an acceptable version. His problems stemmed in part from the stresses placed upon his voice while recording the lead vocals of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond". Gilmour was asked to sing in his place, but declined, and eventually colleague and friend <a href="Roy%20Harper%20%28singer%29">Roy Harper</a> was asked to stand in. Harper was recording his own album in another of Abbey Road's studios, and Gilmour had already performed some guitar licks for him. Waters later regretted the decision, believing he should have performed the song. <a href="Venetta%20Fields">The Blackberries</a> recorded backing vocals for "Shine On You Crazy Diamond".

The band played much of "Wish You Were Here" on 5 July 1975 at the Knebworth music festival. Roy Harper, performing at the same event, on discovering that his stage costume was missing, proceeded to destroy one of Pink Floyd's vans, injuring himself in the process. This delayed the normal setup procedure of the band's sound system. As a pair of World War II <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> had been booked to fly over the crowd during their entrance, the band were not able to delay their set. The result was that a power supply problem pushed Wright's keyboards completely out of tune, damaging the band's performance. At one point he left the stage, but the band were able to continue with a less sensitive keyboard, a piano and a simpler light show. Following a brief intermission, they returned to perform "The Dark Side of the Moon", but critics displeased about being denied access backstage savaged the performance.

"Wish You Were Here" was sold in one of the more elaborate packages to accompany a Pink Floyd album. Storm Thorgerson had accompanied the band on their 1974 tour and had given serious thought to the meaning of the lyrics, eventually deciding that the songs were, in general, concerned with "unfulfilled presence", rather than Barrett's illness. This theme of absence was reflected in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band. Thorgerson had noted that <a href="Roxy%20Music">Roxy Music</a>'s "<a href="Country%20Life%20%28Roxy%20Music%20album%29">Country Life</a>" was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve – censoring the cover image – and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for "Wish You Were Here" in a black-coloured shrink-wrap (therefore making the album art "absent"). The concept behind "Welcome to the Machine" and "Have a Cigar" suggested the use of a handshake (an often empty gesture), and <a href="George%20Hardie%20%28artist%29">George Hardie</a> designed a sticker containing the album's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake, to be placed on the opaque sleeve (the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background).

The album's cover images were photographed by Aubrey 'Po' Powell, Storm's partner at the design studio Hipgnosis and inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings, for fear of "getting burned", and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands, one man on fire. "Getting burned" was also a common phrase in the music industry, used often by artists denied royalty payments. Two stuntmen were used (Ronnie Rondell and Danny Rogers), one dressed in a fire-retardant suit covered by a business suit. His head was protected by a hood, underneath a wig. The photograph was taken at the <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> studios in Los Angeles. Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, and the flames were forced into Rondell's face, burning his moustache. The two stuntmen changed positions, and the image was later reversed.

The album's back cover depicts a faceless "Floyd salesman", in Thorgerson's words, "selling his soul" in the desert (shot in the <a href="Yuma%20Desert">Yuma Desert</a> in California again by Aubrey ' Po ' Powell). The absence of wrists and ankles signifies his presence as an "empty suit". The inner sleeve shows a veil concealing a nude woman in a windswept Norfolk grove, and a splash-less diver at <a href="Mono%20Lake">Mono Lake</a> – titled "Monosee" (the German translation of Mono Lake) on the liner notes – in California (again emphasising the theme of absence). The decision to shroud the cover in black plastic was not popular with the band's US record company, <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, who insisted that it be changed (they were over-ruled). EMI were less concerned; the band were reportedly extremely happy with the end product, and when presented with a pre-production mockup, they accepted it with a spontaneous round of applause.

The album was released on 12 September 1975 in the UK, and on the following day in the US. It was Pink Floyd's first album with Columbia Records, an affiliate of <a href="CBS">CBS</a>; the band and their manager <a href="Steve%20O%27Rourke">Steve O'Rourke</a> had been dissatisfied with the efforts of EMI's US label <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>, The band remained with <a href="EMI">EMI</a>'s <a href="Harvest%20Records">Harvest Records</a> in Europe.

In Britain, with 250,000 advance sales, the album went straight to number one, and demand was such that EMI informed retailers that only 50 percent of their orders would be fulfilled. With 900,000 advance orders (the largest for any Columbia release) it reached number one on the US "Billboard" chart in its second week. "Wish You Were Here" was Pink Floyd's fastest-selling album ever. The album was certified Silver and Gold (60,000 and 100,000 sales respectively) in the UK on 1 August 1975, and Gold in the US on 17 September 1975. It was certified six times platinum on 16 May 1997, and by 2004 has sold an estimated 13 million copies worldwide. "Have a Cigar" was chosen by Columbia as their first single, with "Welcome to the Machine" on the B-side in the US. The album was a commercial hit in Europe, topping Dutch, English and Spanish charts - in Spain, the album remained at number one for 20 weeks.

On release, the album received mixed reviews. Ben Edmunds wrote in "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" that the band's "lackadaisical demeanor" leaves the subject of Barrett "unrealised; they give such a matter-of-fact reading of the goddamn thing that they might as well be singing about Roger Waters's brother-in-law getting a parking ticket." Edmunds concluded the band is "devoid" of the "sincere passion for their 'art'" that contemporary <a href="space%20rock">space rock</a> acts purportedly have. "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" reviewer wrote: "From whichever direction one approaches "Wish You Were Here", it still sounds unconvincing in its ponderous sincerity and displays a critical lack of imagination in all departments."

A positive review came from <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>": "The music is not only simple and attractive, with the synthesizer used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves some of the symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that "The Dark Side of the Moon" simulated so ponderously." Years later, he reflected further on the record: "My favorite Pink Floyd album has always been "Wish You Were Here", and you know why? It has soul, that's why – it's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero but as long as he's Roger's that doesn't matter."

"Wish You Were Here" has since been frequently regarded as one of the greatest albums. According to <a href="Acclaimed%20Music">Acclaimed Music</a>, it is the 185th most ranked record on critics' all-time lists. In 2012, it was voted 211th on "Rolling Stone" magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2015, it was chosen as the fourth greatest progressive rock album by "Rolling Stone". In 1998 <a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">"Q"</a> readers voted "Wish You Were Here" the 34th greatest album of all time. In 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 43 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2007, one of Germany's largest public radio stations, <a href="WDR%202">WDR 2</a>, asked its listeners to vote for the 200 best albums of all time. "Wish You Were Here" was voted number one. In 2004 "Wish You Were Here" was ranked number 36 on <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>'s list of the Top 100 albums of the 1970s. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> rated "Wish You Were Here" as the 8th greatest <a href="classic%20rock">classic rock</a> album. and <a href="Ultimate%20Classic%20Rock">Ultimate Classic Rock</a> placed "Wish You Were Here" second best in their list of "Worst to Best Pink Floyd Albums".

Despite the problems during production, the album remained Wright's favourite: "It's an album I can listen to for pleasure, and there aren't many Floyd albums that I can." Gilmour shares this view: "I for one would have to say that it is my favourite album, the "Wish You Were Here" album. The end result of all that, whatever it was, definitely has left me an album I can live with very very happily. I like it very much."

"Wish You Were Here" has been remastered and re-released on several formats. In the UK and US the album was re-issued in <a href="Quadraphonic%20sound">quadraphonic</a> using the <a href="Stereo%20Quadraphonic">SQ format</a> in 1976, and in 1980 a special "Hi-Fi Today" audiophile print was released in the UK. In the US it was released on CD in 1983, and in the UK 1985, and again as a remastered CD with new artwork in 1994. In the US, Columbia's CBS Mastersound label released a half-speed mastered audiophile LP in 1981, and in 1994 Sony Mastersound released a 24-carat gold-plated CD, remastered using <a href="Super%20Bit%20Mapping">Super Bit Mapping</a>, with the original artwork from the LP in both <a href="longbox">longbox</a> and <a href="Optical%20disc%20packaging">jewel case</a> forms, the latter with a cardboard slipcover. The album was included as part of the box set "<a href="Shine%20On%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Shine On</a>", and five years later Columbia Records released an updated remastered CD, 17 seconds longer than the EMI remasters from 1994, giving a running time of 44:28.

The label was a recreation of the original machine handshake logo, with a black and blue background. The album was subsequently re-released in 2000 for its 25th anniversary, on the Capitol Records label in the US. The album was re-released and remixed in 2011 in multiple editions as part of the "<a href="Why%20Pink%20Floyd...%3F">Why Pink Floyd...?</a>" reissue campaign. The "Wish You Were Here - Immersion Box Set" includes the new stereo digital remaster (2011) by James Guthrie on CD, an unreleased 5.1 Surround Mix (2009) by James Guthrie on DVD and Blu-ray, a Quad Mix (which had been released only on vinyl LP and 8-track tape) on DVD, as well as the original stereo mix (1975) on DVD and Blu-ray. This campaign also featured the 2011 stereo remaster on 180g heavyweight vinyl as well as the 2011 stereo remaster and the 5.1 surround sound mix (2009) as a hybrid <a href="Super%20Audio%20CD">Super Audio CD (SACD)</a>. In 2016, the 180g vinyl was re-released on the band's own Pink Floyd Records label this time remastered by James Guthrie, Joel Plante and <a href="Bernie%20Grundman">Bernie Grundman</a>.

Nuthatch

The nuthatches constitute a <a href="genus">genus</a>, Sitta, of small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a>s belonging to the family Sittidae. Characterised by large heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet, nuthatches advertise their territory using loud, simple songs. Most species exhibit grey or bluish upperparts and a black eye stripe.

Most nuthatches breed in the temperate or <a href="montane%20forest">montane woodlands</a> of the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, although two species have adapted to rocky habitats in the warmer and drier regions of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. However, the greatest diversity is in <a href="Southern%20Asia">Southern Asia</a>, and similarities between the species have made it difficult to identify distinct species. All members of this genus nest in holes or crevices. Most species are <a href="bird%20migration">non-migratory</a> and live in their habitat year-round, although the <a href="North%20America">North America</a>n <a href="red-breasted%20nuthatch">red-breasted nuthatch</a> migrates to warmer regions during the winter. A few nuthatch species have restricted ranges and face threats from <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>.

Nuthatches are <a href="Omnivore">omnivorous</a> where they eat mostly <a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="Nut%20%28fruit%29">nut</a>s, and <a href="seed">seed</a>s. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by climbing along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, but they may join <a href="mixed-species%20feeding%20flock">mixed feeding flocks</a> at other times. Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.

The nuthatch family, Sittidae, was described by <a href="Ren%C3%A9-Primev%C3%A8re%20Lesson">René-Primevère Lesson</a> in 1828. Sometimes the <a href="wallcreeper">wallcreeper</a> ("Tichodroma muraria"), which is restricted to the mountains of southern Eurasia, is placed in the same family as the nuthatches, but in a separate subfamily "Tichodromadinae", in which case the nuthatches are classified in the subfamily "Sittinae". However, it is more often placed in a separate family, the Tichodromadidae. The wallcreeper is intermediate in its <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> between the nuthatches and the <a href="treecreeper">treecreeper</a>s, but its appearance, the texture of its plumage, and the shape and pattern of its tail suggest that it is closer to the former <a href="taxon">taxon</a>. The <a href="nuthatch%20vanga">nuthatch vanga</a> of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> (formerly known as the coral-billed nuthatch) and the <a href="sittella">sittella</a>s from <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> were once placed in the nuthatch family because of similarities in appearance and lifestyle, but they are not closely related. The resemblances arose via <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a> to fill an <a href="ecology">ecological</a> niche.

The nuthatches' closest relatives, other than the wallcreeper, are the <a href="treecreeper">treecreeper</a>s, and the two (or three) families are sometimes placed in a larger grouping with the <a href="wren">wren</a>s and <a href="gnatcatcher">gnatcatcher</a>s. This <a href="superfamily%20%28taxonomy%29">superfamily</a>, the <a href="Certhioidea">Certhioidea</a>, is proposed on <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> studies using <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>l and <a href="cell%20nucleus">nuclear</a> DNA, and was created to cover a clade of (four or) five families removed from a larger grouping of passerine birds, the <a href="Old%20World%20warbler">Sylvioidea</a>.

The nuthatches are all in the genus "Sitta" <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>, 1758, a name derived from "", <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> for this bird. "Nuthatch" refers to the propensity of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, <a href="Corsican%20nuthatch">Corsican nuthatch</a> and <a href="Chinese%20nuthatch">Chinese nuthatch</a> have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a> along with the <a href="Kruper%27s%20nuthatch">Krüper's</a> and <a href="Algerian%20nuthatch">Algerian nuthatch</a>. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.

The <a href="Eurasian%20nuthatch">Eurasian</a>, <a href="chestnut-vented%20nuthatch">chestnut-vented</a>, <a href="Kashmir%20nuthatch">Kashmir</a> and <a href="chestnut-bellied%20nuthatch">chestnut-bellied nuthatch</a>es form another superspecies and replace each other geographically across Asia. They are currently considered to be four separate species, but the south-Asian forms were once believed to be a subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch. A recent change in this taxonomy is a split of the chestnut-bellied nuthatch into three species, namely the Indian nuthatch, "Sitta castanea", found south of the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a>, the Burmese nuthatch, "Sitta neglecta", found in southeast Asia, and the chestnut-bellied nuthatch "sensu stricto", "S. cinnamoventris", which occurs in the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the white-breasted northern subspecies of Eurasian nuthatch, "S. (europea) arctica", is distinctive, and also a possible candidate for full species status. This split has been accepted by the <a href="British%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">British Ornithologists' Union</a>.

A 2006 review of Asian nuthatches suggested that there are still unresolved problems in nuthatch taxonomy and proposed splitting the genus "Sitta". This suggestion would move the red- and yellow-billed south Asian species (<a href="velvet-fronted%20nuthatch">velvet-fronted</a>, <a href="yellow-billed%20nuthatch">yellow-billed</a> and <a href="sulphur-billed%20nuthatch">sulphur-billed nuthatch</a>es) to a new genus, create a third genus for the <a href="blue%20nuthatch">blue nuthatch</a>, and possibly a fourth for the <a href="beautiful%20nuthatch">beautiful nuthatch</a>.

The fossil record for this group appears to be restricted to a foot bone of an early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> bird from <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> which has been identified as an extinct representative of the climbing Certhioidea, a <a href="clade">clade</a> comprising the treecreepers, wallcreeper and nuthatches. It has been described as "Certhiops rummeli". Two fossil species have been described in the genus "Sitta": "S. cuvieri" Gervais, 1852 and "S. senogalliensis" Portis, 1888, but probably not belong to nuthatches.

Nuthatches are compact birds with short legs, compressed wings, and square 12-feathered tails. They have long, sturdy, pointed bills and strong toes with long claws. Nuthatches have blue-grey backs (violet-blue in some Asian species, which also have red or yellow bills) and white underparts, which are variably tinted with buff, orange, rufous or lilac. Although head markings vary between species, a long black eye stripe, with contrasting white <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>, dark forehead and blackish cap is common. The sexes look similar, but may differ in underpart colouration, especially on the rear flanks and under the tail. Juveniles and first-year birds can be almost indistinguishable from adults.

The sizes of nuthatches vary, from the large <a href="giant%20nuthatch">giant nuthatch</a>, at and , to the small <a href="brown-headed%20nuthatch">brown-headed nuthatch</a> and the <a href="pygmy%20nuthatch">pygmy nuthatch</a>, both around in length and about .

Nuthatches are very vocal, using an assortment of whistles, trills and calls. Their <a href="bird%20vocalization">breeding songs</a> tend to be simple and often identical to their contact calls but longer in duration. The red-breasted nuthatch, which coexists with the <a href="black-capped%20chickadee">black-capped chickadee</a> throughout much of its range, is able to understand the latter species' calls. The chickadee has subtle call variations that communicate information about the size and risk of potential predators. Many birds recognise the simple alarm calls produced by other species, but the red-breasted nuthatch is able to interpret the chickadees' detailed variations and to respond appropriately.

The species diversity for Sittidae is greatest in southern Asia (possibly the original home of this family), where about 15 species occur, but it has representatives across much of the Northern Hemisphere. The currently recognised nuthatch species are tabulated below.
<onlyinclude>
</onlyinclude>

Members of the nuthatch family live in most of North America and Europe and throughout Asia down to the <a href="Wallace%20Line">Wallace Line</a>. Nuthatches are sparsely represented in Africa; one species lives in a small area of northeastern Algeria and a population of the Eurasian nuthatch subspecies, "S. e. hispaniensis", lives in the mountains of <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. Most species are resident year-round. The only significant migrant is the red-breasted nuthatch, which winters widely across North America, deserting the northernmost parts of its breeding range in Canada; it has been recorded as a vagrant in <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> and England.

Most nuthatches are woodland birds and the majority are found in <a href="conifer">conifer</a>ous or other <a href="evergreen">evergreen</a> forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the Corsican nuthatch, which is closely linked with <a href="European%20black%20pine">Corsican pine</a>, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> or mixed woods but breeds in coniferous forests in the north of its extensive range. However, the two species of rock nuthatches are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.

Nuthatches prefer a fairly temperate climate; northern species live near sea level whereas those further south are found in cooler highland habitats. Eurasian and red-breasted nuthatches are lowland birds in the north of their extensive ranges, but breed in the mountains further south; for example, Eurasian nuthatch, which breeds where the July temperature range is , is found near sea level in Northern Europe, but between altitude in Morocco. The velvet-fronted nuthatch is the sole member of the family which prefers tropical lowland forests.

All nuthatches nest in cavities; except for the two species of rock nuthatches, all use tree holes, making a simple cup lined with soft materials on which to rest eggs. In some species the lining consists of small woody objects such as bark flakes and seed husks, while in others it includes the moss, grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.

Members of the red-breasted nuthatch superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a> nests. Several species reduce the size of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The red-breasted nuthatch makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer <a href="resin">resin</a> globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears <a href="blister%20beetle">blister beetle</a>s around the entrance to its nest, and it has been suggested that the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.

The western rock nuthatch builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern rock nuthatch builds a similar but less complex structure across the entrance to a cavity. Its nest can be quite small but may weigh up to 32 <a href="kilogram">kg</a> (70 <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">lb</a>). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.
Nuthatches are <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>. The female produces eggs that are white with red or yellow markings; the clutch size varies, tending to be larger for northern species. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 18 days by the female alone, or by both parents, depending on the species. The <a href="altricial">altricial</a> (naked and helpless) chicks take between 21 and 27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the young, and in the case of two American species, brown-headed and pygmy, <a href="helpers%20at%20the%20nest">helper</a> males from the previous brood may assist the parents in feeding.

For the few species on which data are available, the average nuthatch lifespan in the wild is between 2 and 3.5 years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual <a href="survival%20rate">survival rate</a> of 53% and the male Corsican nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: <a href="accipiter">accipiter</a>s, <a href="owl">owl</a>s, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators may be linked to reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a <a href="sharp-shinned%20hawk">sharp-shinned hawk</a>, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a <a href="house%20wren">house wren</a>, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.

Cold can be a problem for small birds that do not migrate. <a href="Communal%20roosting">Communal roosting</a> in tight huddles can help conserve heat and several nuthatch species employ it—up to 170 pygmy nuthatches have been seen in a single roost. The pygmy nuthatch is able to lower its body temperature when roosting, conserving energy through <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a> and a lowered <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a>.

Nuthatches forage along tree trunks and branches and are members of the same <a href="Guild%20%28ecology%29">feeding guild</a> as woodpeckers. Unlike woodpeckers and <a href="Certhia">treecreepers</a>, however, they do not use their tails for additional support, relying instead on their strong legs and feet to progress in jerky hops. They are able to descend head-first and hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches. Krüper's nuthatch can even stretch downward from an upside-down position to drink water from leaves without touching the ground. Rock nuthatches forage with a similar technique to the woodland species, but seek food on rock faces and sometimes buildings. When breeding, a pair of nuthatches will only feed within their territory, but at other times will associate with passing <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a> or join <a href="mixed-species%20feeding%20flock">mixed-species feeding flock</a>s.

<a href="Insect">Insect</a>s and other <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s are a major portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, <a href="snail">snail</a>s, <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover a seed <a href="cache%20%28biology%29">cache</a>.

All nuthatches appear to store food, especially seeds, in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes, and these caches are remembered for as long as 30 days. Similarly, the rock nuthatches wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need. European nuthatches have been found to avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.

Some nuthatches, such as the Eurasian nuthatch and the North American species, have extensive ranges and large populations, and few conservation problems, although locally they may be affected by woodland fragmentation. In contrast, some of the more restricted species face severe pressures.

The <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a> white-browed nuthatch is found only in the <a href="Nat%20Ma%20Taung">Mount Victoria</a> area of Burma, where forest up to above sea level has been almost totally cleared and habitat between is heavily degraded. Nearly 12,000 people live in the Natma Taung <a href="national%20park">national park</a> which includes Mount Victoria, and their fires and traps add to the pressure on the nuthatch. The population of the white-browed nuthatch, estimated at only a few thousand, is decreasing, and no conservation measures are in place. The Algerian nuthatch is found in only four areas of Algeria, and it is possible that the total population does not exceed 1,000 birds. Fire, erosion, and grazing and disturbance by livestock have reduced the quality of the habitat, despite its location in the Taza National Park.

Deforestation has also caused population declines for the <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from several of the areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.

Krüper's nuthatch is threatened by urbanisation and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and made it easier for developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.

Red-necked grebe

The red-necked grebe ("Podiceps grisegena") is a <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> <a href="aquatic%20bird">aquatic bird</a> found in the of the northern hemisphere. Its wintering habitat is largely restricted to calm waters just beyond the waves around ocean coasts, although some birds may winter on large lakes. <a href="Grebe">Grebe</a>s prefer shallow bodies of fresh water such as lakes, marshes or fish-ponds as breeding sites.

The red-necked grebe is a nondescript dusky-grey bird in winter. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive red neck plumage, black cap and contrasting pale grey face from which its name was derived. It also has an elaborate <a href="courtship%23Courtship%20in%20the%20animal%20kingdom">courtship</a> display and a variety of loud mating calls. Once paired, it builds a nest from water plants on top of floating vegetation in a shallow lake or bog.

Like all grebes, the Red-necked is a good swimmer, a particularly swift diver, and responds to danger by diving rather than flying. The feet are positioned far back on the body, near the tail, which makes the bird ungainly on land. It dives for fish or picks insects off vegetation; it also swallows its own feathers, possibly to protect the digestive system. The <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> of its two subspecies—"P. g. grisegena" found in Europe and western Asia, and the larger "P. g. holboelii" (formerly Holbœll grebe), in North America and eastern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>—is evaluated as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>, and the global population is stable or growing.

Grebes are small to medium-large water birds with lobed, rather than webbed, toes. There are several <a href="genus">genera</a>, of which the most widespread is "<a href="Podiceps">Podiceps</a>" with nine species, one recently extinct. The red-necked grebe's closest relative is the fish-eating <a href="great%20crested%20grebe">great crested grebe</a> of Europe and western Asia. It is possible that the red-necked grebe originally evolved in North America and later spread to Europe, where a change of diet to include more insects helped to reduce competition with its larger cousin. Fossils of the species dating to the middle <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> have been found in Italy.
The genus name "Podiceps" comes from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "podicis", "vent" or "anus", and "pes", "foot", and is a reference to the placement of a grebe's legs towards the rear of its body. The species name "grisegena" is from Latin "griseus" (grey) and "gena" (cheek) and refers to the face pattern of the breeding adult.

The red-necked grebe has two subspecies, the <a href="Subspecies%23Nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> "P. g. grisegena" in Europe and western Asia, and "P. g. holboelii" (Holboell's grebe, named for Danish explorer of <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>ic birds <a href="Carl%20Peter%20Holb%C3%B8ll">Carl Peter Holbøll</a>) in North America and eastern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. The east Asian birds have slightly smaller bills than the American form, although the differences are too small to merit separation as a third subspecies.

The red-necked grebe is a medium-large grebe, smaller than the great crested grebe of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, and the <a href="western%20grebe">western</a> and <a href="Clark%27s%20grebe">Clark's grebe</a>s of North America. The adult of the nominate European subspecies is long with a average wingspan, and weighs . In breeding plumage, it has a black cap that extends below the eye, very pale grey cheeks and throat, a rusty red neck, dark grey back and flanks, and white underparts. The eyes are dark brown and the long, pointed bill is black with a yellow base. 
The winter plumage of the red-necked grebe is duskier than that of other grebes; its dark grey cap is less defined, and merges into the grey face, and a pale crescent that curves around the rear of the face contrasts with the rest of the head. The front of the neck is whitish or light grey, the hind neck is darker grey, and the yellow of the bill is less obvious than in summer. Although the red-necked grebe is unmistakable in breeding plumage, it is less distinctive in winter and can be confused with similar species. It is larger than the <a href="Slavonian%20grebe">Slavonian (horned) grebe</a>, with a relatively larger bill and a grey, rather than white face. It is closer in size to the Eurasian great crested grebe, but that species is longer-necked, has a more contrasting head pattern, and always shows white above the eye.

The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male averages heavier than the female. Chicks have a striped head and breast, and older <a href="juvenile%20%28organism%29">juveniles</a> have a striped face, diffuse blackish cap, pale red neck and extensive yellow on the bill.

The subspecies "P. g. holboelii" is larger than the nominate race at length, with a wingspan, and a weight of . The plumages are the same as those of the nominate race, although the adult's bill is more extensively yellow. The difference in size between the sexes is greater than for this subspecies that for "P. g. grisegena".

The red-necked grebe flies with its long neck extended and its large feet trailing behind the body, which gives it a stretched-out appearance. The relatively small wings are grey with white <a href="Flight%20feathers%23Secondaries">secondaries</a>, and beat very rapidly. Its small wing area means that the grebe is unable to take off from land, and needs a lengthy run across water to gain the speed needed for take-off. Like all grebes, the red-necked is an expert swimmer; it uses its feet for propulsion underwater, and steers by rotating its legs, since its tail is too short for this purpose.

This is one of the most vocal grebes during the breeding season, but, like its relatives, it is mainly silent for the rest of the year. It has a loud, wailing or howling display call "uooooh", given by a single bird or a pair in duet, by night or during the day, and often from cover. Long sequences of up to 60 consecutive notes may be delivered during singing encounters between rival territorial birds. A great variety of quacking, clucking, hissing, rattling and purring calls are also given, with much individual variation.

Breeding takes place in shallow freshwater lakes, bays of larger lakes, marshes, and other inland bodies of water, often less than in extent and less than deep. The red-necked grebe shows a preference for waters in forested areas or, further north, in shrub <a href="tundra">tundra</a>, and favours sites with abundant <a href="Emergent%20plant">emergent vegetation</a>, such as <a href="reed%20bed">reedbeds</a>. The best breeding habitat is fish-ponds, which have an abundance of food in addition to meeting the other requirements. The American subspecies is less tied to a high aquatic plant density, and sometimes breeds on quite open lakes.

All populations are migratory and winter mainly at sea, usually in estuaries and bays, but often well offshore where fish are within diving reach near shallow banks or islands. The preferred passage and wintering habitat is water less than deep with a sand or gravel bottom, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed. During winter, birds typically feed alone and rarely aggregate into flocks, but on migration, concentrations of over 2000 individuals may occur at favoured staging sites. Migration is usually at night, but may occur during the day, especially when over water. This is particularly noticeable in autumn on the Great Lakes, when up to 18,000 birds may pass <a href="Whitefish%20Point%20Bird%20Observatory">Whitefish Point</a> on <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>; these are thought to be Canadian breeders heading for the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to winter. This easterly route is longer than that to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, but avoids the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rockies</a>.

The breeding range of the red-necked grebe overlaps with that of the Slavonian grebe, although the latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both. The red-necked grebe prefers an inland temperate climate, and is less successful near coasts and in subarctic and warm temperate zones. It is usually a lowland bird, breeding below , although has nested at up to in Turkey.

The nominate subspecies breeds from southern Sweden and Denmark through central and eastern Europe east to western Siberia, and winters mainly in the <a href="North%20Sea">North</a> and <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>s, with smaller numbers in the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a>, <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> and on inland lakes. "P. g. holboelii" breeds in North America in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, western and central Canada, and the northern US east to <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>; in Asia it nests in eastern Siberia from <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka</a> south to <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaido</a> and west to Mongolia. The Asian birds winter at sea from Japan to the <a href="East%20China%20Sea">East China Sea</a>, and American breeders winter in the Pacific, mainly from southern Alaska to <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> (with smaller numbers south to <a href="California">California</a>), and in the Atlantic from <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a> to <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Some birds remain on the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> if they are sufficiently ice-free. This species occurs as a rare winter <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> in Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of northern and western India.

Red-necked grebes usually nest as isolated pairs with more than between neighbouring nests, although semi-colonial nesting may occur in suitable sites, where up to 20 pairs each defend a linear territory. Semi-colonial breeding is more likely to occur in prime locations, such as large floating mats of vegetation with no connection to the shoreline. Such sites, safe from most predators and large enough to provide some wind and wave protection, have grebes nesting much closer than shoreline breeders, down to . Pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs, which hatch earlier in the season and result in larger broods. The territory is defended with various threat displays, including wing-spreading, hunching, and bill-thrusting; pairs breeding in colonies are more aggressive, less likely to leave the nest unguarded and show a greater tendency to move out of sight of the colony when not incubating. Breeding is often in loose association with <a href="gull">gull</a>s or other colonial water birds. 

The <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> pair forms in April or May on migration or at the breeding water, and a highly vocal courtship ritual commences. The elaborate breeding performance includes head-shaking, a head-lowered "cat" display, parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds, and culminates in a "penguin" dance in which pair members raise the whole body upright, breast to breast.

Like all grebes, the red-necked grebe nests near water into which it can escape, since the position of the legs far back on the body prevents fast movement on land. It often breeds further within reed beds than other grebes. The nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation, in water deep, and with the bulk of nest below the water line. Egg-laying mainly takes place from mid-April to May in Europe, and somewhat later, from mid-May to June, in North America. Parents may leave the nest for significant periods of time during the night, possibly to evade nocturnal predators. It is unclear whether this is for self-protection or to protect the eggs by diverting attention from the nest; the clutch does not appear to suffer from this temporary abandonment, whatever the reason.

The red-necked grebe lays four or five (range one to nine) dull white or pale blue eggs, which average in breadth, in length, and weigh about , of which 10% is shell. Parents take turns to <a href="avian%20incubation">incubate</a> the eggs for 21–33 days until the <a href="precocial">precocial</a> downy chicks hatch; they immediately climb onto the parent's back, where they spend most of their time until they are 10–17 days old. The young may be fed by the parents for up to 54 days after fledging, and can fly at 50–70 days. The parents do not interfere with the feeding of their chicks when they are still being carried. Later they care for the younger chicks for longer, and are aggressive with the older offspring. This equalises the post-fledging survival of all chicks, and encourages their independence. The brood may be split, so that each parent feeds only some of the chicks. This spreads the feeding demand equally between the parents.

After breeding the adults <a href="moult">moult</a> their wing feathers and are temporarily flightless; migration commences once the <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s have regrown. The red-necked grebe is normally single-brooded, although second broods and re-nesting after a clutch has been lost may extend nesting into July or August.

Eggs may be destroyed and chicks killed by a range of predators, including the <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a> in North America and the <a href="carrion%20crow">carrion crow</a> in Europe. <a href="Esox">Pike</a> may take swimming chicks. On average, for each adult, 0.65 young birds are still alive by their fourth month, although the mortality rate for the adult is unknown. Red-necked grebes attempt to evade <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> by diving; when feeding, dives average less than 30 seconds, although escape dives are more prolonged.

On the breeding grounds, the red-necked grebe feeds mainly on <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s including adult and <a href="larva">larva</a>l aquatic insects, such as <a href="water%20beetle">water beetle</a>s and <a href="dragonfly">dragonfly</a> larvae, <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> and <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s. Fish (such as <a href="smelt%20%28fish%29">smelt</a>) may be important locally or seasonally, especially for the American subspecies, and <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s can constitute up to 20% of the grebe's diet. Birds breeding at the coast often make foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas to feed.
Aquatic prey is obtained by diving or by swimming on surface with the head submerged, and terrestrial insects and their larvae are picked off vegetation. A line slanting downward from the eye to the tip of the opened lower mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when swimming under water. The grebe probably opens its bill and looks down the eye-line toward its target.
European breeders, which have to compete with the larger great crested grebe for fish, eat a greater proportion of invertebrates than the longer-billed American subspecies, although both races eat mainly fish in winter. Birds of the nominate subspecies from the northernmost breeding populations in <a href="Finland">Finland</a> and Russia, beyond the range of great crested grebe, have a longer and more slender bill than those further south, reflecting a greater proportion of fish in the diet where their main competitor is absent. If food is scarce, parents may desert unhatched eggs, or allow the smallest chicks to starve, although the latter strategy appears not to be particularly efficient in protecting the older chicks.

Like other grebes, the red-necked grebe ingests large quantities of its own feathers, which remain in the bird's stomach. Feathers are not only swallowed by adults, mainly during self-preening, but are often fed to the young, sometimes within a day of hatching. These feathers soon decompose into a felt-like, amorphous mass. The function of the feathers in the stomach is unknown, although it has been suggested that they help to protect the lower digestive tract from bones and other hard, indigestible material.

The red-necked grebe has a large range, estimated at 1–10 million square kilometres (0.4–3.8 million square miles), and a global population of 150,000–370,000 individuals, with "P. g. holboellii" about twice as numerous as the nominate race. The population trend has not been quantified, but it is not believed to meet the thresholds for the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>.

The red-necked grebe is one of the species to which the "Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds" (<a href="AEWA">AEWA</a>) applies. Parties to the Agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies which are describes in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.

The Red-necked Grebe was hunted by humans in northern Europe in the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> and <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> periods, but there is no evidence that there is any significant level of hunting at the present time. In North America, there are potential threats from pollutants such as <a href="polychlorinated%20biphenyls">polychlorinated biphenyls</a> (PCBs) and <a href="pesticides">pesticides</a> such as <a href="DDT">DDT</a> which cause reduced reproductive success due to egg sterility and eggshell thinning. Breeding areas may be threatened by the modification and degradation of lakes and by human disturbance from water-based recreational activities. There is no evidence to suggest that these threats could result in a significant risk to the overall population; more than 70% of North American red-necked grebes breed in Canada, where the population is stable or increasing.
