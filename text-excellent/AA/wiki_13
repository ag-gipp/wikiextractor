Macedonia (ancient kingdom)

Macedonia () or Macedon (; , "") was an <a href="Classical%20antiquity">ancient</a> <a href="monarchy">kingdom</a> on the periphery of <a href="Archaic%20Greece">Archaic</a> and <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical Greece</a>, and later the dominant state of <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic Greece</a>. The <a href="History%20of%20Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">kingdom was founded</a> and initially ruled by the royal <a href="Argead%20dynasty">Argead dynasty</a>, which was followed by the <a href="Antipatrid%20dynasty">Antipatrid</a> and <a href="Antigonid%20dynasty">Antigonid</a> dynasties. Home to the <a href="ancient%20Macedonians">ancient Macedonians</a>, the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the <a href="Greek%20peninsula">Greek peninsula</a>, and bordered by <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">Epirus</a> to the west, <a href="Paeonia%20%28kingdom%29">Paeonia</a> to the north, <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> to the east and <a href="Ancient%20Thessaly">Thessaly</a> to the south.

Before the 4th century BC, Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great <a href="polis">city-states</a> of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> and <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>, and <a href="Achaemenid%20Macedonia">briefly subordinate</a> to <a href="Achaemenid%20Persia">Achaemenid Persia</a>. During the reign of the Argead king <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">PhilipII</a> (359–336 BC), Macedonia <a href="Rise%20of%20Macedon">subdued</a> <a href="mainland%20Greece">mainland Greece</a> and <a href="Thracians">Thrace</a> through conquest and diplomacy. With a reformed <a href="Ancient%20Macedonian%20army">army</a> containing <a href="Macedonian%20phalanx">phalanxes</a> wielding the "<a href="sarissa">sarissa</a>" pike, PhilipII defeated the old powers of <a href="Second%20Athenian%20League">Athens</a> and <a href="Theban%20hegemony">Thebes</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chaeronea%20%28338%20BC%29">Battle of Chaeronea</a> in 338BC. PhilipII's son <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, leading a <a href="League%20of%20Corinth">federation of Greek states</a>, accomplished his father's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he <a href="Battle%20of%20Thebes">destroyed Thebes</a> after the city revolted. During Alexander's subsequent <a href="Chronology%20of%20the%20expedition%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great%20into%20Asia">campaign of conquest</a>, he <a href="Wars%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">overthrew</a> the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> and conquered territory that stretched as far as the <a href="Indus%20River">Indus River</a>. For a brief period, his empire was the most powerful in the worldthe definitive <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> state, inaugurating the transition to a new period of <a href="Culture%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek civilization</a>. <a href="Hellenistic%20art">Greek arts</a> and <a href="Hellenistic%20literature">literature</a> flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20engineering">engineering</a>, and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20science">science</a> spread throughout much of the ancient world. Of particular importance were the contributions of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, tutor to Alexander, <a href="Aristotelianism">whose writings</a> became a keystone of <a href="Western%20philosophy">Western philosophy</a>.

After <a href="death%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander's death</a> in 323BC, the ensuing <a href="wars%20of%20the%20Diadochi">wars of the Diadochi</a>, and the partitioning of Alexander's short-lived empire, Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Egypt</a>, the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Pergamon">Kingdom of Pergamon</a>. Important cities such as <a href="Pella">Pella</a>, <a href="Pydna">Pydna</a>, and <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a> were involved in power struggles for control of the territory. New cities were founded, such as <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a> by the usurper <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a> (named after his wife <a href="Thessalonike%20of%20Macedon">Thessalonike of Macedon</a>). Macedonia's decline began with the <a href="Macedonian%20Wars">Macedonian Wars</a> and <a href="Rise%20of%20Rome">the rise</a> of <a href="ancient%20Rome">Rome</a> as the leading <a href="Mediterranean%20region">Mediterranean</a> power. At the end of the <a href="Third%20Macedonian%20War">Third Macedonian War</a> in 168BC, <a href="Roman%20Greece">the Macedonian monarchy was abolished</a> and replaced by Roman <a href="client%20state">client state</a>s. A short-lived revival of the monarchy during the <a href="Fourth%20Macedonian%20War">Fourth Macedonian War</a> in 150–148BC ended with the establishment of the <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a> of <a href="Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Macedonia</a>.

The Macedonian kings, who wielded <a href="Absolute%20monarchy">absolute power</a> and commanded <a href="State%20ownership">state resources</a> such as gold and silver, facilitated mining operations to <a href="Mint%20%28facility%29">mint</a> <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20coinage">currency</a>, finance <a href="Antigonid%20Macedonian%20army">their armies</a> and, by the reign of PhilipII, a Macedonian navy. Unlike the other "<a href="diadochi">diadochi</a>" <a href="successor%20state">successor state</a>s, the <a href="imperial%20cult">imperial cult</a> fostered by Alexander was never adopted in Macedonia, yet Macedonian rulers nevertheless assumed roles as <a href="high%20priest">high priest</a>s of the kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20religion">cults</a> of the <a href="Hellenistic%20religion">Hellenistic religion</a>. The authority of Macedonian kings was theoretically limited by the institution of the army, while <a href="Government%20of%20Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">a few municipalities</a> within the <a href="Koinon%20of%20Macedonians">Macedonian commonwealth</a> enjoyed a high degree of <a href="autonomy">autonomy</a> and even had <a href="History%20of%20democracy">democratic governments</a> with <a href="popular%20assemblies">popular assemblies</a>.

The name Macedonia (, "") comes from the <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> Μακεδόνες ("Makedónes"), which itself is derived from the <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> adjective <a href="Makednos">μακεδνός</a> ("makednós"), meaning "tall", possibly descriptive of <a href="Ancient%20Macedonians">the people</a>. It has the same root as the adjective μακρός ("makros"), meaning "long" or "tall" in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>. The name is originally believed to have meant either "highlanders", "the tall ones", or "high grown men". Linguist <a href="Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes">Robert S. P. Beekes</a> claims that both terms are of <a href="Pre-Greek%20substrate">Pre-Greek substrate</a> origin and cannot be explained in terms of <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> morphology.

The <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical</a> <a href="Greek%20historiography">Greek historians</a> <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> reported the <a href="Origin%20myth">legend</a> that the <a href="List%20of%20Macedonian%20kings">Macedonian kings</a> of the <a href="Argead%20dynasty">Argead dynasty</a> were descendants of <a href="Temenus">Temenus</a>, king of <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, and could therefore claim the mythical <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> as one of their <a href="ancestor">ancestor</a>s as well as <a href="Family%20tree%20of%20the%20Greek%20gods">a direct lineage</a> from <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>, chief god of the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek pantheon</a>. Contradictory legends state that either <a href="Perdiccas%20I%20of%20Macedon">Perdiccas I of Macedon</a> or <a href="Caranus%20of%20Macedon">Caranus of Macedon</a> were the founders of the Argead dynasty, with either five or eight kings before AmyntasI. The assertion that the Argeads descended from Temenus was accepted by the "<a href="Hellanodikai">Hellanodikai</a>" authorities of the <a href="Ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Ancient Olympic Games</a>, permitting <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Macedon">Alexander I of Macedon</a> () to enter the competitions owing to his perceived Greek heritage. Little is known about the kingdom before the reign of AlexanderI's father <a href="Amyntas%20I%20of%20Macedon">Amyntas I of Macedon</a> () during the <a href="Archaic%20Greece">Archaic period</a>.

The <a href="History%20of%20Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">kingdom of Macedonia</a> was situated along the <a href="Haliacmon">Haliacmon</a> and <a href="Vardar">Axius</a> rivers in <a href="Lower%20Macedonia">Lower Macedonia</a>, north of <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a>. Historian <a href="Robert%20Malcolm%20Errington">Robert Malcolm Errington</a> suggests that one of the earliest Argead kings established <a href="Aigai%2C%20Macedonia">Aigai</a> (modern <a href="Vergina">Vergina</a>) as their capital in the mid-7th centuryBC. Before the 4th centuryBC, the kingdom covered a region corresponding roughly to the <a href="Western%20Macedonia">western</a> and <a href="Central%20Macedonia">central</a> parts of the <a href="Macedonia%20%28Greece%29">region of Macedonia</a> in modern <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. It gradually expanded into the region of <a href="Upper%20Macedonia">Upper Macedonia</a>, inhabited by the Greek <a href="Lynkestis">Lyncestae</a> and <a href="Elimiotis">Elimiotae</a> tribes, and into regions of <a href="Emathia">Emathia</a>, <a href="Eordaia">Eordaia</a>, <a href="Bottiaea">Bottiaea</a>, <a href="Mygdonia">Mygdonia</a>, <a href="Crestonia">Crestonia</a>, and <a href="Almopia">Almopia</a>, which were inhabited by various peoples such as <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a> and <a href="Phrygians">Phrygians</a>. Macedonia's non-Greek neighbors included Thracians, inhabiting territories to the northeast, <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> to the northwest, and <a href="Paeonians">Paeonians</a> to the north, while the lands of <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> to the south and <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a> to the west were inhabited by Greeks with similar cultures to that of the Macedonians.

A year after <a href="Darius%20I%20of%20Persia">Darius I of Persia</a> () launched <a href="European%20Scythian%20campaign%20of%20Darius%20I">an invasion</a> into Europe against the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a>, <a href="Paeonians">Paeonians</a>, <a href="Thrace">Thracians</a>, and several Greek city-states of the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, the Persian general <a href="Megabazus">Megabazus</a> used diplomacy to convince AmyntasI to submit as a <a href="Vassal%20state">vassal</a> of the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, ushering in the period of <a href="Achaemenid%20Macedonia">Achaemenid Macedonia</a>. Achaemenid Persian <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a> over Macedonia was briefly interrupted by the <a href="Ionian%20Revolt">Ionian Revolt</a> (499–493BC), yet the Persian general <a href="Mardonius%20%28general%29">Mardonius</a> brought it back under Achaemenid <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a>. 

Although Macedonia enjoyed a large degree of <a href="autonomy">autonomy</a> and was never made a <a href="satrap">satrap</a>y (i.e. province) of the Achaemenid Empire, it was expected to provide troops for the <a href="Achaemenid%20army">Achaemenid army</a>. AlexanderI provided Macedonian military support to <a href="Xerxes%20I">Xerxes I</a> () during the <a href="Second%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece">Second Persian invasion of Greece</a> in 480–479 BC, and Macedonian soldiers fought on the side of the Persians at the 479BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Platea">Battle of Platea</a>. Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Greek victory at Salamis</a> in 480BC, AlexanderI was employed as an Achaemenid diplomat to propose a peace treaty and alliance with <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athens</a>, an offer that was rejected. Soon afterwards, the Achaemenid forces were <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Delian%20League">forced to withdraw from mainland Europe</a>, marking the end of Persian control over Macedonia.

Although initially a Persian vassal, AlexanderI of Macedon fostered friendly diplomatic relations with his former Greek enemies, the Athenian and <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n-led coalition of Greek city-states. His successor <a href="Perdiccas%20II%20of%20Macedon">PerdiccasII</a> () led the Macedonians to war in four separate conflicts against Athens, leader of the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a>, while incursions by the Thracian ruler <a href="Sitalces">Sitalces</a> of the <a href="Odrysian%20kingdom">Odrysian kingdom</a> threatened Macedonia's <a href="territorial%20integrity">territorial integrity</a> in the northeast. The Athenian statesman <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a> promoted colonization of the <a href="Strymon%20River">Strymon River</a> near the Kingdom of Macedonia, where the colonial city of <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a> was founded in 437/436BC so that it could provide Athens with a steady supply of silver and gold as well as <a href="timber">timber</a> and <a href="Pitch%20%28resin%29">pitch</a> to support the <a href="Athenian%20navy">Athenian navy</a>. Initially Perdiccas II did not take any action and might have even welcomed the Athenians, as the Thracians were foes to both of them. This changed due to an Athenian alliance with a brother and cousin of PerdiccasII who had rebelled against him. Thus, two separate wars were fought against Athens between 433 and 431BC. The Macedonian king retaliated by promoting the rebellion of Athens' allies in <a href="Chalcidice">Chalcidice</a> and subsequently won over the strategic city of <a href="Potidaea">Potidaea</a>. After capturing the Macedonian cities <a href="Therma">Therma</a> and <a href="Veria">Beroea</a>, Athens besieged Potidaea but failed to overcome it; Therma was returned to Macedonia and much of Chalcidice to Athens in a <a href="peace%20treaty">peace treaty</a> brokered by Sitalces, who provided Athens with military aid in exchange for acquiring new Thracian allies.

PerdiccasII sided <a href="Peloponnesian%20League">with Sparta</a> in the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a> (431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, but he was forced to retreat owing to a shortage of provisions in winter. In 424 BC, <a href="Arrhabaeus">Arrhabaeus</a>, a local ruler of <a href="Lynkestis">Lynkestis</a> in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his <a href="suzerain">overlord</a> Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lyncestis">Battle of Lyncestis</a> the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general <a href="Brasidas">Brasidas</a>, whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian <a href="baggage%20train">baggage train</a>. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens, and he was able to put down Arrhabaeus's revolt.
Brasidas died in 422 BC, the year Athens and Sparta struck an accord, the <a href="Peace%20of%20Nicias">Peace of Nicias</a>, that freed Macedonia from its obligations as an Athenian ally. Following the 418BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Mantinea%20%28418%20BC%29">Battle of Mantinea</a>, the victorious Spartans formed an alliance with <a href="History%20of%20Argos">Argos</a>, a military pact PerdiccasII was keen to join given the threat of Spartan allies remaining in Chalcidice. When Argos suddenly switched sides as a pro-Athenian <a href="democracy">democracy</a>, the Athenian navy was able to form a <a href="blockade">blockade</a> against Macedonian <a href="seaport">seaport</a>s and invade Chalcidice in 417BC. PerdiccasII sued for peace in 414BC, forming an alliance with Athens that was continued by his son and successor <a href="Archelaus%20I%20of%20Macedon">ArchelausI</a> (). Athens then provided naval support to ArchelausI in the 410BC Macedonian siege of <a href="Pydna">Pydna</a>, in exchange for timber and naval equipment.

Although Archelaus I was faced with some internal revolts and had to fend off an invasion of Illyrians led by <a href="Sirras">Sirras</a> of Lynkestis, he was able to project Macedonian power into Thessaly where he sent military aid to his allies. Although he retained Aigai as a ceremonial and religious center, ArchelausI moved the <a href="capital%20city">capital</a> of the kingdom north to <a href="Pella">Pella</a>, which was then positioned by a lake with a river connecting it to the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. He improved Macedonia's <a href="currency">currency</a> by minting <a href="coin">coin</a>s with a <a href="Silver%20coin">higher silver content</a> as well as issuing separate <a href="Coinage%20metals">copper coinage</a>. His royal court attracted the presence of well-known intellectuals such as the Athenian <a href="playwright">playwright</a> <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>. When ArchelausI was assassinated (perhaps following a <a href="Homosexuality%20in%20ancient%20Greece">homosexual</a> love affair with <a href="royal%20page">royal page</a>s at his court), the kingdom was plunged into chaos, in an era lasting from 399 to 393BC that included the reign of four different monarchs: <a href="Orestes%20of%20Macedon">Orestes</a>, son of ArchelausI; <a href="Aeropus%20II%20of%20Macedon">AeropusII</a>, uncle, <a href="regent">regent</a>, and murderer of Orestes; <a href="Pausanias%20of%20Macedon">Pausanias</a>, son of AeropusII; and <a href="Amyntas%20II%20of%20Macedon">AmyntasII</a>, who was married to the youngest daughter of ArchelausI. Very little is known about this turbulent period; it came to an end when <a href="Amyntas%20III%20of%20Macedon">AmyntasIII</a> (), son of Arrhidaeus and grandson of AmyntasI, killed Pausanias and claimed the Macedonian throne.
Amyntas III was forced to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383BC (based on conflicting accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrian <a href="Dardani">Dardani</a> led by <a href="Bardylis">Bardylis</a>. The <a href="pretender">pretender</a> to the throne <a href="Argaeus%20II%20of%20Macedon">Argaeus</a> ruled in his absence, yet AmyntasIII eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. AmyntasIII was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of <a href="Olynthos">Olynthos</a>, but with the aid of <a href="Teleutias">Teleutias</a>, brother of the Spartan king <a href="Agesilaus%20II">Agesilaus II</a>, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their <a href="Chalcidian%20League">Chalcidian League</a> in 379BC.

<a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Macedon">Alexander II</a> (), son of <a href="Eurydice%20I%20of%20Macedon">EurydiceI</a> and AmyntasIII, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the "<a href="Tagus%20%28title%29">tagus</a>" (supreme Thessalian military leader) <a href="Alexander%20of%20Pherae">Alexander of Pherae</a>, capturing the city of <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a>. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both AlexanderII and Alexander of Pherae as their <a href="overlord">overlord</a>s, appealed to <a href="Pelopidas">Pelopidas</a> of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a> for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic <a href="hostage">hostage</a>s including AlexanderII's brother and future king <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">PhilipII</a> (). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law <a href="Ptolemy%20of%20Aloros">Ptolemy of Aloros</a>, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for <a href="Perdiccas%20III%20of%20Macedon">PerdiccasIII</a> (), younger brother of AlexanderII, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the <a href="age%20of%20majority">age of majority</a> in 365BC. The remainder of Perdiccas III's reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery. However, an Athenian invasion led by <a href="Timotheus%20%28general%29">Timotheus</a>, son of <a href="Conon">Conon</a>, managed to capture <a href="Methoni%2C%20Pieria">Methone</a> and Pydna, and an Illyrian invasion led by Bardylis succeeded in killing PerdiccasIII and 4,000 Macedonian troops in battle.

Philip II was twenty-four years old when he acceded to the throne in 359BC. Through the use of deft diplomacy, he was able to convince the Thracians under <a href="Berisades">Berisades</a> to cease their support of <a href="Pausanias%20%28pretender%29">Pausanias</a>, a pretender to the throne, and the Athenians to halt their support of <a href="Argaeus%20II%20of%20Macedon">another pretender</a>. He achieved these by bribing the Thracians and their <a href="Paeonia%20%28kingdom%29">Paeonian</a> allies and establishing a treaty with Athens that relinquished his claims to Amphipolis. He was also able to make peace with the Illyrians who <a href="Battle%20of%20Erigon%20Valley">had threatened his borders</a>.

Philip II spent his initial years radically transforming the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonian%20army">Macedonian army</a>. A reform of its organization, equipment, and training, including the introduction of the <a href="Macedonian%20phalanx">Macedonian phalanx</a> armed with <a href="Pike%20%28weapon%29">long pikes</a> (i.e. the "<a href="sarissa">sarissa</a>"), proved immediately successful when tested against his Illyrian and Paeonian enemies. Confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much PhilipII's royal predecessors may have contributed to these reforms and the extent to which his ideas were influenced by his <a href="Adolescence">adolescent</a> years of captivity in Thebes as a political hostage during the <a href="Theban%20hegemony">Theban hegemony</a>, especially after meeting with the general <a href="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</a>.

The Macedonians, like the other Greeks, traditionally practiced <a href="monogamy">monogamy</a>, but PhilipII practiced <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a> and married seven wives with <a href="Cleopatra%20Eurydice">perhaps only one</a> that did not involve the loyalty of his aristocratic subjects or new allies. His first marriages were to <a href="Phila%20of%20Elimeia">Phila of Elimeia</a> of the Upper Macedonian aristocracy as well as the Illyrian princess <a href="Audata">Audata</a> to ensure a marriage alliance. To establish an alliance with Larissa in Thessaly, he married the Thessalian noblewoman <a href="Philinna">Philinna</a> in 358BC, who bore him a son who would later rule as <a href="Philip%20III%20Arrhidaeus">Philip III Arrhidaeus</a> (). In 357BC, he married <a href="Olympias">Olympias</a> to secure an alliance with <a href="Arybbas%20of%20Epirus">Arybbas</a>, the <a href="King%20of%20Epirus">King of Epirus</a> and the <a href="Molossians">Molossians</a>. This marriage would bear a son who would later rule as AlexanderIII (better known as <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>) and claim descent from the legendary <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a> by way of his <a href="Aeacidae">dynastic heritage from Epirus</a>. It is unclear whether or not the Achaemenid Persian kings influenced PhilipII's practice of polygamy, although his predecessor AmyntasIII had three sons with a possible second wife Gygaea: Archelaus, Arrhidaeus, and <a href="Menelaus%20%28son%20of%20Amyntas%20III%29">Menelaus</a>. PhilipII had Archelaus put to death in 359BC, while PhilipII's other two half brothers fled to Olynthos, serving as a "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>" for the <a href="Olynthian%20War">Olynthian War</a> (349–348BC) against the Chalcidian League.

While Athens was preoccupied with the <a href="Social%20War%20%28357%E2%80%93355%20BC%29">Social War (357–355 BC)</a>, PhilipII retook Amphipolis from them in 357BC and the following year recaptured Pydna and Potidaea, the latter of which he handed over to the Chalcidian League as promised in a treaty. In 356BC, he took <a href="Crenides%20%28Macedonia%29">Crenides</a>, refounding it as <a href="Philippi">Philippi</a>, while his general <a href="Parmenion">Parmenion</a> defeated the Illyrian king <a href="Grabos">Grabos</a> of the <a href="Grabaei">Grabaei</a>. During the 355–354BC siege of Methone, PhilipII lost his right eye to an arrow wound, but managed to capture the city and treated the inhabitants cordially, unlike the Potidaeans, who had been enslaved.

Philip II then involved Macedonia in the <a href="Third%20Sacred%20War">Third Sacred War</a> (356–346BC). It began when <a href="Phocis%20%28ancient%20region%29">Phocis</a> captured and plundered the temple of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> at <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> instead of submitting unpaid fines, causing the <a href="Amphictyonic%20League">Amphictyonic League</a> to declare war on Phocis and a <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a> among the members of the <a href="Thessalian%20League">Thessalian League</a> aligned with either Phocis or Thebes. PhilipII's initial campaign against <a href="Pherae">Pherae</a> in Thessaly in 353BC at the behest of Larissa ended in two disastrous defeats by the Phocian general <a href="Onomarchus">Onomarchus</a>. PhilipII in turn defeated Onomarchus in 352BC at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crocus%20Field">Battle of Crocus Field</a>, which led to PhilipII's election as leader ("<a href="archon">archon</a>") of the Thessalian League, provided him a seat on the Amphictyonic Council, and allowed for a marriage alliance with Pherae by wedding <a href="Nicesipolis">Nicesipolis</a>, niece of the tyrant <a href="Jason%20of%20Pherae">Jason of Pherae</a>.

Philip II had some early involvement with the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, especially by supporting <a href="satraps">satraps</a> and mercenaries would rebelled against the central auhority of the Achaemenid king. The satrap of <a href="Hellespontine%20Phrygia">Hellespontine Phrygia</a> <a href="Artabazos%20II">Artabazos II</a>, who was in rebellion against <a href="Artaxerxes%20III">Artaxerxes III</a>, was able to take refuge as an exile at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC. He was accompanied in exile by his family and by his mercenary general <a href="Memnon%20of%20Rhodes">Memnon of Rhodes</a>. <a href="Barsine">Barsine</a>, daughter of Artabazos, and future wife of Alexander the Great, grew up at the Macedonian court.

After campaigning against the Thracian ruler <a href="Cersobleptes">Cersobleptes</a>, in 349BC, PhilipII began his war against the Chalcidian League, which had been reestablished in 375BC following a temporary disbandment. Despite an Athenian intervention by <a href="Charidemus">Charidemus</a>, Olynthos was captured by PhilipII in 348BC, and its inhabitants were <a href="Slavery%20in%20ancient%20Greece">sold into slavery</a>, including some <a href="Athenian%20citizenship">Athenian citizens</a>. The Athenians, especially in a series of speeches by <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> known as the "<a href="Olynthiacs">Olynthiacs</a>", were unsuccessful in persuading their allies to counterattack and in 346BC concluded a treaty with Macedonia <a href="Peace%20of%20Philocrates">known as the Peace</a> of <a href="Philocrates">Philocrates</a>. The treaty stipulated that Athens would relinquish claims to Macedonian coastal territories, the Chalcidice, and Amphipolis in return for the release of the enslaved Athenians as well as guarantees that PhilipII would not attack Athenian settlements in the <a href="Thracian%20Chersonese">Thracian Chersonese</a>. Meanwhile, Phocis and <a href="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a> were captured by Macedonian forces, the <a href="Pythia">Delphic temple</a> robbers were executed, and PhilipII was awarded the two Phocian seats on the Amphictyonic Council and the position of <a href="master%20of%20ceremonies">master of ceremonies</a> over the <a href="Pythian%20Games">Pythian Games</a>. Athens initially opposed his membership on the council and refused to attend the games in protest, but they eventually accepted these conditions, perhaps after some persuasion by Demosthenes in his oration "<a href="On%20the%20Peace">On the Peace</a>".
Over the next few years, Philip II reformed local governments in Thessaly, campaigned against the Illyrian ruler <a href="Pleuratus%20I">Pleuratus I</a>, deposed Arybbas in <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">Epirus</a> in favor of his brother-in-law <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Epirus">AlexanderI</a> (through PhilipII's marriage to Olympias), and defeated Cersebleptes in Thrace. This allowed him to extend Macedonian control over the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a> in anticipation of an invasion into <a href="Classical%20Anatolia">Achaemenid Anatolia</a>. In 342BC, PhilipII conquered <a href="History%20of%20Plovdiv">a Thracian city</a> in what is now <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and renamed it <a href="Philippopolis%20%28Thracia%29">Philippopolis</a> (modern <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>). War broke out with Athens in 340BC while PhilipII was engaged in two ultimately unsuccessful sieges of <a href="Perinthus">Perinthus</a> and <a href="Byzantion">Byzantion</a>, followed by a successful campaign against the Scythians along the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> and Macedonia's involvement in the <a href="Fourth%20Sacred%20War">Fourth Sacred War</a> against <a href="Amphissa%20%28city%29">Amphissa</a> in 339BC. Thebes ejected a Macedonian garrison from <a href="Nicaea%2C%20Locris">Nicaea (near Thermopylae)</a>, leading Thebes to join Athens, <a href="Megara">Megara</a>, Corinth, <a href="Achaea">Achaea</a>, and <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> in a final confrontation against Macedonia at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chaeronea%20%28338%20BC%29">Battle of Chaeronea</a> in 338BC. After the Macedonian victory at Chaeronea, PhilipII installed an <a href="oligarchy">oligarchy</a> in Thebes, yet was lenient toward Athens, wishing to utilize their navy in a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire. He was then chiefly responsible for the formation of the <a href="League%20of%20Corinth">League of Corinth</a> that included the major Greek city-states except Sparta. Despite the Kingdom of Macedonia's official exclusion from the league, in 337BC, PhilipII was elected as the leader ("<a href="hegemon">hegemon</a>") of its council ("<a href="synedrion">synedrion</a>") and the <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> ("<a href="strategos">strategos</a> <a href="autokrator">autokrator</a>") of a forthcoming campaign to invade the Achaemenid Empire. Philip's plan to punish the Persians for the suffering of the Greeks and to liberate the Greek cities of Asia Minor as well as perhaps the panhellenic fear of another Persian invasion of Greece, contributed to his decision to invade the Achaemenid Empire. The Persians offered aid to Perinthus and Byzantion in 341–340BC, highlighting Macedonia's strategic need to secure Thrace and the Aegean Sea against increasing Achaemenid encroachment, as the Persian king <a href="Artaxerxes%20III">Artaxerxes III</a> further consolidated his control over satrapies in <a href="Geography%20of%20Anatolia">western Anatolia</a>. The latter region, yielding far more wealth and valuable resources than the Balkans, was also coveted by the Macedonian king for its sheer economic potential.

When Philip II married <a href="Cleopatra%20Eurydice%20of%20Macedon">Cleopatra Eurydice</a>, niece of general <a href="Attalus%20%28general%29">Attalus</a>, talk of providing new potential heirs at the wedding feast infuriated PhilipII's son Alexander, a veteran of the Battle of Chaeronea, and his mother Olympias. They fled together to Epirus before Alexander was recalled to Pella by PhilipII. When PhilipII arranged a marriage between his son Arrhidaeus and <a href="Ada%20of%20Caria">Ada of Caria</a>, daughter of <a href="Pixodarus">Pixodarus</a>, the Persian satrap of <a href="Caria">Caria</a>, Alexander intervened and proposed to marry Ada instead. PhilipII then cancelled the wedding altogether and exiled Alexander's advisors <a href="Ptolemy%20I">Ptolemy</a>, <a href="Nearchus">Nearchus</a>, and <a href="Harpalus">Harpalus</a>. To reconcile with Olympias, PhilipII had their daughter <a href="Cleopatra%20of%20Macedon">Cleopatra</a> marry Olympias' brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) AlexanderI of Epirus, but PhilipII was assassinated by his bodyguard, <a href="Pausanias%20of%20Orestis">Pausanias of Orestis</a>, during their wedding feast and succeeded by Alexander in 336BC.

Modern scholars have argued over the possible role of <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Macedon">AlexanderIII "the Great"</a> and his mother Olympias in the assassination of PhilipII, noting the latter's choice to exclude Alexander from his planned invasion of Asia, choosing instead for him to act as <a href="regent%20of%20Greece">regent of Greece</a> and deputy "hegemon" of the League of Corinth, and the potential bearing of another male heir between PhilipII and his new wife, Cleopatra Eurydice. AlexanderIII () was immediately proclaimed king by <a href="Popular%20assembly">an assembly</a> of the army and leading aristocrats, chief among them being <a href="Antipater">Antipater</a> and Parmenion. By the end of his reign and military career in 323BC, Alexander would rule over an empire consisting of <a href="mainland%20Greece">mainland Greece</a>, <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>, <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, and much of <a href="Central%20Asia">Central</a> and <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a> (i.e. modern <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>). Among his first acts was the burial of his father at Aigai. The members of the League of Corinth revolted at the news of PhilipII's death, but were soon quelled by military force alongside persuasive diplomacy, electing Alexander as "hegemon" of the league to carry out the planned invasion of Achaemenid Persia.

In 335 BC, Alexander <a href="Alexander%27s%20Balkan%20campaign">fought against the Thracian tribe</a> of the <a href="Triballi">Triballi</a> at <a href="Haemus%20Mons">Haemus Mons</a> and along the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, forcing their surrender on <a href="Peuce%20Island">Peuce Island</a>. Shortly thereafter, the Illyrian king <a href="Cleitus%20%28Dardania%29">Cleitus</a> of the <a href="Dardani">Dardani</a> threatened to attack Macedonia, but Alexander took the initiative and <a href="Siege%20of%20Pelium">besieged the Dardani</a> at <a href="Pelion%20%28Chaonia%29">Pelion</a> (in modern <a href="Albania">Albania</a>). When Thebes had once again revolted from the League of Corinth and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in the <a href="Cadmea">Cadmea</a>, Alexander left the Illyrian front and marched to Thebes, which he <a href="Battle%20of%20Thebes">placed under siege</a>. After breaching the walls, Alexander's forces killed 6,000 Thebans, took 30,000 inhabitants as <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>, and burned the city to the ground as a warning that convinced all other Greek states except Sparta not to challenge Alexander again.

Throughout his military career, Alexander won every battle that he personally commanded. His first victory against the Persians in Asia Minor at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Granicus">Battle of the Granicus</a> in 334BC used a small cavalry contingent as a distraction to allow his infantry to cross the river followed by a <a href="cavalry%20charge">cavalry charge</a> from his <a href="companion%20cavalry">companion cavalry</a>. Alexander led the cavalry charge at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Issus">Battle of Issus</a> in 333BC, forcing the Persian king <a href="Darius%20III">Darius III</a> and his army to flee. DariusIII, despite having superior numbers, was again forced to flee the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaugamela">Battle of Gaugamela</a> in 331BC. The Persian king was later captured and executed by his own satrap of <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a> and kinsman, <a href="Bessus">Bessus</a>, in 330BC. The Macedonian king subsequently hunted down and executed Bessus in what is now <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, securing the region of <a href="Sogdia">Sogdia</a> in the process. At the 326BC <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Hydaspes">Battle of the Hydaspes</a> (modern-day <a href="Punjab">Punjab</a>), when the <a href="war%20elephant">war elephant</a>s of <a href="King%20Porus">King Porus</a> of the <a href="Pauravas">Pauravas</a> threatened Alexander's troops, he had them form open ranks to surround the elephants and dislodge their handlers by using their "sarissa" pikes. When his Macedonian troops threatened <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> in 324BC at <a href="Opis">Opis</a>, <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> (near modern <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>), Alexander offered Macedonian military titles and greater responsibilities to Persian officers and units instead, forcing his troops to seek forgiveness at a staged banquet of reconciliation between Persians and Macedonians.
Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of <a href="megalomania">megalomania</a>. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the <a href="Gordian%20Knot">Gordian Knot</a>, he also attempted to portray himself as a <a href="Sacred%20king">living god</a> and son of Zeus following his visit to the <a href="oracle">oracle</a> at <a href="Siwah">Siwah</a> in the <a href="Libyan%20Desert">Libyan Desert</a> (in modern-day <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>) in 331BC. His attempt in 327BC to have his men prostrate before him in <a href="Bactra">Bactra</a> in an act of "<a href="proskynesis">proskynesis</a>" borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian <a href="Callisthenes">Callisthenes</a> refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at <a href="Ecbatana">Ecbatana</a> (near modern <a href="Hamadan">Hamadan</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>) in 330BC, this was "symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people", according to Errington. His murder of <a href="Cleitus%20the%20Black">Cleitus the Black</a> in 328BC is described as "vengeful and reckless" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed <a href="Roxana">Roxana</a>, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married <a href="Stateira%20II">Stateira II</a>, eldest daughter of DariusIII, and <a href="Parysatis%20II">Parysatis II</a>, youngest daughter of <a href="Artaxerxes%20III">Artaxerxes III</a>, at the <a href="Susa%20weddings">Susa weddings</a> in 324BC.

Meanwhile, in Greece, the <a href="Spartan%20king">Spartan king</a> <a href="Agis%20III">Agis III</a> attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331BC at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Megalopolis">Battle of Megalopolis</a> by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy "hegemon" of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330BC, Alexander declared that the <a href="tyrannies">tyrannies</a> installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom was to be restored.

When <a href="Death%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great died</a> at <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> in 323BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>, the Macedonian military command became split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother PhilipIII Arrhidaeus () as king and another siding with Alexander's infant son with Roxana, <a href="Alexander%20IV%20of%20Macedon">AlexanderIV</a> (). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the <a href="Lamian%20War">Lamian War</a> (323–322BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Thermopylae%20%28323%20BC%29">Battle of Thermopylae</a>, he fled to <a href="Lamia%20%28city%29">Lamia</a> where he was besieged by the Athenian commander <a href="Leosthenes">Leosthenes</a>. A Macedonian army led by <a href="Leonnatus">Leonnatus</a> rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Diadochi">a power struggle</a> between the "<a href="diadochi">diadochi</a>", the former generals of Alexander's army.

A <a href="Partition%20of%20Babylon">council of the army convened in Babylon</a> immediately after Alexander's death, naming PhilipIII as king and the <a href="chiliarch">chiliarch</a> <a href="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a> as his regent. Antipater, <a href="Antigonus%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus Monophthalmus</a>, <a href="Craterus">Craterus</a>, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's <a href="Tomb%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great</a>. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the <a href="Nile%20River">Nile River</a> resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although <a href="Eumenes%20of%20Cardia">Eumenes of Cardia</a> managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321BC <a href="Partition%20of%20Triparadisus">Partition of Triparadisus</a> in <a href="Syria%20%28region%29">Syria</a> where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist <a href="Polyperchon">Polyperchon</a> as his successor, passing over his own son <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a> and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent (since PhilipIII was considered mentally unstable), in effect bypassing the council of the army as well.

Forming an alliance with Ptolemy, Antigonus, and <a href="Lysimachus">Lysimachus</a>, Cassander had his officer <a href="Nicanor%20%28Antipatrid%20general%29">Nicanor</a> capture the <a href="Munichia">Munichia</a> fortress of Athens' port town <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> in defiance of Polyperchon's decree that Greek cities should be free of Macedonian garrisons, sparking the <a href="Second%20War%20of%20the%20Diadochi">Second War of the Diadochi</a> (319–315BC). Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon, in 317BC, PhilipIII, by way of his politically engaged wife <a href="Eurydice%20II%20of%20Macedon">Eurydice II of Macedon</a>, officially replaced him as regent with Cassander. Afterwards, Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias in Epirus. A joint force of Epirotes, Aetolians, and Polyperchon's troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of PhilipIII and Eurydice's army, allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide. Olympias then had Nicanor and dozens of other Macedonian nobles killed, but by the spring of 316BC, Cassander had defeated her forces, captured her, and placed her on trial for murder before sentencing her to death.

Cassander married Philip II's daughter <a href="Thessalonike%20of%20Macedon">Thessalonike</a> and briefly extended Macedonian control into Illyria as far as <a href="Epidamnos">Epidamnos</a>. By 313BC, it was retaken by the Illyrian king <a href="Glaucias%20of%20Taulantii">Glaucias of Taulantii</a>. By 316BC, Antigonus had taken the territory of Eumenes and managed to eject <a href="Seleucus%20Nicator">Seleucus Nicator</a> from his Babylonian satrapy, leading Cassander, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus to issue a joint ultimatum to Antigonus in 315BC for him to surrender various territories in Asia. Antigonus promptly allied with Polyperchon, now based in Corinth, and issued an ultimatum of his own to Cassander, charging him with murder for executing Olympias and demanding that he hand over the royal family, King AlexanderIV and the <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a> Roxana. The conflict that followed lasted until the winter of 312/311BC, when a new peace settlement recognized Cassander as general of Europe, Antigonus as "first in Asia", Ptolemy as general of Egypt, and Lysimachus as general of Thrace. Cassander had AlexanderIV and Roxana put to death in the winter of 311/310BC, and by 306–305BC, the "diadochi" were declared kings of their respective territories.

The beginning of <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic Greece</a> was defined by the struggle between the <a href="Antipatrid%20dynasty">Antipatrid dynasty</a>, led first by <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a> (), son of Antipater, and the <a href="Antigonid%20dynasty">Antigonid dynasty</a>, led by the Macedonian general <a href="Antigonus%20I%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus I Monophthalmus</a> () and his son, the future king <a href="Demetrius%20I%20of%20Macedon">DemetriusI</a> (). Cassander besieged Athens in 303BC, but was forced to retreat to Macedonia when Demetrius invaded <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a> to his rear, attempting to sever his path of retreat. While Antigonus and Demetrius attempted to recreate PhilipII's <a href="League%20of%20Corinth">Hellenic league</a> with themselves as dual hegemons, a revived coalition of Cassander, <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy I Soter</a> () of Egypt's <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>, <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus I Nicator</a> () of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, and Lysimachus (), <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Thrace%20and%20Dacia">King of Thrace</a>, defeated the Antigonids at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ipsus">Battle of Ipsus</a> in 301BC, killing Antigonus and forcing Demetrius into flight.

Cassander died in 297 BC, and his sickly son <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Macedon">PhilipIV</a> died the same year, succeeded by Cassander's other sons <a href="Alexander%20V%20of%20Macedon">Alexander V of Macedon</a> () and <a href="Antipater%20II%20of%20Macedon">Antipater II of Macedon</a> (), with their mother <a href="Thessalonike%20of%20Macedon">Thessalonike of Macedon</a> acting as regent. While Demetrius fought against the Antipatrid forces in Greece, AntipaterII killed his own mother to obtain power. His desperate brother AlexanderV then requested aid from <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus of Epirus</a> (), who had fought alongside Demetrius at the Battle of Ipsus, but was sent to Egypt as a hostage as part of an agreement between Demetrius and PtolemyI. In exchange for defeating the forces of AntipaterII and forcing him to flee to the court of Lysimachus in Thrace, Pyrrhus was awarded the westernmost portions of the Macedonian kingdom. Demetrius had his nephew AlexanderV assassinated and was then proclaimed king of Macedonia, but his subjects protested against his aloof, Eastern-style <a href="autocracy">autocracy</a>.

War broke out between Pyrrhus and Demetrius in 290BC when <a href="Lanassa%20%28wife%20of%20Pyrrhus%29">Lanassa, wife of Pyrrhus</a>, daughter of <a href="Agathocles%20of%20Syracuse">Agathocles of Syracuse</a>, left him for Demetrius and offered him her <a href="dowry">dowry</a> of <a href="Corcyra">Corcyra</a>. The war dragged on until 288BC, when Demetrius lost the support of <a href="Ancient%20Macedonians">the Macedonians</a> and fled the country. Macedonia was then divided between Pyrrhus and Lysimachus, the former taking <a href="western%20Macedonia">western Macedonia</a> and the latter eastern Macedonia. By 286BC, Lysimachus had expelled Pyrrhus and his forces from Macedonia. In 282BC, a new war erupted between SeleucusI and Lysimachus; the latter was killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Corupedion">Battle of Corupedion</a>, allowing SeleucusI to take control of Thrace and Macedonia. In two dramatic reversals of fortune, SeleucusI was assassinated in 281BC by his officer <a href="Ptolemy%20Keraunos">Ptolemy Keraunos</a>, son of PtolemyI and grandson of Antipater, who was then proclaimed king of Macedonia before being killed in battle in 279BC by <a href="Galatians%20%28people%29">Celtic invaders</a> in the <a href="Gallic%20invasion%20of%20Greece">Gallic invasion of Greece</a>. The Macedonian army proclaimed the general <a href="Sosthenes%20of%20Macedon">Sosthenes of Macedon</a> as king, although he apparently refused the title. After defeating the <a href="Gauls">Gallic</a> ruler <a href="Bolgios">Bolgios</a> and driving out the raiding party of <a href="Brennus%20%283rd%20century%20BC%29">Brennus</a>, Sosthenes died and left a chaotic situation in Macedonia. The Gallic invaders ravaged Macedonia until <a href="Antigonus%20Gonatas">Antigonus Gonatas</a>, son of Demetrius, defeated them in Thrace at the 277BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Lysimachia">Battle of Lysimachia</a> and was then proclaimed king <a href="Antigonus%20II%20of%20Macedon">Antigonus II of Macedon</a> ().

In 280 BC, Pyrrhus embarked on a campaign in <a href="Magna%20Graecia">Magna Graecia</a> (i.e. <a href="southern%20Italy">southern Italy</a>) against the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> known as the <a href="Pyrrhic%20War">Pyrrhic War</a>, followed by his <a href="Siege%20of%20Syracuse%20%28278%20BC%29">invasion of Sicily</a>. Ptolemy Keraunos secured his position on the Macedonian throne by giving Pyrrhus five thousand soldiers and twenty <a href="war%20elephant">war elephant</a>s for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275BC after the ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed to the <a href="rise%20of%20Rome">rise of Rome</a> because <a href="Colonies%20in%20antiquity">Greek cities in southern Italy</a> such as <a href="Taranto">Tarentum</a> now became Roman allies. Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia in 274BC, defeating the largely mercenary army of AntigonusII at the 274BC <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Aous%20%28274%20BC%29">Battle of Aous</a> and driving him out of Macedonia, forcing him to seek refuge with his naval fleet in the Aegean.
Pyrrhus lost much of his support among the Macedonians in 273BC when his unruly Gallic mercenaries plundered the royal cemetery of Aigai. Pyrrhus pursued AntigonusII in the Peloponnese, yet AntigonusII was ultimately able to recapture Macedonia. Pyrrhus was killed while besieging <a href="Argos">Argos</a> in 272BC, allowing AntigonusII to reclaim the rest of Greece. He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai and annexed the <a href="Paeonia%20%28kingdom%29">Kingdom of Paeonia</a>.

The <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a> hampered AntigonusII's control over <a href="central%20Greece">central Greece</a>, and the formation of the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a> in 251BC pushed Macedonian forces out of much of the Peloponnese and at times incorporated Athens and Sparta. While the Seleucid Empire aligned with Antigonid Macedonia against Ptolemaic Egypt during the <a href="Syrian%20Wars">Syrian Wars</a>, the Ptolemaic navy heavily disrupted AntigonusII's efforts to control mainland Greece. With the aid of the Ptolemaic navy, the Athenian statesman <a href="Chremonides">Chremonides</a> led a revolt against Macedonian authority known as the <a href="Chremonidean%20War">Chremonidean War</a> (267–261BC). By 265BC, Athens was surrounded and besieged by AntigonusII's forces, and a Ptolemaic fleet was defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cos">Battle of Cos</a>. Athens finally surrendered in 261BC. After Macedonia formed an alliance with the Seleucid ruler <a href="Antiochus%20II">Antiochus II</a>, a peace settlement between AntigonusII and <a href="Ptolemy%20II%20Philadelphus">Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a> of Egypt was finally struck in 255BC.
In 251 BC, <a href="Aratus%20of%20Sicyon">Aratus of Sicyon</a> led a rebellion against AntigonusII, and in 250BC, PtolemyII declared his support for the self-proclaimed King <a href="Alexander%20of%20Corinth">Alexander of Corinth</a>. Although Alexander died in 246BC and Antigonus was able to score a naval victory against the Ptolemies <a href="Battle%20of%20Andros%20%28246%20BC%29">at Andros</a>, the Macedonians lost the <a href="Acrocorinth">Acrocorinth</a> to the forces of Aratus in 243BC, followed by the induction of Corinth into the Achaean League. AntigonusII made peace with the Achaean League in 240BC, ceding the territories that he had lost in Greece. AntigonusII died in 239BC and was succeeded by his son <a href="Demetrius%20II%20of%20Macedon">Demetrius II of Macedon</a> (). Seeking an alliance with Macedonia to defend against the Aetolians, the <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a> and regent of Epirus, <a href="Olympias%20II%20of%20Epirus">Olympias II</a>, offered her daughter <a href="Phthia%20of%20Macedon">Phthia of Macedon</a> to DemetriusII in marriage. Demetrius II accepted her proposal, but he damaged relations with the Seleucids by divorcing <a href="Stratonice%20of%20Macedon">Stratonice of Macedon</a>. Although the Aetolians formed an alliance with the Achaean League as a result, DemetriusII was able to invade Boeotia and capture it from the Aetolians by 236BC.

The Achaean League managed to capture <a href="Megalopolis%2C%20Greece">Megalopolis</a> in 235BC, and by the end of DemetriusII's reign most of the Peloponnese except Argos was taken from the Macedonians. DemetriusII also lost an ally <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">in Epirus</a> when the <a href="Deidamia%20II%20of%20Epirus">monarchy was toppled</a> in a <a href="Epirote%20League">republican revolution</a>. DemetriusII enlisted the aid of the <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>n king <a href="Agron%20%28king%29">Agron</a> to defend <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a> against Aetolia, and in 229BC, they managed to defeat the combined navies of the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Paxos">Battle of Paxos</a>. Another Illyrian ruler, <a href="Longarus">Longarus</a> of the <a href="Dardanian%20Kingdom">Dardanian Kingdom</a>, invaded Macedonia and defeated an army of DemetriusII shortly before his death in 229BC. Although his young son <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip</a> immediately inherited the throne, his regent <a href="Antigonus%20III%20Doson">Antigonus III Doson</a> (), nephew of AntigonusII, was proclaimed king by the army, with Philip as his heir, following a string of military victories against the Illyrians in the north and the Aetolians in Thessaly.
Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226BC seeking an unexpected alliance now that the reformist king <a href="Cleomenes%20III">Cleomenes III</a> of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the <a href="Cleomenean%20War">Cleomenean War</a> (229–222BC). In exchange for military aid, AntigonusIII demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225BC. In 224BC, AntigonusIII's forces took <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a> from Sparta. After forming a Hellenic league in the same vein as PhilipII's League of Corinth, he managed to defeat Sparta at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sellasia">Battle of Sellasia</a> in 222BC. Sparta was occupied by a foreign power for the first time in its history, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, leaving behind a strong <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic kingdom</a> for his successor PhilipV.

<a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a> () faced immediate challenges to his authority by the Illyrian <a href="Dardani">Dardani</a> and Aetolian League. PhilipV and his allies were successful against the Aetolians and their allies in the <a href="Social%20War%20%28220%E2%80%93217%20BC%29">Social War (220–217 BC)</a>, yet he made peace with the Aetolians once he heard of incursions by the Dardani in the north and the <a href="History%20of%20Carthage">Carthaginian</a> victory over <a href="History%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">the Romans</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Trasimene">Battle of Lake Trasimene</a> in 217BC. <a href="Demetrius%20of%20Pharos">Demetrius of Pharos</a> is alleged to have convinced PhilipV to first <a href="Illyrian%20Wars">secure Illyria</a> in advance of an invasion of the <a href="Italian%20peninsula">Italian peninsula</a>. In 216BC, PhilipV sent a hundred <a href="Hellenistic-era%20warships">light warships</a> into the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> to attack Illyria, a move that prompted <a href="Scerdilaidas">Scerdilaidas</a> of the <a href="Ardiaean%20Kingdom">Ardiaean Kingdom</a> to appeal to the Romans for aid. Rome responded by sending ten heavy <a href="quinquereme">quinquereme</a>s from <a href="Roman%20Sicily">Roman Sicily</a> to patrol the Illyrian coasts, causing PhilipV to reverse course and order his fleet to retreat, averting open conflict for the time being.

In 215 BC, at the height of the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a> with the <a href="Carthaginian%20Empire">Carthaginian Empire</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> authorities intercepted a ship off the <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a>n coast holding a Macedonian envoy and a Carthaginian ambassador in possession of a treaty composed by <a href="Hannibal%20Barca">Hannibal Barca</a> declaring an alliance with PhilipV. <a href="Macedonian%E2%80%93Carthaginian%20Treaty">The treaty</a> stipulated that <a href="History%20of%20Carthage">Carthage</a> had the sole right to negotiate the terms of Rome's hypothetical surrender and promised mutual aid in the event that a resurgent Rome should seek revenge against either Macedonia or Carthage. Although the Macedonians were perhaps only interested in safeguarding their newly conquered territories in Illyria, the Romans were nevertheless able to thwart whatever grand ambitions PhilipV had for the Adriatic region during the <a href="First%20Macedonian%20War">First Macedonian War</a> (214–205BC). In 214BC, Rome positioned a <a href="Roman%20navy">naval fleet</a> at <a href="Oricus">Oricus</a>, which was assaulted along with <a href="Apollonia%20%28Illyria%29">Apollonia</a> by Macedonian forces. When the Macedonians captured <a href="Lissus">Lissus</a> in 212BC, the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a> responded by inciting the Aetolian League, Sparta, <a href="Elis">Elis</a>, <a href="Messenia">Messenia</a>, and <a href="Attalus%20I">Attalus I</a> () of <a href="Pergamon">Pergamon</a> to wage war against PhilipV, keeping him occupied and away from Italy.

The Aetolian League concluded a <a href="peace%20agreement">peace agreement</a> with PhilipV in 206BC, and the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> negotiated the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Phoenice">Treaty of Phoenice</a> in 205BC, ending the war and allowing the Macedonians to retain some captured settlements in Illyria. Although the Romans rejected an Aetolian request in 202BC for Rome to declare war on Macedonia once again, the Roman Senate gave serious consideration to the similar offer made by Pergamon and its ally <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> in 201BC. These states were concerned about PhilipV's alliance with <a href="Antiochus%20III%20the%20Great">Antiochus III the Great</a> of the Seleucid Empire, which invaded the war-weary and financially exhausted Ptolemaic Empire in the <a href="Fifth%20Syrian%20War">Fifth Syrian War</a> (202–195BC) as PhilipV captured Ptolemaic settlements in the Aegean Sea. Although Rome's envoys played a critical role in convincing Athens to join the anti-Macedonian alliance with Pergamon and Rhodes in 200BC, the "<a href="comitia%20centuriata">comitia centuriata</a>" (people's assembly) rejected the Roman Senate's proposal for a declaration of war on Macedonia. Meanwhile, PhilipV conquered territories in the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a> and <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a> as well as Ptolemaic <a href="Samos">Samos</a>, which led Rhodes to <a href="Cretan%20War%20%28205%E2%80%93200%20BC%29">form an alliance with Pergamon</a>, <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a>, <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a>, and <a href="Chios">Chios</a> against Macedonia. Despite PhilipV's nominal alliance with the Seleucid king, he lost the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Chios%20%28201%20BC%29">Battle of Chios</a> in 201BC and was blockaded at <a href="Bargylia">Bargylia</a> by the Rhodian and Pergamene navies.
While Philip V was busy fighting Rome's Greek allies, Rome viewed this as an opportunity to punish this former ally of Hannibal with a war that they hoped would supply a victory and require few resources. The Roman Senate demanded that PhilipV cease hostilities against neighboring Greek powers and defer to an international arbitration committee for settling grievances. When the "comitia centuriata" finally voted in approval of the Roman Senate's declaration of war in 200BC and handed their <a href="ultimatum">ultimatum</a> to PhilipV, demanding that a <a href="tribunal">tribunal</a> assess the damages owed to Rhodes and Pergamon, the Macedonian king rejected it. This marked the beginning of the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a> (200–197BC), with <a href="Publius%20Sulpicius%20Galba%20Maximus">Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus</a> spearheading <a href="military%20operation">military operation</a>s in Apollonia.
The Macedonians successfully defended their territory for roughly two years, but the <a href="Roman%20consul">Roman consul</a> <a href="Titus%20Quinctius%20Flamininus">Titus Quinctius Flamininus</a> managed to expel PhilipV from Macedonia in 198BC, forcing his men to take refuge in Thessaly. When the Achaean League switched their loyalties from Macedonia to Rome, the Macedonian king sued for peace, but the terms offered were considered too stringent, and so the war continued. In June 197BC, the Macedonians were defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cynoscephalae">Battle of Cynoscephalae</a>. Rome then ratified a treaty that forced Macedonia to relinquish control of much of its Greek possessions outside of Macedonia proper, if only to act as a buffer against Illyrian and Thracian incursions into Greece. Although some Greeks suspected Roman intentions of supplanting Macedonia as the new hegemonic power in Greece, Flaminius announced at the <a href="Isthmian%20Games">Isthmian Games</a> of 196BC that Rome intended to preserve Greek <a href="liberty">liberty</a> by leaving behind no garrisons and by not exacting <a href="tribute">tribute</a> of any kind. His promise was delayed by negotiations with the Spartan king <a href="Nabis">Nabis</a>, who had meanwhile captured Argos, yet Roman forces evacuated Greece in 194BC.

Encouraged by the Aetolian League and their calls to liberate Greece from the Romans, the <a href="Seleucid%20dynasty">Seleucid king</a> AntiochusIII landed with his army at <a href="Demetrias">Demetrias</a>, Thessaly, in 192BC, and was elected "strategos" by the Aetolians. Macedonia, the Achaean League, and other Greek city-states maintained their alliance with Rome. The Romans <a href="Roman%E2%80%93Seleucid%20War">defeated the Seleucids</a> in the 191BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Thermopylae%20%28191%20BC%29">Battle of Thermopylae</a> as well as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Magnesia">Battle of Magnesia</a> in 190BC, forcing the Seleucids to pay a <a href="war%20indemnity">war indemnity</a>, dismantle most of its navy, and abandon its claims to any territories north or west of the <a href="Taurus%20Mountains">Taurus Mountains</a> in the 188BC <a href="Treaty%20of%20Apamea">Treaty of Apamea</a>. With Rome's acceptance, PhilipV was able to capture some cities in central Greece in 191–189BC that had been allied to AntiochusIII, while Rhodes and <a href="Eumenes%20II">Eumenes II</a> () of Pergamon gained territories in Asia Minor.

Failing to please all sides in various territorial disputes, the Roman Senate decided in 184/183BC to force PhilipV to abandon <a href="Aenus%20%28Thrace%29">Aenus</a> and <a href="Maroneia">Maronea</a>, since these had been declared free cities in the Treaty of Apamea. This assuaged the fear of EumenesII that Macedonia could pose a threat to his lands in the Hellespont. <a href="Perseus%20of%20Macedon">Perseus of Macedon</a> () succeeded PhilipV and executed <a href="Demetrius%20%28son%20of%20Philip%20V%29">his brother Demetrius</a>, who had been favored by the Romans but was charged by Perseus with <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a>. Perseus then attempted to form marriage alliances with <a href="Prusias%20II%20of%20Bithynia">Prusias II of Bithynia</a> and <a href="Seleucus%20IV%20Philopator">Seleucus IV Philopator</a> of the Seleucid Empire, along with renewed relations with Rhodes that greatly unsettled EumenesII. Although EumenesII attempted to undermine these diplomatic relationships, Perseus fostered an alliance with the <a href="Boeotian%20League">Boeotian League</a>, extended his authority into Illyria <a href="Abrupolis">and Thrace</a>, and in 174BC, won the role of managing the Temple of Apollo at Delphi as a member of the <a href="Amphictyonic%20Council">Amphictyonic Council</a>.
Eumenes II came to Rome in 172 BC and delivered a speech to <a href="Senate%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">the Senate</a> denouncing the alleged crimes and transgressions of Perseus. This convinced the Roman Senate to declare the <a href="Third%20Macedonian%20War">Third Macedonian War</a> (171–168BC). Although Perseus's forces were victorious against the Romans at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Callinicus">Battle of Callinicus</a> in 171BC, the Macedonian army was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna">Battle of Pydna</a> in June 168BC. Perseus fled to <a href="Samothrace">Samothrace</a> but surrendered shortly afterwards, was brought to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> for the <a href="Roman%20triumph">triumph</a> of <a href="Lucius%20Aemilius%20Paullus%20Macedonicus">Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus</a>, and was placed under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> at <a href="Alba%20Fucens">Alba Fucens</a>, where he died in 166BC. The Romans abolished the Macedonian monarchy by installing four separate allied <a href="republic">republic</a>s in its stead, their capitals located at <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a>, <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a>, <a href="Pella">Pella</a>, and <a href="Pelagonia">Pelagonia</a>. The Romans imposed severe laws inhibiting many social and economic interactions between the inhabitants of these republics, including the banning of marriages between them and the (temporary) prohibition on gold and silver mining. A certain <a href="Andriscus">Andriscus</a>, claiming Antigonid descent, rebelled against the Romans and was pronounced king of Macedonia, defeating the army of the Roman <a href="praetor">praetor</a> Publius Juventius Thalna during the <a href="Fourth%20Macedonian%20War">Fourth Macedonian War</a> (150–148BC). Despite this, Andriscus was defeated in 148BC at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna%20%28148%20BC%29">second Battle of Pydna</a> by <a href="Quintus%20Caecilius%20Metellus%20Macedonicus">Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus</a>, whose forces occupied the kingdom. This was followed in 146BC by the Roman <a href="destruction%20of%20Carthage">destruction of Carthage</a> and victory over the Achaean League at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Corinth%20%28146%20BC%29">Battle of Corinth</a>, ushering in the era of <a href="Roman%20Greece">Roman Greece</a> and the gradual establishment of the <a href="Roman%20province%20of%20Macedonia">Roman province of Macedonia</a>.

At the head of <a href="Government%20of%20Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonia's government</a> was <a href="List%20of%20Macedonian%20kings">the king</a> ("<a href="basileus">basileus</a>"). From at least the reign of PhilipII, the king was assisted by the <a href="royal%20page">royal page</a>s ("basilikoi paides"), bodyguards ("<a href="somatophylakes">somatophylakes</a>"), companions ("<a href="hetairoi">hetairoi</a>"), friends ("<a href="philoi">philoi</a>"), an assembly that included members of the military, and (during the Hellenistic period) <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a>s. Evidence is lacking regarding the extent to which each of these groups shared authority with the king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework. Before the reign of PhilipII, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy.

The earliest known government of ancient Macedonia was that of its <a href="monarchy">monarchy</a>, lasting until 167BC when it was abolished by the Romans. The Macedonian hereditary monarchy existed since at least the time of <a href="Archaic%20Greece">Archaic Greece</a>, with Homeric aristocratic roots in <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean Greece</a>. Thucydides wrote that in previous ages, Macedonia was divided into small tribal regions, each having its own <a href="petty%20king">petty king</a>, the tribes of <a href="Lower%20Macedonia">Lower Macedonia</a> eventually coalescing under one great king who exercised power as an <a href="overlord">overlord</a> over the lesser kings of <a href="Upper%20Macedonia">Upper Macedonia</a>. The direct line of <a href="Order%20of%20succession">father-to-son succession</a> was broken after the assassination of <a href="Orestes%20of%20Macedon">Orestes of Macedon</a> in 396BC (allegedly by his <a href="regent">regent</a> and successor <a href="Aeropus%20II%20of%20Macedon">Aeropus II of Macedon</a>), clouding the issue of whether <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a> was the established custom or if there was a constitutional right for an assembly of the army or <a href="Popular%20assembly">of the people</a> to choose another king. It is unclear if the male offspring of Macedonian queens or <a href="Queen%20consort">consorts</a> were always preferred over others given the accession of <a href="Archelaus%20I%20of%20Macedon">Archelaus I of Macedon</a>, son of <a href="Perdiccas%20II%20of%20Macedon">Perdiccas II of Macedon</a> and a <a href="Slavery%20in%20ancient%20Greece">slave woman</a>, although Archelaus succeeded the throne after murdering his father's designated <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>.
It is known that Macedonian kings before PhilipII upheld the privileges and carried out the responsibilities of hosting foreign diplomats, determining the kingdom's foreign policies, and negotiating alliances with foreign powers. After the Greek victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Salamis</a> in 480BC, the Persian commander <a href="Mardonius%20%28general%29">Mardonius</a> had <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Macedon">Alexander I of Macedon</a> sent to Athens as a chief envoy to orchestrate an alliance between the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> and <a href="History%20of%20Athens">Athens</a>. The decision to send Alexander was based on his <a href="Marriage%20of%20state">marriage alliance</a> with a noble Persian house and his previous formal relationship with the city-state of Athens. With their ownership of natural resources including gold, silver, timber, and <a href="royal%20land">royal land</a>, the early Macedonian kings were also capable of <a href="Bribery">bribing</a> foreign and domestic parties with impressive gifts.

Little is known about the <a href="Judiciary">judicial system</a> of ancient Macedonia except that the king acted as the <a href="chief%20judge">chief judge</a> of the kingdom. The Macedonian kings were also <a href="Commander-in-chief">supreme commanders</a> of the military. PhilipII was also highly regarded for his acts of piety in serving as the <a href="high%20priest">high priest</a> of the nation. He performed daily <a href="ritual%20sacrifice">ritual sacrifice</a>s and led <a href="religious%20festival">religious festival</a>s. Alexander imitated various aspects of his father's reign, such as granting land and gifts to loyal aristocratic followers, but lost some core support among them for adopting some of the trappings of an Eastern, Persian monarch, a "lord and master" as Carol J. King suggests, instead of a "comrade-in-arms" as was the traditional relationship of Macedonian kings with their companions. Alexander's father, PhilipII, was perhaps influenced by Persian traditions when he adopted institutions similar to those found in the Achaemenid realm, such as having a <a href="Royal%20Secretary">royal secretary</a>, royal archive, royal pages, and a seated <a href="throne">throne</a>.

The <a href="royal%20page">royal page</a>s were adolescent boys and young men <a href="conscripted">conscripted</a> from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of PhilipII onward, although more solid evidence dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to introduce them to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during "<a href="symposium">symposia</a>" (i.e. formal drinking parties). Although there is little evidence for royal pages in the Antigonid period, it is known that some of them fled with <a href="Perseus%20of%20Macedon">Perseus of Macedon</a> to <a href="Samothrace">Samothrace</a> following <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna">his defeat</a> by the Romans in 168BC.

Royal bodyguards served as the closest members to the king at court and on the battlefield. They were split into two categories: the "<a href="agema">agema</a>" of the "<a href="hypaspistai">hypaspistai</a>", a type of ancient <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> usually numbering in the hundreds, and a smaller group of men handpicked by the king either for their individual merits or to honor the noble families to which they belonged. Therefore, the bodyguards, limited in number and forming the king's inner circle, were not always responsible for protecting the king's life on and off the battlefield; their title and office was more a mark of distinction, perhaps used to quell rivalries between aristocratic houses.

The companions, including the elite <a href="companion%20cavalry">companion cavalry</a> and "<a href="pezhetairoi">pezhetairoi</a>" infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king's bodyguards. The most trusted or highest ranking companions formed a council that served as an advisory body to the king. A small amount of evidence suggests the existence of an assembly of the army during times of war and a <a href="Direct%20democracy">people's assembly</a> during times of peace.

Members of the council had the right to speak freely, and although there is no direct evidence that they voted on affairs of state, it is clear that the king was at least occasionally pressured to agree to their demands. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a> and <a href="Sentence%20%28law%29">assign punishments</a> for them, such as when Alexander the Great acted as <a href="prosecutor">prosecutor</a> in the trial and conviction of three alleged conspirators in his father's assassination plot (while many others <a href="Acquittal">were acquitted</a>). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld or constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions <a href="Partition%20of%20Babylon">immediately formed a council</a> to assume control of his empire, but it was soon destabilized by <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Diadochi">open rivalry and conflict</a> between <a href="Diadochi">its members</a>. The army also used <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> as a tool to achieve political ends.

Antigonid Macedonian kings relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, such as the military "<a href="strategos">strategos</a>" and the <a href="politarch">politarch</a>, i.e. the elected governor ("<a href="archon">archon</a>") of a large city ("<a href="polis">polis</a>"), as well as the politico-religious office of the "<a href="epistates">epistates</a>". No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been chosen among the same group of aristocratic "philoi" and "hetairoi" who filled vacancies for army officers.
In <a href="ancient%20Athens">ancient Athens</a>, the <a href="Athenian%20democracy">Athenian democracy</a> was restored on three separate occasions following the initial conquest of the city by Antipater in 322BC. When it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed <a href="oligarchy">oligarchy</a> composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state. Other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of <a href="autonomy">autonomy</a>. After PhilipII conquered Amphipolis in 357BC, the city was allowed to retain its <a href="democracy">democracy</a>, including its constitution, <a href="popular%20assembly">popular assembly</a>, <a href="city%20council">city council</a> ("<a href="Boule%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">boule</a>"), and yearly <a href="election">election</a>s for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner ("epistates") to monitor the city's political affairs. <a href="Philippi">Philippi</a>, the city founded by PhilipII, was the only other city in the Macedonian <a href="commonwealth">commonwealth</a> that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly ("<a href="Ecclesia%20%28ancient%20Athens%29">ecclesia</a>") of <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> seems to have had only a passive function in practice. Some cities also maintained their own municipal <a href="revenue">revenue</a>s. The Macedonian king and central government administered the revenues generated by <a href="Greek%20temple">temples</a> and <a href="priesthood">priesthood</a>s.

Within the <a href="Koinon%20of%20Macedonians">Macedonian commonwealth</a>, some evidence from the 3rd centuryBC indicates that foreign relations were handled by the central government. Although individual Macedonian cities nominally participated in <a href="Panhellenic">Panhellenic</a> events as independent entities, in reality, the granting of "<a href="asylia">asylia</a>" (inviolability, <a href="diplomatic%20immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>, and the <a href="right%20of%20asylum">right of asylum</a> at <a href="sanctuaries">sanctuaries</a>) to certain cities was handled directly by the king. Likewise, the city-states within contemporary Greek "<a href="Koinon">koina</a>" (i.e., <a href="federation">federation</a>s of city-states, the "<a href="sympoliteia">sympoliteia</a>") obeyed the federal decrees <a href="vote">vote</a>d on collectively by the members of their league. In city-states belonging to a league or commonwealth, the granting of "<a href="proxenia">proxenia</a>" (i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors) was usually a right shared by local and central authorities. Abundant evidence exists for the granting of "proxenia" as being the sole <a href="prerogative">prerogative</a> of central authorities in the neighboring <a href="Epirote%20League">Epirote League</a>, and some evidence suggests the same arrangement in the Macedonian commonwealth. City-states that were <a href="Alliance">allied</a> with Macedonia issued their own decrees regarding "proxenia". Foreign leagues also formed alliances with the Macedonian kings, such as when the <a href="Cretan%20League">Cretan League</a> signed treaties with <a href="Demetrius%20II%20Aetolicus">Demetrius II Aetolicus</a> and <a href="Antigonus%20III%20Doson">Antigonus III Doson</a> ensuring enlistment of Cretan mercenaries into the Macedonian army, and elected <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a> as honorary protector ("<a href="prostates">prostates</a>") of the league.

The basic structure of the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonian%20army">Ancient Macedonian army</a> was the division between the companion cavalry ("<a href="hetairoi">hetairoi</a>") and the foot companions ("<a href="pezhetairoi">pezhetairoi</a>"), augmented by various allied troops, foreign levied soldiers, and mercenaries. The foot companions existed perhaps since the reign of <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Macedon">Alexander I of Macedon</a>. Macedonian cavalry, wearing <a href="muscled%20cuirass">muscled cuirass</a>es, became renowned in Greece during and after their involvement in the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>, at times siding with either Athens or Sparta. Macedonian infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers, while the cavalry was composed of noblemen. As evidenced by early 4th century BC artwork, there was a pronounced Spartan influence on the Macedonian army before PhilipII. Nicholas Viktor Sekunda states that at the beginning of PhilipII's reign in 359BC, the Macedonian army consisted of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry, yet Malcolm Errington cautions that these figures cited by ancient authors should be treated with some skepticism.

After spending years as a political hostage in Thebes, PhilipII sought to imitate the Greek example of <a href="Military%20drill">martial exercises</a> and the issuing of <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20military%20personal%20equipment">standard equipment</a> for citizen soldiery, and succeeded in transforming the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained, <a href="professional%20army">professional army</a>. PhilipII adopted some of the <a href="military%20tactics">military tactics</a> of his enemies, such as the "<a href="embolon">embolon</a>" (flying wedge) cavalry formation of the <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>ns. His infantry wielded "peltai" shields that replaced the earlier "<a href="hoplon">hoplon</a>"-style shield, were equipped with <a href="Greek%20helmet%20%28disambiguation%29">protective helmets</a>, <a href="greave">greave</a>s, and either <a href="cuirass">cuirass</a> <a href="breastplate">breastplate</a>s or "<a href="kotthybos">kotthybos</a>" stomach bands, and armed with "<a href="sarissa">sarissa</a>" <a href="Pike%20%28weapon%29">pikes</a> and a <a href="dagger">dagger</a> as a secondary weapon. The elite "<a href="hypaspistai">hypaspistai</a>" infantry, composed of handpicked men from the ranks of the "pezhetairoi", were formed during the reign of PhilipII and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. PhilipII was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards ("<a href="somatophylakes">somatophylakes</a>").
For his lighter missile troops, Philip II employed mercenary <a href="Cretan%20archers">Cretan archers</a> as well as Thracian, Paeonian, and Illyrian <a href="javelin">javelin</a> throwers, <a href="Sling%20%28weapon%29">slingers</a>, and archers. He hired engineers such as <a href="Polyidus%20of%20Thessaly">Polyidus of Thessaly</a> and <a href="Diades%20of%20Pella">Diades of Pella</a>, who were capable of building <a href="state%20of%20the%20art">state of the art</a> <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s and <a href="artillery">artillery</a> that fired large <a href="Crossbow%20bolt">bolts</a>. Following the acquisition of the lucrative mines at <a href="Krinides">Krinides</a> (renamed <a href="Philippi">Philippi</a>), the royal <a href="treasury">treasury</a> could afford to field a permanent, professional <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a>. The increase in state revenues under PhilipII allowed the Macedonians to build a <a href="Naval%20warfare">small navy</a> for the first time, which included <a href="trireme">trireme</a>s.

The only Macedonian cavalry units attested under Alexander were the companion cavalry, yet he formed a "<a href="Hipparchus%20%28cavalry%20officer%29">hipparchia</a>" (i.e. unit of a few hundred horsemen) of companion cavalry composed entirely of ethnic <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a> while campaigning in Asia. When marching his forces into Asia, Alexander brought 1,800 cavalrymen from Macedonia, 1,800 <a href="Thessalian%20cavalry">cavalrymen from Thessaly</a>, 600 cavalrymen from the rest of Greece, and 900 "<a href="prodromoi">prodromoi</a>" cavalry from <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. Antipater was able to quickly raise a force of 600 native Macedonian cavalry to fight in the <a href="Lamian%20War">Lamian War</a> when it began in 323BC. The most elite members of Alexander's "hypaspistai" were designated as the "<a href="agema">agema</a>", and a new term for "hypaspistai" emerged after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaugamela">Battle of Gaugamela</a> in 331BC: the "<a href="argyraspides">argyraspides</a>" (silver shields). The latter continued to serve after the reign of Alexander the Great and may have been of Asian origin. Overall, his <a href="pikemen">pike-wielding</a> <a href="phalanx">phalanx</a> infantry numbered some 12,000 men, 3,000 of which were elite "hypaspistai" and 9,000 of which were "pezhetairoi". Alexander continued the use of Cretan archers and introduced native Macedonian archers into the army. After the Battle of Gaugamela, archers of West Asian backgrounds became commonplace.

<a href="Antigonid%20Macedonian%20army">The Macedonian army</a> continued to evolve under the <a href="Antigonid%20dynasty">Antigonid dynasty</a>. It is uncertain how many men were appointed as "somatophylakes", which numbered eight men at the end of Alexander the Great's reign, while the "hypaspistai" seem to have morphed into assistants of the "somatophylakes". At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cynoscephalae">Battle of Cynoscephalae</a> in 197BC, the Macedonians commanded some 16,000 phalanx pikemen. Alexander the Great's royal squadron of companion cavalry contained 800 men, the same number of cavalrymen in the sacred squadron (<a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a>: "sacra ala"; <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>: "hiera ile") commanded by <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a> during the <a href="Social%20War%20%28220%E2%80%93217%20BC%29">Social War</a> of 219BC. The regular Macedonian cavalry numbered 3,000 at Callinicus, which was separate from the sacred squadron and royal cavalry. While Macedonian cavalry of the 4th century BC had fought without shields, the use of shields by cavalry was adopted from the <a href="Celtic%20settlement%20of%20Eastern%20Europe">Celtic invaders</a> of the 270s BC who settled in <a href="Galatia">Galatia</a>, central Anatolia.

Thanks to <a href="Military%20Decree%20of%20Amphipolis">contemporary inscriptions</a> from Amphipolis and Greia dated 218 and 181BC, respectively, historians have been able to partially piece together the organization of the Antigonid army under PhilipV. From at least the time of <a href="Antigonus%20III%20Doson">Antigonus III Doson</a>, the most elite Antigonid-period infantry were the <a href="peltast">peltast</a>s, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding "peltai" <a href="javelin">javelin</a>s, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than <a href="Macedonian%20phalanx">Macedonian phalanx</a> pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected to serve in the elite "agema" <a href="vanguard">vanguard</a>, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The number of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men. They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into "<a href="chalkaspides">chalkaspides</a>" (bronze shield) and "<a href="leukaspides">leukaspides</a>" (white shield) regiments.

The Antigonid Macedonian kings continued to expand and equip <a href="Ancient%20navies%20and%20vessels">the navy</a>. <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a> maintained <a href="Hellenistic-era%20warships">a small fleet</a> at <a href="Pydna">Pydna</a>, <a href="Demetrius%20I%20of%20Macedon">Demetrius I of Macedon</a> had one at Pella, and <a href="Antigonus%20II%20Gonatas">Antigonus II Gonatas</a>, while serving as a general for Demetrius in Greece, used the navy to secure the Macedonian holdings in <a href="Demetrias">Demetrias</a>, <a href="Chalkis">Chalkis</a>, <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, and <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>. The navy was considerably expanded during the <a href="Chremonidean%20War">Chremonidean War</a> (267–261BC), allowing the Macedonian navy to defeat the Ptolemaic Egyptian navy at the 255BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Cos">Battle of Cos</a> and 245BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Andros%20%28246%20BC%29">Battle of Andros</a>, and enabling Macedonian influence to spread over the <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a>. AntigonusIII Doson used the Macedonian navy to invade <a href="Caria">Caria</a>, while PhilipV sent 200 ships to fight in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chios%20%28201%20BC%29">Battle of Chios</a> in 201BC. The Macedonian navy was reduced to a mere six vessels as agreed in the 197BC <a href="peace%20treaty">peace treaty</a> that concluded the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a> with the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>, although <a href="Perseus%20of%20Macedon">Perseus of Macedon</a> quickly assembled some "<a href="lemboi">lemboi</a>" at the outbreak of the <a href="Third%20Macedonian%20War">Third Macedonian War</a> in 171BC.

Following its adoption as the court language of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>'s regime, authors of ancient Macedonia wrote their works in <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a>, the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of late <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical</a> and <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic Greece</a>. Rare textual evidence indicates that the native Macedonian language was either a dialect of <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> similar to <a href="Thessalian%20Greek">Thessalian Greek</a> and <a href="Northwestern%20Greek">Northwestern Greek</a>, or a <a href="Hellenic%20languages">language closely related to Greek</a>. The vast majority of surviving inscriptions from ancient Macedonia were written in <a href="Attic%20Greek">Attic Greek</a> and its successor Koine. Attic (and later Koine) Greek was the preferred language of the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonian%20army">Ancient Macedonian army</a>, although it is known that Alexander the Great once shouted an emergency order in Macedonian to his royal guards during the <a href="Symposium">drinking party</a> where he killed <a href="Cleitus%20the%20Black">Cleitus the Black</a>. Macedonian became <a href="Extinct%20language">extinct</a> in either the Hellenistic or the Roman period, and entirely replaced by Koine Greek.

By the 5th century BC, the Macedonians and the southern Greeks worshiped more or less the <a href="List%20of%20Greek%20mythological%20figures">same deities of the Greek pantheon</a>. In Macedonia, political and religious offices were often intertwined. For instance, the head of state for the city of Amphipolis also served as the priest of <a href="Asklepios">Asklepios</a>, Greek god of medicine; a similar arrangement existed at <a href="Cassandreia">Cassandreia</a>, where a cult priest honoring the city's founder <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a> was the nominal head of the city. The main sanctuary of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> was maintained at <a href="Dion%2C%20Pieria">Dion</a>, while another at <a href="Veria">Veria</a> was dedicated to <a href="Herakles">Herakles</a> and was patronized by <a href="Demetrius%20II%20Aetolicus">Demetrius II Aetolicus</a> (). Meanwhile, foreign <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">cults from Egypt</a> were fostered by the royal court, such as the temple of <a href="Sarapis">Sarapis</a> at Thessaloniki. The Macedonians also had relations with "international" cults; for example, Macedonian kings <a href="Philip%20III%20of%20Macedon">Philip III of Macedon</a> and <a href="Alexander%20IV%20of%20Macedon">Alexander IV of Macedon</a> made <a href="votive%20offering">votive offering</a>s to the internationally esteemed <a href="Samothrace%20temple%20complex">Samothrace temple complex</a> of the <a href="Cabeiri">Cabeiri</a> <a href="mystery%20cult">mystery cult</a>. 

In the three royal tombs at <a href="Vergina">Vergina</a>, professional painters decorated the walls with a mythological scene of <a href="Hades">Hades</a> abducting <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a> and royal hunting scenes, while lavish <a href="grave%20goods">grave goods</a> including <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20military%20personal%20equipment">weapons, armor</a>, drinking vessels, and personal items were housed with the dead, whose bones <a href="Cremation">were burned</a> before <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20funeral%20and%20burial%20practices">burial in golden coffins</a>. Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs, yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty, including a <a href="diadem">diadem</a>, luxurious goods, and arms and armor. Scholars have debated about the identity of the tomb occupants since <a href="Manolis%20Andronikos">the discovery</a> of their remains in 1977–1978, and recent research and forensic examination have concluded that at least one of the persons buried was PhilipII. Located near Tomb1 are the above-ground ruins of a "<a href="heroon">heroon</a>", a shrine for <a href="Cult%20%28religion%29">cult worship</a> of the dead. In 2014, the ancient Macedonian <a href="Kasta%20Tomb">Kasta Tomb</a> was discovered outside of Amphipolis and is the largest ancient tomb found in Greece (as of 2017).

Young Macedonian men were typically expected to engage in <a href="hunting">hunting</a> and martial combat as a by-product of their <a href="transhumance">transhumance</a> lifestyle of herding <a href="livestock">livestock</a> such as goats and sheep, while <a href="horse%20breeding">horse breeding</a> and raising <a href="cattle">cattle</a> were other common pursuits. Some Macedonians engaged in farming, often with <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a>, <a href="land%20reclamation">land reclamation</a>, and <a href="horticulture">horticulture</a> activities supported by the Macedonian state. The Macedonian economy and state finances were mainly supported by <a href="logging">logging</a> and by <a href="mining">mining</a> valuable <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s such as copper, iron, gold, and silver. The conversion of these raw materials into finished products and the sale of those products encouraged the growth of urban centers and a gradual shift away from the traditional rustic Macedonian lifestyle during the course of the 5thcenturyBC.

The Macedonian king was an <a href="autocracy">autocratic</a> figure at the head of both government and society, with arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy, but he was also the leader of a very personal regime with close relationships or connections to his "<a href="hetairoi">hetairoi</a>", the core of the Macedonian <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a>. These aristocrats were second only to the king in terms of power and privilege, filling the ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in the military. It was in the more bureaucratic regimes of the <a href="Hellenistic%20kingdoms">Hellenistic kingdoms</a> that succeeded Alexander the Great's empire where greater <a href="social%20mobility">social mobility</a> for members of society seeking to join the aristocracy could be found, especially in Ptolemaic Egypt. Although governed by a king and martial aristocracy, Macedonia seems to have lacked the widespread <a href="History%20of%20slavery">use of slaves</a> seen in contemporaneous Greek states.

By the reign of <a href="Archelaus%20I%20of%20Macedon">ArchelausI</a> in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was importing customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps <a href="Homer">Homer</a>ic, funerary rites connected with the <a href="symposium">symposium</a> that were typified by items such as the decorative metal <a href="krater">krater</a>s that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze <a href="Derveni%20Krater">Derveni Krater</a> from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> and <a href="Cult%20of%20Dionysus">his entourage</a> and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian <a href="metalwork">metalwork</a> usually followed <a href="Pottery%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Athenian styles of vase shapes</a> from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, <a href="diadem">diadem</a>s, and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20coinage">coins</a> among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.
Surviving Macedonian painted artwork includes <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es and <a href="mural">mural</a>s, but also decoration on <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20sculpture">sculpted artwork</a> such as <a href="statue">statue</a>s and <a href="relief">relief</a>s. For instance, trace colors still exist on the <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a>s of the late 4th-century BC <a href="Alexander%20Sarcophagus">Alexander Sarcophagus</a>. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by the <a href="ancient%20Macedonians">ancient Macedonians</a>. Aside from metalwork and painting, <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a>s are another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork. The <a href="Stag%20Hunt%20Mosaic">Stag Hunt Mosaic</a> of Pella, with its three-dimensional qualities and illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored to Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion <a href="Craterus">Craterus</a>, or simply a conventional illustration of the royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and <a href="Helen%20of%20Troy">Helen of Troy</a> being abducted by <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a>, the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting, and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage); these subjects are at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate a metaphorical connection.

Philip II was assassinated in 336 BC at the <a href="History%20of%20theatre">theatre</a> of <a href="Aigai%2C%20Macedonia">Aigai, Macedonia</a>, amid games and spectacles celebrating the marriage of his daughter <a href="Cleopatra%20of%20Macedon">Cleopatra of Macedon</a>. Alexander the Great was allegedly a great admirer of both theatre and music. He was especially fond of the <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">plays</a> by <a href="Classical%20Athenian">Classical Athenian</a> <a href="tragedian">tragedian</a>s <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>, and <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>, whose works formed part of a proper <a href="Education%20in%20ancient%20Greece">Greek education</a> for his new eastern subjects alongside studies in the Greek language, including the <a href="Epic%20Cycle">epics</a> of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>. While he and his army were stationed at <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> (in modern-day Lebanon), Alexander had his generals act as judges not only for athletic contests but also for stage performances of Greek tragedies. The contemporaneous famous <a href="actor">actor</a>s <a href="Thessalus%20%28actor%29">Thessalus</a> and Athenodorus performed at the event.

<a href="History%20of%20music">Music</a> was also appreciated in Macedonia. In addition to the <a href="agora">agora</a>, the <a href="Gymnasium%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">gymnasium</a>, the <a href="theatre">theatre</a>, and <a href="Religious%20sanctuary">religious sanctuaries</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20temple">temples</a> dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, one of the main markers of a true Greek city in the <a href="empire%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">empire of Alexander the Great</a> was the presence of an <a href="odeon%20%28building%29">odeon</a> for <a href="Concert">musical performances</a>. This was the case not only for <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in <a href="History%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, but also cities as distant as <a href="Ai-Khanoum">Ai-Khanoum</a> in what is now modern-day <a href="History%20of%20Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.

<a href="Perdiccas%20II%20of%20Macedon">Perdiccas II of Macedon</a> was able to host well-known Classical Greek intellectual visitors at his royal court, such as the lyric poet <a href="Melanippides">Melanippides</a> and the renowned medical doctor <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a>, and <a href="Pindar">Pindar</a>'s "<a href="encomium">enkomion</a>" written for <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Macedon">Alexander I of Macedon</a> may have been composed at his court. ArchelausI received many more Greek scholars, artists, and celebrities at his court than his predecessors. His honored guests included the <a href="History%20of%20painting%23Egypt%2C%20Greece%2C%20and%20Rome">painter</a> <a href="Zeuxis">Zeuxis</a>, the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20architecture">architect</a> <a href="Callimachus%20%28sculptor%29">Callimachus</a>, the poets <a href="Choerilus%20of%20Samos">Choerilus of Samos</a>, <a href="Timotheus%20of%20Miletus">Timotheus of Miletus</a>, and <a href="Agathon">Agathon</a>, as well as the famous Athenian <a href="playwright">playwright</a> <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>. The philosopher <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, who studied at the <a href="Platonic%20Academy">Platonic Academy</a> of Athens and established the <a href="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian school of thought</a>, moved to Macedonia, and is said to have tutored the young Alexander the Great, as well as serving as an esteemed diplomat for PhilipII. Among Alexander's retinue of artists, writers, and philosophers was <a href="Pyrrho%20of%20Elis">Pyrrho of Elis</a>, founder of <a href="Pyrrhonism">Pyrrhonism</a>, the school of <a href="philosophical%20skepticism">philosophical skepticism</a>. During the Antigonid period, <a href="Antigonos%20Gonatas">Antigonos Gonatas</a> fostered cordial relationships with <a href="Menedemos%20of%20Eretria">Menedemos of Eretria</a>, founder of the <a href="Eretrian%20school">Eretrian school</a> of philosophy, and <a href="Zeno%20of%20Citium">Zenon</a>, the founder of <a href="Stoicism">Stoicism</a>.

In terms of early <a href="Greek%20historiography">Greek historiography</a> and later <a href="Roman%20historiography">Roman historiography</a>, <a href="Felix%20Jacoby">Felix Jacoby</a> identified thirteen possible ancient <a href="List%20of%20Greek%20historiographers">historians</a> who wrote about Macedonia in his "<a href="Fragmente%20der%20griechischen%20Historiker">Fragmente der griechischen Historiker</a>". Aside from accounts in <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and Thucydides, the works compiled by Jacoby are only fragmentary, whereas other works are completely lost, such as the history of an <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>n war fought by <a href="Perdiccas%20III%20of%20Macedon">Perdiccas III</a> written by Antipater. The Macedonian historians <a href="Marsyas%20of%20Pella">Marsyas of Pella</a> and <a href="Marsyas%20of%20Philippi">Marsyas of Philippi</a> wrote histories of Macedonia, the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic</a> king <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy I Soter</a> authored a history about Alexander, and <a href="Hieronymus%20of%20Cardia">Hieronymus of Cardia</a> wrote a history about Alexander's royal successors. Following the <a href="Indian%20campaign%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">Indian campaign of Alexander the Great</a>, the Macedonian military officer <a href="Nearchus">Nearchus</a> wrote a work of his <a href="travel%20literature">voyage</a> from the mouth of the <a href="Indus%20river">Indus river</a> to the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. The Macedonian <a href="Craterus%20%28historian%29">historian Craterus</a> published a compilation of decrees made by <a href="Ecclesia%20%28ancient%20Athens%29">the popular assembly</a> of the <a href="Athenian%20democracy">Athenian democracy</a>, ostensibly while attending the school of Aristotle. <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a> had manuscripts of the history of PhilipII written by <a href="Theopompus">Theopompus</a> gathered by his court scholars and disseminated with further copies.

When Alexander I of Macedon petitioned to compete in the <a href="foot%20race">foot race</a> of the ancient Olympic Games, the event organizers at first denied his request, explaining that only Greeks were allowed to compete. However, AlexanderI produced proof of an <a href="Argead%20dynasty">Argead</a> royal <a href="genealogy">genealogy</a> showing ancient <a href="Argive">Argive</a> <a href="Temenid">Temenid</a> lineage, a move that ultimately convinced the Olympic "<a href="Hellanodikai">Hellanodikai</a>" authorities of his Greek descent and ability to compete. By the end of the 5thcenturyBC, the Macedonian king ArchelausI was crowned with the <a href="olive%20wreath">olive wreath</a> at both <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a> and <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> (in the <a href="Pythian%20Games">Pythian Games</a>) for winning <a href="chariot%20racing">chariot racing</a> contests. PhilipII allegedly heard of the Olympic victory of his horse (in either an individual <a href="horse%20race">horse race</a> or chariot race) on the same day his son Alexander the Great was born, on either 19 or 20July 356BC. Non-royal Macedonians also competed in and won various Olympic contests by the 4th century BC. In addition to literary contests, Alexander the Great staged <a href="Music%20competition">competitions for music</a> and athletics across his empire.

Ancient Macedonia produced only a few fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in the Greek world, including <a href="eel">eel</a>s from the <a href="Strymonian%20Gulf">Strymonian Gulf</a> and special <a href="History%20of%20wine">wine</a> produced in <a href="Chalcidice">Chalcidice</a>. The earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in Macedonia during the 3rdcenturyBC, which perhaps influenced the later <a href="Trencher%20%28tableware%29">trencher bread</a> of <a href="medieval%20Europe">medieval Europe</a>. <a href="Cattle">Cattle</a> and <a href="goat">goat</a>s were consumed, although there was no notice of Macedonian mountain <a href="History%20of%20cheese">cheeses</a> in literature until the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The comedic playwright <a href="Menander">Menander</a> wrote that Macedonian dining habits penetrated <a href="History%20of%20Athens">Athenian</a> high society; for instance, the introduction of meats into the <a href="dessert">dessert</a> course of a meal. The Macedonians also most likely introduced "mattye" to Athenian cuisine, a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced, salted, and sauced meats served <a href="Full%20course%20dinner">during the wine course</a>. This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by the Athenian comic poet <a href="Alexis%20%28poet%29">Alexis</a> about the declining morals of Athenians in the age of <a href="Demetrius%20I%20of%20Macedon">Demetrius I of Macedon</a>.

The "<a href="symposium">symposium</a>" in the Macedonian and wider Greek realm was a banquet for the nobility and privileged class, an occasion for feasting, drinking, entertainment, and sometimes <a href="Symposium%20%28Plato%29">philosophical discussion</a>. The "<a href="hetairoi">hetairoi</a>", leading members of the Macedonian <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a>, were expected to attend such feasts with their king. They were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for the acquisition of <a href="game%20meat">game meat</a> as well as for sport.

There is some disagreement among both ancient authors and modern scholars about the ethnic identity of the ancient Macedonians. <a href="Ernst%20Badian">Ernst Badian</a> notes that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of <a href="Arrian">Arrian</a>, who lived at the time of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the <a href="League%20of%20Corinth">League of Corinth</a> in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected "<a href="hegemon">hegemon</a>" PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself), <a href="N.%20G.%20L.%20Hammond">N. G. L. Hammond</a> asserts that ancient views differentiating Macedonia's ethnic identity from the rest of the Greek-speaking world should be seen as an expression of conflict between two different political systems: the democratic system of the city-states (e.g. Athens) versus the monarchy (Macedonia). Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.

Anson argues that some Hellenic authors expressed complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous ideas about the exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some such as <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in his "<a href="Politics%20%28Aristotle%29">Politics</a>" as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts that in addition to persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians. <a href="Simon%20Hornblower">Simon Hornblower</a> argues on the Greek identity of the Macedonians, taking into consideration their origin, language, cults and customs. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the <a href="Macedonian%20Wars">Roman conquest of Macedonia</a> and then <a href="Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29">the rest of Greece</a> with the defeat of the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a> by the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Corinth%20%28146%20BC%29">Battle of Corinth (146 BC)</a>.

Macedonian architecture, although utilizing a mixture of different forms and styles from the rest of Greece, did not represent a unique or diverging style from other <a href="Architecture%20of%20ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek architecture</a>. Among the <a href="classical%20order">classical order</a>s, Macedonian architects favored the <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic order</a>, especially in the <a href="peristyle">peristyle</a> courtyards of private homes. There are several surviving examples, albeit in ruins, of Macedonian palatial architecture, including a <a href="palace">palace</a> at the site of the capital Pella, the summer residence of <a href="Vergina">Vergina</a> near the old capital Aigai, and the royal residence at <a href="Demetrias">Demetrias</a> near modern <a href="Volos">Volos</a>. At Vergina, the ruins of three large <a href="banquet%20hall">banquet hall</a>s with marble-<a href="tile">tile</a>d floors (covered in the debris of <a href="roof%20tiles">roof tiles</a>) with floor plan dimensions measuring roughly 16.7 x 17.6 m (54.8 x 57.7 ft) demonstrate perhaps the earliest examples of monumental <a href="timber%20roof%20trusses">triangular roof trusses</a>, if dated before the reign of <a href="Antigonus%20II%20Gonatas">Antigonus II Gonatas</a> or even the onset of the Hellenistic period. Later Macedonian architecture also featured <a href="arch">arch</a>es and <a href="vault%20%28architecture%29">vault</a>s. The palaces of both Vergina and Demetrias had walls made of sundried <a href="brick">brick</a>s, while the latter palace had four corner <a href="tower">tower</a>s around a central courtyard in the manner of a fortified residence fit for a king or at least a military governor.

Macedonian rulers also sponsored works of architecture outside of Macedonia proper. For instance, following his victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chaeronea%20%28338%20BC%29">Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)</a>, PhilipII raised a round memorial building at <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a> known as the <a href="Philippeion">Philippeion</a>, decorated inside with statues depicting him, his parents <a href="Amyntas%20III%20of%20Macedon">Amyntas III of Macedon</a> and <a href="Eurydice%20I%20of%20Macedon">Eurydice I of Macedon</a>, his wife <a href="Olympias">Olympias</a>, and his son Alexander the Great.
The ruins of roughly twenty <a href="Greek%20theatre">Greek theatre</a>s survive in the present-day <a href="Decentralized%20Administration%20of%20Macedonia%20and%20Thrace">regions of Macedonia and Thrace in Greece</a>: sixteen open-air theatres, three <a href="Odeon%20%28building%29">odea</a>, and a possible theatre in <a href="Veria">Veria</a> undergoing excavation.

By the Hellenistic period, it became common for Greek states to finance the development and proliferation of ever more powerful <a href="torsion%20siege%20engine">torsion siege engine</a>s, <a href="Naval%20warfare">naval ships</a>, and standardized designs for <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20military%20personal%20equipment">arms and armor</a>. Under PhilipII and Alexander the Great, improvements were made to <a href="siege%20artillery">siege artillery</a> such as bolt-shooting <a href="ballista">ballista</a>e and <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s such as huge rolling <a href="siege%20tower">siege tower</a>s. E.W.Marsden and M.Y.Treister contend that the Macedonian rulers <a href="Antigonus%20I%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus I Monophthalmus</a> and his successor <a href="Demetrius%20I%20of%20Macedon">Demetrius I of Macedon</a> had the most powerful siege artillery of the Hellenistic world at the end of the 4thcenturyBC. <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis%20%28306%20BC%29">The siege</a> of <a href="Salamis%2C%20Cyprus">Salamis, Cyprus</a>, in 306BC necessitated the building of large siege engines and drafting of craftsmen from parts of <a href="West%20Asia">West Asia</a>. The siege tower commissioned by DemetriusI for the Macedonian <a href="Siege%20of%20Rhodes%20%28305%E2%80%93304%20BC%29">Siege of Rhodes (305–304 BC)</a> and manned by over three thousand soldiers was built at a height of nine <a href="Storey">stories</a>. It had a base of , eight wheels that were steered in either direction by pivots, three sides covered in iron plates to protect them from fire, and mechanically opened windows (shielded with wool-stuffed leather curtains to soften the blow of ballistae rounds) of different sizes to accommodate the firing of missiles ranging from arrows to larger bolts.

During the siege of <a href="Echinus%20%28Phthiotis%29">Echinus</a> by <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a> in 211BC, the besiegers built <a href="Mining%20%28military%29">underground tunnels</a> to protect the soldiers and <a href="sapper">sapper</a>s as they went back and forth from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift <a href="wickerwork">wickerwork</a> <a href="curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain wall</a> mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the <a href="battering%20ram">battering ram</a>. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Egypt</a> became the center for technological improvements to the <a href="catapult">catapult</a> by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of <a href="Philo%20of%20Alexandria">Philo of Alexandria</a>.

Although perhaps not as prolific as other areas of Greece in regards to technological innovations, there are some inventions that may have originated in Macedonia aside from siege engines and artillery. The <a href="Rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis">rotary-operated</a> <a href="olive%20press">olive press</a> for producing <a href="olive%20oil">olive oil</a> may have been invented in ancient Macedonia or another part of Greece, or even as far east as the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> or <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. <a href="History%20of%20glass">Mold-pressed glass</a> first appeared in Macedonia in the 4thcenturyBC (although it could have simultaneously existed in the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>); the first known clear, translucent glass pieces of the Greek world have been discovered in Macedonia and <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> and date to the second half of the 4thcenturyBC. Greek technical and <a href="scientific%20literature">scientific literature</a> began with <a href="Classical%20Athens">Classical Athens</a> in the 5thcenturyBC, while the major production centers for technical innovation and texts during the Hellenistic period were <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Rhodian%20school">Rhodes</a>, and <a href="Pergamon">Pergamon</a>.

The <a href="Mint%20%28facility%29">minting</a> of silver coinage began during the reign of <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Macedon">AlexanderI</a> as a means to pay for royal expenditures. <a href="Archelaus%20I%20of%20Macedon">ArchelausI</a> increased the silver content of his coins as well as minting copper coins to promote foreign and domestic commerce. The minting of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of PhilipII and Alexander the Great, especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the <a href="Pangaion%20Hills">Pangaion Hills</a>. During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia, <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Egypt</a>, and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Pergamon">Kingdom of Pergamon</a> exercised <a href="State%20monopoly">full monopolistic control</a> over <a href="mining">mining</a> activities, largely to ensure the funding of their armies. By the end of the <a href="conquests%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">conquests of Alexander the Great</a>, nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> produced standard coins. The right to mint coins was shared by <a href="Central%20government">central</a> and some <a href="local%20government">local government</a>s, i.e. the <a href="autonomous">autonomous</a> <a href="municipal%20government">municipal government</a>s of Thessaloniki, Pella, and Amphipolis within the Macedonian <a href="commonwealth">commonwealth</a>. The Macedonians were also the first to issue different coins for <a href="Circulation%20%28currency%29">internal and external circulation</a>.

State revenues were also raised by collecting <a href="produce">produce</a> from <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a>s, timber from forests, and <a href="Tax%23History">taxes</a> on <a href="import">import</a>s and <a href="export">export</a>s at <a href="harbor">harbor</a>s. Some mines, <a href="Grove%20%28nature%29">grove</a>s, <a href="History%20of%20agriculture">agricultural lands</a>, and <a href="Logging">forests</a> belonging to the Macedonian state were exploited by the Macedonian king, although these were often <a href="lease">lease</a>d as <a href="asset">asset</a>s or given as <a href="Grant%20%28money%29">grants</a> to members of the <a href="nobility">nobility</a> such as the "<a href="hetairoi">hetairoi</a>" and "<a href="philoi">philoi</a>". <a href="Tariff">Tariff</a>s exacted on goods flowing in and out of Macedonian <a href="seaport">seaport</a>s existed from at least the reign of <a href="Amyntas%20III%20of%20Macedon">AmyntasIII</a>, and <a href="Callistratus%20of%20Aphidnae">Callistratus of Aphidnae</a> (d.c.350BC) aided <a href="Perdiccas%20III%20of%20Macedon">PerdiccasIII</a> in doubling the kingdom's annual profits on <a href="customs%20duties">customs duties</a> from 20 to 40 <a href="Talent%20%28measurement%29">talents</a>.

After the defeat of <a href="Perseus%20of%20Macedon">Perseus</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna">Pydna</a> in 168BC, the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a> allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly established autonomous <a href="client%20state">client state</a>s that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming <a href="inflation">inflation</a> caused by an increased <a href="money%20supply">money supply</a> from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before the establishment of the <a href="Roman%20province%20of%20Macedonia">Roman province of Macedonia</a>), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.

The reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great witnessed the demise of Classical Greece and the birth of Hellenistic civilization, following the <a href="Hellenization">spread of Greek culture</a> to the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> during and after Alexander's conquests. Macedonians then migrated to Egypt and parts of Asia, but the intensive <a href="colonization">colonization</a> of foreign lands sapped the available manpower in Macedonia proper, weakening the kingdom in its fight with other Hellenistic powers and contributing to its downfall and conquest by the Romans. However, the diffusion of Greek culture and language cemented by Alexander's conquests in West Asia and North Africa served as a "precondition" for the <a href="Mithridatic%20Wars">later Roman expansion</a> into these territories and <a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">entire basis</a> for the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, according to Errington.
The ethnic Macedonian rulers of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid successor states accepted men from all over the Greek world as their "hetairoi" companions and did not foster a national identity like the Antigonids. Modern scholarship has focused on how these Hellenistic successor kingdoms were influenced more by their Macedonian origins than Eastern or southern Greek traditions. While <a href="Spartan%20Constitution">Spartan society</a> remained mostly insular and Athens continued placing <a href="Solonian%20Constitution">strict limitations on acquiring citizenship</a>, the <a href="Cosmopolitanism">cosmopolitan</a> Hellenistic cities of Asia and northeastern Africa bore a greater resemblance to Macedonian cities and contained a mixture of subjects including natives, Greek and Macedonian colonists, and Greek-speaking Hellenized Easterners, many of whom were the product of intermarriage between Greeks and native populations.

The <a href="deification">deification</a> of Macedonian monarchs perhaps began with the death of PhilipII, but it was his son Alexander the Great who unambiguously claimed to be a <a href="Imperial%20cult">living god</a>. Following his visit to the <a href="oracle">oracle</a> of <a href="Didyma">Didyma</a> in 334BC that suggested his divinity, Alexander traveled to the <a href="Oracle%20of%20Ammon">Oracle</a> of <a href="Zeus%20Ammon">Zeus Ammon</a> — the <a href="Interpretatio%20graeca">Greek equivalent</a> of the Egyptian <a href="Amun-Ra">Amun-Ra</a> — at the <a href="Siwa%20Oasis">Siwa Oasis</a> of the <a href="Libyan%20Desert">Libyan Desert</a> in 332BC to confirm his <a href="Sacred%20king">divine status</a>. Although the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires <a href="Ptolemaic%20cult%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">maintained ancestral cults</a> and deified their rulers, kings were not worshiped in the Kingdom of Macedonia. While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks prior to Alexander's reign, particularly at the <a href="Colonies%20in%20antiquity">Greek colony</a> of <a href="Cyrene%2C%20Libya">Cyrene, Libya</a>, Alexander was the first Macedonian monarch to patronize <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">Egyptian</a>, <a href="Persian%20mythology">Persian</a>, and <a href="Babylonian%20religion">Babylonian priesthoods and deities</a>, strengthening the fusion of <a href="Ancient%20Mesopotamian%20religion">Near Eastern</a> and Greek religious beliefs. After his reign, the <a href="Mysteries%20of%20Isis">cult of Isis</a> gradually spread throughout the Hellenistic and <a href="Religion%20in%20ancient%20Rome">Roman world</a>, while beliefs in the Egyptian god <a href="Sarapis">Sarapis</a> were thoroughly Hellenized by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt before the spread of his cult to Macedonia and the Aegean region. The German historian <a href="Johann%20Gustav%20Droysen">Johann Gustav Droysen</a> argued that the conquests of Alexander the Great and creation of the Hellenistic world allowed for the growth and <a href="History%20of%20Christianity">establishment of Christianity</a> in the Roman era.

Honoré de Balzac

Honoré de Balzac (; , born Honoré Balzac, 20 May 1799 – 18 August 1850) was a French novelist and playwright. The <a href="novel%20sequence">novel sequence</a> "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20humaine">La Comédie humaine</a>", which presents a panorama of <a href="Napoleonic%20Era">post-Napoleonic</a> French life, is generally viewed as his "<a href="Masterpiece">magnum opus</a>".

Owing to his keen observation of detail and unfiltered representation of society, Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of <a href="Literary%20realism">realism</a> in <a href="European%20literature">European literature</a>. He is renowned for his multi-faceted characters; even his lesser characters are complex, morally ambiguous and fully human. Inanimate objects are imbued with character as well; the city of <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, a backdrop for much of his writing, takes on many human qualities. His writing influenced many famous writers, including the novelists <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Émile Zola</a>, <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href="Gustave%20Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a>, <a href="Jack%20Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>, and <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>, filmmakers <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>, <a href="%C3%89ric%20Rohmer">Eric Rohmer</a> and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a> as well as important philosophers such as <a href="Friedrich%20Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> and <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>. Many of Balzac's works have been made into films, and they continue to inspire other writers.

An enthusiastic reader and independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble adapting to the teaching style of his <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a>. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions to succeed in the world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a <a href="Law">law office</a>, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. "La Comédie Humaine" reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.

Balzac suffered from health problems throughout his life, possibly due to his intense writing schedule. His relationship with his family was often strained by financial and personal drama, and he lost more than one friend over critical reviews. In 1850, Balzac married <a href="Ewelina%20Ha%C5%84ska">Ewelina Hańska</a>, a Polish aristocrat and his longtime love; he died in Paris five months later.

Honoré de Balzac was born into a family which through its industry and efforts aspired to achieve respectability. His father, born Bernard-François Balssa, was one of eleven children from an artisan family in <a href="Tarn%20%28department%29">Tarn</a>, a region in the south of France. In 1760 he set off for Paris with only a <a href="Louis%20%28coin%29">"Louis" coin</a> in his pocket, intent on improving his <a href="social%20standing">social standing</a>; by 1776 he had become Secretary to the <a href="Conseil%20du%20Roi">King's Council</a> and a <a href="Freemason">Freemason</a> (he had also changed his name to the more noble sounding "Balzac", his son later adding—without official recognition—the <a href="nobiliary%20particle">nobiliary particle</a>: ""de""). After the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> (1793–94), François Balzac was despatched to <a href="Tours">Tours</a> to coordinate supplies for the <a href="French%20Army">Army</a>.

Balzac's mother, born Anne-Charlotte-Laure Sallambier, came from a family of <a href="haberdasher">haberdasher</a>s in Paris. Her family's wealth was a considerable factor in the match: she was eighteen at the time of the wedding, and François Balzac fifty. As the author and literary critic <a href="V.%20S.%20Pritchett">Sir Victor Pritchett</a> explained, "She was certainly drily aware that she had been given to an old husband as a reward for his professional services to a friend of her family and that the capital was on her side. She was not in love with her husband".

Honoré (named after <a href="Honoratus%20of%20Amiens">Saint-Honoré of Amiens</a>, who is commemorated on 16 May, four days before Balzac's birthday) was actually the second child born to the Balzacs; exactly one year previous, Louis-Daniel had been born, but he lived for only a month. Honoré's sisters Laure and Laurence were born in 1800 and 1802, and his younger brother Henry-François in 1807.

As an infant Balzac was sent to a <a href="wet-nurse">wet-nurse</a>; the following year he was joined by his sister Laure and they spent four years away from home. (Although Genevan philosopher <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s influential book "" convinced many mothers of the time to nurse their own children, sending babies to wet-nurses was still common among the middle and upper classes.) When the Balzac children returned home, they were kept at a frosty distance from their parents, which affected the author-to-be significantly. His 1835 novel "<a href="Lily%20of%20the%20Valley%20%28novel%29">Le Lys dans la Vallée</a>" features a cruel governess named Miss Caroline, modeled after his own caregiver.

At age ten Balzac was sent to the <a href="Oratory%20of%20Jesus">Oratorian</a> <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a> in <a href="Vend%C3%B4me">Vendôme</a>, where he studied for seven years. His father, seeking to instill the same hardscrabble work ethic which had gained him the esteem of society, intentionally gave little spending money to the boy. This made him the object of ridicule among his much wealthier schoolmates.

Balzac had difficulty adapting to the <a href="Rote%20learning">rote style</a> of learning at the school. As a result, he was frequently sent to the "alcove", a punishment cell reserved for disobedient students. (The janitor at the school, when asked later if he remembered Honoré, replied: "Remember M. Balzac? I should think I do! I had the honour of escorting him to the dungeon more than a hundred times!") Still, his time alone gave the boy ample freedom to read every book which came his way.

Balzac worked these scenes from his boyhood—as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him—into "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20Humaine">La Comédie Humaine</a>". His time at Vendôme is reflected in "<a href="Louis%20Lambert%20%28novel%29">Louis Lambert</a>", his 1832 novel about a young boy studying at an Oratorian grammar school at Vendôme. The narrator says : "He devoured books of every kind, feeding indiscriminately on religious works, history and literature, philosophy and physics. He had told me that he found indescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books."

Balzac often fell ill, finally causing the headmaster to contact his family with news of a "sort of a coma". When he returned home, his grandmother said: ""Voilà donc comme le collège nous renvoie les jolis que nous lui envoyons!"" ("Look how the academy returns the pretty ones we send them!") Balzac himself attributed his condition to "intellectual congestion", but his extended confinement in the "alcove" was surely a factor. (Meanwhile, his father had been writing a treatise on "the means of preventing thefts and murders, and of restoring the men who commit them to a useful role in society", in which he heaped disdain on prison as a form of crime prevention.)

In 1814 the Balzac family moved to Paris, and Honoré was sent to private tutors and schools for the next two and a half years. This was an unhappy time in his life, during which he attempted suicide on a bridge over the <a href="Loire%20River">Loire River</a>.

In 1816 Balzac entered the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Sorbonne</a>, where he studied under three famous professors: <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Guizot">François Guizot</a>, who later became <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20France">Prime Minister</a>, was Professor of Modern History; <a href="Abel-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Villemain">Abel-François Villemain</a>, a recent arrival from the "Collège Charlemagne", lectured on French and classical literature; and, most influential of all, <a href="Victor%20Cousin">Victor Cousin</a>'s courses on philosophy encouraged his students to think independently.

Once his studies were completed, Balzac was persuaded by his father to follow him into the Law; for three years he trained and worked at the office of Victor Passez, a family friend. During this time Balzac began to understand the vagaries of human nature. In his 1840 novel "Le Notaire", he wrote that a young person in the legal profession sees "the oily wheels of every fortune, the hideous wrangling of heirs over corpses not yet cold, the human heart grappling with the Penal Code."
In 1819 Passez offered to make Balzac his successor, but his apprentice had had enough of the Law. He despaired of being "a clerk, a machine, a riding-school hack, eating and drinking and sleeping at fixed hours. I should be like everyone else. And that's what they call living, that life at the grindstone, doing the same thing over and over again... I am hungry and nothing is offered to appease my appetite". He announced his intention to become a writer.

The loss of this opportunity caused serious discord in the Balzac household, although Honoré was not turned away entirely. Instead, in April 1819 he was allowed to live in the French capital—as English critic <a href="George%20Saintsbury">George Saintsbury</a> describes it—"in a garret furnished in the most Spartan fashion, with a starvation allowance and an old woman to look after him", while the rest of the family moved to a house twenty miles [32 km] outside Paris.

Balzac's first project was a <a href="libretto">libretto</a> for a <a href="comic%20opera">comic opera</a> called "Le Corsaire", based on <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>'s "<a href="The%20Corsair">The Corsair</a>". Realizing he would have trouble finding a composer, however, he turned to other pursuits.

In 1820 Balzac completed the five-act verse tragedy "<a href="Cromwell%20%28tragedy%29">Cromwell</a>". Although it pales by comparison with his later works, some critics consider it a good-quality text. When he finished, Balzac went to <a href="Villeparisis">Villeparisis</a> and read the entire work to his family; they were unimpressed. He followed this effort by starting (but never finishing) three novels: "Sténie", "Falthurne", and "Corsino".

In 1821 Balzac met the enterprising , who convinced the author to write short stories, which Le Poitevin would then sell to publishers. Balzac quickly turned to longer works, and by 1826 he had written nine novels, all published under pseudonyms and often produced in collaboration with other writers. For example, the scandalous novel "Vicaire des Ardennes" (1822)—banned for its depiction of nearly-incestuous relations and, more egregiously, of a married priest—attributed to a "Horace de Saint-Aubin". These books were <a href="potboiler">potboiler</a> novels, designed to sell quickly and titillate audiences. In Saintsbury's view, "they are curiously, interestingly, almost enthrallingly bad". Saintsbury indicates that <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a> tried to dissuade him from reading these early works of Balzac. American critic Samuel Rogers, however, notes that "without the training they gave Balzac, as he groped his way to his mature conception of the novel, and without the habit he formed as a young man of writing under pressure, one can hardly imagine his producing "La Comédie Humaine"". Biographer <a href="Graham%20Robb">Graham Robb</a> suggests that as he discovered the Novel, Balzac discovered himself.

During this time Balzac wrote two pamphlets in support of <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a> and the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a>. The latter, regarding the <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a>s, illustrated his lifelong admiration for the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. In the preface to "La Comédie Humaine" he wrote: "Christianity, above all, Catholicism, being ... a complete system for the repression of the depraved tendencies of man, is the most powerful element of social order".

In the late 1820s Balzac dabbled in several business ventures, a penchant his sister blamed on the temptation of an unknown neighbour. His first enterprise was in publishing which turned out cheap one-volume editions of French classics including the works of <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>. This business failed miserably, with many of the books "sold as waste paper". Balzac had better luck publishing the Memoirs of <a href="Laure%20Junot%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Abrant%C3%A8s">the Duchess of Abrantès</a>, with whom he also had a love affair.

Balzac borrowed money from his family and friends and tried to build a printing business, then a typefounder enterprise. His inexperience and lack of capital caused his ruin in these trades. He gave the businesses to a friend (who made them successful) but carried the debts for many years. As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50,000 francs to his mother.

Balzac never lost his penchant for "une bonne spéculation". It resurfaced painfully later when—as a renowned and busy author—he traveled to <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> in the hopes of reprocessing the <a href="slag">slag</a> from the <a href="History%20of%20mining%20in%20Sardinia%23Roman%20times">Roman mines</a> there. Near the end of his life Balzac was captivated by the idea of cutting of <a href="oak">oak wood</a> in Ukraine and transporting it for sale in France.

After writing several novels, in 1832 Balzac conceived the idea for an enormous series of books that would paint a panoramic portrait of "all aspects of society". The moment the idea came to him, Balzac raced to his sister's apartment and proclaimed: "I am about to become a genius"! Although he originally called it "Etudes des Mœurs" ( literally 'Studies of manners', or 'The Ways of the World ' ) it eventually became known as "La Comédie Humaine", and he included in it all the fiction that he had published in his lifetime under his own name. This was to be Balzac's life work and his greatest achievement.
After the collapse of his businesses, Balzac traveled to <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> and stayed with the De Pommereul family outside <a href="Foug%C3%A8res">Fougères</a>. There he drew inspiration for "<a href="Les%20Chouans">Les Chouans</a>" (1829), a tale of love gone wrong amid the <a href="Chouannerie">Chouan</a> royalist forces. Although Balzac was a supporter of the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Crown</a>, Balzac paints the counter-revolutionaries in a sympathetic light—even though they are the center of the book's most brutal scenes. This was the first book Balzac released under his own name, and it gave him what one critic called "passage into the Promised Land". It established him as an author of note (even if its historical fiction-genre imitates that of <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a>) and provided him with a name outside his past pseudonyms.

Soon afterwards, around the time of his father's death, Balzac wrote "<a href="El%20Verdugo%20%28short%20story%29">El Verdugo</a>"—about a 30-year-old man who kills his father (Balzac was 30 years old at the time). This was the first work signed "Honoré "de" Balzac". He followed his father in the surname Balzac but added the aristocratic-sounding nobiliary particle to help him fit into respected society, a choice based on skill rather than by right. "The aristocracy and authority of talent are more substantial than the aristocracy of names and material power", he wrote in 1830. The timing of the decision was also significant; as Robb explained: "The disappearance of the father coincides with the adoption of the nobiliary particle. A symbolic inheritance." Just as his father had worked his way up from poverty into respectable society, Balzac considered toil and effort his real mark of nobility.

When the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> overthrew <a href="Charles%20X%20of%20France">Charles X</a> in 1830, Balzac declared himself a <a href="Legitimist">Legitimist</a>, supporting King Charles' <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Royal House of Bourbon</a>, but not without qualifications. He felt that the new <a href="July%20Monarchy">July Monarchy</a> (which claimed widespread popular support) was disorganized and unprincipled, in need of a mediator to keep the political peace between the King and insurgent forces. He called for "a young and vigorous man who belongs neither to the Directoire nor to the Empire, but who is 1830 incarnate..." He planned to be such a <a href="candidate">candidate</a>, appealing especially to the higher classes in <a href="Chinon">Chinon</a>. But after a near-fatal accident in 1832 (he slipped and cracked his head on the street), Balzac decided not to stand for election.
1831 saw the success of "<a href="La%20Peau%20de%20chagrin">La Peau de chagrin</a>" ("The Wild Ass's Skin" or "The Magic Skin"), a fable-like tale about a despondent young man named Raphaël de Valentin who finds an animal skin which promises great power and wealth. He obtains these things, but loses the ability to manage them. In the end, his health fails and he is consumed by his own confusion. Balzac meant the story to bear witness to the treacherous turns of life, its "serpentine motion".

In 1833 Balzac released "<a href="Eug%C3%A9nie%20Grandet">Eugénie Grandet</a>", his first best-seller. The tale of a young lady who inherits her father's miserliness, it also became the most critically acclaimed book of his career. The writing is simple, yet the individuals (especially the bourgeois title character) are dynamic and complex. It is followed by "<a href="La%20Duchesse%20de%20Langeais">La Duchesse de Langeais</a>", arguably the most sublime of his novels.

"<a href="Le%20P%C3%A8re%20Goriot">Le Père Goriot</a>" ("Old Father Goriot", 1835) was his next success, in which Balzac transposes the story of "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>" to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The centrality of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but also the fact that he had fathered a child, <a href="Marie-Caroline%20Du%20Fresnay">Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay</a>, with his otherwise-married lover, <a href="Maria%20Du%20Fresnay">Maria Du Fresnay</a>, who had been his source of inspiration for "<a href="Eug%C3%A9nie%20Grandet">Eugénie Grandet</a>".

In 1836 Balzac took the helm of the "Chronique de Paris", a weekly magazine of society and politics. He tried to enforce strict impartiality in its pages and a reasoned assessment of various ideologies. As Rogers notes, "Balzac was interested in any social, political, or economic theory, whether from the right or the left." The magazine failed, but in July 1840 he founded another publication, the "Revue Parisienne". It produced three issues.

These dismal business efforts—and his misadventures in <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>—provided an appropriate "milieu" in which to set the two-volume "<a href="Illusions%20perdues">Illusions perdues</a>" ("Lost Illusions", 1843). The novel concerns Lucien de Rubempré, a young poet trying to make a name for himself, who becomes trapped in the morass of society's darkest contradictions. Lucien's journalistic work is informed by Balzac's own failed ventures in the field. "<a href="Splendeurs%20et%20mis%C3%A8res%20des%20courtisanes">Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes</a>" ("The Harlot High and Low", 1847) continues Lucien's story. He is trapped by the Abbé Herrera (<a href="Vautrin">Vautrin</a>) in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status. The book undergoes a massive temporal rift; the first part (of four) covers a span of six years, while the final two sections focus on just three days.

"<a href="Le%20Cousin%20Pons">Le Cousin Pons</a>" (1847) and "<a href="La%20Cousine%20Bette">La Cousine Bette</a>" (1848) tell the story of "Les Parents Pauvres" ("The Poor Relations"). The conniving and wrangling over wills and inheritances reflect the expertise gained by the author as a young law clerk. Balzac's health was deteriorating by this point, making the completion of this pair of books a significant accomplishment.

Many of his novels were initially serialized, like those of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Dickens</a>. Their length was not predetermined. "Illusions Perdues" extends to a thousand pages after starting inauspiciously in a small-town print shop, whereas "<a href="La%20Fille%20aux%20yeux%20d%27or">La Fille aux yeux d'or</a>" ("The Girl with the Golden Eyes", 1835) opens with a broad panorama of Paris but becomes a closely plotted novella of only fifty pages.

Balzac's work habits are legendary. He wrote from 1 am to 8 am every night and sometimes even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He often worked for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; he claimed to have once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.
Balzac revised obsessively, covering printer's proofs with changes and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during the publication of a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the finished product quite often was different from the original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some—such as "Les employés" ("The Government Clerks", 1841)—are nonetheless noted by critics.

Although Balzac was "by turns a hermit and a vagrant", he managed to stay in tune with the social spheres which nourished his writing. He was friends with <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Théophile Gautier</a> and <a href="Pierre-Marie-Charles%20de%20Bernard%20du%20Grail%20de%20la%20Villette">Pierre-Marie-Charles de Bernard du Grail de la Villette</a>, and he was acquainted with <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>. Nevertheless, he did not spend as much time in "salons" and <a href="Gentlemen%27s%20club">clubs</a> of Paris like many of his characters. "In the first place he was too busy", explains Saintsbury, "in the second he would not have been at home there... [H]e felt it was his business not to frequent society but to create it". However he often spent long periods at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Sach%C3%A9">Château de Saché</a>, near <a href="Tours">Tours</a>, the home of his friend Jean de Margonne, his mother's lover and father to her youngest child. Many of Balzac's tormented characters were conceived in the chateau's small second-floor bedroom. Today the <a href="chateau">chateau</a> is a museum dedicated to the author's life.

In 1833, as he revealed in a letter to his sister, Balzac entered into an illicit affair with fellow writer <a href="Maria%20Du%20Fresnay">Maria Du Fresnay</a>, who was then aged 24. Her marriage to a considerably older man (Charles du Fresnay, Mayor of <a href="Sartrouville">Sartrouville</a>) had been a failure from the outset. In this letter, Balzac also reveals that the young woman had just come to tell him she was pregnant with his child. In 1834, 8 months after the event, <a href="Maria%20Du%20Fresnay">Maria Du Fresnay</a>'s daughter by Balzac, <a href="Marie-Caroline%20Du%20Fresnay">Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay</a>, was born. This revelation from French journalist in 1955 confirmed what was already suspected by several historians: the dedicatee of the novel <a href="Eug%C3%A9nie%20Grandet">Eugénie Grandet</a>, a certain "Maria", turns out to be <a href="Maria%20Du%20Fresnay">Maria Du Fresnay</a> herself.

In February 1832 Balzac received an intriguing letter from <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a>—with no return address and signed simply ""L'Étrangère"" ("The Foreigner")—expressing sadness at the cynicism and atheism in "La Peau de Chagrin" and its negative portrayal of women. His response was to place a <a href="classified%20advertisement">classified advertisement</a> in the "Gazette de France", hoping that his anonymous critic would see it. Thus began a fifteen-year correspondence between Balzac and "the object of [his] sweetest dreams": <a href="Ewelina%20Ha%C5%84ska">Ewelina Hańska</a>.
Ewelina ("née" Rzewuska) was married to a <a href="Szlachta">nobleman</a> twenty years her senior, <a href="Marshal">Marshal</a> <a href="Wac%C5%82aw%20Ha%C5%84ski">Wacław Hański</a>, a wealthy Polish landowner living near <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>. It had been a <a href="marriage%20of%20convenience">marriage of convenience</a> to preserve her <a href="Rzewuski%20family">family</a>'s fortune. In Balzac Countess Ewelina found a kindred spirit for her emotional and social desires, with the added benefit of feeling a connection to the glamorous capital of France. Their correspondence reveals an intriguing balance of passion, propriety and patience; <a href="Graham%20Robb">Robb</a> says it is "like an experimental novel in which the female protagonist is always trying to pull in extraneous realities but which the hero is determined to keep on course, whatever tricks he has to use".

Marshal Hański died in 1841, and his widow and her admirer finally had the chance to pursue their affections. A rival of the Hungarian composer <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, Balzac visited Countess Hańska in <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> in 1843 and won her heart. After a series of financial setbacks, health problems and objections from <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Tsar Nicholas I</a>, the couple finally received permission to wed. On 14 March 1850, with Balzac's health in serious decline, they travelled by carriage from her <a href="family%20seat">family seat</a> at <a href="Park%23Private%20parks">Park</a> in <a href="Volhynian%20Governorate">Volhynia</a> to <a href="St.%20Barbara%27s%20Church%2C%20Berdychiv">St. Barbara's Catholic Church</a> in <a href="Berdychiv">Berdychiv</a> (<a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>'s former banking city in present-day <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>), where they were married by Abbot Ożarowski. The ten-hour journey to and from the ceremony took a toll on both husband and wife: her feet were too swollen to walk, and he endured severe heart trouble.

Although he married late in life, Balzac had already written two treatises on marriage: "Physiologie du Mariage" and "Scènes de la Vie Conjugale". These works lacked firsthand knowledge; Saintsbury points out that "cœlebs cannot talk of [marriage] with much authority". In late April the newly-weds set off for Paris. His health deteriorated on the way, and Ewelina wrote to her daughter about Balzac being "in a state of extreme weakness" and "sweating profusely". They arrived in the French capital on 20 May, his fifty-first birthday.
Five months after his wedding, on Sunday, 18 August 1850, Balzac died in the presence of his mother; <a href="Ewelina%20Ha%C5%84ska">Eve de Balzac ("formerly" Countess Hańska)</a> had gone to bed. He had been visited that day by <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, who later served as a <a href="pallbearer">pallbearer</a> and the <a href="eulogy">eulogist</a> at Balzac's funeral.

Balzac is buried at <a href="Cimeti%C3%A8re%20du%20P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a> in Paris. At his <a href="memorial%20service">memorial service</a>, Victor Hugo pronounced "Today we have people in black because of the death of the man of talent; a nation in mourning for a man of genius". The funeral was attended by "almost every writer in Paris", including <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9rick%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Frédérick Lemaître</a>, <a href="Gustave%20Courbet">Gustave Courbet</a>, <a href="Alexandre%20Dumas%2C%20p%C3%A8re">Dumas "père"</a> and <a href="Alexandre%20Dumas%2C%20fils">Dumas "fils"</a>, as well as representatives of the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a> and other dignitaries.

Later, a <a href="statue">statue</a> (called the <a href="Auguste%20Rodin%23Balzac">Monument à Balzac</a>) was created by the celebrated French sculptor <a href="Auguste%20Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a>. Cast in bronze, the <a href="Monument%20to%20Balzac">Balzac Monument</a> has stood since 1939 nearby the intersection of <a href="Boulevard%20Raspail">Boulevard Raspail</a> and <a href="Boulevard%20Montparnasse">Boulevard Montparnasse</a> at Place Pablo-Picasso. Rodin featured Balzac in several of his smaller sculptures as well.

The "Comédie Humaine" remained unfinished at the time of his death—Balzac had plans to include numerous other books, most of which he never started. He frequently flitted between <a href="work%20in%20progress">works in progress</a>, and "finished articles" were frequently revised between editions. This piecemeal style is reflective of the author's own life, a possible attempt to stabilize it through fiction. "The vanishing man", wrote Sir Victor Pritchett, "who must be pursued from the <a href="Montparnasse">rue Cassini</a> to ... <a href="Versailles%2C%20Yvelines">Versailles</a>, <a href="Ville%20d%27Avray">Ville d'Avray</a>, Italy, and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> can construct a settled dwelling only in his work".

Balzac's extensive use of detail, especially the detail of objects, to illustrate the lives of his characters made him an early pioneer of literary <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a>. While he admired and drew inspiration from the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> style of <a href="List%20of%20Scottish%20novelists">Scottish novelist</a> <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a>, Balzac sought to depict human existence through the use of particulars. In the preface to the first edition of "Scènes de la Vie privée", he wrote: "the author firmly believes that details alone will henceforth determine the merit of works". Plentiful descriptions of décor, clothing, and possessions help breathe life into the characters. For example, Balzac's friend <a href="Henri%20de%20Latouche">Henri de Latouche</a> had a good knowledge of hanging wallpaper. Balzac transferred this to his descriptions of the <a href="Vautrin">Pension Vauquer</a> in "Le Père Goriot", making the wallpaper speak of the identities of those living inside.

Some critics consider Balzac's writing exemplary of <a href="French%20literature%20of%20the%2019th%20century%23Naturalism">naturalism</a>—a more pessimistic and analytical form of realism, which seeks to explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Émile Zola</a> declared Balzac the father of the <a href="Naturalism%20%28literature%29">naturalist novel</a>. Zola indicated that whilst the <a href="Romanticism">Romantics</a> saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.

Balzac sought to present his characters as real people, neither fully good nor fully evil, but completely human. "To arrive at the truth", he wrote in the preface to "<a href="Lily%20of%20the%20Valley%20%28novel%29">Le Lys dans la vallée</a>", "writers use whatever literary device seems capable of giving the greatest intensity of life to their characters". "Balzac's characters", Robb notes, "were as real to him as if he were observing them in the outside world". This reality was noted by playwright <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, who said: "One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of ["Illusions Perdues" protagonist] Lucien de Rubempré... It haunts me in my moments of pleasure. I remember it when I laugh".

At the same time, the characters depict a particular range of social types: the noble soldier, the scoundrel, the proud workman, the fearless spy, the alluring mistress. That Balzac was able to balance the strength of the individual against the representation of the type is evidence of the author's skill. One critic explained that "there is a center and a circumference to Balzac's world".

Balzac's use of repeat characters, moving in and out of the "Comédie"'s books, strengthens the realist representation. "When the characters reappear", notes Rogers, "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see". He also used a realist technique which French novelist <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a> later termed "retrospective illumination", whereby a character's past is revealed long after she or he first appears.
A nearly infinite reserve of energy propels the characters in Balzac's novels. Struggling against the currents of human nature and society, they may lose more often than they win—but only rarely do they give up. This universal trait is a reflection of Balzac's own social wrangling, that of his family, and an interest in the Austrian mystic and physician <a href="Franz%20Mesmer">Franz Mesmer</a>, who pioneered the study of <a href="animal%20magnetism">animal magnetism</a>. Balzac spoke often of a "nervous and fluid force" between individuals, and Raphaël de Valentin's decline in "La Peau de Chagrin" exemplifies the danger of withdrawing from other people's company.

Representations of the city, countryside, and building interiors are essential to Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early <a href="French%20literature%20of%20the%2019th%20century%23Naturalism">naturalist</a>. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. As he did with the people around him, Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes that he had made on previous visits.

The influence of Paris permeates "La Comédie": nature defers to the artificial <a href="metropolis">metropolis</a>, in contrast to descriptions of the weather and wildlife in the <a href="countryside">countryside</a>. "If in Paris", Rogers says, "we are in a man-made region where even the seasons are forgotten, these provincial towns are nearly always pictured in their natural setting". Balzac said, "the streets of Paris possess human qualities and we cannot shake off the impressions they make upon our minds." His labyrinthine city provided a literary model used later by English novelist <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and Russian author <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>. The centrality of Paris in "La Comédie Humaine" is key to Balzac's legacy as a realist. "Realism is nothing if not urban", notes critic <a href="Peter%20Brooks%20%28writer%29">Peter Brooks</a>; the scene of a young man coming into the city to find his fortune is ubiquitous in the realist novel, and appears repeatedly in Balzac's works, such as "<a href="Illusions%20Perdues">Illusions Perdues</a>".

Balzac's literary mood evolved over time from one of despondency and chagrin to that of solidarity and courage—but not optimism. "La Peau de Chagrin", among his earliest novels, is a pessimistic tale of confusion and destruction. But the cynicism declined as his "<a href="wikt%3Aoeuvre">oeuvre</a>" developed, and the characters of "Illusions Perdues" reveal sympathy for those who are pushed to one side by society. As part of the 19th-century evolution of the novel as a "democratic literary form", Balzac wrote that ""les livres sont faits pour tout le monde"" ("books are written for everybody").

Balzac concerned himself overwhelmingly with the darker essence of human nature and the corrupting influence of middle and high societies. His mission was to observe humankind in its most representative state, frequently wandering through the streets "incognito" among the masses of Parisian society to undertake his research. He used incidents from his life and the people around him, in works like "Eugénie Grandet" and "Louis Lambert".

Balzac was a <a href="Legitimism">legitimist</a>; in many ways, his views are the antithesis of <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>'s democratic republicanism. Nevertheless, his keen insight regarding working-class conditions earned him the esteem of many Socialists and Marxists. <a href="Engels">Engels</a> declared that Balzac was his favorite writer. Marx's work "<a href="Das%20Kapital">Das Kapital</a>" also makes constant reference to the works of Balzac and urged Engels to read Balzac's work "<a href="The%20Unknown%20Masterpiece">The Unknown Masterpiece</a>".

Balzac influenced writers of his time and beyond. He has been compared to <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and is considered one of Dickens' significant influences. Literary critic W. H. Helm calls one "the French Dickens" and the other "the English Balzac", while another critic, Richard Lehan, states that "Balzac was the bridge between the comic realism of Dickens and the naturalism of <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Zola</a>".

<a href="Gustave%20Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a> was also substantially influenced by Balzac. Praising his portrayal of society while attacking his <a href="prose">prose</a> style, Flaubert once wrote: "What a man he would have been had he known how to write!" While he disdained the label of "realist", Flaubert clearly took heed of Balzac's close attention to detail and unvarnished depictions of bourgeois life. This influence shows in Flaubert's work "L'éducation sentimentale" which owes a debt to Balzac's "Illusions Perdues". "What Balzac started", observes Lehan, "Flaubert helped finish".

<a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a> similarly learned from the <a href="Literary%20realism">Realist</a> example; he adored Balzac and studied his works carefully, although he criticised what he perceived as Balzac's "vulgarity". Balzac's story "Une Heure de ma Vie" ("An Hour of my Life", 1822), in which minute details are followed by deep personal reflections, is a clear forebear of the style which Proust used in "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Lost%20Time">À la recherche du temps perdu</a>". However, Proust wrote later in life that the contemporary fashion of ranking Balzac higher than Tolstoy was "madness."

Perhaps the author most affected by Balzac was American expatriate novelist <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>. In 1878 James wrote with sadness about the lack of contemporary attention paid to Balzac, and lavished praise on him in four essays (in 1875, 1877, 1902, and 1913). In 1878 James wrote: "Large as Balzac is, he is all of one piece and he hangs perfectly together". He wrote with admiration of Balzac's attempt to portray in writing "a beast with a hundred claws". In his own novels James explored more of the psychological motives of the characters and less of the historical sweep exhibited by Balzac—a conscious style preference; he stated: "the artist of the "Comédie Humaine" is half smothered by the historian". Still, both authors used the form of the realist novel to probe the machinations of society and the myriad motives of human behavior.

<a href="William%20Saroyan">William Saroyan</a> wrote a short story about Balzac in his 1971 book, "<a href="Letters%20from%2074%20rue%20Taitbout">Letters from 74 rue Taitbout</a> or Don't Go But If You Must Say Hello To Everybody".

Balzac's vision of a society in which class, money and personal ambition are the key players has been endorsed by critics of both left-wing and right-wing political persuasions. Marxist <a href="Friedrich%20Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> wrote: "I have learned more [from Balzac] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together". Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as <a href="Walter%20Benjamin">Walter Benjamin</a> and <a href="Camille%20Paglia">Camille Paglia</a>. He was also praised by <a href="James%20Baldwin">James Baldwin</a>, who said 1984: "I’m sure that my life in France would have been very different had I not met Balzac. [He taught me] the way that country and its society works." In 1970 <a href="Roland%20Barthes">Roland Barthes</a> published "<a href="S/Z">S/Z</a>", a detailed analysis of Balzac's story "<a href="Sarrasine">Sarrasine</a>" and a key work in <a href="Structuralism%23Structuralism%20in%20literary%20theory%20and%20literary%20criticism">structuralist</a> literary criticism.
Balzac has also influenced popular culture. Many of his works have been made into popular films and television serials, including: <a href="Travers%20Vale">Travers Vale</a>'s "Père Goriot" (1915), "Les Chouans" (1947), "Le Père Goriot" (1968 BBC mini-series), and "La Cousine Bette" (1974 BBC mini-series, starring <a href="Margaret%20Tyzack">Margaret Tyzack</a> and <a href="Helen%20Mirren">Helen Mirren</a>; 1998 film, starring <a href="Jessica%20Lange">Jessica Lange</a>). Balzac is mentioned to humorous effect in <a href="Meredith%20Willson">Meredith Willson</a>'s musical "<a href="The%20Music%20Man">The Music Man</a>". He is included in <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a>'s 1959 film, "<a href="The%20400%20Blows">The 400 Blows</a>". Truffaut believed Balzac and Proust to be the greatest French writers.

Władysław II Jagiełło

Jogaila (), later Władysław II Jagiełło () (c. 1352/1362 – 1 June 1434) was the <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duke of Lithuania</a> (1377–1434) and then the <a href="King%20of%20Poland">King of Poland</a> (1386–1434), first alongside his wife <a href="Jadwiga%20of%20Poland">Jadwiga</a> until 1399, and then sole King of Poland. He ruled in Lithuania from 1377. Born a <a href="pagan">pagan</a>, in 1386 he converted to Catholicism and was baptized as Władysław in <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>, married the young Queen Jadwiga, and was crowned King of Poland as Władysław II Jagiełło. In 1387 he <a href="Christianization%20of%20Lithuania">converted Lithuania</a> to Christianity. His own reign in Poland started in 1399, upon the death of Queen Jadwiga, and lasted a further thirty-five years and laid the foundation for the centuries-long <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20union">Polish–Lithuanian union</a>. He was a member of the <a href="Jagiellonian%20dynasty">Jagiellonian dynasty</a> in Poland that bears his name and was previously also known as the <a href="Gediminids">Gediminid dynasty</a> in the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>. The dynasty ruled both states until 1572, and became one of the most influential dynasties in late <a href="medieval">medieval</a> and <a href="early%20modern">early modern</a> Central and Eastern Europe. During his reign, the Polish-Lithuanian state was the largest state in the <a href="Christian%20world">Christian world</a>.

Jogaila was the last <a href="pagan">pagan</a> ruler of <a href="medieval%20Lithuania">medieval Lithuania</a>. After he became King of Poland, as a result of the <a href="Union%20of%20Krewo">Union of Krewo</a>, the newly formed Polish-Lithuanian union confronted the growing power of the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>. The allied victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Grunwald">Battle of Grunwald</a> in 1410, followed by the <a href="Peace%20of%20Thorn%20%281411%29">Peace of Thorn</a>, secured the Polish and Lithuanian borders and marked the emergence of the Polish–Lithuanian alliance as a significant force in Europe. The reign of Władysław II Jagiełło extended Polish frontiers and is often considered the beginning of Poland's <a href="Polish%20Golden%20Age">Golden Age</a>.

Little is known of Jogaila's early life, and even his year of birth is uncertain. Previously historians assumed he was born in 1352, but some recent research suggests a later date—about 1362. He was a descendant of the Gediminid dynasty and was the son of <a href="Algirdas">Algirdas</a>, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, <a href="Uliana%20of%20Tver">Uliana of Tver</a>.

The Grand Duchy of Lithuania to which Jogaila succeeded as Grand Duke in 1377 was a political entity composed of two leading, but very different nationalities and two political systems: ethnic Lithuania in the north-west and the vast <a href="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a>n territories of former <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a>, comprising the lands of modern Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of western Russia. At first, Jogaila—like his father—based his rule in the southern and eastern territories of Lithuania, while his uncle, <a href="K%C4%99stutis">Kęstutis</a>, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Trakai">Duke of Trakai</a>, continued to rule the north-western region. Jogaila's succession, however, soon placed this system of dual rule under strain.

At the start of his reign, Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus' lands. In 1377–78, <a href="Andrei%20of%20Polotsk">Andrei of Polotsk</a>, the eldest son of Algirdas, challenged Jogaila's authority and sought to become Grand Duke. In 1380, Andrei and another brother, <a href="Demetrius%20I%20Starshy">Dmitry</a>, sided with Prince <a href="Dmitri%20Donskoi">Dmitri of Moscow</a> against Jogaila's alliance with emir <a href="Mamai">Mamai</a>, de facto khan of the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Golden Horde</a>. Jogaila failed to support Mamai, lingering in the vicinity of the battlefield, which led to Mamai's army's significant defeat at the hands of Prince Dmitri in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kulikovo">Battle of Kulikovo</a>. The Muscovites' Pyrrhic victory over the Golden Horde, in the long term, signified, however, the beginning of a slow climb to power by the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow">Grand Duchy of Moscow</a>, which became within a century the most serious rival and threat to the integrity, well-being and survival of Lithuania. However, in 1380 Muscovy was greatly weakened by tremendous losses suffered during the battle and thus, in the same year, Jogaila was free to begin a struggle for supremacy with Kęstutis.

In the north-west, Lithuania faced constant armed incursions from the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>—founded after 1226 to fight and convert the pagan <a href="Baltic%20tribes">Baltic tribes</a> of <a href="Old%20Prussians">Prussians</a>, <a href="Yotvingians">Yotvingians</a> and <a href="Lithuanians">Lithuanians</a>. In 1380, Jogaila concluded the secret <a href="Treaty%20of%20Dovydi%C5%A1k%C4%97s">Treaty of Dovydiškės</a>, directed against Kęstutis. When Kęstutis discovered the plan, the <a href="Lithuanian%20Civil%20War%20%281381%E2%80%931384%29">Lithuanian Civil War</a> began. He seized Vilnius, overthrew Jogaila, and pronounced himself grand duke in his place. In 1382, Jogaila raised an army from his father's vassals and confronted Kęstutis near Trakai. Kęstutis and his son <a href="Vytautas">Vytautas</a> entered Jogaila's encampment for negotiations but were tricked and imprisoned in the <a href="Kreva%20Castle">Kreva Castle</a>, where Kęstutis was found dead, probably murdered, a week later. Vytautas escaped to the Teutonic fortress of <a href="Ordensburg%20Marienburg">Marienburg</a> and was baptised there under the name Wigand.

Jogaila formulated the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Dubysa">Treaty of Dubysa</a>, which rewarded the Knights for their aid in defeating Kęstutis and Vytautas by promising Christianisation and granting them <a href="Samogitia">Samogitia</a> west of the <a href="Dubysa">Dubysa</a> river. However, when Jogaila failed to ratify the treaty, the Knights invaded Lithuania in the summer of 1383. In 1384, Jogaila reconciled with Vytautas promising to return his patrimony in Trakai. Vytautas then turned against the Knights, attacking and looting several Prussian castles.

Jogaila's Russian mother <a href="Uliana%20of%20Tver">Uliana of Tver</a> urged him to marry Sofia, daughter of <a href="Dmitri%20Donskoi">Prince Dmitri of Moscow</a>, who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy. That option, however, was unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Knights, who regarded <a href="Orthodox%20Christians">Orthodox Christians</a> as schismatics and little better than heathens. Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> and marry the eleven-year-old Queen <a href="Jadwiga%20of%20Poland">Jadwiga of Poland</a>. The nobles of <a href="Lesser%20Poland">Lesser Poland</a> made this offer to Jogaila for many reasons. They wanted to neutralize the dangers posed by Lithuania itself and to secure the fertile territories of <a href="Galicia%E2%80%93Volhynia">Galicia–Volhynia</a>. The Polish nobles saw the offer as an opportunity for increasing their privileges and avoiding Austrian influence, brought by Jadwiga's previous fiancé <a href="William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">William, Duke of Austria</a>.

On 14 August 1385 in <a href="Kreva%20Castle">Kreva Castle</a>, Jogaila confirmed his prenuptial promises in the <a href="Union%20of%20Krewo">Union of Krewo</a> (Union of Kreva). The promises included the adoption of Christianity, repatriation of lands "stolen" from Poland by its neighbours, and "terras suas Lithuaniae et Russiae Coronae Regni Poloniae perpetuo applicare", a clause interpreted by historians to mean anything from a <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a> between Lithuania and Poland to a complete incorporation of Lithuania into Poland. The agreement at Kreva has been described both as far-sighted and as a desperate gamble.

Jogaila was duly baptised at the <a href="Wawel%20Cathedral">Wawel Cathedral</a> in <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a> on 15 February 1386 and from then on formally used the name Władysław or Latin versions of it. The marriage took place three days later, and on 4 March 1386 Jogaila was crowned King Władysław by archbishop <a href="Bodzanta">Bodzanta</a>. He was also to be legally adopted by Jadwiga's mother, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bosnia">Elizabeth of Bosnia</a>, so retaining the throne in the event of Jadwiga's death. The royal baptism triggered the conversion of most of Jogaila's court and noblemen, as well as mass baptisms in Lithuanian rivers, a beginning of the final <a href="Christianization%20of%20Lithuania">Christianization of Lithuania</a>. Though the ethnic <a href="Lithuanian%20nobility">Lithuanian nobility</a> were the main converts to Catholicism—both paganism and the Orthodox rite remained strong among the peasants—the king's conversion and its political implications created lasting repercussions for the history of both Lithuania and Poland.

Władysław II Jagiello and Queen Jadwiga reigned as co-monarchs; and though Jadwiga probably had little real power, she took an active part in Poland's political and cultural life. In 1387, she led two successful military expeditions to <a href="Red%20Ruthenia">Red Ruthenia</a>, recovered lands her father <a href="Louis%20I%20of%20Hungary">Louis I of Hungary</a> had transferred from Poland to Hungary, and secured the homage of <a href="Petru%20I%20of%20Moldavia">Petru I, Voivode of Moldavia</a>. In 1390, she also personally opened negotiations with the Teutonic Order. Most political responsibilities, however, fell to Jagiello, with Jadwiga attending to the cultural and charitable activities for which she is still revered.

Soon after Jagiello's accession to the Polish throne, Jagiello granted <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> a city charter like that of <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>, modeled on the <a href="Magdeburg%20Law">Magdeburg Law</a>; and Vytautas issued a privilege to a Jewish commune of <a href="Trakai">Trakai</a> on almost the same terms as privileges issued to the Jews of Poland in the reigns of <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20the%20Pious">Boleslaus the Pious</a> and <a href="Casimir%20the%20Great">Casimir the Great</a>. Władysław's policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial and uneven at first but achieved a lasting influence. By the time of the <a href="Union%20of%20Lublin">Union of Lublin</a> in 1569, there was not much difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland.

One effect of Jagiello's measures was to be the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian identity in the fifteenth century.

Jagiello's baptism failed to end the <a href="crusade">crusade</a> of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his conversion was a sham, perhaps even a heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that <a href="pagan">pagan</a>s remained in Lithuania. From then on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain the cause of a crusade and faced the growing threat to its existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance. Władysław sponsored the creation of the <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20Vilnius">diocese of Vilnius</a> under <a href="bishop%20of%20Vilnius">bishop</a> <a href="Andrzej%20Wasilko">Andrzej Wasilko</a>, the former confessor of <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Hungary">Elisabeth of Hungary</a>. The bishopric, which included Samogitia, then largely controlled by the Teutonic Order, was subordinated to the see of <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a> and not to that of Teutonic <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>. The decision may not have improved Władysław's relations with the Order, but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland, enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart.

In 1389, Władysław's rule in Lithuania faced a revived challenge from Vytautas, who resented the power given to <a href="Skirgaila">Skirgaila</a> in Lithuania at the expense of his own patrimony. Vytautas started a <a href="Lithuanian%20Civil%20War%20%281389%E2%80%931392%29">civil war in Lithuania</a>, aiming to become the Grand Duke. On 4 September 1390, the joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Grand Master, <a href="Konrad%20von%20Wallenrode">Konrad von Wallenrode</a>, laid siege to Vilnius, which was held by Władysław's regent Skirgaila with combined Polish, Lithuanian and Ruthenian troops. Although the Knights lifted the siege of the castle after a month, they reduced much of the outer city to ruins. This bloody conflict was eventually brought to a temporary halt in 1392 with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ostr%C3%B3w">Treaty of Ostrów</a>, by which Władysław handed over the government of Lithuania to his cousin in exchange for peace: Vytautas was to rule Lithuania as the Grand Duke ("magnus dux") until his death, under the overlordship of the Supreme Duke ("dux supremus") in the person of the Polish monarch. Skirgaila was moved from the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Trakai">Duchy of Trakai</a> to become prince of Kiev. Vytautas initially accepted his status but soon began to pursue Lithuania's independence from Poland.

The protracted period of war between the Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights was ended on 12 October 1398 by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Salynas">Treaty of Salynas</a>, named after the islet in the <a href="Neman%20River">Neman River</a> where it was signed. Lithuania agreed to cede Samogitia and assist the Teutonic Order in a campaign to seize <a href="Pskov">Pskov</a>, while the Order agreed to assist Lithuania in a campaign to seize <a href="Novgorod">Novgorod</a>. Shortly afterwards, Vytautas was crowned as a king by local nobles; but the following year his forces and those of his ally, Khan <a href="Tokhtamysh">Tokhtamysh</a> of the <a href="White%20Horde">White Horde</a>, were crushed by the <a href="Timurid%20Dynasty">Timurids</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Vorskla%20River">Battle of the Vorskla River</a>, ending his imperial ambitions in the east and obliging him to submit to Władysław's protection once more.

On 22 June 1399, Jadwiga gave birth to a daughter, baptised <a href="Elizabeth%20Bonifacia%20of%20Poland">Elizabeth Bonifacia</a>, but within a month the mother and daughter died, leaving Władysław sole ruler of the Kingdom of Poland and without an heir nor much legitimacy to rule the kingdom. Jadwiga's death undermined Władysław's right to the throne, and as a result old conflicts between the nobility of <a href="Lesser%20Poland">Lesser Poland</a>, generally sympathetic to Władysław, and the gentry of <a href="Greater%20Poland">Greater Poland</a> began to surface. In 1402, Władysław answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying <a href="Anna%20of%20Celje">Anna of Celje</a>, a granddaughter of <a href="Casimir%20III%20of%20Poland">Casimir III of Poland</a>, a political match that re-legitimised his reign.

The <a href="Union%20of%20Vilnius%20and%20Radom">Union of Vilnius and Radom</a> of 1401 confirmed the status of Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław's overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian <a href="boyar">boyar</a>s were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, the implications of the union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent <a href="defensive%20alliance">defensive alliance</a> between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania.

In late 1401, the new war against the Order overstretched the resources of the Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of Władysław's brothers, the malcontent <a href="%C5%A0vitrigaila">Švitrigaila</a>, chose this moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke. On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in <a href="Malbork">Marienburg</a>, where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.

The war ended in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Raci%C4%85%C5%BC">Treaty of Raciąż</a> on 22 May 1404. Władysław acceded to the formal cession of Samogitia and agreed to support the Order's designs on <a href="Pskov">Pskov</a>; in return, <a href="Konrad%20von%20Jungingen">Konrad von Jungingen</a> undertook to sell Poland the disputed <a href="Dobrzy%C5%84%20Land">Dobrzyń Land</a> and the town of <a href="Z%C5%82otoryja">Złotoryja</a>, once pawned to the Order by <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Opolski">Władysław Opolski</a>, and to support Vytautas in a revived attempt on <a href="Novgorod">Novgorod</a>. Both sides had practical reasons for signing the treaty at that point: the Order needed time to fortify its newly acquired lands, the Poles and Lithuanians to deal with territorial challenges in the east and in <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>.

Also in 1404, Władysław held talks at <a href="Wroc%C5%82aw">Vratislav</a> with <a href="Wenceslaus%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Romans">Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia</a>, who offered to return Silesia to Poland if Władysław supported him in his power struggle within the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. Władysław turned the deal down with the agreement of both Polish and Silesian nobles, unwilling to burden himself with new military commitments in the west.

In December 1408, Władysław and Vytautas held strategic talks in <a href="Navahrudak%20Castle">Navahrudak Castle</a>, where they decided to foment a <a href="Samogitian%20uprising">Samogitian uprising</a> against Teutonic rule to draw German forces away from <a href="Pomerelia">Pomerelia</a>. Władysław promised to repay Vytautas for his support by restoring Samogitia to Lithuania in any future peace treaty. The uprising, which began in May 1409, at first provoked little reaction from the Knights, who had not yet consolidated their rule in Samogitia by building castles; but by June their diplomats were busy lobbying Władysław's court at <a href="Oborniki">Oborniki</a>, warning his nobles against Polish involvement in a war between Lithuania and the Order. Władysław, however, bypassed his nobles and informed new Grand Master <a href="Ulrich%20von%20Jungingen">Ulrich von Jungingen</a> that if the Knights acted to suppress Samogitia, Poland would intervene. This stung the Order into issuing a declaration of war against Poland on 6 August, which Władysław received on 14 August in <a href="Nowy%20Korczyn">Nowy Korczyn</a>.

The castles guarding the northern border were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at Złotoryja, <a href="Dobrzy%C5%84%20nad%20Wis%C5%82%C4%85">Dobrzyń</a> and <a href="Bobrowniki">Bobrowniki</a>, the capital of Dobrzyń Land, while German burghers invited them into <a href="Bydgoszcz">Bydgoszcz</a> (German: Bromberg). Władysław arrived on the scene in late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came to terms with the Order on 8 October. During the winter, the two armies prepared for a major confrontation. Władysław installed a strategic supply depot at <a href="P%C5%82ock">Płock</a> in <a href="Masovia">Masovia</a> and had a <a href="pontoon%20bridge">pontoon bridge</a> constructed and transported north down the <a href="Vistula">Vistula</a>.

Meanwhile, both sides unleashed diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched letters to the monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens; Władysław countered with his own letters to the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. <a href="Wenceslaus%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Romans">Wenceslas IV of Bohemia</a> signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund of Luxembourg</a>, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.

When the war resumed in June 1410, Władysław advanced into the Teutonic heartland at the head of an army of about 20,000 mounted nobles, 15,000 armed commoners, and 2,000 professional cavalry mainly hired from Bohemia. After crossing the Vistula over the pontoon bridge at <a href="Czerwi%C5%84sk">Czerwińsk</a>, his troops met up with those of <a href="Vytautas">Vytautas</a>, whose 11,000 light cavalry included Lithuanians, Ruthenians, and <a href="Tatars">Tatars</a>. The Teutonic Order's army numbered about 18,000 cavalry, mostly Germans, and 5,000 infantry. On 15 July, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Grunwald">Battle of Grunwald</a> after one of the largest and most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages, the allies won a victory so overwhelming that the Teutonic Order's army was virtually annihilated, with most of its key commanders killed in combat, including Grand Master <a href="Ulrich%20von%20Jungingen">Ulrich von Jungingen</a> and Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode. Thousands of troops were reported to have been slaughtered on either side.

The road to the Teutonic capital <a href="Malbork">Marienburg</a> now lay open, the city undefended; but for reasons the sources do not explain, Władysław hesitated to pursue his advantage. On 17 July, his army began a laboured advance, arriving at Marienburg only on 25 July, by which time the new Grand Master, <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Plauen">Heinrich von Plauen</a>, had organised a defence of the fortress. The apparent half-heartedness of the ensuing siege, called off by Władysław on 19 September, has been ascribed variously to the impregnability of the fortifications, to high casualty figures among the Lithuanians, to Władysław's unwillingness to risk further casualties, or to his desire to keep the Order weakened but undefeated as to not upset the balance of power between Poland (which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if it was totally defeated) and Lithuania; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation.

The war ended in 1411 with the <a href="Peace%20of%20Thorn%20%281411%29">Peace of Thorn</a>, in which neither Poland nor Lithuania drove home their negotiating advantage to the full, much to the discontent of the Polish nobles. Poland regained <a href="Dobrzy%C5%84%20Land">Dobrzyń Land</a>, Lithuania regained Samogitia, and Masovia regained a small territory beyond the <a href="Wkra">Wkra</a> river. Most of the Teutonic Order's territory, however, including towns that had surrendered, remained intact. Władysław then proceeded to release many high-ranking Teutonic Knights and officials for apparently modest ransoms. The cumulative expense of the ransoms, however, proved a drain on the Order's resources. This failure to exploit the victory to his nobles' satisfaction provoked growing opposition to Władysław's regime after 1411, further fuelled by the granting of <a href="Podolia">Podolia</a>, disputed between Poland and Lithuania, to Vytautas, and by the king's two-year absence in Lithuania.

In an effort to outflank his critics, Władysław promoted the leader of the opposing faction, bishop <a href="Miko%C5%82aj%20Tr%C4%85ba">Mikołaj Trąba</a>, to the archbishopric of <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a> in autumn 1411 and replaced him in Kraków with <a href="Wojciech%20Jastrz%C4%99biec">Wojciech Jastrzębiec</a>, a supporter of Vytautas. He also sought to create more allies in Lithuania. In the <a href="Union%20of%20Horod%C5%82o">Union of Horodło</a>, signed on 2 October 1413, he decreed that the status of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was "tied to our Kingdom of Poland permanently and irreversibly" and granted the Catholic nobles of Lithuania privileges equal to those of the Polish <a href="szlachta">szlachta</a>. The act included a clause prohibiting the Polish nobles from electing a monarch without the consent of the Lithuanian nobles, and the Lithuanian nobles from electing a grand duke without the consent of the Polish monarch.

In 1414, a sporadic new war broke out, known as the "<a href="Hunger%20War">Hunger War</a>" from the Knights' <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched-earth</a> tactics of burning fields and mills; but both the Knights and the Lithuanians were too exhausted from the previous war to risk a major battle, and the fighting petered out in the autumn. Hostilities did not flare up again until 1419, during the <a href="Council%20of%20Constance">Council of Constance</a>, when they were called off at the papal legate's insistence.

The Council of Constance proved a turning point in the Teutonic crusades, as it did for several European conflicts. Vytautas sent a delegation in 1415, including the <a href="metropolitan%20of%20Kiev">metropolitan of Kiev</a> and Samogitian witnesses; they arrived at Constance at the end of that year to express their preference for being "baptised with water and not with blood". The Polish envoys, among them <a href="Miko%C5%82aj%20Tr%C4%85ba">Mikołaj Trąba</a>, <a href="Zawisza%20Czarny">Zawisza Czarny</a>, and <a href="Pawe%C5%82%20W%C5%82odkowic">Paweł Włodkowic</a>, lobbied for an end to the forced conversion of heathens and to the Order's aggression against Lithuania and Poland. As a result of the Polish–Lithuanian diplomacy, the council, though scandalised by Włodkowic's questioning of the legitimacy of the monastic state, denied the Order's request for a further crusade and instead entrusted the conversion of the Samogitians to Poland–Lithuania.

The diplomatic context at Constance included the revolt of the Bohemian <a href="Hussite">Hussite</a>s, who looked upon Poland as an ally in their wars against <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund</a>, the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to Władysław on condition that he accept the religious principles of the <a href="Four%20Articles%20of%20Prague">Four Articles of Prague</a>, which he was not prepared to do. After Władysław's refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, Władysław's nephew, <a href="Sigismund%20Korybut">Sigismund Korybut</a>, attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success. Vytautas accepted Sigismund's offer of a royal crown in 1429 — apparently with Władysław's blessing — but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled.

In 1422, Władysław fought another war, known as the <a href="Gollub%20War">Gollub War</a>, against the Teutonic Order, defeating them in under two months before the Order's imperial reinforcements had time to arrive. The resulting <a href="Treaty%20of%20Melno">Treaty of Melno</a> ended the Knights' claims to Samogitia once and for all and defined a permanent border between Prussia and Lithuania. Lithuania was given the province of Samogitia, with the port of <a href="Palanga">Palanga</a>, but the city of <a href="Klaip%C4%97da">Klaipėda</a> was left to the Order. This border remained largely unchanged for roughly 500 years, until 1920. The terms of this treaty have, however, been seen as turning a Polish victory into defeat, as a result of Władysław's renunciation of Polish claims to Pomerania, Pomerelia, and <a href="Che%C5%82mno%20Land">Chełmno Land</a>, for which he received only the town of <a href="Nieszawa">Nieszawa</a> in return. The Treaty of Melno closed a chapter in the Knights' wars with Lithuania but did little to settle their long-term issues with Poland. Further <a href="Polish-Teutonic%20War%20%281431%E2%80%931435%29">sporadic warfare</a> broke out between Poland and the Knights between 1431 and 1435.

Cracks in the cooperation between Poland and Lithuania after the death of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. Władysław supported his brother <a href="%C5%A0vitrigaila">Švitrigaila</a> as grand duke of Lithuania, but when Švitrigaila, with the support of the Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles, rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop <a href="Zbigniew%20Ole%C5%9Bnicki%20%28cardinal%29">Zbigniew Oleśnicki</a> of Kraków, occupied <a href="Podolia">Podolia</a>, which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and <a href="Volhynia">Volhynia</a>. In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas's brother <a href="Sigismund%20Kestutaitis">Žygimantas</a> as grand duke, leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław's death.

Władysław's second wife, Anna of Celje, had died in 1416, leaving a daughter, <a href="Jadwiga%20of%20Lithuania">Jadwiga</a>. In 1417, Władysław married <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Pilica">Elisabeth of Pilica</a>, who died in 1420 without bearing him a child, and two years later, <a href="Sophia%20of%20Halshany">Sophia of Halshany</a> (niece of <a href="Uliana%20Olshanska">Uliana Olshanska</a>), who bore him two surviving sons. The death in 1431 of his daughter Jadwiga, the last heir of Piast blood, released Władysław to make his sons by Sophia of Halshany his heirs, though he had to sweeten the Polish nobles with concessions to ensure their agreement, since the monarchy was elective.

During an excursion into <a href="Przemy%C5%9Bl%20Land">Przemyśl Land</a> in the 48th year of his reign, Władysław caught a cold from which he was unable to recover. He finally died in <a href="Grodek%20Jagiellonski">Grodek</a> in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, <a href="Wladyslaw%20III%20of%20Poland">Władysław III</a>, and Lithuania to his younger, <a href="Casimir%20IV%20Jagiellon">Casimir</a>, both still minors at the time. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken for granted. Władysław's death ended the personal union between the two realms, and it was not clear what would take its place.

The Dark Side of the Moon

The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by English <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, released on 1 March 1973 by <a href="Harvest%20Records">Harvest Records</a>. Primarily developed during live performances, the band premiered an early version of the record several months before recording began. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> in London.

The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work. A <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>, its themes explore conflict, greed, time, death, and <a href="Mental%20disorder">mental illness</a>, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating health of founding member <a href="Syd%20Barrett">Syd Barrett</a>, who departed the group in 1968. The group used advanced recording techniques at the time, including <a href="multitrack%20recording">multitrack recording</a>, <a href="tape%20loop">tape loop</a>s, and <a href="Analog%20synthesizer">analogue synthesizers</a>. Snippets from interviews with the band's <a href="road%20crew">road crew</a>, as well as philosophical quotations, were also used. Engineer <a href="Alan%20Parsons">Alan Parsons</a> was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer <a href="Clare%20Torry">Clare Torry</a>, who appears on "<a href="The%20Great%20Gig%20in%20the%20Sky">The Great Gig in the Sky</a>". The iconic sleeve, which depicts a <a href="Prism%20spectrometer">prism spectrum</a>, was designed by <a href="Storm%20Thorgerson">Storm Thorgerson</a>, following <a href="keyboardist">keyboardist</a> <a href="Richard%20Wright%20%28musician%29">Richard Wright</a>'s request for a "simple and bold" design, representing the band's lighting and the record's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: "<a href="Money%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Money</a>" and "<a href="Us%20and%20Them%20%28song%29">Us and Them</a>". 

"The Dark Side of the Moon" received critical acclaim upon release, and has since been hailed by critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. The record reached number one on the US "<a href="Billboard%20200">Billboard 200</a>", and has charted for over 900 weeks in total. With estimated sales of over 45 million copies, it is Pink Floyd's best seller, and one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20albums">best-selling albums worldwide</a>. The record helped to propel Pink Floyd to international fame, bringing wealth and recognition to all four of its members. It has been <a href="Remaster">remastered</a> and re-released on several occasions, most recently for digital distribution.

Following "<a href="Meddle">Meddle</a>" in 1971, <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. In a band meeting at drummer <a href="Nick%20Mason">Nick Mason</a>'s home in <a href="Camden%20Town">Camden</a>, bassist <a href="Roger%20Waters">Roger Waters</a> proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member <a href="Syd%20Barrett">Syd Barrett</a>. The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's <a href="The%20Man%20and%20The%20Journey">"The Man" and "The Journey"</a>. In an interview for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", guitarist <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a> said: "I think we all thought – and Roger definitely thought – that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific."
Generally, all four members agreed that Waters' album concept unified by a single theme was a good idea. Waters, Gilmour, Mason and keyboardist <a href="Richard%20Wright%20%28musician%29">Richard Wright</a> participated in the writing and <a href="Record%20producer">production</a> of the new material, and Waters created the early <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo tracks</a> at his <a href="Islington">Islington</a> home in a small studio built in his garden shed. Parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of "<a href="Breathe%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Breathe</a>" came from an earlier work by Waters and <a href="Ron%20Geesin">Ron Geesin</a>, written for the soundtrack of "<a href="Music%20from%20The%20Body">The Body</a>", and the basic structure of "<a href="Us%20and%20Them%20%28song%29">Us and Them</a>" borrowed from an original composition by Wright for "<a href="Zabriskie%20Point%20%28film%29">Zabriskie Point</a>". The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, and then at the <a href="Rainbow%20Theatre">Rainbow Theatre</a> in <a href="Finsbury%20Park">Finsbury Park</a>, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a <a href="Public%20address%20system">PA system</a>, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel <a href="Quadraphonic%20sound">quadraphonic</a> output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three <a href="Truck">lorries</a>; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour. The album had been given the provisional title of "Dark Side of the Moon" (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). However, after discovering that that title had already been used by another band, <a href="Medicine%20Head">Medicine Head</a>, it was temporarily changed to "Eclipse". The new material premièred at <a href="Brighton%20Dome">The Dome</a> in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference.
"Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics", as it was then known, was performed in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 – more than a year before its release – at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described the piece as "bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning." <a href="Derek%20Jewell">Derek Jewell</a> of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" wrote "The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast." "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" was less enthusiastic: "Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo." The following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed in the same order in which it was eventually recorded; differences included the lack of synthesizers in tracks such as "<a href="On%20the%20Run%20%28instrumental%29">On the Run</a>", and <a href="Bible">Bible</a> readings replaced by <a href="Clare%20Torry">Clare Torry</a>'s vocals on "<a href="The%20Great%20Gig%20in%20the%20Sky">The Great Gig in the Sky</a>".

Pink Floyd's <a href="Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon%20Tour">lengthy tour</a> through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make continual improvements to the scale and quality of their performances. Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band travelled to France and recorded music for French director <a href="Barbet%20Schroeder">Barbet Schroeder</a>'s film "<a href="La%20Vall%C3%A9e%20%28film%29">La Vallée</a>". They then performed in Japan and returned to France in March to complete work on the film. After a series of dates in North America, the band flew to London to begin recording, from 24 May to 25 June. More concerts in Europe and North America followed before the band returned on 9 January 1973 to complete the album.

"The Dark Side of the Moon" built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions which, according to critic <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a>, had become characteristic of the band after founding member Syd Barrett left in 1968. Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as "that psychedelic noodling stuff", and with Waters cited 1971's "Meddle" as a turning-point towards what would be realised on the album. "The Dark Side of the Moon"s lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death, and insanity, the latter inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state. The album contains <a href="musique%20concr%C3%A8te">musique concrète</a> on several tracks.

Each side of the album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience, and (according to Waters) "empathy". "<a href="Speak%20to%20Me">Speak to Me</a>" and "Breathe" together stress the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life – "Don't be afraid to care". By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesizer-driven instrumental "On the Run" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying. "<a href="Time%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Time</a>" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane aspects; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in "<a href="Breathe%20%28Reprise%29">Breathe (Reprise)</a>". The first side of the album ends with Wright and vocalist <a href="Clare%20Torry">Clare Torry</a>'s soulful metaphor for death, "The Great Gig in the Sky". 

Opening with the sound of <a href="cash%20register">cash register</a>s and loose change, the first track on side two, "<a href="Money%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Money</a>", mocks greed and <a href="consumerism">consumerism</a> using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related <a href="sound%20effect">sound effect</a>s. "Money" became the most commercially successful track, and has been covered by several acts. "Us and Them" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of <a href="emotional%20conflict">conflict</a> and the use of simple <a href="Dichotomy">dichotomies</a> to describe personal relationships. "<a href="Any%20Colour%20You%20Like">Any Colour You Like</a>" concerns the lack of choice one has in a human society. "<a href="Brain%20Damage%20%28song%29">Brain Damage</a>" looks at a <a href="mental%20illness">mental illness</a> resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line "and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes" reflects the mental breakdown of former bandmate Syd Barrett. The album ends with "<a href="Eclipse%20%28song%29">Eclipse</a>", which espouses the concepts of <a href="alterity">alterity</a> and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.

The album was recorded at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a>, in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973. The band were assigned staff engineer <a href="Alan%20Parsons">Alan Parsons</a>, who had worked as assistant tape operator on "<a href="Atom%20Heart%20Mother">Atom Heart Mother</a>", and who had also gained experience as a recording engineer on <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>" and "<a href="Let%20It%20Be">Let It Be</a>". The recording sessions made use of some of the most advanced studio techniques of the time; the studio was capable of <a href="Multitrack%20recording">16-track</a> mixes, which offered a greater degree of flexibility than the eight- or four-track mixes they had previously used, although the band often used so many tracks that to make more space available second-generation copies were made.

Beginning on 1 June, the first track to be recorded was "Us and Them", followed six days later by "Money". Waters had created <a href="Sound%20effect">effects</a> <a href="Tape%20loop">loops</a> from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio, and these were later re-recorded to take advantage of the band's decision to record a <a href="Quadraphonic%20sound">quadraphonic</a> mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders). "Time" and "The Great Gig in the Sky" were the next pieces to be recorded, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US. The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal F.C.</a>, would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch "<a href="Monty%20Python%27s%20Flying%20Circus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a>" on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point. Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: "We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on."
Returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded "Brain Damage", "Eclipse", "Any Colour You Like" and "On the Run", while fine-tuning the work they had already laid down in the previous sessions. A foursome of female vocalists was assembled to sing on "Brain Damage", "Eclipse" and "Time", and saxophonist <a href="Dick%20Parry">Dick Parry</a> was booked to play on "Us and Them" and "Money". With director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for "". Once the recording sessions were complete, the band began a tour of Europe.

The album features metronomic sound effects during "Speak to Me", and tape loops opening "Money". Mason created a rough version of "Speak to Me" at his home, before completing it in the studio. The track serves as an <a href="overture">overture</a> and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album. A piano chord, replayed backwards, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of "Breathe". Mason received a rare solo composing credit for "Speak to Me".

The sound effects on "Money" were created by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which were used to create a <a href="beat%20%28music%29">7-beat</a> <a href="tape%20loop">effects loop</a> (later adapted to four tracks in order to create a "walk around the room" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album). At times the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and band to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled <a href="multitrack%20recording">multitrack recording</a>s of several of the songs (particularly "On the Run").

Along with the conventional <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s to their sound. For example, the band experimented with an <a href="EMS%20VCS%203">EMS VCS 3</a> on "<a href="Brain%20Damage%20%28song%29">Brain Damage</a>" and "Any Colour You Like", and a <a href="EMS%20Synthi%20A">Synthi A</a> on "Time" and "On the Run". They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as an assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during "On the Run"), and a specially treated <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a> made to simulate a human <a href="Heart%20rate">heartbeat</a> (during "Speak to Me", "On the Run", "Time" and "Eclipse"). This heartbeat is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on "Time" and "On the Run". "Time" features assorted clocks ticking, then chiming simultaneously at the start of the song, accompanied by a series of <a href="Rototom">Rototom</a>s. The recordings were initially created as a quadraphonic test by Parsons, who recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop. Although these recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of this material were eventually used in the track.
Several tracks, including "Us and Them" and "Time", demonstrated Richard Wright's and David Gilmour's ability to harmonise their voices. In the 2003 <a href="Classic%20Albums">Classic Albums</a> documentary "The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon", Waters attributed this to the fact that their voices sounded extremely similar. To take advantage of this, Parsons utilised studio techniques such as the <a href="double%20tracking">double tracking</a> of vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself. The engineer also made prominent use of <a href="flanging">flanging</a> and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with <a href="reverberation">reverb</a>, and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the <a href="quadraphonic">quadraphonic</a> mix of "On the Run", when the sound of the <a href="Hammond%20organ%23Console%20organs">Hammond B3</a> organ played through a <a href="Leslie%20speaker">Leslie speaker</a> rapidly swirls around the listener).

The album's credits include <a href="Clare%20Torry">Clare Torry</a>, a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road. She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition "The Great Gig in the Sky". She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a> perform at the <a href="Hammersmith%20Odeon">Hammersmith Odeon</a>, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do. Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band – only to find them delighted with her performance. Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. For her contribution she was paid £30, equivalent to about £ in 2019. In 2004, she sued <a href="EMI">EMI</a> and Pink Floyd for 50% of the songwriting <a href="royalties">royalties</a>, arguing that her contribution to "The Great Gig in the Sky" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, with all post-2005 pressings crediting Wright and Torry jointly.

Snippets of voices between and over the music are another notable feature of the album. During recording sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on <a href="flashcard">flashcard</a>s. The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3, and shown such questions as "What's your favourite colour?" and "What's your favourite food?", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death). Questions such as "When was the last time you were violent?", followed immediately by "Were you in the right?", were answered in the order they were presented. Roger "The Hat" Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid. Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied "... give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock ..." When asked about death he responded "live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me ..." Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: "I've been mad for fucking years – absolutely years". The band's road manager <a href="Peter%20Watts%20%28road%20manager%29">Peter Watts</a> (father of actress <a href="Naomi%20Watts">Naomi Watts</a>) contributed the repeated laughter during "Brain Damage" and "Speak to Me". His second wife, Patricia "Puddie" Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the "geezer" who was "cruisin' for a bruisin used in the segue between "Money" and "Us and Them", and the words "I never said I was frightened of dying" heard halfway through "The Great Gig in the Sky".

Perhaps the most notable responses "I am not frightened of dying. Any time will do: I don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it – you've got to go sometime" and closing words "there is no dark side in the moon, really. As a matter of fact it's all dark" came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll. <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul</a> and <a href="Linda%20McCartney">Linda McCartney</a> were also interviewed, but their answers were judged to be "trying too hard to be funny", and were not included on the album. McCartney's <a href="Wings%20%28band%29">Wings</a> bandmate <a href="Henry%20McCullough">Henry McCullough</a> contributed the line "I don't know, I was really drunk at the time".

Following the completion of the dialogue sessions, producer <a href="Chris%20Thomas%20%28record%20producer%29">Chris Thomas</a> was hired to provide "a fresh pair of ears". Thomas's background was in music, rather than engineering. He had worked with Beatles producer <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a>, and was acquainted with Pink Floyd's manager <a href="Steve%20O%27Rourke">Steve O'Rourke</a>. All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a "dry" and "clean" mix which made more use of the non-musical elements, and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more "echoey" mix. Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating "There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out. It was a very creative atmosphere. A lot of fun." Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas's intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product. Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on "Us and Them". He was also present for the recording of "The Great Gig in the Sky" (although Parsons was responsible for hiring Torry). Interviewed in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio, Waters said:

The album was originally released in a <a href="gatefold">gatefold</a> LP sleeve designed by <a href="Hipgnosis">Hipgnosis</a> and <a href="George%20Hardie%20%28artist%29">George Hardie</a>. Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for "<a href="Atom%20Heart%20Mother">Atom Heart Mother</a>" and "<a href="Obscured%20by%20Clouds">Obscured by Clouds</a>", as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. Designers <a href="Storm%20Thorgerson">Storm Thorgerson</a> and <a href="Aubrey%20Powell%20%28designer%29">Aubrey Powell</a> were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band. For "The Dark Side of the Moon", Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something "smarter, neater – more classy". The design was inspired by a photograph of a prism with a colour beam projected through it that Thorgerson had found in a photography book.

The artwork was created by their associate, George Hardie. Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of seven designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best. The final design depicts a glass <a href="prism">prism</a> dispersing light into colour. The design represents three elements: the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright's request for a "simple and bold" design. The spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold – an idea that Waters came up with. Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colours, missing <a href="indigo">indigo</a> compared to the traditional division of the spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers. One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an <a href="Infrared%20photography">infrared photograph</a> of the <a href="Giza%20pyramid%20complex">Great Pyramids of Giza</a>, created by Powell and Thorgerson.

The band were so confident of the quality of Waters' lyrics that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve.

As the quadraphonic mix of the album was not then complete, the band (with the exception of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the <a href="London%20Planetarium">London Planetarium</a> on 27 February. The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the band, and the stereo mix of the album was presented through a poor-quality <a href="public%20address">public address</a> system. Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; "Melody Maker"s Roy Hollingworth described side one as "so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow", but praised side two, writing: "The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night." Steve Peacock of "Sounds" wrote: "I don't care if you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd unreservedly recommend everyone to "The Dark Side of the Moon"". In his 1973 review for "Rolling Stone" magazine, <a href="Loyd%20Grossman">Loyd Grossman</a> declared "Dark Side" "a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement". In "" (1981), <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> found its lyrical ideas clichéd and its music pretentious, but called it a "<a href="kitsch">kitsch</a> masterpiece" that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry's saxophone, and studio effects which enhance Gilmour's guitar solos.

"The Dark Side of the Moon" was released first in the US on 1 March 1973, and then in the UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">gold certification</a> in the US. Throughout March 1973 the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a> in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" Top LPs & Tape</a> chart's number one spot on 28 April 1973, and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour.

Much of the album's early American success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd's US record company, <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>. Newly appointed chairman <a href="Bhaskar%20Menon">Bhaskar Menon</a> set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band's 1971 studio album "Meddle". Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with <a href="CBS">CBS</a> president <a href="Clive%20Davis">Clive Davis</a>, on <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. "The Dark Side of the Moon" was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract. Menon's enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of "Us and Them" and "Time". In some countries – notably the UK – Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968's "<a href="Point%20Me%20at%20the%20Sky">Point Me at the Sky</a>", and unusually "Money" was released as a single on 7 May, with "Any Colour You Like" on the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side</a>. It reached number 13 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> in July 1973. A two-sided white label promotional version of the single, with mono and stereo mixes, was sent to radio stations. The mono side had the word "bullshit" removed from the song – leaving "bull" in its place – however, the stereo side retained the uncensored version. This was subsequently withdrawn; the replacement was sent to radio stations with a note advising disc jockeys to dispose of the first uncensored copy. On 4 February 1974, a <a href="double%20A-side">double A-side</a> single was released with "Time" on one side, and "Us and Them" on the opposite side. Menon's efforts to secure a contract renewal with Pink Floyd were in vain however; at the beginning of 1974, the band signed for Columbia with a reported advance fee of $1M (in Britain and Europe they continued to be represented by <a href="Harvest%20Records">Harvest Records</a>).

"The Dark Side of the Moon" became one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20albums">best-selling albums</a> of all time and is in the top 25 of a list of <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20albums%20in%20the%20United%20States">best-selling</a> albums in the United States. Although it held the number one spot in the US for only a week, it remained in the "Billboard" album chart for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. The album re-appeared on the "Billboard" charts with the introduction of the <a href="Top%20Pop%20Catalog%20Albums">Top Pop Catalog Albums</a> chart in May 1991, and has been a perennial feature since then. In the UK, it is the seventh-best-selling album of all time and the highest selling album never to reach number one.

In the US the <a href="Gramophone%20record">LP</a> was released before the introduction of <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">platinum awards</a> in 1976. It therefore held only a gold disc until 16 February 1990, when it was certified 11× platinum. On 4 June 1998 the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) certified the album 15× platinum, denoting sales of fifteen million in the United States – making it their biggest-selling work there ("<a href="The%20Wall">The Wall</a>" is 23× platinum, but as a double album this signifies sales of 11.5 million). "Money" has sold well as a single, and as with "Time", remains a radio favourite; in the US, for the year ending 20 April 2005, "Time" was played on 13,723 occasions, and "Money" on 13,731 occasions. Industry sources suggest that worldwide sales of the album total about 45 million. "On a slow week" between 8,000 and 9,000 copies are sold, and a total of 400,000 were sold in 2002, making it the 200th-best-selling album of that year – nearly three decades after its initial release. The album has sold 9,502,000 copies in the US since 1991 when <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a> began tracking sales for Billboard. To this day, it occupies a prominent spot on "Billboard"s Pop Catalog Chart. It reached number one when the 2003 hybrid CD/<a href="Super%20Audio%20CD">SACD</a> edition was released and sold 800,000 copies in the US. On the week of 5 May 2006 "The Dark Side of the Moon" achieved a combined total of 1,716 weeks on the "Billboard" 200 and Pop Catalog charts. One in every fourteen people in the US under the age of 50 is estimated to own, or to have owned, a copy. Upon a change in methodology in 2009 allowing catalogue titles to be included in the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, "The Dark Side of the Moon" returned to the chart at number 189 on 12 December of that year for its 742nd charting week. It has continued to sporadically appear on the Billboard 200 since then, with the total at 942 weeks on the chart as of January 2019.

"The combination of words and music hit a peak," explained Gilmour. "All the music before had not had any great lyrical point to it. And this one was clear and concise. The cover was also right. I think it's become like a benevolent noose hanging behind us. Throughout our entire career, people have said we would never top the "Dark Side" record and tour. But "<a href="The%20Wall">The Wall</a>" earned more in dollar terms."

In 1979, "The Dark Side of the Moon" was released as a remastered <a href="LP%20record">LP</a> by <a href="Mobile%20Fidelity%20Sound%20Lab">Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab</a>, and in April 1988 on their "Ultradisc" gold CD format. The album was released by EMI on the then-new <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a> format in 1984, and in 1992 it was re-released as a remastered CD in the box set "<a href="Shine%20On%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Shine On</a>". This version was re-released as a 20th anniversary box set edition with postcards the following year. The cover design was again by Storm Thorgerson, the designer of the original 1973 cover. On some pressings, a faintly audible orchestral version of the Beatles' "<a href="Ticket%20to%20Ride">Ticket to Ride</a>" can be heard after "Eclipse" over the album's closing heartbeats.

The original quadraphonic mix, created by Alan Parsons, was commissioned by <a href="EMI">EMI</a> but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix. To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons' quadraphonic mix (done shortly after the original release), and instead had engineer <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28record%20producer%29">James Guthrie</a> create a new <a href="5.1%20surround%20sound">5.1</a> channel surround sound mix on the <a href="Super%20Audio%20CD">SACD</a> format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since co-producing and engineering their eleventh album, "The Wall", and had previously worked on surround versions of "The Wall" for DVD-Video and Waters' "In the Flesh" for SACD. Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting that Guthrie was "possibly a little too true to the original mix", but was generally complimentary. The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003, and has since sold more than 800,000 copies. The cover image was created by a team of designers including Storm Thorgerson. The image is a photograph of a custom-made <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> window, built to match the exact dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colours of the original. The idea is derived from the "sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound ..." The image was created out of a desire to be "the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognisable prism design, but was different and hence new".

"The Dark Side of the Moon" was also re-released in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and included slightly different versions of the original posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th anniversary poster. In 2007 the album was included in "<a href="Oh%2C%20by%20the%20Way">Oh, by the Way</a>", a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd, and a <a href="Digital%20rights%20management">DRM</a>-free version was released on the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>. In 2011 the album was re-released as part of the <a href="Why%20Pink%20Floyd...%3F">Why Pink Floyd...?</a> campaign, featuring a remastered version of the album along with various other material.

The success of the album brought wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars. Some of the profits were invested in the production of "<a href="Monty%20Python%20and%20the%20Holy%20Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a>". Engineer <a href="Alan%20Parsons">Alan Parsons</a> received a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Engineered%20Album%2C%20Non-Classical">Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical</a> for "The Dark Side of the Moon", and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with <a href="the%20Alan%20Parsons%20Project">the Alan Parsons Project</a>. Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: "I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on "Dark Side of the Moon", which has an element of truth to it. But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't."

Part of the legacy of "The Dark Side of the Moon" is in its influence on modern music, the musicians who have performed <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a>s of its songs, and even in modern urban myths. Its release is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes drawn between Pink Floyd and <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a> – specifically their 1997 album "<a href="OK%20Computer">OK Computer</a>" – which has been called "The Dark Side of the Moon" of the 1990s, owing to the fact that both albums share themes relating to the loss of a creative individual's ability to function in the modern world.

In a 2018 book about <a href="classic%20rock">classic rock</a>, <a href="Steven%20Hyden">Steven Hyden</a> recalls concluding, in his teens, that "The Dark Side of the Moon" and "<a href="Led%20Zeppelin%20IV">Led Zeppelin IV</a>" were the two greatest albums of the genre, <a href="vision%20quest">vision quest</a>s "encompass[ing] the twin poles of teenage desire". They had similarities, in that both album's cover and internal artwork eschew pictures of the bands in favor of "inscrutable iconography without any tangible meaning (which always seemed to give the music packaged inside "more" meaning)". But whereas Led Zeppelin had looked outward, toward "conquering the world" and was known at the time for its outrageous sexual antics while on tour, Pink Floyd looked inward, toward "overcoming your own hang-ups" and seemed so sedate and boring that, Hyden commented, the scene in "Live at Pompeii" where they take a lunch break at the studio might well have been the most interesting part of recording "The Dark Side of the Moon".

"The Dark Side of the Moon" has frequently appeared on rankings of the greatest albums of all-time. In 1987, "Rolling Stone" listed the record 35th on its "Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years", and sixteen years later, in 2003 the album polled in 43rd position on the magazine's list of the "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>".and was voted 43rd again on the magazine's 2012 list. In 2006, it was voted "My Favourite Album" by the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>'s audience. "<a href="NME">NME</a>" readers voted the album eighth in their 2006 "Best Album of All Time" online poll, and in 2009, <a href="Planet%20Rock%20%28radio%20station%29">Planet Rock</a> listeners voted the album the "greatest of all time". The album is also number two on the "Definitive 200" list of albums, made by the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Recording%20Merchandisers">National Association of Recording Merchandisers</a> "in celebration of the art form of the record album". It came 29th in "The Observer"s 2006 list of "The 50 Albums That Changed Music", and 37th in "The Guardian"s 1997 list of the "100 Best Albums Ever", as voted for by a panel of artists and music critics. The album's cover has been lauded by critics and listeners alike, <a href="VH1">VH1</a> proclaiming it the fourth greatest in history, and Planet Rock listeners the greatest of all time. In 2013, "The Dark Side of the Moon" was selected for preservation in the United States <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a> by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> for being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". In 2014, readers of "<a href="Rhythm%20%28music%20magazine%29">Rhythm</a>" voted it the seventh most influential progressive drumming album.

One of the more notable covers of "The Dark Side of the Moon" is "<a href="Return%20to%20the%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">Return to the Dark Side of the Moon</a>: A Tribute to Pink Floyd". Released in 2006, the album is a progressive rock tribute featuring artists such as <a href="Adrian%20Belew">Adrian Belew</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Shaw">Tommy Shaw</a>, <a href="Dweezil%20Zappa">Dweezil Zappa</a>, and <a href="Rick%20Wakeman">Rick Wakeman</a>. In 2000, <a href="The%20Squirrels">The Squirrels</a> released "The Not So Bright Side of the Moon", which features a cover of the entire album. The New York dub collective <a href="Easy%20Star%20All-Stars">Easy Star All-Stars</a> released "<a href="Dub%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">Dub Side of the Moon</a>" in 2003 and "<a href="Dubber%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">Dubber Side of the Moon</a>" in 2010. The group Voices on the Dark Side released the album "Dark Side of the Moon a Cappella", a complete <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> version of the album. The <a href="Bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a> band Poor Man's Whiskey frequently play the album in bluegrass style, calling the suite "Dark Side of the Moonshine". A <a href="string%20quartet">string quartet</a> version of the album was released in 2004. In 2009, <a href="The%20Flaming%20Lips">The Flaming Lips</a> released a <a href="The%20Flaming%20Lips%20and%20Stardeath%20and%20White%20Dwarfs%20with%20Henry%20Rollins%20and%20Peaches%20Doing%20The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">track-by-track remake of the album</a> in collaboration with <a href="Stardeath%20and%20White%20Dwarfs">Stardeath and White Dwarfs</a>, and featuring <a href="Henry%20Rollins">Henry Rollins</a> and <a href="Peaches%20%28musician%29">Peaches</a> as guest musicians.

Several notable acts have covered the album live in its entirety, and a range of performers have used <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> from "The Dark Side of the Moon" in their own material. Jam-rock band <a href="Phish">Phish</a> performed a semi-improvised version of the entire album as part their show on 2 November 1998 in <a href="West%20Valley%20City%2C%20Utah">West Valley City, Utah</a>. Progressive metal band <a href="Dream%20Theater">Dream Theater</a> have twice covered the album in their live shows, and in May 2011 <a href="Mary%20Fahl">Mary Fahl</a> released "<a href="From%20the%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">From the Dark Side of the Moon</a>", a song-by-song "re-imagining" of the album. <a href="Milli%20Vanilli">Milli Vanilli</a> used the tape loops from Pink Floyd's "Money" to open their track "<a href="All%20or%20Nothing%20%28Milli%20Vanilli%20album%29">Money</a>", followed by <a href="Marky%20Mark%20and%20the%20Funky%20Bunch">Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch</a> on "<a href="Music%20for%20the%20People%20%28Marky%20Mark%20and%20the%20Funky%20Bunch%20album%29">Music for the People</a>".

Dark Side of the Rainbow and Dark Side of Oz are two names commonly used in reference to rumours (circulated on the Internet since at least 1994) that "The Dark Side of the Moon" was written as a soundtrack for the 1939 film "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>". Observers playing the film and the album simultaneously have reported apparent synchronicities, such as <a href="Dorothy%20Gale">Dorothy</a> beginning to jog at the lyric "no one told you when to run" during "Time", and Dorothy balancing on a <a href="Tightrope%20walking">tightrope</a> fence during the line "balanced on the biggest wave" in "Breathe". David Gilmour and Nick Mason have both denied a connection between the two works, and Roger Waters has described the rumours as "amusing". Alan Parsons has stated that the film was not mentioned during production of the album.

Murasaki Shikibu

Heian women were traditionally excluded from learning <a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese</a>, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics and managed to acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to late twenties and gave birth to a <a href="Daini%20no%20Sanmi">daughter</a> before her husband died, two years after they were married. It is uncertain when she began to write "The Tale of Genji", but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, Murasaki was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to <a href="Empress%20Sh%C5%8Dshi">Empress Shōshi</a> at the Imperial court, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Shōshi to the <a href="Lake%20Biwa">Lake Biwa</a> region. Scholars differ on the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1031.

Murasaki wrote "<a href="The%20Diary%20of%20Lady%20Murasaki">The Diary of Lady Murasaki</a>", a volume of poetry, and "The Tale of Genji". Within a decade of its completion, "Genji" was distributed throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of <a href="Japanese%20literature">Japanese literature</a> and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Early in the 20th century her work was translated; a six-volume English translation was completed in 1933. Scholars continue to recognize the importance of her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have been illustrated by Japanese artists and well-known <a href="ukiyo-e">ukiyo-e</a> woodblock masters.

Murasaki Shikibu was born c. 973 in <a href="Heian-ky%C5%8D">Heian-kyō</a>, Japan, into the northern <a href="Fujiwara%20clan">Fujiwara clan</a> descending from <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Yoshifusa">Fujiwara no Yoshifusa</a>, the first 9th-century <a href="Heian%20period%23Fujiwara%20regency">Fujiwara regent</a>. The Fujiwara clan dominated court politics until the end of the 11th century through strategic marriages of Fujiwara daughters into the imperial family and the use of regencies. In the late 10th century and early 11th century, <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Michinaga">Fujiwara no Michinaga</a> arranged his four daughters into marriages with emperors, giving him unprecedented power. Murasaki's great-grandfather, <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Kanesuke">Fujiwara no Kanesuke</a>, had been in the top tier of the aristocracy, but her branch of the family gradually lost power and by the time of Murasaki's birth was at the middle to lower ranks of the Heian aristocracy—the level of provincial governors. The lower ranks of the nobility were typically posted away from court to undesirable positions in the provinces, exiled from the centralized power and court in Kyoto.

Despite the loss of status, the family had a reputation among the literati through Murasaki's paternal great-grandfather and grandfather, both of whom were well-known poets. Her great-grandfather, Fujiwara no Kanesuke, had fifty-six poems included in thirteen of the <a href="Nij%C5%ABichidaish%C5%AB">Twenty-one Imperial Anthologies</a>, the "<a href="Thirty-six%20Poetry%20Immortals">Collections of Thirty-six Poets</a>" and the "<a href="Yamato%20Monogatari">Yamato Monogatari</a>" ("Tales of Yamato"). Her great-grandfather and grandfather both had been friendly with <a href="Ki%20no%20Tsurayuki">Ki no Tsurayuki</a>, who became notable for popularizing verse written in Japanese. Her father, <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Tametoki">Fujiwara no Tametoki</a>, attended the State Academy (<a href="Daigaku-ry%C5%8D">Daigaku-ryō</a>) and became a well-respected scholar of <a href="Chinese%20classics">Chinese classics</a> and poetry; his own verse was anthologized. He entered public service around 968 as a minor official and was given a governorship in 996. He stayed in service until about 1018. Murasaki's mother was descended from the same branch of northern Fujiwara as Tametoki. The couple had three children, a son and two daughters.

In the <a href="Heian%20period">Heian era</a> the use of names, insofar as they were recorded, did not follow a modern pattern. A court lady, as well as being known by the title of her own position, if any, took a name referring to the rank or title of a male relative. Thus "Shikibu" is not a modern surname, but refers to "<a href="Shikibu-sh%C5%8D">Shikibu-shō</a>", the Ministry of Ceremonials where Murasaki's father was a functionary. "Murasaki", an additional name possibly derived from the color violet associated with <a href="wisteria">wisteria</a>, the meaning of the word "fuji" (an element of her clan name), may have been bestowed on her at court in reference to the name she herself had given to the main female character in "Genji". Michinaga mentions the names of several ladies-in-waiting in a 1007 diary entry; one, Fujiwara no Takako (Kyōshi), may be Murasaki's personal name.

In Heian-era Japan, husbands and wives kept separate households; children were raised with their mothers, although the <a href="patrilineal">patrilineal</a> system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when the children were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she was very close to one sister who died in her twenties.

Murasaki was born at a period when Japan was becoming more isolated, after <a href="Japanese%20missions%20to%20Imperial%20China">missions to China</a> had ended and a stronger national culture was emerging. In the 9th and 10th centuries, Japanese gradually became a written language through the development of <a href="kana">kana</a>, a <a href="syllabary">syllabary</a> based on abbreviations of Chinese characters. In Murasaki's lifetime men continued to write in <a href="Chinese%20character">Chinese</a>, the language of government, but kana became the written language of noblewomen, setting the foundation for unique forms of <a href="Japanese%20literature">Japanese literature</a>.

Chinese was taught to Murasaki's brother as preparation for a career in government, and during her childhood, living in her father's household, she learned and became proficient in <a href="classical%20Chinese">classical Chinese</a>. In her diary she wrote, "When my brother ... was a young boy learning the Chinese classics, I was in the habit of listening to him and I became unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize. Father, a most learned man, was always regretting the fact: 'Just my luck,' he would say, 'What a pity she was not born a man! With her brother she studied <a href="Chinese%20literature">Chinese literature</a>, and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music, <a href="calligraphy">calligraphy</a> and <a href="Waka%20%28poetry%29">Japanese poetry</a>. Murasaki's education was unorthodox. Louis Perez explains in "The History of Japan" that "Women ... were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in Chinese." Murasaki was aware that others saw her as "pretentious, awkward, difficult to approach, prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous and scornful". Asian literature scholar Thomas Inge believes she had "a forceful personality that seldom won her friends".
Aristocratic Heian women lived restricted and secluded lives, allowed to speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father's household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties.

In 996 when her father was posted to a four-year governorship in <a href="Echizen%20Province">Echizen Province</a>, Murasaki went with him, although it was uncommon for a noblewoman of the period to travel such a distance on a trip that could take as long as five days. She returned to Kyoto, probably in 998, to marry her father's friend Fujiwara no Nobutaka (c. 950 – c. 1001), a much older second cousin. Descended from the same branch of the Fujiwara clan, he was a court functionary and bureaucrat at the Ministry of Ceremonials, with a reputation for dressing extravagantly and as a talented dancer. In his late forties at the time of their marriage, he had multiple households with an unknown number of wives and offspring. Gregarious and well known at court, he was involved in numerous romantic relationships that may have continued after his marriage to Murasaki. As was customary, she would have remained in her father's household where her husband would have visited her. Nobutaka had been granted more than one governorship, and by the time of his marriage to Murasaki he was probably quite wealthy. Accounts of their marriage vary: <a href="Richard%20Bowring">Richard Bowring</a> writes that the marriage was happy, but Japanese literature scholar Haruo Shirane sees indications in her poems that she resented her husband.

The couple's daughter, Kenshi (Kataiko), was born in 999. Two years later Nobutaka died during a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemic. As a married woman Murasaki would have had servants to run the household and care for her daughter, giving her ample leisure time. She enjoyed reading and had access to romances (<a href="monogatari">monogatari</a>) such as "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20the%20Bamboo%20Cutter">The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</a>" and "<a href="The%20Tales%20of%20Ise">The Tales of Ise</a>." Scholars believe she may have started writing "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Genji">The Tale of Genji</a>" before her husband's death; it is known she was writing after she was widowed, perhaps in a state of grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: "I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed from day to day in listless fashion ... doing little more than registering the passage of time ... The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable".

According to legend, Murasaki retreated to <a href="Ishiyama-dera">Ishiyama-dera</a> at <a href="Lake%20Biwa">Lake Biwa</a>, where she was inspired to write "The Tale of Genji" on an August night while looking at the moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis of the story of her retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the moon for inspiration. She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero <a href="Hikaru%20Genji">Prince Genji</a>. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of "Genji" to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.

In her early to mid-thirties, she became a <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a> ("nyōbō") at court, most likely because of her reputation as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in "Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook" that scholars have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's <a href="Concubinage">concubine</a>, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.

Heian culture and court life reached a peak early in the 11th century. The population of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the <a href="Heian%20Palace">Heian Palace</a> in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized as some of the earliest and among the best literature written in Japanese <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>.

When in 995 Michinaga's two brothers <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Michitaka">Fujiwara no Michitaka</a> and <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Michikane">Fujiwara no Michikane</a> died leaving the regency vacant, Michinaga quickly won a power struggle against his nephew <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Korechika">Fujiwara no Korechika</a> (brother to <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Teishi">Teishi</a>, <a href="Emperor%20Ichij%C5%8D">Emperor Ichijō</a>'s wife), and, aided by his sister Senshi, he assumed power. Teishi had supported her brother Korechika, who was later discredited and banished from court, causing her to lose power. Four years later Michinaga sent Shōshi, his eldest daughter, to Emperor Ichijō's harem when she was about 12. A year after placing Shōshi in the imperial harem, in an effort to undermine Teishi's influence and increase Shōshi's standing, Michinaga had her named Empress although Teishi already held the title. As historian <a href="Donald%20Shively">Donald Shively</a> explains, "Michinaga shocked even his admirers by arranging for the unprecedented appointment of Teishi (or Sadako) and Shōshi as concurrent empresses of the same emperor, Teishi holding the usual title of "Lustrous Heir-bearer" "kōgō" and Shōshi that of "Inner Palatine" ("chūgū"), a toponymically derived equivalent coined for the occasion". About five years later, Michinaga brought Murasaki to Shōshi's court, in a position that Bowring describes as a companion-tutor.

Women of high status lived in seclusion at court and, through strategic marriages, were used to gain political power for their families. Despite their seclusion, some women wielded considerable influence, often achieved through competitive <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salons</a>, dependent on the quality of those attending. Ichijō's mother and Michinaga's sister, Senshi, had an influential salon, and Michinaga probably wanted Shōshi to surround herself with skilled women such as Murasaki to build a rival salon.
Shōshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki joined her court. According to <a href="Arthur%20Waley">Arthur Waley</a>, Shōshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living arrangements were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women writers such as <a href="Izumi%20Shikibu">Izumi Shikibu</a> and <a href="Akazome%20Emon">Akazome Emon</a>—the author of an early <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a> history, "<a href="Eiga%20Monogatari">The Tale of Flowering Fortunes</a>". The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; but there is something not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed it does not seem to me that in herself she is really a poet at all."

<a href="Sei%20Sh%C5%8Dnagon">Sei Shōnagon</a>, author of "<a href="The%20Pillow%20Book">The Pillow Book</a>", had been in service as lady-in-waiting to Teishi when Shōshi came to court; it is possible that Murasaki was invited to Shōshi's court as a rival to Shōnagon. Teishi died in 1001, before Murasaki entered service with Shōshi, so the two writers were not there concurrently, but Murasaki, who wrote about Shōnagon in her diary, certainly knew of her, and to an extent was influenced by her. Shōnagon's "The Pillow Book" may have been commissioned as a type of propaganda to highlight Teishi's court, known for its educated ladies-in-waiting. Japanese literature scholar Joshua Mostow believes Michinaga provided Murasaki to Shōshi as an equally or better educated woman, so as to showcase Shōshi's court in a similar manner.

The two writers had different temperaments: Shōnagon was witty, clever, and outspoken; Murasaki was withdrawn and sensitive. Entries in Murasaki's diary show that the two may not have been on good terms. Murasaki wrote, "Sei Shōnagon ... was dreadfully conceited. She thought herself so clever, littered her writing with Chinese characters, [which] left a great deal to be desired." Keene thinks that Murasaki's impression of Shōnagon could have been influenced by Shōshi and the women at her court because Shōnagon served Shōshi's rival empress. Furthermore, he believes Murasaki was brought to court to write "Genji" in response to Shōnagon's popular "Pillow Book". Murasaki contrasted herself to Shōnagon in a variety of ways. She denigrated the pillow book genre and, unlike Shōnagon who flaunted her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki pretended to not know the language.
Although the popularity of the Chinese language diminished in the late Heian era, Chinese ballads continued to be popular, including those written by <a href="Bai%20Juyi">Bai Juyi</a>. Murasaki taught Chinese to Shōshi who was interested in Chinese art and Juyi's ballads. Upon becoming Empress, Shōshi installed screens decorated with <a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese script</a>, causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men, far removed from the women's quarters. The study of Chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against the notion that only men should have access to the literature. Women were supposed to read and write only in Japanese, which separated them through language from government and the power structure. Murasaki, with her unconventional classical Chinese education, was one of the few women available to teach Shōshi classical Chinese. Bowring writes it was "almost subversive" that Murasaki knew Chinese and taught the language to Shōshi. Murasaki, who was reticent about her Chinese education, held the lessons between the two women in secret, writing in her diary, "Since last summer ... very secretly, in odd moments when there happened to be no one about, I have been reading with Her Majesty ... There has of course been no question of formal lessons ... I have thought it best to say nothing about the matter to anybody."
Murasaki probably earned an ambiguous nickname, "The Lady of the Chronicles" ("<a href="Nihon%20Shoki">Nihongi</a> no tsubone)", for teaching Shōshi Chinese literature. A lady-in-waiting who disliked Murasaki accused her of flaunting her knowledge of Chinese and began calling her "The Lady of the Chronicles"—an allusion to the classic "Chronicles of Japan"—after an incident in which chapters from "Genji" were read aloud to the Emperor and his courtiers, one of whom remarked that the author showed a high level of education. Murasaki wrote in her diary, "How utterly ridiculous! Would I, who hesitate to reveal my learning to my women at home, ever think of doing so at court?" Although the nickname was apparently meant to be disparaging, Mulhern believes Murasaki was flattered by it.

The attitude toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon there was a great deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.
Murasaki seems to have been unhappy with court life and was withdrawn and somber. No surviving records show that she entered poetry competitions; she appears to have exchanged few poems or letters with other women during her service. In general, unlike Sei Shōnagon, Murasaki gives the impression in her diary that she disliked court life, the other ladies-in-waiting, and the drunken revelry. She did, however, become close friends with a lady-in-waiting named Lady Saishō, and she wrote of the winters that she enjoyed, "I love to see the snow here".

According to Waley, Murasaki may not have been unhappy with court life in general but bored in Shōshi's court. He speculates she would have preferred to serve with the Lady Senshi, whose household seems to have been less strict and more light-hearted. In her diary, Murasaki wrote about Shōshi's court, "[she] has gathered round her a number of very worthy young ladies ... Her Majesty is beginning to acquire more experience of life, and no longer judges others by the same rigid standards as before; but meanwhile her Court has gained a reputation for extreme dullness".

Murasaki disliked the men at court whom she thought to be drunken and stupid. However, some scholars, such as Waley, are certain she was involved romantically with Michinaga. At the least, Michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly, and her flirtation with him is recorded in her diary as late as 1010. Yet, she wrote to him in a poem, "You have neither read my book, nor won my love." In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga—one night he sneaked into her room, stealing a newly written chapter of "Genji." However, Michinaga's patronage was essential if she was to continue writing. Murasaki described her daughter's court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the "complexities of the marriage system", and in elaborate detail, the birth of Shōshi's two sons.

It is likely that Murasaki enjoyed writing in solitude. She believed she did not fit well with the general atmosphere of the court, writing of herself: "I am wrapped up in the study of ancient stories ... living all the time in a poetical world of my own scarcely realizing the existence of other people ... But when they get to know me, they find to their extreme surprise that I am kind and gentle". Inge says that she was too outspoken to make friends at court, and Mulhern thinks Murasaki's court life was comparatively quiet compared to other <a href="court%20poets">court poets</a>. Mulhern speculates that her remarks about Izumi were not so much directed at Izumi's poetry but at her behavior, lack of morality and her court liaisons, of which Murasaki disapproved.

Rank was important in Heian court society and Murasaki would not have felt herself to have much, if anything, in common with the higher ranked and more powerful Fujiwaras. In her diary, she wrote of her life at court: "I realized that my branch of the family was a very humble one; but the thought seldom troubled me, and I was in those days far indeed from the painful consciousness of inferiority which makes life at Court a continual torment to me." A court position would have increased her social standing, but more importantly she gained a greater experience to write about. Court life, as she experienced it, is well reflected in the chapters of "Genji" written after she joined Shōshi. The name Murasaki was most probably given to her at a court dinner in an incident she recorded in her diary: in c. 1008 the well-known court poet <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Kint%C5%8D">Fujiwara no Kintō</a> inquired after the "Young Murasaki"—an allusion to the character named Murasaki in "Genji"—which would have been considered a compliment from a male court poet to a female author.

When Emperor Ichijō died in 1011, Shōshi retired from the Imperial Palace to live in a Fujiwara mansion in Biwa, most likely accompanied by Murasaki, who is recorded as being there with Shōshi in 1013. <a href="William%20George%20Aston">George Aston</a> explains that when Murasaki retired from court she was again associated with Ishiyama-dera: "To this beautiful spot, it is said, Murasaki no Shikibu (sic) retired from court life to devote the remainder of her days to literature and religion. There are sceptics, however, <a href="Motoori%20Norinaga">Motoori</a> being one, who refuse to believe this story, pointing out ... that it is irreconcilable with known facts. On the other hand, the very chamber in the temple where the "Genji" was written is shown—with the ink-slab which the author used, and a Buddhist <a href="Sutra">Sutra</a> in her handwriting, which, if they do not satisfy the critic, still are sufficient to carry conviction to the minds of ordinary visitors to the temple."

Murasaki may have died in 1014. Her father made a hasty return to Kyoto from his post at <a href="Echigo%20Province">Echigo Province</a> that year, possibly because of her death. Writing in "A Bridge of Dreams: A Poetics of "The Tale of Genji"", Shirane mentions that 1014 is generally accepted as the date of Murasaki Shikibu's death and 973 as the date of her birth, making her 41 when she died. Bowring considers 1014 to be speculative, and believes she may have lived with Shōshi until as late as 1025. Waley agrees given that Murasaki may have attended ceremonies with Shōshi held for her son, <a href="Emperor%20Go-Ichij%C5%8D">Emperor Go-Ichijō</a> around 1025.

Murasaki's brother Nubonori died in around 1011, which, combined with the death of his daughter, may have prompted her father to resign his post and take vows at <a href="Mii-dera">Miidera</a> temple where he died in 1029. Murasaki's daughter entered court service in 1025 as a <a href="wet%20nurse">wet nurse</a> to the future <a href="Emperor%20Go-Reizei">Emperor Go-Reizei</a> (1025–1068). She went on to become a well-known poet as <a href="Daini%20no%20Sanmi">Daini no Sanmi</a>.

Three works are attributed to Murasaki: "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Genji">The Tale of Genji</a>", "<a href="The%20Diary%20of%20Lady%20Murasaki">The Diary of Lady Murasaki</a>" and "<a href="Poetic%20Memoirs">Poetic Memoirs</a>", a collection of 128 poems. Her work is considered important because her writing reflects the creation and development of Japanese writing during a period when Japanese shifted from an unwritten vernacular to a written language. Until the 9th century, Japanese language texts were written in <a href="Chinese%20character">Chinese character</a>s using the <a href="man%27y%C5%8Dgana">man'yōgana</a> writing system. A revolutionary achievement was the development of <a href="kana">kana</a>, a true Japanese script, in the mid-to late 9th century. Japanese authors began to write prose in their own language, which led to genres such as tales (<a href="monogatari">monogatari</a>) and poetic journals (<a href="Nikki%20Bungaku">Nikki Bungaku</a>). Historian <a href="Edwin%20O.%20Reischauer">Edwin Reischauer</a> writes that genres such as the monogatari were distinctly Japanese and that "Genji", written in kana, "was the outstanding work of the period".

Murasaki began her diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much of what we know about her and her experiences at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, some of which may have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing "Genji", including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to <a href="calligraphy">calligraphers</a> for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and "de facto" regent to an emperor.

"Poetic Memoirs" is a collection of 128 poems Mulhern describes as "arranged in a biographical sequence". The original set has been lost. According to custom, the verses would have been passed from person to person and often copied. Some appear written for a lover—possibly her husband before he died—but she may have merely followed tradition and written simple love poems. They contain biographical details: she mentions a sister who died, the visit to Echizen province with her father and that she wrote poetry for Shōshi. Murasaki's poems were published in 1206 by <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Teika">Fujiwara no Teika</a>, in what Mulhern believes to be the collection that is closest to the original form; at around the same time Teika included a selection of Murasaki's works in an imperial anthology, "<a href="Shin%20Kokin%20Wakash%C5%AB">New Collections of Ancient and Modern Times</a>".

Murasaki is best known for her "The Tale of Genji", a three-part <a href="novel">novel</a> spanning 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.

In his "The Pleasures of Japanese Literature", Keene claims Murasaki wrote the "supreme work of Japanese fiction" by drawing on traditions of <a href="Waka%20%28poetry%29">waka</a> court diaries, and earlier monogatari—written in a mixture of Chinese script and Japanese script—such as "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20the%20Bamboo%20Cutter">The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</a>" or "<a href="The%20Tales%20of%20Ise">The Tales of Ise</a>". She drew on and blended styles from Chinese histories, narrative poetry and contemporary Japanese prose. Adolphson writes that the juxtaposition of formal Chinese style with mundane subjects resulted in a sense of <a href="parody">parody</a> or <a href="satire">satire</a>, giving her a distinctive voice. "Genji" follows the traditional format of monogatari—telling a tale—particularly evident in its use of a <a href="narrator">narrator</a>, but Keene claims Murasaki developed the genre far beyond its bounds, and by doing so created a form that is utterly modern. The story of the "shining prince" Genji is set in the late 9th to early 10th centuries, and Murasaki eliminated from it the elements of fairy tales and fantasy frequently found in earlier monogatari.

The themes in "Genji" are common to the period, and are defined by Shively as encapsulating "the tyranny of time and the inescapable sorrow of romantic love". The main theme is that of the fragility of life, "the sorrow of human existence", "<a href="mono%20no%20aware">mono no aware</a>"—she used the term over a thousand times in "Genji". Keene speculates that in her tale of the "shining prince", Murasaki may have created for herself an idealistic escape from court life, which she found less than savory. In Prince Genji she formed a gifted, comely, refined, yet human and sympathetic <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>. Keene writes that "Genji" gives a view into the Heian period; for example love affairs flourished, although women typically remained unseen behind screens, curtains or <a href="fusuma">fusuma</a>.

<a href="Helen%20McCullough">Helen McCullough</a> describes Murasaki's writing as of universal appeal and believes "The Tale of Genji" "transcends both its genre and age. Its basic subject matter and setting—love at the Heian court—are those of the romance, and its cultural assumptions are those of the mid-Heian period, but Murasaki Shikibu's unique genius has made the work for many a powerful statement of human relationships, the impossibility of permanent happiness in love ... and the vital importance, in a world of sorrows, of sensitivity to the feelings of others." Prince Genji recognizes in each of his lovers the inner beauty of the woman and the fragility of life, which according to Keene, makes him heroic. The story was popular: Emperor Ichijō had it read to him, even though it was written in Japanese. By 1021 all the chapters were known to be complete and the work was sought after in the provinces where it was scarce.
Murasaki's reputation and influence have not diminished since her lifetime when she, with other Heian women writers, was instrumental in developing Japanese into a written language. Her writing was required reading for court poets as early as the 12th century as her work began to be studied by scholars who generated authoritative versions and criticism. Within a century of her death she was highly regarded as a classical writer. In the 17th century, Murasaki's work became emblematic of <a href="Confucius">Confucian</a> philosophy and women were encouraged to read her books. In 1673 <a href="Kumazawa%20Banzan">Kumazawa Banzan</a> argued that her writing was valuable for its sensitivity and depiction of emotions. He wrote in his "Discursive Commentary on Genji" that when "human feelings are not understood the harmony of the Five Human Relationships is lost."

"The Tale of Genji" was copied and illustrated in various forms as early as a century after Murasaki's death. "The <a href="Genji%20Monogatari%20Emaki">Genji Monogatari Emaki</a>", is a late Heian era 12th-century <a href="Emakimono">handscroll</a>, consisting of four scrolls, 19 paintings, and 20 sheets of calligraphy. The illustrations, definitively dated to between 1110 and 1120, have been tentatively attributed to Fujiwara no Takachika and the calligraphy to various well-known contemporary calligraphers. The scroll is housed at the <a href="Gotoh%20Museum">Gotoh Museum</a> and the <a href="Tokugawa%20Art%20Museum">Tokugawa Art Museum</a>.

Female virtue was tied to literary knowledge in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or "Genji" inspired artifacts, known as genji-e. <a href="Dowry">Dowry</a> sets decorated with scenes from "Genji" or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century genji-e symbolically imbued a bride with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century they had come to symbolize marital success. In 1628, <a href="Tokugawa%20Iemitsu">Tokugawa Iemitsu</a>'s daughter had a set of <a href="Lacquerware">lacquer</a> boxes made for her wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk genji-e <a href="Folding%20screen">screens</a>, painted by <a href="Kan%C5%8D%20Tan%27y%C5%AB">Kanō Tan'yū</a> as a wedding gift in 1649.

Murasaki became a popular subject of paintings and illustrations highlighting her as a virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown at her desk in Ishimyama Temple, staring at the moon for inspiration. <a href="Tosa%20Mitsuoki">Tosa Mitsuoki</a> made her the subject of <a href="Emakimono">hanging scrolls</a> in the 17th century. "The Tale of Genji" became a favorite subject of Japanese <a href="ukiyo-e">ukiyo-e</a> artists for centuries with artists such as <a href="Hiroshige">Hiroshige</a>, <a href="Torii%20Kiyonaga">Kiyonaga</a>, and <a href="Utamaro">Utamaro</a> illustrating various editions of the novel. While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, by the middle of the <a href="Edo%20period">Edo period</a> the mass-produced ukiyo-e prints made the illustrations accessible for the <a href="samurai">samurai</a> classes and commoners.

In "Envisioning the "Tale of Genji"" Shirane observes that ""The Tale of Genji" has become many things to many different audiences through many different media over a thousand years ... unmatched by any other Japanese text or artifact." The work and its author were popularized through its illustrations in various media: <a href="emaki">emaki</a> (illustrated handscrolls); <a href="By%C5%8Dbu">byōbu-e</a> (screen paintings), ukiyo-e (woodblock prints); films, comics, and in the modern period, <a href="manga">manga</a>. In her fictionalized account of Murasaki's life, "The Tale of Murasaki: A Novel", <a href="Liza%20Dalby">Liza Dalby</a> has Murasaki involved in a romance during her travels with her father to Echizen Province.

"The Tale of the Genji" is recognized as an enduring classic. McCullough writes that Murasaki "is both the quintessential representative of a unique society and a writer who speaks to universal human concerns with a timeless voice. Japan has not seen another such genius." Keene writes that "The Tale of Genji" continues to captivate, because, in the story, her characters and their concerns are universal. In the 1920s, when Waley's translation was published, reviewers compared "Genji" to <a href="Jane%20Austen">Austen</a>, <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Proust</a>, and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>. Mulhern says of Murasaki that she is similar to Shakespeare, who represented his <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan England</a>, in that she captured the essence of the Heian court and as a novelist "succeeded perhaps even beyond her own expectations." Like Shakespeare, her work has been the subject of reams of criticism and many books.
Kyoto held a year-long celebration commemorating the 1000th anniversary of "Genji" in 2008, with poetry competitions, visits to the <a href="the%20Tale%20of%20Genji%20Museum">Tale of Genji Museum</a> in <a href="Uji%2C%20Kyoto">Uji</a> and Ishiyama-dera (where a life size rendition of Murasaki at her desk was displayed), and women dressing in traditional 12-layered Heian court <a href="J%C5%ABnihitoe">Jūnihitoe</a> and ankle-length hair wigs. The author and her work inspired museum exhibits and Genji manga spin-offs. The design on the reverse of the first <a href="Banknotes%20of%20the%20Japanese%20yen%23Commemorative%20series%20D%20%282000%2C%20the%20current%20issue%29">2000 yen</a> note commemorated her and "The Tale of Genji". A <a href="Callicarpa%20japonica">plant</a> bearing purple berries has been named after her.

A "Genji Album", only in the 1970s dated to 1510, is housed at Harvard University. The album is considered the earliest of its kind and consists of 54 paintings by <a href="Tosa%20Mitsunobu">Tosa Mitsunobu</a> and 54 sheets of calligraphy on "shikishi" paper in five colors, written by master calligraphers. The leaves are housed in a case dated to the <a href="Edo%20period">Edo period</a>, with a silk frontispiece painted by Tosa Mitsuoki, dated to around 1690. The album contains Mitsuoki's authentication slips for his ancestor's 16th-century paintings.

Zenobia

Septimia Zenobia (<a href="Palmyrene%20dialect">Palmyrene</a>: (Btzby), pronounced Bat-Zabbai; 240 – c. 274 AD) was a third century queen of the <a href="Palmyrene%20Empire">Palmyrene Empire</a> in <a href="Syria%20%28region%29">Syria</a>. Many legends surround her ancestry; she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the city, <a href="Odaenathus">Odaenathus</a>. Her husband became king in 260, elevating <a href="Palmyra">Palmyra</a> to supreme power in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> by defeating the <a href="Sassanians">Sassanians</a> and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia became the <a href="regent">regent</a> of her son <a href="Vaballathus">Vaballathus</a> and held "de facto" power throughout his reign.

In 270, Zenobia launched an invasion which brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Egypt</a>. By mid-271 her realm extended from <a href="Ancyra">Ancyra</a>, central <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, to <a href="Upper%20Egypt">southern Egypt</a>, although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However, in reaction to Roman emperor <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a>'s campaign in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress (declaring Palmyra's secession from Rome). The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting; the queen was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome where she spent the remainder of her life.

Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a national hero in Syria.

Zenobia was born c. 240–241. She bore the <a href="Roman%20naming%20conventions%23Nomen">gentilicium</a> (surname) Septimia, and her native Palmyrene name was Bat-Zabbai (written "Btzby" in the <a href="Palmyrene%20alphabet">Palmyrene alphabet</a>, an <a href="Western%20Aramaic%20languages">Aramaic</a> name meaning "daughter of Zabbai"). In <a href="Greek%20name">Greek</a>—Palmyra's <a href="Lingua%20franca">diplomatic</a> and second language, used in many Palmyrene inscriptions—she used the name Zenobia ("one whose life derives from <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>"). The philologist <a href="Wilhelm%20Dittenberger">Wilhelm Dittenberger</a> believed that the name Bat Zabbai underwent a detortum (twist), resulting in the name Zenobia. In Palmyra, names such as Zabeida, Zabdila, Zabbai or Zabda were often transformed into "Zenobios" (masculine) and "Zenobia" (feminine) when written in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>. The historian <a href="Victor%20Duruy">Victor Duruy</a> believed that the queen used the Greek name as a translation of her native name in deference to her Greek subjects. The ninth-century historian <a href="al-Tabari">al-Tabari</a>, in his highly fictionalized account, wrote that the queen's name was Na'ila al-Zabba'. <a href="Manichaeism">Manichaean</a> sources called her "Tadi".

No contemporary statues of Zenobia have been found in Palmyra or elsewhere, only inscriptions on statues bases survive, indicating that a statue of the queen once stood in the place; most known representations of Zenobia are the idealized portraits of her found on her coins. Palmyrene sculptures were normally impersonal, unlike Greek and Roman ones: a statue of Zenobia would have given an idea of her general style in dress and jewelry but would not have revealed her true appearance. British scholar <a href="William%20Wright%20%28orientalist%29">William Wright</a> visited Palmyra toward the end of the nineteenth century in a vain search for a sculpture of the queen.

In addition to archaeological evidence, Zenobia's life was recorded in different ancient sources but many are flawed or fabricated; the "<a href="Augustan%20History">Augustan History</a>", a late-Roman collection of biographies, is the most notable (albeit unreliable) source for the era. The author (or authors) of the "Augustan History" invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia in the absence of contemporary sources. Some "Augustan History" accounts are corroborated from other sources, and are more credible. Byzantine chronicler <a href="Joannes%20Zonaras">Joannes Zonaras</a> is considered an important source for the life of Zenobia.

Palmyrene society was an amalgam of <a href="Ancient%20Semitic-speaking%20peoples">Semitic</a> tribes (mostly <a href="Arameans">Aramean</a> and <a href="Arabs">Arab</a>), and Zenobia cannot be identified with any one group; as a Palmyrene, she would have had Aramean and Arab blood. Information about Zenobia's ancestry and immediate family connections is scarce and contradictory. Nothing is known about her mother, and her father's identity is debated. Manichaean sources mention a "Nafsha", sister of the "queen of Palmyra", but those sources are confused and "Nafsha" may refer to Zenobia herself: it is doubtful that Zenobia had a sister.

The "Augustan History" contains details of Zenobia's early life, although their credibility is doubtful. According to the "Augustan History", the queen's hobby as a child was hunting. Apparently not a commoner, she would have received an education appropriate for a noble Palmyrene girl. According to the "Augustan History", in addition to her Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue, Zenobia was reportedly fluent in <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a> and Greek and spoke <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. Around age 14 (c. 255) she became the second wife of <a href="Odaenathus">Odaenathus</a>, the "ras" (lord) of Palmyra. Noble families in Palmyra often intermarried, and it is probable that Zenobia and Odaenathus shared some ancestors.

Han dynasty

The Han dynasty (; ) was the second <a href="Dynasties%20in%20Chinese%20history">imperial dynasty of China</a> (206 BC–220 AD), preceded by the <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> (221–206 BC) and succeeded by the <a href="Three%20Kingdoms">Three Kingdoms</a> period (220–280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a <a href="Golden%20age%20%28metaphor%29">golden age</a> in Chinese history. To this day, China's <a href="Han%20Chinese">majority ethnic group</a> refers to themselves as the "Han Chinese" and the Chinese script is referred to as "<a href="Chinese%20characters">Han characters</a>". It was founded by the rebel leader <a href="Liu%20Bang">Liu Bang</a>, <a href="Posthumous%20name">known posthumously</a> as <a href="Emperor%20Gaozu%20of%20Han">Emperor Gaozu of Han</a>, and briefly interrupted by the <a href="Xin%20dynasty">Xin dynasty</a> (9–23 AD) of the former regent <a href="Wang%20Mang">Wang Mang</a>. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the <a href="%23Western%20Han">Western Han</a> or Former Han (206 BC – 9 AD) and the <a href="%23Eastern%20Han">Eastern Han</a> or Later Han (25–220 AD).

<a href="Emperor%20of%20China">The emperor</a> was at the pinnacle of <a href="Society%20and%20culture%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">Han society</a>. He presided over the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">Han government</a> but shared power with both <a href="Chinese%20nobility">the nobility</a> and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly <a href="Gentry%20%28China%29">gentry class</a>. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">commanderies</a>, and a number of <a href="Kings%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">semi-autonomous kingdoms</a>. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the <a href="Rebellion%20of%20the%20Seven%20States">Rebellion of the Seven States</a>. From the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu</a> (r. 141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> in education and court politics, synthesized with the <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a> of later scholars such as <a href="Dong%20Zhongshu">Dong Zhongshu</a>. This policy endured until the fall of the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing dynasty</a> in 1911 AD.

The Han dynasty saw an <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">age of economic prosperity</a> and witnessed a significant growth of the <a href="Chinese%20currency%23Imperial%20China">money economy</a> first established during the <a href="Zhou%20dynasty">Zhou dynasty</a> (c. 1050–256 BC). <a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage">The coinage</a> issued by the central government <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">mint</a> in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">finance its military campaigns</a> and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the Han government <a href="Nationalization">nationalized</a> the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty. <a href="Science%20and%20technology%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">Science and technology during the Han period</a> saw significant advances, including the process of <a href="papermaking">papermaking</a>, the nautical steering ship <a href="rudder">rudder</a>, the use of <a href="negative%20number">negative number</a>s in <a href="Chinese%20mathematics">mathematics</a>, the <a href="raised-relief%20map">raised-relief map</a>, the <a href="Hydraulics">hydraulic</a>-powered <a href="armillary%20sphere">armillary sphere</a> for <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">astronomy</a>, and a <a href="seismometer">seismometer</a> employing an <a href="inverted%20pendulum">inverted pendulum</a> that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes.

The <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a>, a nomadic <a href="Eurasian%20Steppe">steppe</a> confederation, defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a "de facto" inferior and vassal partner, but continued their military raids on the Han borders. Emperor Wu launched <a href="Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu%20War">several military campaigns</a> against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as <a href="List%20of%20tributaries%20of%20Imperial%20China">Han tributaries</a>. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the <a href="Tarim%20Basin">Tarim Basin</a> of <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>, which reached as far as the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Mediterranean%20region">Mediterranean world</a>. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic <a href="Xianbei">Xianbei</a> confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful <a href="Southward%20expansion%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">military expeditions in the south</a>, annexing <a href="Han%E2%80%93Nanyue%20War">Nanyue in 111 BC</a> and <a href="Han%20campaigns%20against%20Dian">Dian in 109 BC</a>, and in the <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a> where the <a href="Xuantu%20Commandery">Xuantu</a> and <a href="Lelang%20Commandery">Lelang Commanderies</a> were established in 108 BC. After 92 AD, the palace <a href="eunuch%20%28court%20official%29">eunuchs</a> increasingly involved themselves in court politics, engaging in violent power struggles between the various <a href="consort%20clan">consort clan</a>s of the empresses and <a href="empress%20dowager">empresses dowager</a>, causing the Han's ultimate downfall. Imperial authority was also seriously challenged by large <a href="Daoist">Daoist</a> religious societies which instigated the <a href="Yellow%20Turban%20Rebellion">Yellow Turban Rebellion</a> and the <a href="Way%20of%20the%20Five%20Pecks%20of%20Rice">Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion</a>. Following the death of <a href="Emperor%20Ling%20of%20Han">Emperor Ling</a> (r. 168–189 AD), the palace eunuchs <a href="History%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">suffered wholesale massacre</a> by <a href="Military%20history%20of%20China%20%28pre-1911%29">military officers</a>, allowing members of the aristocracy and military governors to become warlords and <a href="End%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">divide the empire</a>. When <a href="Cao%20Pi">Cao Pi</a>, King of <a href="Cao%20Wei">Wei</a>, usurped the throne from <a href="Emperor%20Xian%20of%20Han">Emperor Xian</a>, the Han dynasty ceased to exist.

According to the "<a href="Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian">Records of the Grand Historian</a>", after the collapse of the <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> the <a href="hegemon">hegemon</a> <a href="Xiang%20Yu">Xiang Yu</a> appointed <a href="Liu%20Bang">Liu Bang</a> as prince of the small fief of <a href="Hanzhong">Hanzhong</a>, named after its location on the <a href="Han%20River%20%28Shaanxi%20and%20Hubei%29">Han River</a> (in modern southwest <a href="Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a>). Following Liu Bang's victory in the <a href="Chu%E2%80%93Han%20Contention">Chu–Han Contention</a>, the resulting Han dynasty was named after the Hanzhong fief.

<a href="China">China</a>'s first <a href="Dynasties%20in%20Chinese%20history">imperial dynasty</a> was the <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> (221–207 BC). The Qin unified the Chinese <a href="Warring%20States%20period">Warring States</a> by conquest, but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor <a href="Qin%20Shi%20Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a>. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, <a href="Xiang%20Yu">Xiang Yu</a> (d. 202 BC) of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Chu">Chu</a> and <a href="Liu%20Bang">Liu Bang</a> (d. 195 BC) of <a href="Hanzhong">Han</a>, engaged <a href="Chu-Han%20contention">in a war</a> to decide who would become <a href="wikt%3Ahegemony">hegemon</a> of China, which had fissured into <a href="Eighteen%20Kingdoms">18 kingdoms</a>, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Although Xiang Yu proved to be a capable commander, Liu Bang defeated him at <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaixia">Battle of Gaixia</a> (202 BC), in modern-day <a href="Anhui">Anhui</a>. Liu Bang assumed the title <a href="Emperor%20of%20China">"emperor"</a> ("huangdi") at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as <a href="Emperor%20Gaozu%20of%20Han">Emperor Gaozu</a> (r. 202–195 BC). <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a> (known today as Xi'an) was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han.

At the beginning of the Western Han (), also known as the Former Han () dynasty, thirteen centrally controlled <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">commanderies</a>—including the capital region—existed in the western third of the empire, while the eastern two-thirds were divided into ten <a href="Kings%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">semi-autonomous kingdoms</a>. To placate his prominent commanders from the war with Chu, Emperor Gaozu <a href="Enfeoffment">enfeoffed</a> some of them as kings. By 157 BC, the Han court had replaced all of these kings with royal <a href="Liu">Liu</a> family members, since the loyalty of non-relatives to the throne was questioned. After several insurrections by Han kings—the largest being the <a href="Rebellion%20of%20the%20Seven%20States">Rebellion of the Seven States</a> in 154 BC—the imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in 145 BC limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new centrally controlled commanderies. Kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff; this duty was assumed by the imperial court. Kings became nominal heads of their <a href="fief">fief</a>s and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes. The kingdoms were never entirely abolished and existed throughout the remainder of Western and Eastern Han.

To the north of <a href="China%20proper">China proper</a>, the nomadic <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> chieftain <a href="Modu%20Chanyu">Modu Chanyu</a> (r. 209–174 BC) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the <a href="Eurasian%20Steppe">Eurasian Steppe</a>. By the end of his reign, he controlled <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, and the <a href="Tarim%20Basin">Tarim Basin</a>, subjugating over twenty states east of <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a>. Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders, and he established a trade <a href="embargo">embargo</a> against the group. In retaliation, the Xiongnu invaded what is now <a href="Shanxi">Shanxi</a> province, where they <a href="Battle%20of%20Baideng">defeated the Han forces at Baideng</a> in 200 BC. After negotiations, the "<a href="heqin">heqin</a>" agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance, but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as <a href="silk">silk</a> clothes, food, and wine to the Xiongnu.

Despite the tribute and a negotiation between <a href="Laoshang%20Chanyu">Laoshang Chanyu</a> (r. 174–160 BC) and <a href="Emperor%20Wen%20of%20Han">Emperor Wen</a> (r. 180–157 BC) to reopen border markets, many of the <a href="Chanyu">Chanyu</a>'s Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the <a href="Great%20Wall%20of%20China">Great Wall</a> for additional goods. In a court conference assembled by <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu</a> (r. 141–87 BC) in 135 BC, the <a href="Consensus%20decision-making">majority consensus</a> of the ministers was to retain the "heqin" agreement. Emperor Wu accepted this, despite continuing Xiongnu raids. However, a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a <a href="Battle%20of%20Mayi">limited engagement at Mayi</a> involving the assassination of the Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han. When this plot failed in 133 BC, Emperor Wu launched a series of <a href="Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu%20War">massive military invasions</a> into Xiongnu territory. The assault culminated in 119 BC at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mobei">Battle of Mobei</a>, where the Han commanders <a href="Huo%20Qubing">Huo Qubing</a> (d. 117 BC) and <a href="Wei%20Qing">Wei Qing</a> (d. 106 BC) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a>.

After Wu's reign, Han forces continued to prevail against the Xiongnu. The Xiongnu leader Huhanye Chanyu (呼韓邪) (r. 58–31 BC) finally submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in 51 BC. His rival claimant to the throne, <a href="Zhizhi%20Chanyu">Zhizhi Chanyu</a> (r. 56–36 BC), was killed by <a href="Chen%20Tang">Chen Tang</a> and Gan Yanshou (甘延壽/甘延寿) at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zhizhi">Battle of Zhizhi</a>, in modern <a href="Taraz">Taraz</a>, <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>.

In 121 BC, Han forces expelled the Xiongnu from a vast territory spanning the <a href="Hexi%20Corridor">Hexi Corridor</a> to <a href="Lop%20Nur">Lop Nur</a>. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-<a href="Qiang%20people">Qiang</a> invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: <a href="Jiuquan">Jiuquan</a>, <a href="Zhangyi">Zhangyi</a>, <a href="Dunhuang">Dunhuang</a>, and <a href="Wuwei%2C%20Gansu">Wuwei</a>. The majority of people on the frontier were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged <a href="commoner">commoner</a>s, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.

Even before Han's expansion into Central Asia, diplomat <a href="Zhang%20Qian">Zhang Qian</a>'s travels from 139 to 125 BC had established Chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations. Zhang encountered <a href="Dayuan">Dayuan</a> (<a href="Fergana">Fergana</a>), <a href="Kangju">Kangju</a> (<a href="Sogdiana">Sogdiana</a>), and <a href="Daxia">Daxia</a> (<a href="Bactria">Bactria</a>, formerly the <a href="Greco-Bactrian%20Kingdom">Greco-Bactrian Kingdom</a>); he also gathered information on Shendu (<a href="Indus%20River">Indus River</a> valley of <a href="North%20India">North India</a>) and Anxi (the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>). All of these countries eventually received Han embassies. These connections marked the beginning of the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> trade network that extended to the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, bringing <a href="History%20of%20silk">Han items like silk</a> to Rome and <a href="Roman%20glass">Roman goods such as glasswares</a> to China.

From roughly 115 to 60 BC, Han forces fought the Xiongnu over control of the oasis <a href="city-state">city-state</a>s in the Tarim Basin. Han was eventually victorious and established the <a href="Protectorate%20of%20the%20Western%20Regions">Protectorate of the Western Regions</a> in 60 BC, which dealt with the region's defense and foreign affairs. The Han also <a href="Southward%20expansion%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">expanded southward</a>. The <a href="Han%E2%80%93Nanyue%20War">naval conquest of Nanyue</a> in 111 BC expanded the Han realm into what are now modern <a href="Guangdong">Guangdong</a>, <a href="Guangxi">Guangxi</a>, and <a href="Northern%20and%20southern%20Vietnam">northern Vietnam</a>. <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> was brought into the Han realm with the <a href="Han%20campaigns%20against%20Dian">conquest</a> of the <a href="Dian%20Kingdom">Dian Kingdom</a> in 109 BC, followed by parts of the <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a> with the <a href="Han%20conquest%20of%20Gojoseon">Han conquest of Gojoseon</a> and colonial establishments of <a href="Xuantu%20Commandery">Xuantu Commandery</a> and <a href="Lelang%20Commandery">Lelang Commandery</a> in 108 BC. In China's first known nationwide <a href="census">census</a> taken in 2 AD, the population was registered as having 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households.

To pay for his military campaigns and colonial expansion, Emperor Wu <a href="Nationalization">nationalized</a> several private industries. He created central government <a href="Monopoly">monopolies</a> administered largely by <a href="Four%20occupations">former merchants</a>. These monopolies included salt, <a href="History%20of%20ferrous%20metallurgy">iron</a>, and <a href="Chinese%20alcoholic%20beverages">liquor</a> production, as well as <a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage">bronze-coin currency</a>. The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty. The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court. The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent <a href="Regent">regency</a> of <a href="Huo%20Guang">Huo Guang</a> (d. 68 BC). The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy. The Reformists, however, overturned these policies, favoring a cautious, non-expansionary approach to foreign policy, frugal <a href="Government%20budget">budget</a> reform, and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs.

<a href="Wang%20Zhengjun">Wang Zhengjun</a> (71 BC–13 AD) was first empress, then <a href="empress%20dowager">empress dowager</a>, and finally <a href="grand%20empress%20dowager">grand empress dowager</a> during the reigns of the Emperors <a href="Emperor%20Yuan%20of%20Han">Yuan</a> (r. 49–33 BC), <a href="Emperor%20Cheng%20of%20Han">Cheng</a> (r. 33–7 BC), and <a href="Emperor%20Ai%20of%20Han">Ai</a> (r. 7–1 BC), respectively. During this time, a succession of her male relatives held the title of regent. Following the death of Ai, Wang Zhengjun's nephew <a href="Wang%20Mang">Wang Mang</a> (45 BC–23 AD) was appointed regent as Marshall of State on 16 August under <a href="Emperor%20Ping%20of%20Han">Emperor Ping</a> (r. 1 BC–6 AD). When Ping died on 3 February 6 AD, <a href="Ruzi%20Ying">Ruzi Ying</a> (d. 25 AD) was chosen as the heir and Wang Mang was appointed to serve as acting emperor for the child. Wang promised to relinquish his control to Liu Ying once he came of age. Despite this promise, and against protest and revolts from the nobility, Wang Mang claimed on 10 January that the divine <a href="Mandate%20of%20Heaven">Mandate of Heaven</a> called for the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of his own: the <a href="Xin%20dynasty">Xin dynasty</a> (9–23 AD).

Wang Mang initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. These reforms included <a href="History%20of%20slavery">outlawing slavery</a>, <a href="nationalization">nationalizing</a> land to <a href="Well-field%20system">equally distribute</a> between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the <a href="Yellow%20River">Yellow River</a> had raised its water level and overwhelmed the <a href="Flood%20control">flood control works</a>. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying to the north and the other to the south of the <a href="Shandong%20Peninsula">Shandong Peninsula</a>, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.

The flood dislodged thousands of peasant farmers, many of whom joined roving bandit and rebel groups such as the <a href="Red%20Eyebrows%20Rebellions">Red Eyebrows</a> to survive. Wang Mang's armies were incapable of quelling these enlarged rebel groups. Eventually, an insurgent mob forced their way into the <a href="Weiyang%20Palace">Weiyang Palace</a> and killed Wang Mang.

The <a href="Gengshi%20Emperor">Gengshi Emperor</a> (r. 23–25 AD), a descendant of <a href="Emperor%20Jing%20of%20Han">Emperor Jing</a> (r. 157–141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital. However, he was overwhelmed by the Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed, assassinated, and replaced him with the puppet monarch <a href="Liu%20Penzi">Liu Penzi</a>. Gengshi's brother Liu Xiu, known posthumously as <a href="Emperor%20Guangwu%20of%20Han">Emperor Guangwu</a> (r. 25–57 AD), after distinguishing himself at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kunyang">Battle of Kunyang</a> in 23 AD, was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor.

Under Guangwu's rule the Han Empire was restored. Guangwu made <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a> his capital in 25 AD, and by 27 AD his officers <a href="Deng%20Yu">Deng Yu</a> and <a href="Feng%20Yi">Feng Yi</a> had forced the Red Eyebrows to surrender and executed their leaders for <a href="treason">treason</a>. From 26 until 36 AD, Emperor Guangwu had to wage war against other regional warlords who claimed the title of emperor; when these warlords were defeated, China reunified under the Han.

The period between the foundation of the Han dynasty and Wang Mang's reign is known as the Western Han () or Former Han () (206 BC–9 AD). During this period the capital was at <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a> (modern <a href="Xi%27an">Xi'an</a>). From the reign of Guangwu the capital was moved eastward to Luoyang. The era from his reign until <a href="End%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">the fall of Han</a> is known as the Eastern Han or Later Han (25–220 AD).

The Eastern Han (), also known as the Later Han (), formally began on 5 August 25, when Liu Xiu became <a href="Emperor%20Guangwu%20of%20Han">Emperor Guangwu of Han</a>. During the widespread rebellion against Wang Mang, the state of <a href="Goguryeo">Goguryeo</a> was free to raid Han's <a href="Four%20Commanderies%20of%20Han">Korean commanderies</a>; Han did not reaffirm its control over the region until AD 30. The <a href="Tr%C6%B0ng%20Sisters">Trưng Sisters</a> of <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> rebelled against Han in AD 40. Their rebellion was crushed by Han general <a href="Ma%20Yuan%20%28Han%20dynasty%29">Ma Yuan</a> (d. AD 49) in a campaign from AD 42–43. Wang Mang renewed hostilities against the <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a>, who were estranged from Han until their leader Bi (比), a rival claimant to the throne against his cousin Punu (蒲奴), submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in AD 50. This created two rival Xiongnu states: the Southern Xiongnu led by Bi, an ally of Han, and the Northern Xiongnu led by Punu, an enemy of Han.

During the turbulent reign of Wang Mang, China lost control over the Tarim Basin, which was conquered by the Northern Xiongnu in AD 63 and used as a base to invade the Hexi Corridor in <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a>. <a href="Dou%20Gu">Dou Gu</a> (d. 88 AD) defeated the Northern Xiongnu at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Yiwulu">Battle of Yiwulu</a> in AD 73, evicting them from <a href="Turpan">Turpan</a> and chasing them as far as <a href="Barkol%20Kazakh%20Autonomous%20County">Lake Barkol</a> before establishing a garrison <a href="Hami%20Prefecture">at Hami</a>. After the new Protector General of the Western Regions <a href="Chen%20Mu">Chen Mu</a> (d. AD 75) was killed by allies of the Xiongnu in <a href="Karasahr">Karasahr</a> and <a href="Kucha">Kucha</a>, the garrison at Hami was withdrawn. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ikh%20Bayan">Battle of Ikh Bayan</a> in AD 89, <a href="Dou%20Xian">Dou Xian</a> (d. AD 92) defeated the <a href="Northern%20Chanyu%20%281st%20century%29">Northern Xiongnu chanyu</a> who then retreated into the <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai Mountains</a>. After the Northern Xiongnu fled into the <a href="Ili%20River">Ili River</a> valley in AD 91, the nomadic <a href="Xianbei">Xianbei</a> occupied the area from the borders of the <a href="Buyeo%20Kingdom">Buyeo Kingdom</a> in Manchuria to the Ili River of the <a href="Wusun">Wusun</a> people. The Xianbei reached their apogee under Tanshihuai (檀石槐) (d. AD 180), who consistently defeated Chinese armies. However, Tanshihuai's confederation disintegrated after his death.

<a href="Ban%20Chao">Ban Chao</a> (d. AD 102) enlisted the aid of the <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushan Empire</a>, occupying the area of modern <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>, to subdue <a href="Kashgar">Kashgar</a> and its ally Sogdiana. When a request by Kushan ruler <a href="Vima%20Kadphises">Vima Kadphises</a> (r. c. 90–c. 100 AD) for a marriage alliance with the Han was rejected in AD 90, he sent his forces to <a href="Wakhan">Wakhan</a> (Afghanistan) to attack Ban Chao. The conflict ended with the Kushans withdrawing because of lack of supplies. In AD 91, the office of Protector General of the Western Regions was reinstated when it was bestowed on Ban Chao.
Foreign travelers to Eastern-Han China include <a href="Bhikkhu">Buddhist monks</a> who <a href="Silk%20Road%20transmission%20of%20Buddhism">translated works into Chinese</a>, such as <a href="An%20Shigao">An Shigao</a> from Parthia, and <a href="Lokaksema%20%28Buddhist%20monk%29">Lokaksema</a> from Kushan-era <a href="Gandhara">Gandhara</a>, India. In addition to tributary relations with the Kushans, the Han Empire received gifts from the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>, from a king in modern <a href="Burma">Burma</a>, from a ruler <a href="Wa%20%28Japan%29">in Japan</a>, and initiated an unsuccessful mission to <a href="Daqin">Daqin</a> (<a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>) in AD 97 with <a href="Gan%20Ying">Gan Ying</a> as emissary. A <a href="Sino-Roman%20relations">Roman embassy</a> of Emperor <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> (r. 161–180 AD) is recorded in the "<a href="Weil%C3%BCe">Weilüe</a>" and "<a href="Hou%20Hanshu">Hou Hanshu</a>" to have reached the court of <a href="Emperor%20Huan%20of%20Han">Emperor Huan of Han</a> (r. AD 146–168) in AD 166, yet <a href="Rafe%20de%20Crespigny">Rafe de Crespigny</a> asserts that this was most likely a group of <a href="Roman%20commerce">Roman merchants</a>. In addition to <a href="Roman%20glass">Roman glass</a>wares and <a href="Roman%20currency">coins</a> found in China, Roman <a href="medal">medal</a>lions from the reign of <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a> and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius have been found at <a href="%C3%93c%20Eo">Óc Eo</a> in Vietnam. This was near the commandery of <a href="Rinan">Rinan</a> (also <a href="Jiaozhi">Jiaozhi</a>) where Chinese sources claim the Romans first landed, as well as embassies from <a href="Tianzhu%20%28India%29">Tianzhu</a> (in northern India) in the years 159 and 161. Óc Eo is also thought to be the port city "<a href="Cattigara">Cattigara</a>" described by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> in his "<a href="Geography%20%28Ptolemy%29">Geography</a>" (c. 150 AD) as lying east of the <a href="Golden%20Chersonese">Golden Chersonese</a> (<a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a>) along the "<a href="Magnus%20Sinus">Magnus Sinus</a>" (i.e. <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> and <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>), where <a href="Indo-Roman%20trade%20relations">a Greek sailor</a> had visited.
<a href="Emperor%20Zhang%20of%20Han">Emperor Zhang's</a> (r. 75–88 AD) reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house. Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a> intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial <a href="consort%20clan">consort clan</a>s. With the aid of the eunuch <a href="Zheng%20Zhong">Zheng Zhong</a> (d. 107 AD), <a href="Emperor%20He%20of%20Han">Emperor He</a> (r. 88–105 AD) had <a href="Empress%20Dou%20%28Zhang%29">Empress Dowager Dou</a> (d. 97 AD) put under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—<a href="Consort%20Liang">Consort Liang</a>—and then concealing her identity from him. After Emperor He's death, his wife <a href="Empress%20Deng%20Sui">Empress Deng Sui</a> (d. 121 AD) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD.

When Empress Dowager Deng died, <a href="Emperor%20An%20of%20Han">Emperor An</a> (r. 106–125 AD) was convinced by the accusations of the eunuchs Li Run () and Jiang Jing () that Deng and her family had planned to depose him. An dismissed Deng's clan members from office, exiled them and forced many to commit suicide. After An's death, his wife, <a href="Empress%20Yan%20Ji">Empress Dowager Yan</a> (d. 126 AD) placed the child <a href="Marquess%20of%20Beixiang">Marquess of Beixiang</a> on the throne in an attempt to retain power within her family. However, palace eunuch <a href="Sun%20Cheng">Sun Cheng</a> (d. 132 AD) masterminded a successful overthrow of her regime to enthrone <a href="Emperor%20Shun%20of%20Han">Emperor Shun of Han</a> (r. 125–144 AD). Yan was placed under house arrest, her relatives were either killed or exiled, and her eunuch allies were slaughtered. The regent <a href="Liang%20Ji">Liang Ji</a> (d. 159 AD), brother of <a href="Empress%20Liang%20Na">Empress Liang Na</a> (d. 150 AD), had the brother-in-law of <a href="Empress%20Deng%20Mengn%C3%BC">Consort Deng Mengnü</a> (later empress) (d. 165 AD) killed after Deng Mengnü resisted Liang Ji's attempts to control her. Afterward, Emperor Huan employed eunuchs to depose Liang Ji, who was then forced to commit suicide.
Students from the <a href="Taixue">Imperial University</a> organized a widespread <a href="student%20protest">student protest</a> against the eunuchs of Emperor Huan's court. Huan further alienated the bureaucracy when he initiated grandiose construction projects and hosted thousands of <a href="concubine">concubine</a>s in his <a href="harem">harem</a> at a time of economic crisis. Palace eunuchs imprisoned the official Li Ying () and his associates from the Imperial University on a dubious charge of treason. In 167 AD, the Grand Commandant <a href="Dou%20Wu">Dou Wu</a> (d. 168 AD) convinced his son-in-law, Emperor Huan, to release them. However the emperor permanently barred Li Ying and his associates from serving in office, marking the beginning of the <a href="Disasters%20of%20Partisan%20Prohibitions">Partisan Prohibitions</a>.

Following Huan's death, Dou Wu and the Grand Tutor Chen Fan () (d. 168 AD) attempted a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> against the eunuchs <a href="Hou%20Lan">Hou Lan</a> (d. 172 AD), <a href="Cao%20Jie%20%28eunuch%29">Cao Jie</a> (d. 181 AD), and Wang Fu (). When the plot was uncovered, the eunuchs arrested <a href="Empress%20Dou%20Miao">Empress Dowager Dou</a> (d. 172 AD) and Chen Fan. General Zhang Huan () favored the eunuchs. He and his troops confronted Dou Wu and his retainers at the palace gate where each side shouted accusations of treason against the other. When the retainers gradually deserted Dou Wu, he was forced to commit suicide.

Under <a href="Emperor%20Ling%20of%20Han">Emperor Ling</a> (r. 168–189 AD) the eunuchs had the partisan prohibitions renewed and expanded, while also auctioning off top government offices. Many affairs of state were entrusted to the eunuchs <a href="Zhao%20Zhong">Zhao Zhong</a> (d. 189 AD) and <a href="Zhang%20Rang">Zhang Rang</a> (d. 189 AD) while Emperor Ling spent much of his time <a href="Sexual%20roleplay">roleplaying</a> with concubines and participating in military parades.

The Partisan Prohibitions were repealed during the <a href="Yellow%20Turban%20Rebellion">Yellow Turban Rebellion</a> and <a href="Way%20of%20the%20Five%20Pecks%20of%20Rice">Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion</a> in 184 AD, largely because the court did not want to continue to alienate a significant portion of the <a href="Four%20occupations">gentry class</a> who might otherwise join the rebellions. The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical <a href="Taoism">Daoist</a> religious societies led by <a href="Faith%20healing">faith healers</a> <a href="Zhang%20Jue">Zhang Jue</a> (d. 184 AD) and <a href="Zhang%20Lu%20%28Three%20Kingdoms%29">Zhang Lu</a> (d. 216 AD), respectively. Zhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a> and southern <a href="Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a>, was not quelled until 215 AD. Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across eight <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Provincial%20authorities">provinces</a> was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings. Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled <a href="militia">militia</a> forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority.

General-in-Chief <a href="He%20Jin">He Jin</a> (d. 189 AD), half-brother to <a href="Empress%20He%20%28Han%20dynasty%29">Empress He</a> (d. 189 AD), plotted with <a href="Yuan%20Shao">Yuan Shao</a> (d. 202 AD) to overthrow the eunuchs by having several generals march to the outskirts of the capital. There, in a written petition to Empress He, they demanded the eunuchs' execution. After a period of hesitation, Empress He consented. When the eunuchs discovered this, however, they had her brother He Miao () rescind the order. The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22, 189 AD. Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyang's Northern Palace while his brother <a href="Yuan%20Shu">Yuan Shu</a> (d. 199 AD) besieged the Southern Palace. On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed. Zhang Rang had previously fled with <a href="Liu%20Bian">Emperor Shao</a> (r. 189 AD) and his brother Liu Xie—the future <a href="Emperor%20Xian%20of%20Han">Emperor Xian of Han</a> (r. 189–220 AD). While being pursued by the Yuan brothers, Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River.
General <a href="Dong%20Zhuo">Dong Zhuo</a> (d. 192 AD) found the young emperor and his brother wandering in the countryside. He escorted them safely back to the capital and was made <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Minister%20of%20Works">Minister of Works</a>, taking control of Luoyang and forcing Yuan Shao to flee. After Dong Zhuo demoted Emperor Shao and promoted his brother Liu Xie as Emperor Xian, Yuan Shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against Dong, who burned Luoyang to the ground and resettled the court at Chang'an in May 191 AD. Dong Zhuo later poisoned Emperor Shao.

Dong was killed by his adopted son <a href="L%C3%BC%20Bu">Lü Bu</a> (d. 198 AD) in a plot hatched by <a href="Wang%20Yun%20%28Han%20dynasty%29">Wang Yun</a> (d. 192 AD). Emperor Xian fled from Chang'an in 195 AD to the ruins of Luoyang. Xian was persuaded by <a href="Cao%20Cao">Cao Cao</a> (155–220 AD), then Governor of Yan Province in modern western <a href="Shandong">Shandong</a> and eastern <a href="Henan">Henan</a>, to move the capital to <a href="Xuchang">Xuchang</a> in 196 AD.

Yuan Shao challenged Cao Cao for control over the emperor. Yuan's power was greatly diminished after Cao defeated him at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guandu">Battle of Guandu</a> in 200 AD. After Yuan died, Cao killed Yuan Shao's son <a href="Yuan%20Tan">Yuan Tan</a> (173–205 AD), who had fought with his brothers over the family inheritance. His brothers <a href="Yuan%20Shang">Yuan Shang</a> and <a href="Yuan%20Xi">Yuan Xi</a> were killed in 207 AD by <a href="Gongsun%20Kang">Gongsun Kang</a> (d. 221 AD), who sent their heads to Cao Cao.

After Cao's defeat at the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Red%20Cliffs">Battle of Red Cliffs</a> in 208 AD, China was divided into three spheres of influence, with Cao Cao dominating the north, <a href="Sun%20Quan">Sun Quan</a> (182–252 AD) dominating the south, and <a href="Liu%20Bei">Liu Bei</a> (161–223 AD) dominating the west. Cao Cao died in March 220 AD. By December his son <a href="Cao%20Pi">Cao Pi</a> (187–226 AD) had Emperor Xian relinquish the throne to him and is known posthumously as <a href="Cao%20Pi">Emperor Wen of Wei</a>. This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated an age of conflict between <a href="Three%20Kingdoms">three states</a>: <a href="Cao%20Wei">Cao Wei</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Wu">Eastern Wu</a>, and <a href="Shu%20Han">Shu Han</a>.

In the hierarchical social order, the <a href="Emperor%20of%20China">emperor</a> was at the apex of Han society and government. However the emperor was often a minor, ruled over by a <a href="regent">regent</a> such as the <a href="empress%20dowager">empress dowager</a> or one of her male relatives. Ranked immediately below the emperor were <a href="Kings%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">the kings</a> who were of the same <a href="Liu">Liu</a> family clan. The rest of society, including <a href="Chinese%20nobility">nobles</a> lower than kings and all commoners excluding <a href="slave">slave</a>s belonged to one of twenty ranks ("ershi gongcheng" ).

Each successive rank gave its holder greater pensions and legal privileges. The highest rank, of full <a href="marquess">marquess</a>, came with a state pension and a territorial <a href="fief">fief</a>dom. Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received a pension, but had no territorial rule. <a href="Scholar-bureaucrat">Officials</a> who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government officials could be <a href="Enfeoffment">enfeoffed</a> as marquesses. By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to identify themselves as members of a larger, nationwide <a href="Gentry%20%28China%29">gentry class</a> with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship. When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office.

The <a href="farmer">farmer</a>, or specifically the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and officials in the social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as <a href="Leasehold%20estate">tenants</a>, <a href="Day%20labor">wage laborers</a>, and in rare cases slaves. <a href="Artisan">Artisan</a>s, technicians, tradespeople and craftsmen had a legal and <a href="socioeconomic%20status">socioeconomic status</a> between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common <a href="merchant">merchant</a>s. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than the vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come and go from their master's home as they pleased. <a href="Traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">Medical physicians</a>, pig breeders, and <a href="butcher">butcher</a>s had a fairly high social status, while <a href="Divination">occultist diviners</a>, runners, and messengers had low status.

The Han-era family was <a href="Patrilineality">patrilineal</a> and typically had four to five <a href="nuclear%20family">nuclear family</a> members living in one household. Multiple generations of <a href="extended%20family">extended family</a> members did not occupy the same house, unlike families of later dynasties. According to <a href="Confucianism">Confucian family norms</a>, various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy. For example, there were different accepted time frames for mourning the death of a father versus a paternal uncle.

Marriages were highly ritualized, particularly for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as <a href="Bride%20price">bridewealth</a> and <a href="dowry">dowry</a>, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife, but as a <a href="Concubinage">concubine</a>. <a href="Arranged%20marriage">Arranged marriage</a>s were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered more important than the mother's. <a href="Monogamy">Monogamous marriages</a> were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to <a href="divorce">divorce</a> their spouses and remarry. However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee. Her children would not be allowed to go with her.

Apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks, <a href="inheritance">inheritance</a> practices did not involve <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>; each son received an equal share of the family property. Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their <a href="dowry">marriage dowries</a>, though this was usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a <a href="last%20will%20and%20testament">will</a>, but it is unclear how common this was.

Women were expected to obey the will of their father, then their husband, and then their adult son in old age. However, it is known from contemporary sources that there were many deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over their sons, and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers. Women were exempt from the annual <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a> labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning.

The most common occupation for women was weaving clothes for the family, sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women. Other women helped on their brothers' farms or became singers, dancers, <a href="Witchcraft">sorceresses</a>, respected medical physicians, and successful merchants who could afford their own silk clothes. Some women formed spinning collectives, aggregating the resources of several different families.

The early Western Han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of <a href="Legalism%20%28Chinese%20philosophy%29">Legalism</a>, <a href="Huang-Lao">Huang-Lao Daoism</a>, and <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> in making state decisions and shaping government policy. However, the Han court under <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu</a> gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites ("bóshì" 博士) not dealing with the Confucian <a href="Five%20Classics">Five Classics</a> in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the <a href="Taixue">Imperial University</a> that he established in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology espoused by <a href="Confucius">Confucius</a>, or Kongzi (551–479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of <a href="Dong%20Zhongshu">Dong Zhongshu</a> (179–104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of <a href="Li%20%28Confucian%29">ritual</a>, <a href="filial%20piety">filial piety</a>, and <a href="Ren%20%28Confucianism%29">harmonious relationships</a> with <a href="Wu%20Xing">five phases</a> and <a href="Yin%20and%20yang">yin-yang</a> cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe. The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century AD. A Confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and <a href="private%20school">private school</a>s opened in small towns, where teachers earned respectable incomes from <a href="tuition">tuition</a> payments.

Some important texts were created and studied by scholars. Philosophical works written by <a href="Yang%20Xiong%20%28author%29">Yang Xiong</a> (53 BC–18 AD), <a href="Huan%20Tan">Huan Tan</a> (43 BC–28 AD), <a href="Wang%20Chong">Wang Chong</a> (27–100 AD), and <a href="Wang%20Fu%20%28philosopher%29">Wang Fu</a> (78–163 AD) questioned whether human nature was innately good or evil and posed challenges to Dong's universal order. The "<a href="Shiji">Records of the Grand Historian</a>" by <a href="Sima%20Tan">Sima Tan</a> (d. 110 BC) and his son <a href="Sima%20Qian">Sima Qian</a> (145–86 BC) <a href="Chinese%20historiography">established the standard model</a> for all of imperial China's <a href="Twenty-Four%20Histories">Standard Histories</a>, such as the "<a href="Book%20of%20Han">Book of Han</a>" written by <a href="Ban%20Biao">Ban Biao</a> (3–54 AD), his son <a href="Ban%20Gu">Ban Gu</a> (32–92 AD), and his daughter <a href="Ban%20Zhao">Ban Zhao</a> (45–116 AD). There were <a href="Chinese%20dictionaries">dictionaries</a> such as the "<a href="Shuowen%20Jiezi">Shuowen Jiezi</a>" by <a href="Xu%20Shen">Xu Shen</a> (c. 58–c. 147 AD) and the "<a href="Fangyan">Fangyan</a>" by Yang Xiong. <a href="Biography">Biographies</a> on important figures were written by various gentrymen. Han dynasty poetry was dominated by the <a href="Fu%20%28poetry%29">"fu" genre</a>, which achieved its greatest prominence during the reign of Emperor Wu.

Han scholars such as <a href="Jia%20Yi">Jia Yi</a> (201–169 BC) portrayed the previous <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> as a brutal regime. However, archaeological evidence from <a href="Zhangjiashan%20Han%20bamboo%20texts">Zhangjiashan</a> and <a href="Shuihudi%20Qin%20bamboo%20texts">Shuihudi</a> reveal that many of the <a href="statute">statute</a>s in the Han <a href="Code%20%28law%29">law code</a> compiled by Chancellor <a href="Xiao%20He">Xiao He</a> (d. 193 BC) were derived from Qin law.

Various cases for <a href="rape">rape</a>, physical abuse and <a href="murder">murder</a> were prosecuted in court. Women, although usually having fewer rights by custom, were allowed to level civil and criminal charges against men. While suspects were jailed, convicted criminals were never imprisoned. Instead, punishments were commonly monetary fines, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, and the penalty of death by beheading. Early Han punishments of <a href="torture">torturous</a> <a href="mutilation">mutilation</a> were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the <a href="bastinado">bastinado</a>.

Acting as a judge in lawsuits was one of many duties of the <a href="County%20magistrate%20%28China%29">county magistrate</a> and Administrators of commanderies. Complex, high-profile or unresolved cases were often deferred to the Minister of Justice in the capital or even the emperor. In each Han county was several districts, each overseen by a <a href="chief%20of%20police">chief of police</a>. Order in the cities was maintained by government officers in the marketplaces and <a href="constable">constable</a>s in the neighborhoods.

The most common staple crops consumed during Han were <a href="wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="barley">barley</a>, <a href="foxtail%20millet">foxtail millet</a>, <a href="proso%20millet">proso millet</a>, rice, and <a href="bean">bean</a>s. Commonly eaten fruits and vegetables included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, <a href="red%20bayberry">red bayberries</a>, <a href="jujube">jujube</a>s, <a href="calabash">calabash</a>, <a href="bamboo%20shoot">bamboo shoot</a>s, <a href="mustard%20plant">mustard plant</a> and <a href="taro">taro</a>. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, <a href="Mandarin%20duck">Mandarin duck</a>s, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, <a href="sika%20deer">sika deer</a>, and <a href="Chinese%20bamboo%20partridge">Chinese bamboo partridge</a> were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and <a href="soy%20sauce">soy sauce</a>. <a href="Chinese%20alcoholic%20beverages">Beer and wine</a> were regularly consumed.

The types of clothing worn and the materials used during the Han period depended upon social class. Wealthy folk could afford <a href="silk">silk</a> robes, skirts, socks, and mittens, coats made of <a href="Fur%20clothing">badger or fox fur</a>, duck plumes, and <a href="slippers">slippers</a> with inlaid leather, <a href="pearl">pearl</a>s, and silk lining. Peasants commonly wore clothes made of <a href="hemp">hemp</a>, <a href="wool">wool</a>, and <a href="ferret">ferret</a> skins.

Families throughout Han China made ritual sacrifices of animals and food to deities, spirits, and <a href="Ancestor%20worship">ancestors</a> at <a href="Temple%20%28Chinese%29">temples and shrines</a>. They believed that these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm. It was thought that each person had a <a href="Hun%20and%20po">two-part soul</a>: the spirit-soul ("hun" 魂) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals ("<a href="Xian%20%28Taoism%29">xian</a>"), and the body-soul ("po" 魄) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony.

In addition to his many other roles, the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to <a href="Tian">Heaven</a>, the main deities known as the <a href="Three%20Sovereigns%20and%20Five%20Emperors">Five Powers</a>, and the <a href="Shen%20%28Chinese%20religion%29">spirits</a> ("shen" 神) of mountains and rivers. It was believed that the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were linked by natural cycles of <a href="yin%20and%20yang">yin and yang</a> and the <a href="Wu%20Xing">five phases</a>. If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts.
It was believed that <a href="immortality">immortality</a> could be achieved if one reached the lands of the <a href="Queen%20Mother%20of%20the%20West">Queen Mother of the West</a> or <a href="Mount%20Penglai">Mount Penglai</a>. Han-era <a href="Daoism">Daoists</a> assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises, sexual techniques and use of <a href="Elixir%20of%20life">medical elixirs</a>. By the 2nd century AD, Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the <a href="Way%20of%20the%20Five%20Pecks%20of%20Rice">Way of the Five Pecks of Rice</a>. Its followers believed that the sage-philosopher <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a> (fl. 6th century BC) was a holy <a href="prophet">prophet</a> who would offer <a href="salvation">salvation</a> and good health if his devout followers would <a href="Confession%20%28religion%29">confess their sins</a>, ban the worship of unclean gods who accepted meat sacrifices and chant sections of the "<a href="Tao%20Te%20Ching">Daodejing</a>".

<a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> first entered China during the Eastern Han and was first mentioned in 65 AD. <a href="Liu%20Ying%20%28prince%29">Liu Ying</a> (d. 71 AD), a half-brother to <a href="Emperor%20Ming%20of%20Han">Emperor Ming of Han</a> (r. 57–75 AD), was one of its earliest Chinese adherents, although <a href="Chinese%20Buddhism">Chinese Buddhism</a> at this point was heavily associated with <a href="Society%20and%20culture%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Competing%20ideologies">Huang-Lao Daoism</a>. China's first known Buddhist temple, the <a href="White%20Horse%20Temple">White Horse Temple</a>, was constructed outside the wall of the capital, <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>, during Emperor Ming's reign. Important Buddhist canons were translated into Chinese during the 2nd century AD, including the "<a href="Sutra%20of%20Forty-two%20Chapters">Sutra of Forty-two Chapters</a>", "<a href="Perfection%20of%20Wisdom">Perfection of Wisdom</a>", "<a href="Shurangama%20Sutra">Shurangama Sutra</a>", and "<a href="Pratyutpanna%20Sutra">Pratyutpanna Sutra</a>".

In Han government, the emperor was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Salaries">600-bushel salary-rank or higher</a>. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference ("tingyi" 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach <a href="Consensus%20decision-making">majority consensus</a> on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.

Below the emperor were his <a href="cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a> members known as the <a href="Three%20Councillors%20of%20State">Three Councillors of State</a> ("San gong" 三公). These were the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20China">Chancellor</a> or <a href="Minister%20over%20the%20Masses">Minister over the Masses</a> ("Chengxiang" 丞相 or "Da situ" 大司徒), the Imperial Counselor or Excellency of Works ("Yushi dafu" 御史大夫 or "Da sikong" 大司空), and Grand Commandant or Grand Marshal ("Taiwei" 太尉 or "Da sima" 大司馬).

The Chancellor, whose title was changed to 'Minister over the Masses' in 8 BC, was chiefly responsible for drafting the <a href="government%20budget">government budget</a>. The Chancellor's other duties included managing provincial registers for land and population, leading court conferences, acting as judge in lawsuits and recommending nominees for high office. He could appoint officials below the salary-rank of 600 bushels.

The Imperial Counselor's chief duty was to conduct disciplinary procedures for officials. He shared similar duties with the Chancellor, such as receiving annual provincial reports. However, when his title was changed to Minister of Works in 8 BC, his chief duty became oversight of public works projects.

The Grand Commandant, whose title was changed to Grand Marshal in 119 BC before reverting to Grand Commandant in 51 AD, was the irregularly posted commander of the military and then <a href="regent">regent</a> during the Western Han period. In the Eastern Han era he was chiefly a civil official who shared many of the same censorial powers as the other two Councillors of State.

Ranked below the Three Councillors of State were the <a href="Nine%20Ministers">Nine Ministers</a> ("Jiu qing" 九卿), who each headed a specialized ministry. The Minister of Ceremonies ("Taichang" 太常) was the chief official in charge of religious rites, rituals, prayers and the maintenance of ancestral temples and altars. The Minister of the Household ("Guang lu xun" 光祿勳) was in charge of the emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. The Minister of the Guards ("Weiwei" 衛尉) was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls, towers, and gates of the imperial palaces. The Minister Coachman ("Taipu" 太僕) was responsible for the maintenance of imperial stables, horses, carriages and coach-houses for the emperor and his palace attendants, as well as the supply of horses for the armed forces. The Minister of Justice ("Tingwei" 廷尉) was the chief official in charge of upholding, administering, and interpreting the law. The Minister Herald ("Da honglu" 大鴻臚) was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests at the imperial court, such as nobles and <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Imperial%20China">foreign ambassadors</a>. The Minister of the Imperial Clan ("Zongzheng" 宗正) oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. The Minister of Finance ("Da sinong" 大司農) was the <a href="treasurer">treasurer</a> for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces who handled tax revenues and set standards for <a href="units%20of%20measurement">units of measurement</a>. The Minister Steward ("Shaofu" 少府) served the emperor exclusively, providing him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment.

In the Han dynasty, excluding kingdoms and marquessates, was divided, in descending order of size, into political units of <a href="Zhou%20%28country%20subdivision%29">provinces</a> ("zhou"), <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">commanderies</a> ("jun"), and <a href="Counties%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%23History">counties</a> ("xian"). A county was divided into several <a href="District%20%28China%29">districts</a>, the latter composed of a group of <a href="Hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlets</a>, each containing about a hundred families.

The heads of provinces, whose official title was changed from Inspector to Governor and vice versa several times during Han, were responsible for inspecting several commandery-level and kingdom-level administrations. On the basis of their reports, the officials in these local administrations would be promoted, demoted, dismissed or prosecuted by the imperial court.

A governor could take various actions without permission from the imperial court. The lower-ranked inspector had executive powers only during times of crisis, such as raising militias across the commanderies under his jurisdiction to suppress a rebellion.

A commandery consisted of a group of counties, and was headed by an Administrator. He was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense, lawsuits, seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a quota system first established by Emperor Wu. The head of a large county of about 10,000 households was called a Prefect, while the heads of smaller counties were called Chiefs, and both could be referred to as <a href="Magistrate">Magistrate</a>s. A Magistrate maintained law and order in his county, registered the populace for taxation, mobilized commoners for annual <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a> duties, repaired schools and supervised public works.

Kingdoms—roughly the size of <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">commanderies</a>—were ruled exclusively by the emperor's male relatives as semi-autonomous <a href="fiefdom">fiefdom</a>s. Before 157 BC some kingdoms were ruled by non-relatives, granted to them in return for their services to Emperor Gaozu. The administration of each kingdom was very similar to that of the central government. Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom, kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs.

However, in 145 BC, after several insurrections by the kings, Emperor Jing removed the kings' rights to appoint officials whose <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Salaries">salaries were higher than 400 bushels</a>. The Imperial Counselors and Nine Ministers (excluding the Minister Coachman) of every kingdom were abolished, although the Chancellor was still appointed by the central government.

With these reforms, kings were reduced to being nominal heads of their fiefs, gaining a personal income from only a portion of the taxes collected in their kingdom. Similarly, the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess's fief were appointed by the central government. A marquess's Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county Prefect. Like a king, the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income.
At the beginning of the Han dynasty, every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for <a href="conscription">conscription</a> into the military. The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after <a href="Emperor%20Zhao%20of%20Han">Emperor Zhao's</a> (r. 87–74 BC) reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: <a href="infantry">infantry</a>, <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> or <a href="navy">navy</a>. The year of active service was served either on the frontier, in a king's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional (paid) standing army was stationed near the capital.

During the Eastern Han, conscription could be avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a <a href="volunteer%20military">volunteer army</a>. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army ("Nanjun" 南軍), while the <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a> stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army ("Beijun" 北軍). Led by Colonels ("Xiaowei" 校尉), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers. When central authority collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops ("buqu" 部曲).

During times of war, the volunteer army was increased, and a much larger <a href="militia">militia</a> was raised across the country to supplement the Northern Army. In these circumstances, a General ("Jiangjun" 將軍) led a <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a>, which was divided into <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s led by Colonels and sometimes Majors ("Sima" 司馬). Regiments were divided into <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> and led by Captains. <a href="Platoon">Platoon</a>s were the smallest units of soldiers.

The Han dynasty inherited the "<a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage%23Ban%20Liang%20coins">ban liang</a>" coin type from the Qin. In the beginning of the Han, Emperor Gaozu closed the <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">government mint</a> in favor of private minting of coins. This decision was reversed in 186 BC by his widow <a href="Empress%20L%C3%BC%20Zhi">Grand Empress Dowager Lü Zhi</a> (d. 180 BC), who abolished private minting. In 182 BC, Lü Zhi issued a bronze coin that was much lighter in weight than previous coins. This caused widespread <a href="inflation">inflation</a> that was not reduced until 175 BC when Emperor Wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2.6 g (0.09 oz) in weight.

In 144 BC Emperor Jing abolished private minting in favor of central-government and commandery-level minting; he also introduced a new coin. Emperor Wu introduced another in 120 BC, but a year later he abandoned the "ban liangs" entirely in favor of the "<a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage%23Western%20Han%20and%20the%20Wu%20Zhu%20coins">wuzhu</a>" (五銖) coin, weighing 3.2 g (0.11 oz). The "wuzhu" became China's standard coin until the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907 AD). Its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during Wang Mang's regime until it was reinstated in 40 AD by Emperor Guangwu.

Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight, the central government closed commandery mints and monopolized the issue of coinage in 113 BC. This Central government issuance of coinage was overseen by the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Superintendent%20of%20Waterways%20and%20Parks">Superintendent of Waterways and Parks</a>, this duty being transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han.

Aside from the landowner's <a href="Land%20value%20tax%23History">land tax</a> paid in a portion of their <a href="crop%20yield">crop yield</a>, the <a href="Tax%20per%20head">poll tax</a> and <a href="property%20tax">property tax</a>es were paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.

The widespread circulation of coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land, empowering the very social class the government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes. Emperor Wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land, yet powerful merchants were able to avoid registration and own large tracts of land.

The small landowner-cultivators formed the majority of the Han tax base; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy <a href="landlord">landlord</a>s. The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms. These reforms included reducing taxes, temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in <a href="Tuntian">agricultural colonies</a> until they could recover from their debts.

In 168 BC, the land tax rate was reduced from one-fifteenth of a farming household's crop yield to one-thirtieth, and later to a one-hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty. The consequent loss of government revenue was compensated for by increasing property taxes.

The labor tax took the form of <a href="Conscription">conscripted labor</a> for one month per year, which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six. This could be avoided in Eastern Han with a commutable tax, since hired labor became more popular.

In the early Western Han, a wealthy salt or iron industrialist, whether a semi-autonomous king or wealthy merchant, could boast funds that rivaled the imperial <a href="treasury">treasury</a> and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand. This kept many peasants away from their farms and denied the government a significant portion of its land tax revenue. To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the state monopolies. By Eastern Han times, the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations, as well as private businessmen.

<a href="Liquor">Liquor</a> was another profitable private industry nationalized by the central government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2 L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated <a href="speculation">speculation</a> by selling government-stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.

The Han dynasty was a unique period in the development of premodern Chinese science and technology, comparable to the level of <a href="Technology%20of%20the%20Song%20dynasty">scientific and technological growth</a> during the <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> (960–1279).

In the 1st millennium BC, typical ancient Chinese writing materials were <a href="Chinese%20bronze%20inscriptions">bronzewares</a>, <a href="Oracle%20bone%20script">animal bones</a>, and <a href="bamboo%20slip">bamboo slip</a>s or wooden boards. By the beginning of the Han dynasty, the chief writing materials were <a href="clay%20tablet">clay tablet</a>s, silk cloth, hemp's paper, and rolled scrolls made from <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> strips sewn together with hempen string; these were passed through drilled holes and secured with clay stamps.

The oldest known Chinese piece of hard, hempen <a href="wrapping%20paper">wrapping paper</a> dates to the 2nd century BC. The standard <a href="papermaking">papermaking</a> process was invented by <a href="Cai%20Lun">Cai Lun</a> (AD 50–121) in 105. The oldest known surviving piece of <a href="paper">paper</a> with writing on it was found in the ruins of a Han <a href="watchtower">watchtower</a> that had been abandoned in AD 110, in <a href="Inner%20Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a>.

Evidence suggests that <a href="blast%20furnace">blast furnace</a>s, that convert raw <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> into <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a>, which can be remelted in a <a href="cupola%20furnace">cupola furnace</a> to produce <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> by means of a <a href="cold%20blast">cold blast</a> and <a href="hot%20blast">hot blast</a>, were operational in China by the late <a href="Spring%20and%20Autumn%20period">Spring and Autumn period</a> (722–481 BC). The <a href="bloomery">bloomery</a> was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> by injecting excess <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> into a furnace and causing <a href="decarburization">decarburization</a>. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and <a href="steel">steel</a> using a <a href="finery%20forge">fining</a> process.

The Han dynasty Chinese used bronze and iron to make a range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and domestic wares. A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron <a href="seed%20drill">seed drill</a>, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of <a href="Sowing">casting seeds out by hand</a>. The heavy moldboard iron <a href="plow">plow</a>, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three <a href="plowshare">plowshare</a>s, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.

To protect crops from wind and drought, the grain intendant Zhao Guo (趙過) created the alternating fields system ("daitianfa" 代田法) during Emperor Wu's reign. This system switched the positions of <a href="Ridge%20and%20furrow">furrows and ridges</a> between growing seasons. Once experiments with this system yielded successful results, the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it. Han farmers also used the pit field system ("aotian" 凹田) for growing crops, which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain. In southern and small parts of central Han-era China, <a href="paddy%20field">paddy field</a>s were chiefly used to grow rice, while farmers along the <a href="Huai%20River">Huai River</a> used <a href="Transplanting">transplantation</a> methods of rice production.

<a href="Timber">Timber</a> was the chief building material during the Han dynasty; it was used to build palace halls, multi-story residential towers and halls and single-story houses. Because wood decays rapidly, the only remaining evidence of Han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles. The oldest surviving wooden halls in China date to the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> (AD 618–907). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp points out the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, and claims that often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture.

Though Han wooden structures decayed, some Han-dynasty ruins made of brick, stone, and <a href="rammed%20earth">rammed earth</a> remain intact. This includes stone pillar-gates, brick tomb chambers, rammed-earth <a href="Chinese%20city%20wall">city walls</a>, rammed-earth and brick <a href="beacon">beacon</a> towers, rammed-earth sections of the <a href="Great%20Wall%20of%20China">Great Wall</a>, rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood, and two rammed-earth <a href="castle">castle</a>s in <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a>. The ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang'an and Luoyang still stand, along with their <a href="Sewage%20collection%20and%20disposal">drainage systems</a> of brick arches, ditches, and ceramic <a href="water%20pipe">water pipe</a>s. <a href="Que%20%28tower%29">Monumental stone pillar-gates</a>, twenty-nine of which survive from the Han period, formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites. These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles, eaves, and <a href="balustrades">balustrades</a>.

The <a href="courtyard%20house">courtyard house</a> is the most common type of home portrayed in Han artwork. Ceramic architectural <a href="Architectural%20model">models of buildings</a>, like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife. These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture. The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.

Over ten Han-era underground tombs have been found, many of them featuring <a href="arch">arch</a>ways, <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vaulted</a> chambers, and <a href="dome">dome</a>d roofs. Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits. The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.

From Han literary sources, it is known that wooden-trestle <a href="beam%20bridge">beam bridge</a>s, <a href="arch%20bridge">arch bridge</a>s, <a href="simple%20suspension%20bridge">simple suspension bridge</a>s, and floating <a href="pontoon%20bridge">pontoon bridge</a>s existed in Han China. However, there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature, and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge.

<a href="Shaft%20mining">Underground mine shafts</a>, some reaching depths over , were created for the extraction of metal ores. <a href="Borehole">Borehole</a> drilling and <a href="derrick">derrick</a>s were used to lift <a href="brine">brine</a> to iron pans where it was distilled into salt. The distillation furnaces were heated by <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> funneled to the surface through <a href="Pipeline%20transport">bamboo pipelines</a>. Dangerous amounts of additional gas were siphoned off via <a href="carburetor">carburetor</a> chambers and <a href="exhaust%20pipe">exhaust pipe</a>s.

Han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers ("jiang" 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer <a href="Yang%20Xiong%20%28author%29">Yang Xiong</a> described the invention of the <a href="Belt%20%28mechanical%29">belt drive</a> for a <a href="quilling">quilling</a> machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman <a href="Ding%20Huan">Ding Huan</a> (丁緩) are mentioned in the "Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital". Around AD 180, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for <a href="air%20conditioning">air conditioning</a> within palace buildings. Ding also used <a href="gimbal">gimbal</a>s as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known <a href="zoetrope">zoetrope</a> lamp.

Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. As observed in Han miniature tomb models, but not in literary sources, the <a href="Crank%20%28mechanism%29">crank handle</a> was used to operate the <a href="Fan%20%28mechanical%29">fans</a> of <a href="winnowing">winnowing</a> machines that separated grain from <a href="chaff">chaff</a>. The <a href="odometer">odometer</a> cart, invented during Han, measured journey lengths, using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century. Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty, for example a pair of sliding metal <a href="caliper">caliper</a>s used by craftsmen for making minute measurements. These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured. These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.

The <a href="waterwheel">waterwheel</a> appeared in Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by <a href="Huan%20Tan">Huan Tan</a> about AD 20, they were used to turn gears that lifted iron <a href="trip%20hammer">trip hammer</a>s, and were used in pounding, <a href="threshing">threshing</a> and polishing grain. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the <a href="watermill">watermill</a> in China until about the 5th century. The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer <a href="Du%20Shi">Du Shi</a> (d. 38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered <a href="Reciprocating%20motion">reciprocator</a> that worked the <a href="bellows">bellows</a> for the smelting of iron. Waterwheels were also used to power <a href="chain%20pump">chain pump</a>s that lifted water to raised <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> ditches. The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century "<a href="Lunheng">Balanced Discourse</a>".

The <a href="armillary%20sphere">armillary sphere</a>, a three-dimensional representation of the movements in the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>, was invented in Han China by the 1st century BC. Using a <a href="water%20clock">water clock</a>, waterwheel and a series of gears, the Court Astronomer <a href="Zhang%20Heng">Zhang Heng</a> (AD 78–139) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere. To address the problem of slowed <a href="timekeeping">timekeeping</a> in the <a href="pressure%20head">pressure head</a> of the inflow water clock, Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel. Zhang also invented a device he termed an "earthquake weathervane" ("houfeng didong yi" 候風地動儀), which the British scientist and historian <a href="Joseph%20Needham">Joseph Needham</a> described as "the ancestor of all <a href="seismographs">seismographs</a>". This device was able to detect the exact <a href="Cardinal%20direction">cardinal</a> or ordinal direction of <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s from hundreds of kilometers away. It employed an <a href="inverted%20pendulum">inverted pendulum</a> that, when disturbed by ground tremors, would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths (representing all eight directions) into a metal toad's mouth. The account of this device in the "<a href="Book%20of%20the%20Later%20Han">Book of the Later Han</a>" describes how, on one occasion, one of the metal balls was triggered without any of the observers feeling a disturbance. Several days later, a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in Longxi Commandery (in modern <a href="Gansu%20Province">Gansu Province</a>), the direction the device had indicated, which forced the officials at court to admit the efficacy of Zhang's device.

Three Han mathematical treatises still exist. These are the "<a href="Book%20on%20Numbers%20and%20Computation">Book on Numbers and Computation</a>", the "<a href="Zhoubi%20Suanjing">Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven</a>" and the "<a href="Nine%20Chapters%20on%20the%20Mathematical%20Art">Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</a>". Han-era mathematical achievements include solving problems with <a href="Triangle%23Types%20of%20triangle">right-angle triangles</a>, <a href="square%20root">square root</a>s, <a href="cube%20root">cube root</a>s, and <a href="Matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrix methods</a>, finding more accurate <a href="Chronology%20of%20computation%20of%20%CF%80">approximations for pi</a>, providing <a href="mathematical%20proof">mathematical proof</a> of the <a href="Pythagorean%20theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>, use of the <a href="Fraction%20%28mathematics%29">decimal fraction</a>, <a href="Gaussian%20elimination">Gaussian elimination</a> to solve <a href="System%20of%20linear%20equations">linear equations</a>, and continued fractions to find the <a href="root%20of%20a%20function">roots of equations</a>.

One of the Han's greatest mathematical advancements was the world's first use of <a href="negative%20number">negative number</a>s. Negative numbers first appeared in the "Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art" as black <a href="counting%20rods">counting rods</a>, where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods. Negative numbers were also used by the <a href="Greece">Greek</a> mathematician <a href="Diophantus">Diophantus</a> around AD 275, and in the 7th-century <a href="Bakhshali%20manuscript">Bakhshali manuscript</a> of <a href="Gandhara">Gandhara</a>, South Asia, but were not widely accepted in Europe until the 16th century.
The Han applied mathematics to various diverse disciplines. In <a href="musical%20tuning">musical tuning</a>, <a href="Jing%20Fang">Jing Fang</a> (78–37 BC) realized that 53 <a href="perfect%20fifth">perfect fifth</a>s was approximate to 31 <a href="octave">octave</a>s while creating a <a href="musical%20scale">musical scale</a> of 60 tones, calculating the difference at ⁄ (the same value of <a href="53%20equal%20temperament">53 equal temperament</a> discovered by the German mathematician <a href="Nicholas%20Mercator">Nicholas Mercator</a> [1620–1687], i.e. 3/2).

Mathematics were essential in drafting the <a href="Chinese%20calendar">astronomical calendar</a>, a <a href="lunisolar%20calendar">lunisolar calendar</a> that used the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. Use of the ancient Sifen calendar (古四分曆), which measured the <a href="tropical%20year">tropical year</a> at 365⁄ days, was replaced in 104 BC with the Taichu calendar (太初曆) that measured the tropical year at 365⁄ days and the <a href="lunar%20month">lunar month</a> at 29⁄ days. However, Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen calendar.

Han Chinese astronomers made <a href="star%20catalogue">star catalogue</a>s and detailed records of comets that appeared in the night sky, including recording the 12 BC appearance of the comet now known as <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a>.

Han dynasty astronomers adopted a <a href="geocentric%20model">geocentric model</a> of the universe, theorizing that it was <a href="celestial%20sphere">shaped like a sphere</a> surrounding the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by <a href="sunlight">sunlight</a>, that <a href="lunar%20eclipse">lunar eclipse</a>s occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a> occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the <a href="water%20cycle">water cycle</a> of the <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a> of water into clouds.

Evidence found in Chinese literature, and archaeological evidence, show that <a href="cartography">cartography</a> existed in China before the Han. Some of the earliest Han maps discovered were ink-penned silk maps found amongst the <a href="Mawangdui%20Silk%20Texts">Mawangdui Silk Texts</a> in a 2nd-century-BC tomb. The general <a href="Ma%20Yuan%20%28Han%20dynasty%29">Ma Yuan</a> created the world's first known <a href="raised-relief%20map">raised-relief map</a> from rice in the 1st century. This date could be revised if the tomb of Emperor <a href="Qin%20Shi%20Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a> is excavated and the account in the "Records of the Grand Historian" concerning a model map of the empire is proven to be true.

Although the use of the <a href="Scale%20%28map%29">graduated scale</a> and <a href="grid%20reference">grid reference</a> for maps was not thoroughly described until the published work of <a href="Pei%20Xiu">Pei Xiu</a> (AD 224–271), there is evidence that in the early 2nd century, cartographer Zhang Heng was the first to use scales and grids for maps.

Han dynasty Chinese sailed in a variety of ships differing from those of previous eras, such as the <a href="Lou%20chuan">tower ship</a>. The <a href="Junk%20%28ship%29">"junk" design</a> was developed and realized during the Han era. Junk ships featured a square-ended <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> and <a href="stern">stern</a>, a flat-bottomed <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> or <a href="Carvel%20%28boat%20building%29">carvel-shaped</a> hull with no <a href="keel">keel</a> or <a href="sternpost">sternpost</a>, and <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">solid transverse bulkheads</a> in the place of <a href="Boat%20building">structural ribs</a> found in Western vessels. Moreover, Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a <a href="rudder">rudder</a> at the stern, in contrast to the simpler <a href="steering%20oar">steering oar</a> used for riverine transport, allowing them to sail on the high seas.

Although ox-carts and chariots were previously used in China, the <a href="wheelbarrow">wheelbarrow</a> was first used in Han China in the 1st century BC. Han artwork of horse-drawn chariots shows that the Warring-States-Era heavy wooden yoke placed around a horse's chest was replaced by the softer "breast strap". Later, during the <a href="Northern%20Wei">Northern Wei</a> (386–534), the fully developed <a href="horse%20collar">horse collar</a> was invented.

Han-era medical physicians believed that the human body was subject to the same forces of nature that governed the greater universe, namely the <a href="cosmological">cosmological</a> cycles of yin and yang and the <a href="Wu%20Xing">five phases</a>. Each <a href="Zang-fu">organ of the body</a> was associated with a particular phase. Illness was viewed as a sign that "<a href="qi">qi</a>" or "vital energy" channels leading to a certain organ had been disrupted. Thus, Han-era physicians prescribed medicine that was believed to counteract this imbalance. For example, since the wood phase was believed to promote the fire phase, medicinal ingredients associated with the wood phase could be used to heal an organ associated with the fire phase. Besides dieting, Han physicians also prescribed <a href="moxibustion">moxibustion</a>, <a href="acupuncture">acupuncture</a>, and <a href="calisthenics">calisthenics</a> as methods of maintaining one's health. When <a href="surgery">surgery</a> was performed by the Chinese physician <a href="Hua%20Tuo">Hua Tuo</a> (d. AD 208), he used <a href="anesthesia">anesthesia</a> to numb his patients' pain and prescribed a rubbing ointment that allegedly sped the process of healing surgical wounds. Whereas the physician <a href="Zhang%20Zhongjing">Zhang Zhongjing</a> (c. AD 150–c. 219) is known to have written the "<a href="Shanghan%20lun">Shanghan lun</a>" ("Dissertation on Typhoid Fever"), it is thought that both he and Hua Tuo collaborated in compiling the "<a href="Shennong%20Ben%20Cao%20Jing">Shennong Ben Cao Jing</a>" medical text.

Georg Forster

Johann Georg Adam Forster (; November 27, 1754 – January 10, 1794) was a <a href="Germans">German</a> <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a>, <a href="ethnology">ethnologist</a>, <a href="travel%20literature">travel writer</a>, journalist, and revolutionary. At an early age, he accompanied his father, <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">Johann Reinhold Forster</a>, on several scientific expeditions, including <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">second voyage</a> to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>. His report of that journey, "A Voyage Round the World", contributed significantly to the ethnology of the people of <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a> and remains a respected work. As a result of the report, Forster was admitted to the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> at the early age of twenty-two and came to be considered one of the founders of modern scientific travel literature.

After returning to continental Europe, Forster turned toward academia. He traveled to Paris to seek out a discussion with the American revolutionary <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> in 1777. He taught natural history at the <a href="Collegium%20Carolinum%20%28Kassel%29">Collegium Carolinum</a> in the <a href="Ottoneum">Ottoneum</a>, <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a> (1778–84), and later at the <a href="Vilnius%20University">Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University)</a> (1784–87). In 1788, he became <a href="librarian">head librarian</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Mainz">University of Mainz</a>. Most of his scientific work during this time consisted of essays on <a href="botany">botany</a> and ethnology, but he also prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook's diaries.

Forster was a central figure of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> in Germany, and corresponded with most of its adherents, including his close friend <a href="Georg%20Christoph%20Lichtenberg">Georg Christoph Lichtenberg</a>. His ideas and personality influenced <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a>, one of the great scientists of the 19th century. When the French took control of <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a> in 1792, Forster became one of the founders of the city's <a href="Jacobin%20Club">Jacobin Club</a> and went on to play a leading role in the <a href="Mainz%20Republic">Mainz Republic</a>, the earliest <a href="republicanism">republican</a> state in Germany. During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussian</a> and <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austrian</a> coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared an outlaw. Unable to return to Germany and separated from his friends and family, he died in Paris of illness in early 1794.

Georg Forster was born in the small village of <a href="Mokry%20Dw%C3%B3r%2C%20Pomeranian%20Voivodeship">Nassenhuben (Mokry Dwór)</a> near <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> (Gdańsk), in the region of <a href="Royal%20Prussia">Royal Prussia</a>, in the <a href="Polish-Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. He was the oldest of seven surviving children of <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">Johann Reinhold Forster</a> and Justina Elisabeth (née Nicolai). His father was a naturalist, scientist and <a href="Reformed%20churches">Reformed</a> pastor. In 1765, the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> <a href="tsarina">empress</a> <a href="Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia">Catherine II</a> commissioned the pastor to travel through Russia on a research journey and investigate the situation of a <a href="Volga%20German">German colony</a> on the <a href="Volga%20River">Volga River</a>. Georg, then ten years old, joined him. On the journey, which reached the <a href="Kalmykia">Kalmyk</a> <a href="steppe">steppe</a> on the lower Volga, they discovered several new species, and the young Forster learned how to conduct scientific research and practice <a href="cartography">cartography</a>. He also became fluent in Russian.

The report of the journey, which included sharp criticism of the governor of <a href="Saratov">Saratov</a>, was not well received at court. The Forsters claimed they had not received fair payment for their work and had to move house. They chose to settle in England in 1766. The father took up teaching at the <a href="Dissenter">Dissenter</a>'s Academy in <a href="Warrington">Warrington</a> and also translation work. At the age of only thirteen, the young Forster published his first book: an English translation of <a href="Mikhail%20Lomonosov">Lomonosov</a>'s history of Russia, which was well received in scientific circles.

In 1772, Forster's father became a member of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>. This and the withdrawal of <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> resulted in his invitation by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> <a href="admiralty">admiralty</a> to join <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">second expedition</a> to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> (1772–75). Georg Forster joined his father in the expedition again and was appointed as a <a href="technical%20drawing">draughtsman</a> to his father. Johann Reinhold Forster's task was to work on a scientific report of the journey's discoveries that was to be published after their return.

They embarked <a href="HMS%20Resolution%20%28Cook%29">HMS "Resolution"</a> on July 13, 1772, in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>. The ship's route led first to the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">South Atlantic</a>, then through the Indian Ocean and the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> to the islands of <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a> and finally around <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> back to England, returning on July 30, 1775. During the three-year journey, the explorers visited New Zealand, the <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a> islands, <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>, the <a href="Marquesas%20Islands">Marquesas Islands</a> and <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>. They went further south than anybody before them, almost discovering <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. The journey conclusively disproved the "<a href="Terra%20Australis">Terra Australis</a> Incognita" theory, which claimed there was a big, habitable continent in the South.

Supervised by his father, Georg Forster first undertook studies of the <a href="zoology">zoology</a> and <a href="botanics">botanics</a> of the southern seas, mostly by drawing animals and plants. However, Georg also pursued his own interests, which led to completely independent explorations in comparative <a href="geography">geography</a> and <a href="ethnology">ethnology</a>. He quickly learned the languages of the Polynesian islands. His reports on the people of Polynesia are well regarded today, as they describe the inhabitants of the southern islands with empathy, sympathy and largely without <a href="Western%20culture">Western</a> or Christian bias.

Unlike <a href="Louis%20Antoine%20de%20Bougainville">Louis Antoine de Bougainville</a>, whose reports from a journey to Tahiti a few years earlier had initiated uncritical "<a href="noble%20savage">noble savage</a>" romanticism, Forster developed a sophisticated picture of the societies of the South Pacific islands. He described various <a href="social%20structure">social structure</a>s and religions that he encountered on the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a>, Easter Island and in Tonga and New Zealand, and ascribed this diversity to the difference in living conditions of these people. At the same time, he also observed that the languages of these fairly widely scattered islands were similar. About the inhabitants of the <a href="Nomuka">Nomuka</a> islands (in the <a href="Ha%27apai">Ha'apai</a> island group of present-day Tonga), he wrote that their languages, vehicles, weapons, furniture, clothes, tattoos, style of beard, in short all of their being matched perfectly with what he had already seen while studying tribes on <a href="Tongatapu">Tongatapu</a>. However, he wrote, "we could not observe any subordination among them, though this had strongly characterised the natives of Tonga-Tabboo, who seemed to descend even to servility in their obeisance to the king."

The journey was rich in scientific results. However, the relationship between the Forsters and Cook and his officers was often problematic, due to the elder Forster's fractious temperament as well as Cook's refusal to allow more time for botanical and other scientific observation. Cook refused scientists on his third journey after his experiences with the Forsters.

These conflicts continued after the journey with the problem of who should write the official account of the travels. <a href="John%20Montagu%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Sandwich">Lord Sandwich</a>, although willing to pay the promised money, was irritated with Johann Reinhold Forster's opening chapter and tried to have it edited. However, Forster did not want to have his writing corrected "like a theme of a School-boy", and stubbornly refused any compromise. As a result, the official account was written by Cook, and the Forsters were deprived of the right to compile the account and did not obtain payment for their work. During the negotiations, the younger Forster decided to release an unofficial account of their travels. In 1777, his book "A Voyage Round the World in His Britannic Majesty's Sloop Resolution, Commanded by Capt. James Cook, during the Years, 1772, 3, 4, and 5" was published. This report was the first account of Cook's second voyage (it appeared six weeks before the official publication) and was intended for the general public. The English version and his own translation into German (published 1778–80) earned the young author real fame. The poet <a href="Christoph%20Martin%20Wieland">Christoph Martin Wieland</a> praised the book as the most important one of his time, and even today it remains one of the most important journey descriptions ever written. The book also had a significant impact on German literature, culture and science, influencing such scientists as <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a> and it inspired many <a href="ethnology">ethnologists</a> of later times.

Forster wrote well-polished German prose, which was not only scientifically accurate and objective, but also exciting and easy to read. This differed from conventional <a href="travel%20literature">travel literature</a> of the time, insofar as it presented more than a mere collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable <a href="ethnography">ethnographical</a> facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In "A Voyage Round the World" he even presented the songs sung by the people of <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>, complete with lyrics and <a href="musical%20notation">notation</a>. The book is one of the most important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.

Both Forsters also published descriptions of their South Pacific travels in the Berlin-based "Magazin von merkwürdigen neuen Reisebeschreibungen" (""Magazine of strange new travel accounts""), and Georg published a translation of ""A Voyage to the South Sea, by Lieutenant <a href="William%20Bligh">William Bligh</a>, London 1792"" in 1791–93.

The publication of "A Voyage Round the World" brought Forster scientific recognition all over Europe. The respectable <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> made him a member on January 9, 1777, though he was not even 23 years old. He was granted similar titles from academies ranging from <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> to <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>. These appointments, however, were unpaid.

In 1778, he went to Germany to take a teaching position as a Natural History professor at the <a href="Collegium%20Carolinum%20%28Kassel%29">Collegium Carolinum</a> in <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a>, where he met <a href="Therese%20Huber">Therese Heyne</a>, the daughter of classicist <a href="Christian%20Gottlob%20Heyne">Christian Gottlob Heyne</a>. She later became one of the first independent female writers in Germany. They married in 1785 (which was after he left Kassel) and had three children, but their marriage was not happy. From his time in Kassel on, Forster actively corresponded with important figures of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, including <a href="Gotthold%20Ephraim%20Lessing">Lessing</a>, <a href="Johann%20Gottfried%20Herder">Herder</a>, <a href="Christoph%20Martin%20Wieland">Wieland</a> and <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a>. He also initiated cooperation between the Carolinum in Kassel and the <a href="University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a> where his friend <a href="Georg%20Christoph%20Lichtenberg">Georg Christoph Lichtenberg</a> worked. Together, they founded and published the scientific and literary journal "Göttingisches Magazin der Wissenschaften und Litteratur". Forster's closest friend, <a href="Samuel%20Thomas%20von%20S%C3%B6mmering">Samuel Thomas von Sömmering</a>, arrived in Kassel shortly after Forster, and both were soon involved with the <a href="Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a>s in Kassel.

However, by 1783 Forster saw that his involvement with the Rosicrucians not only led him away from real science, but also deeper into debt (it is said he was not good at money); for these reasons Forster was happy to accept a proposal by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth <a href="Komisja%20Edukacji%20Narodowej">Komisja Edukacji Narodowej</a> (Commission of National Education) and became Chair of Natural History at <a href="Vilnius%20University">Vilnius University</a> in 1784. Initially, he was accepted well in <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>, but he felt more and more isolated with time. Most of his contacts were still with scientists in Germany; especially notable is his dispute with <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> about the definition of <a href="race%20%28classification%20of%20human%20beings%29">race</a>. In 1785, Forster traveled to <a href="University%20of%20Halle">Halle</a> where he submitted his thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine. Back in Vilnius, Forster's ambitions to build a real natural history scientific center could not get appropriate financial support from the authorities in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Moreover, his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was not printed until 1843. These events led to high tensions between him and the local community. Eventually, he broke the contract six years short of its completion as <a href="Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia">Catherine II of Russia</a> had offered him a place on a journey around the world (the <a href="Mulovsky%20expedition">Mulovsky expedition</a>) for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. This resulted in a conflict between Forster and the influential Polish scientist <a href="J%C4%99drzej%20%C5%9Aniadecki">Jędrzej Śniadecki</a>. However, the Russian proposal was withdrawn and Forster left Vilnius. He then settled in <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a>, where he became head librarian of the <a href="University%20of%20Mainz">University of Mainz</a>, a position held previously by his friend <a href="Johannes%20von%20M%C3%BCller">Johannes von Müller</a>, who made sure Forster would succeed him when Müller moved to the administration of <a href="Prince-elector">Elector</a> <a href="Friedrich%20Karl%20Josef%20von%20Erthal">Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal</a>.

Forster regularly published essays on contemporary explorations and continued to be a very prolific translator; for instance, he wrote about Cook's third journey to the South Pacific, and about the <a href="Mutiny%20on%20the%20Bounty">Bounty</a> expedition, as well as translating Cook's and Bligh's diaries from these journeys into German. From his London years, Forster was in contact with Sir <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a>, the initiator of the Bounty expedition and a participant in Cook's first journey. While at the University of Vilnius he wrote the article "Neuholland und die brittische Colonie in Botany-Bay", published in the "Allgemeines historisches Taschenbuch" (Berlin, December 1786), an essay on the future prospects of the English colony founded in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in 1788.

Another interest of his was <a href="indology">indology</a> – one of the main goals of his failed expedition to be financed by Catherine II had been to reach India. He translated the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> play "<a href="Shakuntala">Shakuntala</a>" using a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> version provided by Sir <a href="William%20Jones%20%28philologist%29">William Jones</a>; this strongly influenced Herder and triggered German interest in the culture of India.

In the second quarter of 1790, Forster and the young Alexander von Humboldt started from Mainz on a long journey through the <a href="Southern%20Netherlands">Southern Netherlands</a>, the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">United Provinces</a>, and England, eventually finishing in Paris. The impressions from the journey were described in a three volume publication "Ansichten vom Niederrhein, von Brabant, Flandern, Holland, England und Frankreich im April, Mai und Juni 1790" ("Views of the Lower Rhine, from Brabant, Flanders, Holland, England, and France in April, May and June 1790"), published 1791–94. Goethe said about the book: "One wants, after one has finished reading, to start it over, and wishes to travel with such a good and knowledgeable observer." The book includes comments on the <a href="history%20of%20art">history of art</a> that were as influential for the discipline as "A Voyage Round the world" was for <a href="ethnology">ethnology</a>. Forster was, for example, one of the first writers who gave just treatment to the <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic architecture</a> of <a href="Cologne%20Cathedral">Cologne Cathedral</a>, which was widely perceived as "barbarian" at that time. The book conformed well to the early <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> intellectual movements in German-speaking Europe.

Forster's main interest, however, was again focused on the social behavior of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brabant">Brabant</a> and the <a href="French%20Revolution">revolution in France</a> sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on he was to be a confident opponent of the <a href="ancien%20r%C3%A9gime">ancien régime</a>. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the <a href="Storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">Storming of the Bastille</a>, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist <a href="Christian%20Gottlob%20Heyne">Christian Gottlob Heyne</a>, that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.

The French revolutionary army under <a href="General%20Custine">General Custine</a> gained control over <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a> on October 21, 1792. Two days later, Forster joined others in establishing a <a href="Jacobin%20Club">Jacobin Club</a> called "Freunde der Freiheit und Gleichheit" ("Friends of Freedom and Equality") in the <a href="Electoral%20Palace%20Mainz">Electoral Palace</a>. From early 1793 he was actively involved in organizing the <a href="Mainz%20Republic">Mainz Republic</a>. This first republic located on German soil was constituted on the principles of democracy, and encompassed areas on the left bank of the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> between <a href="Landau">Landau</a> and <a href="Bingen%20am%20Rhein">Bingen</a>. Forster became vice-president of the republic's temporary administration and a candidate in the elections to the local parliament, the "Rheinisch-Deutscher Nationalkonvent" ("Rhenish-German National Convention"). From January to March 1793, he was an editor of "Die neue Mainzer Zeitung oder Der Volksfreund" ("The new Mainz newspaper or The People's Friend"). In his first article he wrote:
This freedom did not last long, though. The Mainz Republic existed only until the retreat of the French troops in July 1793 after the <a href="Siege%20of%20Mainz%20%281793%29">Siege of Mainz</a>.

Forster was not present in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and <a href="Adam%20Lux">Adam Lux</a> had been sent to Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an independent state – to become a part of the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French Republic</a>. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.

Based on a decree by Emperor <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis II</a> inflicting punishments on German subjects who collaborated with the French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the <a href="Imperial%20ban">Imperial ban</a>; a prize of 100 ducats was set on his head and he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband <a href="Ludwig%20Ferdinand%20Huber">Ludwig Ferdinand Huber</a>, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> introduced by the <a href="Committee%20of%20Public%20Safety">Committee of Public Safety</a> under the rule of <a href="Maximilien%20Robespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a>. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.

Before the reign of terror reached its climax, Forster died after a rheumatic illness in his small attic apartment at Rue des Moulins in Paris in January 1794, at the age of thirty-nine. At the time, he was making plans to visit India.

Forster had partial Scottish roots and was born in Polish <a href="Royal%20Prussia">Royal Prussia</a>, and therefore was by birth a Polish subject. He worked in Russia, England, Poland and in several German countries of his time. Finally, he finished his life in France. He worked in different milieus and traveled a lot from his youth on. It was his view that this, together with his scientific upbringing based on the principles of the Enlightenment, gave him a wide perspective on different ethnic and national communities:

In his opinion all human beings have the same abilities with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him it is obvious that the culture on <a href="Tierra%20del%20Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German <a href="cosmopolitanism">cosmopolitanism</a>.

In contrast to the attitude expressed in these writings and to his Enlightenment background, he used insulting terms expressing prejudice against Poles in his private letters during his stay in Vilnius and in a diary from the journey through Poland, but he never published any manifestation of this attitude. These insults only became known after his death, when his private correspondence and diaries were released to the public. Since Forster's published descriptions of other nations were seen as impartial scientific observations, Forster's disparaging description of Poland in his letters and diaries was often taken at face value in Imperial and Nazi Germany, where it was used as a means of science-based support for a purported German superiority. The spreading of the ""Polnische Wirtschaft"" (Polish economy) stereotype is most likely due to the influence of his letters.

Forster's attitude brought him into conflict with the people of the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as he was too revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in his dealings with Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, and too insignificant politically and ignored while in France.

After Forster's death, his works were mostly forgotten, except in professional circles. This was partly due to his involvement in the French revolution. However, his reception changed with the politics of the times, with different periods focusing on different parts of his work. In the period of rising nationalism after the Napoleonic era he was regarded in Germany as a "traitor to his country", overshadowing his work as an author and scientist. This attitude rose even though the philosopher <a href="Karl%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Schlegel">Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel</a> wrote about Forster at the beginning of the 19th century:
Some interest in Forster's life and revolutionary actions was revived in the context of the liberal sentiments leading up to the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20German%20states">1848 revolution</a>. But he was largely forgotten in the Germany of <a href="Wilhelm%20II%20of%20Germany">Wilhelm II</a> and more so in the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>, where interest in Forster was limited to his stance on Poland from his private letters. Interest in Forster resumed in the 1960s in <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>, where he was interpreted as a champion of <a href="class%20struggle">class struggle</a>. The <a href="Schirmacher%20Oasis%23Georg%20Forster%20Station">GDR research station</a> in Antarctica that was opened on October 25, 1987, was named after him. In <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, the search for democratic traditions in German history also lead to a more diversified picture of him in the 1970s. The Alexander von Humboldt foundation named a scholarship program for foreign scholars from developing countries after him. His reputation as one of the first and most outstanding German ethnologists is indisputable, and his works are seen as crucial in the development of ethnology in Germany into a separate branch of science.

The ethnographical items collected by Georg and Johann Reinhold Forster are now presented as the "Cook-Forster-Sammlung" ("Cook–Forster Collection") in the <a href="Sammlung%20f%C3%BCr%20V%C3%B6lkerkunde">Sammlung für Völkerkunde</a> anthropological collection in <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a>. Another collection of items collected by the Forsters is on display at the <a href="Pitt%20Rivers%20Museum">Pitt Rivers Museum</a> in Oxford.

Laurence Olivier

Laurence Kerr Olivier, Baron Olivier, (; 22 May 1907 – 11 July 1989) was an English actor and director who, along with his contemporaries <a href="Ralph%20Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a>, <a href="Peggy%20Ashcroft">Peggy Ashcroft</a> and <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, dominated the <a href="Theatre%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British stage</a> of the mid-20th century. He also worked in films throughout his career, playing more than fifty cinema roles. Late in his career, he had considerable success in television roles.

His family had no theatrical connections, but Olivier's father, a clergyman, decided that his son should become an actor. After attending a drama school in London, Olivier learned his craft in a succession of acting jobs during the late 1920s. In 1930 he had his first important <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> success in <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>'s "<a href="Private%20Lives">Private Lives</a>", and he appeared in his first film. In 1935 he played in a celebrated production of "Romeo and Juliet" alongside Gielgud and Ashcroft, and by the end of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and <a href="John%20Burrell%20%28theatre%20director%29">John Burrell</a>, Olivier was the co-director of <a href="the%20Old%20Vic">the Old Vic</a>, building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's <a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a> and <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>'s <a href="Oedipus%20Rex">Oedipus</a>. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the "avant garde" <a href="English%20Stage%20Company">English Stage Company</a> in 1957 to play the title role in "<a href="The%20Entertainer%20%28play%29">The Entertainer</a>", a part he later played <a href="The%20Entertainer%20%28film%29">on film</a>. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a>, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in "<a href="Othello%20%281965%20British%20film%29">Othello</a>" (1965) and <a href="Shylock">Shylock</a> in "<a href="The%20Merchant%20of%20Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a>" (1970).

Among Olivier's films are "<a href="Wuthering%20Heights%20%281939%20film%29">Wuthering Heights</a>" (1939), "<a href="Rebecca%20%281940%20film%29">Rebecca</a>" (1940), and a trilogy of Shakespeare films as actor-director: "<a href="Henry%20V%20%281944%20film%29">Henry V</a>" (1944), "<a href="Hamlet%20%281948%20film%29">Hamlet</a>" (1948), and "<a href="Richard%20III%20%281955%20film%29">Richard III</a>" (1955). His later films included "<a href="The%20Shoes%20of%20the%20Fisherman">The Shoes of the Fisherman</a>" (1968), "<a href="Sleuth%20%281972%20film%29">Sleuth</a>" (1972), "<a href="Marathon%20Man%20%28film%29">Marathon Man</a>" (1976), and "<a href="The%20Boys%20from%20Brazil%20%28film%29">The Boys from Brazil</a>" (1978). His television appearances included an adaptation of "<a href="The%20Moon%20and%20Sixpence">The Moon and Sixpence</a>" (1960), "<a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night%20%281973%20film%29">Long Day's Journey into Night</a>" (1973), "<a href="Love%20Among%20the%20Ruins%20%28film%29">Love Among the Ruins</a>" (1975), "<a href="Cat%20on%20a%20Hot%20Tin%20Roof">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a>" (1976), "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited%20%28TV%20serial%29">Brideshead Revisited</a>" (1981) and "<a href="King%20Lear%20%281983%20TV%20programme%29">King Lear</a>" (1983).

Olivier's honours included a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a> (1947), a <a href="life%20peerage">life peerage</a> (1970) and the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> (1981). For his on-screen work he received four <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>, two <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">British Academy Film Awards</a>, five <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Emmy Awards</a> and three <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>s. The National Theatre's largest auditorium is named in his honour, and he is commemorated in the <a href="Laurence%20Olivier%20Awards">Laurence Olivier Awards</a>, given annually by the <a href="Society%20of%20London%20Theatre">Society of London Theatre</a>. He was married three times, to the actresses <a href="Jill%20Esmond">Jill Esmond</a> from 1930 to 1940, <a href="Vivien%20Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> from 1940 to 1960, and <a href="Joan%20Plowright">Joan Plowright</a> from 1961 until his death.

Olivier was born in <a href="Dorking">Dorking</a>, Surrey, the youngest of the three children of the Reverend Gerard Kerr Olivier (1869–1939) and his wife Agnes Louise, "née" Crookenden (1871–1920). Their elder children were Sybille (1901–1989) and Gerard Dacres "Dickie" (1904–1958). His great-great-grandfather was of French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> descent, and Olivier came from a long line of Protestant clergymen. Gerard Olivier had begun a career as a schoolmaster, but in his thirties he discovered a strong religious vocation and was ordained as a priest of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. He practised extremely <a href="high%20church">high church</a>, <a href="ritualist">ritualist</a> <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a> and liked to be addressed as "Father Olivier". This made him unacceptable to most Anglican congregations, and the only church posts he was offered were temporary, usually deputising for regular <a href="Incumbent%20%28ecclesiastical%29">incumbent</a>s in their absence. This meant a nomadic existence, and for Laurence's first few years, he never lived in one place long enough to make friends.

In 1912, when Olivier was five, his father secured a permanent appointment as assistant <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> at <a href="St%20Saviour%27s%2C%20Pimlico">St Saviour's, Pimlico</a>. He held the post for six years, and a stable family life was at last possible. Olivier was devoted to his mother, but not to his father, whom he found a cold and remote parent. Nevertheless, he learned a great deal of the art of performing from him. As a young man Gerard Olivier had considered a stage career and was a dramatic and effective preacher. Olivier wrote that his father knew "when to drop the voice, when to bellow about the perils of hellfire, when to slip in a gag, when suddenly to wax sentimental ... The quick changes of mood and manner absorbed me, and I have never forgotten them."
In 1916, after attending a series of preparatory schools, Olivier passed the singing examination for admission to the choir school of <a href="All%20Saints%2C%20Margaret%20Street">All Saints, Margaret Street</a>, in central London. His elder brother was already a pupil, and Olivier gradually settled in, though he felt himself to be something of an outsider. The church's style of worship was (and remains) <a href="Anglo-Catholicism">Anglo-Catholic</a>, with emphasis on ritual, vestments and incense. The theatricality of the services appealed to Olivier, and the vicar encouraged the students to develop a taste for secular as well as religious drama. In a school production of "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%28play%29">Julius Caesar</a>" in 1917, the ten-year-old Olivier's performance as Brutus impressed an audience that included <a href="Helen%20Maud%20Holt">Lady Tree</a>, the young <a href="Sybil%20Thorndike">Sybil Thorndike</a>, and <a href="Ellen%20Terry">Ellen Terry</a>, who wrote in her diary, "The small boy who played Brutus is already a great actor." He later won praise in other schoolboy productions, as Maria in "<a href="Twelfth%20Night">Twelfth Night</a>" (1918) and Katherine in "<a href="The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a>" (1922).

From All Saints, Olivier went on to <a href="St%20Edward%27s%20School%2C%20Oxford">St Edward's School, Oxford</a>, from 1920 to 1924. He made little mark until his final year, when he played <a href="Puck%20%28A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream%29">Puck</a> in the school's production of "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>"; his performance was a tour de force that won him popularity among his fellow pupils. In January 1924, his brother left England to work in India as a rubber planter. Olivier missed him greatly and asked his father how soon he could follow. He recalled in his memoirs that his father replied, "Don't be such a fool, you're not going to India, you're going on the stage."

In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, told his son that he must gain not only admission to the <a href="Central%20School%20of%20Speech%20Training%20and%20Dramatic%20Art">Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art</a>, but also a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses. Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of <a href="Elsie%20Fogerty">Elsie Fogerty</a>, the founder and principal of the school. Olivier later speculated that it was on the strength of this that Fogerty agreed to award him the bursary.
One of Olivier's contemporaries at the school was <a href="Peggy%20Ashcroft">Peggy Ashcroft</a>, who observed he was "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, he was not a very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband <a href="Lewis%20Casson">Lewis Casson</a> as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of <a href="Gerald%20du%20Maurier">Gerald du Maurier</a>, of whom he said, "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like <a href="Frank%20Benson%20%28actor%29">Frank Benson</a>." Olivier's concern with speaking naturally and avoiding what he called "singing" Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, as critics regularly decried his delivery.

In 1926, on Thorndike's recommendation, Olivier joined the <a href="Birmingham%20Repertory%20Theatre">Birmingham Repertory Company</a>. His biographer <a href="Michael%20Billington%20%28critic%29">Michael Billington</a> describes the Birmingham company as "Olivier's university", where in his second year he was given the chance to play a wide range of important roles, including Tony Lumpkin in "<a href="She%20Stoops%20to%20Conquer">She Stoops to Conquer</a>", the title role in "<a href="Uncle%20Vanya">Uncle Vanya</a>", and Parolles in "<a href="All%27s%20Well%20That%20Ends%20Well">All's Well That Ends Well</a>". Billington adds that the engagement led to "a lifelong friendship with his fellow actor <a href="Ralph%20Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a> that was to have a decisive effect on the British theatre."

While playing the juvenile lead in "Bird in Hand" at the <a href="Royalty%20Theatre">Royalty Theatre</a> in June 1928, Olivier began a relationship with <a href="Jill%20Esmond">Jill Esmond</a>, the daughter of the actors <a href="Henry%20V.%20Esmond">Henry V. Esmond</a> and <a href="Eva%20Moore">Eva Moore</a>. Olivier later recounted that he thought "she would most certainly do excellent well for a wife ... I wasn't likely to do any better at my age and with my undistinguished track-record, so I promptly fell in love with her."

In 1928 Olivier created the role of Stanhope in <a href="R.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BC.%20Sherriff">R. C. Sherriff</a>'s "<a href="Journey%27s%20End">Journey's End</a>", in which he scored a great success at its single Sunday night premiere. He was offered the part in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> production the following year, but turned it down in favour of the more glamorous role of <a href="Beau%20Geste">Beau Geste</a> in a stage adaptation of <a href="P.%20C.%20Wren">P. C. Wren</a>'s 1929 novel of the same name. "Journey's End" became a long-running success; "Beau Geste" failed. "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" commented, "Mr. Laurence Olivier did his best as Beau, but he deserves and will get better parts. Mr. Olivier is going to make a big name for himself". For the rest of 1929 Olivier appeared in seven plays, all of which were short-lived. Billington ascribes this failure rate to poor choices by Olivier rather than mere bad luck.

In 1930, with his impending marriage in mind, Olivier earned some extra money with small roles in two films. In April he travelled to Berlin to film the English-language version of "<a href="The%20Temporary%20Widow">The Temporary Widow</a>", a crime comedy with <a href="Lilian%20Harvey">Lilian Harvey</a>, and in May he spent four nights working on another comedy, "<a href="Too%20Many%20Crooks%20%281930%20film%29">Too Many Crooks</a>". During work on the latter film, for which he was paid £60, he met Laurence Evans, who became his personal manager. Olivier did not enjoy working in film, which he dismissed as "this anaemic little medium which could not stand great acting", but financially it was much more rewarding than his theatre work.

Olivier and Esmond married on 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street, although within weeks both realised they had erred. Olivier later recorded that the marriage was "a pretty crass mistake. I insisted on getting married from a pathetic mixture of religious and animal promptings. ... She had admitted to me that she was in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely as I would wish". Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again, although he considered those facts to be "mere coincidence", unconnected to the nuptials.

In 1930 <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> cast Olivier as Victor Prynne in his new play "<a href="Private%20Lives">Private Lives</a>", which opened at the new <a href="Phoenix%20Theatre%20%28London%29">Phoenix Theatre</a> in London in September. Coward and <a href="Gertrude%20Lawrence">Gertrude Lawrence</a> played the lead roles, Elyot Chase and Amanda Prynne. Victor is a secondary character, along with Sybil Chase; the author called them "extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again". To make them credible spouses for Amanda and Elyot, Coward was determined that two outstandingly attractive performers should play the parts. Olivier played Victor in the West End and then on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>; <a href="Adrianne%20Allen">Adrianne Allen</a> was Sybil in London, but could not go to New York, where the part was taken by Esmond. In addition to giving the 23-year-old Olivier his first successful West End role, Coward became something of a mentor. In the late 1960s Olivier told <a href="Sheridan%20Morley">Sheridan Morley</a>:

In 1931 <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> offered Olivier a two-film contract at $1,000 a week; he discussed the possibility with Coward, who, irked, told Olivier "You've no artistic integrity, that's your trouble; this is how you cheapen yourself." He accepted and moved to Hollywood, despite some misgivings. His first film was the drama "<a href="Friends%20and%20Lovers%20%281931%20film%29">Friends and Lovers</a>", in a supporting role, before RKO loaned him to <a href="Fox%20Studios">Fox Studios</a> for his first film lead, a British journalist in a Russia under <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> in "<a href="The%20Yellow%20Ticket">The Yellow Ticket</a>", alongside <a href="Elissa%20Landi">Elissa Landi</a> and <a href="Lionel%20Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a>. The cultural historian <a href="Jeffrey%20Richards">Jeffrey Richards</a> describes Olivier's look as an attempt by Fox Studios to produce a likeness of <a href="Ronald%20Colman">Ronald Colman</a>, and Colman's moustache, voice and manner are "perfectly reproduced". Olivier returned to RKO to complete his contract with the 1932 drama "<a href="Westward%20Passage">Westward Passage</a>", which was a commercial failure. Olivier's initial foray into American films had not provided the breakthrough he hoped for; disillusioned with Hollywood, he returned to London, where he appeared in two British films, "<a href="Perfect%20Understanding">Perfect Understanding</a>" with <a href="Gloria%20Swanson">Gloria Swanson</a> and "<a href="No%20Funny%20Business">No Funny Business</a>"—in which Esmond also appeared. He was tempted back to Hollywood in 1933 to appear opposite <a href="Greta%20Garbo">Greta Garbo</a> in "<a href="Queen%20Christina%20%28film%29">Queen Christina</a>", but was replaced after two weeks of filming because of a lack of chemistry between the two.

Olivier's stage roles in 1934 included Bothwell in <a href="Gordon%20Daviot">Gordon Daviot</a>'s "Queen of Scots", which was only a moderate success for him and for the play, but led to an important engagement for the same management (<a href="Bronson%20Albery">Bronson Albery</a>) shortly afterwards. In the interim he had a great success playing a thinly disguised version of the American actor <a href="John%20Barrymore">John Barrymore</a> in <a href="George%20S.%20Kaufman">George S. Kaufman</a> and <a href="Edna%20Ferber">Edna Ferber</a>'s "<a href="The%20Royal%20Family%20%28play%29">Theatre Royal</a>". His success was vitiated by his breaking an ankle two months into the run, in one of the athletic, acrobatic stunts with which he liked to enliven his performances.
In 1935, under Albery's management, <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a> staged "Romeo and Juliet" at the <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward%20Theatre">New Theatre</a>, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, <a href="Edith%20Evans">Edith Evans</a> and Olivier. Gielgud had seen Olivier in "Queen of Scots", spotted his potential, and now gave him a major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played <a href="Mercutio">Mercutio</a> and Olivier played <a href="Romeo">Romeo</a>, after which they exchanged roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, contrasting it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship between the two men was prickly, on Olivier's side, for the rest of his life.

In May 1936 Olivier and Richardson jointly directed and starred in a new piece by <a href="J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BB.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a>, "Bees on the Boatdeck". Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain's decay, did not attract the public and closed after four weeks. Later in the same year Olivier accepted an invitation to join the <a href="Old%20Vic">Old Vic</a> company. The theatre, in an unfashionable location south of the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>, had offered inexpensive tickets for opera and drama under its proprietor <a href="Lilian%20Baylis">Lilian Baylis</a> since 1912. Her drama company specialised in the plays of Shakespeare, and many leading actors had taken very large cuts in their pay to develop their Shakespearean techniques there. Gielgud had been in the company from 1929 to 1931, and Richardson from 1930 to 1932. Among the actors whom Olivier joined in late 1936 were Edith Evans, <a href="Ruth%20Gordon">Ruth Gordon</a>, <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a> and <a href="Michael%20Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a>. In January 1937 he took the title role in an uncut version of "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", in which once again his delivery of the verse was unfavourably compared with that of Gielgud, who had played the role on the same stage seven years previously to enormous acclaim. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>"'s <a href="Ivor%20Brown">Ivor Brown</a> praised Olivier's "magnetism and muscularity" but missed "the kind of pathos so richly established by Mr Gielgud". The reviewer in "The Times" found the performance "full of vitality", but at times "too light ... the character slips from Mr Olivier's grasp".
After "Hamlet", the company presented "Twelfth Night" in what the director, <a href="Tyrone%20Guthrie">Tyrone Guthrie</a>, summed up as "a baddish, immature production of mine, with Olivier outrageously amusing as <a href="Sir%20Toby%20Belch">Sir Toby</a> and a very young Alec Guinness outrageous and more amusing as <a href="Sir%20Andrew%20Aguecheek">Sir Andrew</a>". "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>" was the next play, presented in May to mark the <a href="Coronation%20of%20King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth">Coronation of George VI</a>. A pacifist, as he then was, Olivier was as reluctant to play the warrior king as Guthrie was to direct the piece, but the production was a success, and Baylis had to extend the run from four to eight weeks.

Following Olivier's success in Shakespearean stage productions, he made his first foray into Shakespeare on film in 1936, as <a href="Orlando%20%28As%20You%20Like%20It%29">Orlando</a> in "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It%20%281936%20film%29">As You Like It</a>", directed by <a href="Paul%20Czinner">Paul Czinner</a>, "a charming if lightweight production", according to Michael Brooke of the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s (BFI's) <a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a>. The following year Olivier appeared alongside <a href="Vivien%20Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> in the historical drama "<a href="Fire%20Over%20England">Fire Over England</a>". He had first met Leigh briefly at the <a href="Savoy%20Hotel%20Grill%20Room">Savoy Grill</a> and then again when she visited him during the run of "Romeo and Juliet", probably early in 1936, and the two had begun an affair sometime that year. Of the relationship, Olivier later said that "I couldn't help myself with Vivien. No man could. I hated myself for cheating on Jill, but then I had cheated before, but this was something different. This wasn't just out of lust. This was love that I really didn't ask for but was drawn into." While his relationship with Leigh continued he conducted an affair with the actress <a href="Ann%20Todd">Ann Todd</a>, and possibly had a brief affair with the actor <a href="Henry%20Ainley">Henry Ainley</a>, according to the biographer Michael Munn.

In June 1937 the Old Vic company took up an invitation to perform "Hamlet" in the courtyard of the castle at <a href="Kronborg">Elsinore</a>, where Shakespeare located the play. Olivier secured the casting of Leigh to replace Cherry Cottrell as <a href="Ophelia">Ophelia</a>. Because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel, but the tradition of playing Hamlet at Elsinore was established, and Olivier was followed by, among others, Gielgud (1939), Redgrave (1950), <a href="Richard%20Burton">Richard Burton</a> (1954), <a href="Derek%20Jacobi">Derek Jacobi</a> (1979), <a href="Kenneth%20Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a> (1988) and <a href="Jude%20Law">Jude Law</a> (2009). Back in London, the company staged "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>", with Olivier in the title role. The stylised production by <a href="Michel%20Saint-Denis">Michel Saint-Denis</a> was not well liked, but Olivier had some good notices among the bad. On returning from Denmark, Olivier and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over; Esmond moved out of the marital house and in with her mother. After Olivier and Leigh made a tour of Europe in mid 1937 they returned to separate film projects—"<a href="A%20Yank%20at%20Oxford">A Yank at Oxford</a>" for her and "<a href="The%20Divorce%20of%20Lady%20X">The Divorce of Lady X</a>" for him—and moved into a property together in <a href="Iver">Iver</a>, <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>.

Olivier returned to the Old Vic for a second season in 1938. For "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>" he played <a href="Iago">Iago</a>, with Richardson in the title role. Guthrie wanted to experiment with the theory that Iago's villainy is driven by suppressed homosexual love for <a href="Othello%20%28character%29">Othello</a>. Olivier was willing to co-operate, but Richardson was not; audiences and most critics failed to spot the supposed motivation of Olivier's Iago, and Richardson's Othello seemed underpowered. After that comparative failure, the company had a success with "<a href="Coriolanus">Coriolanus</a>" starring Olivier in the title role. The notices were laudatory, mentioning him alongside great predecessors such as <a href="Edmund%20Kean">Edmund Kean</a>, <a href="William%20Macready">William Macready</a> and <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a>. The actor <a href="Robert%20Speaight">Robert Speaight</a> described it as "Olivier's first incontestably great performance". This was Olivier's last appearance on a London stage for six years.

In 1938 Olivier joined Richardson to film the spy thriller "<a href="Q%20Planes">Q Planes</a>", released the following year. <a href="Frank%20Nugent">Frank Nugent</a>, the critic for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", thought Olivier was "not quite so good" as Richardson, but was "quite acceptable". In late 1938, lured by a salary of $50,000, the actor travelled to Hollywood to take the part of <a href="Heathcliff%20%28Wuthering%20Heights%29">Heathcliff</a> in the 1939 film "<a href="Wuthering%20Heights%20%281939%20film%29">Wuthering Heights</a>", alongside <a href="Merle%20Oberon">Merle Oberon</a> and <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a>. In less than a month Leigh had joined him, explaining that her trip was "partially because Larry's there and partially because I intend to get the part of <a href="Scarlett%20O%27Hara">Scarlett O'Hara</a>"—the role in "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" in which she was eventually cast. Olivier did not enjoy making "Wuthering Heights", and his approach to film acting, combined with a dislike for Oberon, led to tensions on set. The director, <a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a>, was a hard taskmaster, and Olivier learned to remove what Billington described as "the carapace of theatricality" to which he was prone, replacing it with "a palpable reality". The resulting film was a commercial and critical success that earned him a nomination for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>, and created his screen reputation. <a href="C.%20A.%20Lejeune">Caroline Lejeune</a>, writing for "The Observer", considered that "Olivier's dark, moody face, abrupt style, and a certain fine arrogance towards the world in his playing are just right" in the role, while the reviewer for "The Times" wrote that Olivier "is a good embodiment of Heathcliff ... impressive enough on a more human plane, speaking his lines with real distinction, and always both romantic and alive."
After returning to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for "Gone with the Wind", and Olivier to prepare for filming of <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s "<a href="Rebecca%20%281940%20film%29">Rebecca</a>"—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, <a href="Joan%20Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a> was selected for the role of Mrs de Winter, as the producer <a href="David%20O.%20Selznick">David O. Selznick</a> thought that not only was she more suitable for the role, but that it was best to keep Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed "Rebecca" with "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice%20%281940%20film%29">Pride and Prejudice</a>", in the role of <a href="Mr.%20Darcy">Mr. Darcy</a>. To his disappointment <a href="Elizabeth%20Bennet">Elizabeth Bennet</a> was played by <a href="Greer%20Garson">Greer Garson</a> rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.

On stage, Olivier and Leigh starred in "Romeo and Juliet" on Broadway. It was an extravagant production, but a commercial failure. In "The New York Times" <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a> praised the scenery but not the acting: "Although Miss Leigh and Mr Olivier are handsome young people they hardly act their parts at all." The couple had invested almost all their savings in the project, and its failure was a grave financial blow. They were married in August 1940, at the <a href="San%20Ysidro%20Ranch">San Ysidro Ranch</a> in <a href="Santa%20Barbara%2C%20California">Santa Barbara</a>.

The war in Europe had been under way for a year and was going badly for Britain. After his wedding Olivier wanted to help the war effort. He telephoned <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a>, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Minister of Information</a> under <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, hoping to get a position in Cooper's department. Cooper advised him to remain where he was and speak to the film director <a href="Alexander%20Korda">Alexander Korda</a>, who was based in the US at Churchill's behest, with connections to British Intelligence. Korda—with Churchill's support and involvement—directed "<a href="That%20Hamilton%20Woman">That Hamilton Woman</a>", with Olivier as <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a> and Leigh in the <a href="Emma%2C%20Lady%20Hamilton">title role</a>. Korda saw that the relationship between the couple was strained. Olivier was tiring of Leigh's suffocating adulation, and she was drinking to excess. The film, in which the threat of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> paralleled that of <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a>, was seen by critics as "bad history but good British propaganda", according to the BFI.

Olivier's life was under threat from the Nazis and pro-German sympathisers. The studio owners were concerned enough that <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a> and <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> both provided support and security to ensure his safety. On the completion of filming, Olivier and Leigh returned to Britain. He had spent the previous year learning to fly and had completed nearly 250 hours by the time he left America. He intended to join the Royal Air Force but instead made another propaganda film, "<a href="49th%20Parallel%20%28film%29">49th Parallel</a>", narrated short pieces for the Ministry of Information, and joined the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> because Richardson was already in the service. Richardson had gained a reputation for crashing aircraft, which Olivier rapidly eclipsed. Olivier and Leigh settled in a cottage just outside <a href="RAF%20Worthy%20Down">RNAS Worthy Down</a>, where he was stationed with a training squadron; Noël Coward visited the couple and thought Olivier looked unhappy. Olivier spent much of his time taking part in broadcasts and making speeches to build morale, and in 1942 he was invited to make another propaganda film, "<a href="The%20Demi-Paradise">The Demi-Paradise</a>", in which he played a Soviet engineer who helps improve British-Russian relationships.
In 1943, at the behest of the Ministry of Information, Olivier began working on "<a href="Henry%20V%20%281944%20film%29">Henry V</a>". Originally he had no intention of taking the directorial duties, but ended up directing and producing, in addition to taking the title role. He was assisted by an Italian internee, <a href="Filippo%20Del%20Giudice">Filippo Del Giudice</a>, who had been released to produce propaganda for the Allied cause. The decision was made to film the battle scenes in neutral Ireland, where it was easier to find the 650 extras. <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a>, the press attaché at the British embassy in Dublin, played a key liaison role with the Irish government in making suitable arrangements. The film was released in November 1944. Brooke, writing for the BFI, considers that it "came too late in the Second World War to be a call to arms as such, but formed a powerful reminder of what Britain was defending." The music for the film was written by <a href="William%20Walton">William Walton</a>, "a score that ranks with the best in film music", according to the music critic <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a>. Walton also provided the music for Olivier's next two Shakespearean adaptations, "<a href="Hamlet%20%281948%20film%29">Hamlet</a>" (1948) and "<a href="Richard%20III%20%281955%20film%29">Richard III</a>" (1955). "Henry V" was warmly received by critics. The reviewer for "The Manchester Guardian" wrote that the film combined "new art hand-in-hand with old genius, and both superbly of one mind", in a film that worked "triumphantly". The critic for "The Times" considered that Olivier "plays Henry on a high, heroic note and never is there danger of a crack", in a film described as "a triumph of film craft". There were Oscar nominations for the film, including Best Picture and Best Actor, but it won none and Olivier was instead presented with a "Special Award". He was unimpressed, and later commented that "this was my first absolute fob-off, and I regarded it as such."

Throughout the war Tyrone Guthrie had striven to keep the Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near-ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made it a condition of accepting that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, "It would be a disaster, you would have to spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me." It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director <a href="John%20Burrell%20%28theatre%20director%29">John Burrell</a>. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier; the <a href="Lords%20Commissioners%20of%20the%20Admiralty">Sea Lords</a> consented, with, as Olivier put it, "a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful."
The triumvirate secured the <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward%20Theatre">New Theatre</a> for their first season and recruited a company. Thorndike was joined by, among others, <a href="Harcourt%20Williams">Harcourt Williams</a>, <a href="Joyce%20Redman">Joyce Redman</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Leighton">Margaret Leighton</a>. It was agreed to open with a repertory of four plays: "<a href="Peer%20Gynt">Peer Gynt</a>", "<a href="Arms%20and%20the%20Man">Arms and the Man</a>", "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" and "<a href="Uncle%20Vanya">Uncle Vanya</a>". Olivier's roles were the Button Moulder, Sergius, Richard and Astrov; Richardson played Peer, Bluntschli, Richmond and Vanya. The first three productions met with acclaim from reviewers and audiences; "Uncle Vanya" had a mixed reception, although "The Times" thought Olivier's Astrov "a most distinguished portrait" and Richardson's Vanya "the perfect compound of absurdity and pathos". In "Richard III", according to Billington, Olivier's triumph was absolute: "so much so that it became his most frequently imitated performance and one whose supremacy went unchallenged until <a href="Antony%20Sher">Antony Sher</a> played the role forty years later". In 1945 the company toured Germany, where they were seen by many thousands of Allied servicemen; they also appeared at the <a href="Com%C3%A9die-Fran%C3%A7aise">Comédie-Française</a> theatre in Paris, the first foreign company to be given that honour. The critic <a href="Harold%20Hobson">Harold Hobson</a> wrote that Richardson and Olivier quickly "made the Old Vic the most famous theatre in the Anglo-Saxon world."

The second season, in 1945, featured two double bills. The first consisted of "Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2". Olivier played the warrior Hotspur in the first and the doddering <a href="Justice%20Shallow">Justice Shallow</a> in the second. He received good notices, but by general consent the production belonged to Richardson as <a href="Falstaff">Falstaff</a>. In the second double bill it was Olivier who dominated, in the title roles of "<a href="Oedipus%20Rex">Oedipus Rex</a>" and "<a href="The%20Critic%20%28play%29">The Critic</a>". In the two one-act plays his switch from searing tragedy and horror in the first half to farcical comedy in the second impressed most critics and audience members, though a minority felt that the transformation from <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>'s bloodily blinded hero to <a href="Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan">Sheridan</a>'s vain and ludicrous Mr Puff "smacked of a quick-change turn in a music hall". After the London season the company played both the double bills and "Uncle Vanya" in a six-week run on Broadway.

The third, and final, London season under the triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took the title role in "<a href="Cyrano%20de%20Bergerac%20%28play%29">Cyrano de Bergerac</a>". Olivier would have preferred the roles to be reversed, but Richardson did not wish to attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness towards the end of the play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic <a href="James%20Agate">James Agate</a> suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of "Cyrano", Richardson was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a>, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, <a href="Oliver%20Sylvain%20Baliol%20Brett%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Esher">Lord Esher</a>. He had ambitions to be the first head of the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.

In January 1947 Olivier began working on his second film as a director, "<a href="Hamlet%20%281948%20film%29">Hamlet</a>" (1948), in which he also took the lead role. The original play was heavily cut to focus on the relationships, rather than the political intrigue. The film became a critical and commercial success in Britain and abroad, although Lejeune, in "The Observer", considered it "less effective than [Olivier's] stage work. ... He speaks the lines nobly, and with the caress of one who loves them, but he nullifies his own thesis by never, for a moment, leaving the impression of a man who cannot make up his own mind; here, you feel rather, is an actor-producer-director who, in every circumstance, knows exactly what he wants, and gets it". , the critic for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" thought the film "brilliant ... one of the masterpieces of the stage has been made into one of the greatest of films." "Hamlet" became the first non-American film to win the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>, while Olivier won the Award for Best Actor.

In 1948 Olivier led the Old Vic company on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand. He played Richard III, Sir Peter Teazle in Sheridan's" <a href="The%20School%20for%20Scandal">The School for Scandal</a>" and Antrobus in <a href="Thornton%20Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a>'s "<a href="The%20Skin%20of%20Our%20Teeth">The Skin of Our Teeth</a>", appearing alongside Leigh in the latter two plays. While Olivier was on the Australian tour and Richardson was in Hollywood, Esher terminated the contracts of the three directors, who were said to have "resigned". <a href="Melvyn%20Bragg">Melvyn Bragg</a> in a 1984 study of Olivier, and John Miller in the authorised biography of Richardson, both comment that Esher's action put back the establishment of a National Theatre for at least a decade. Looking back in 1971, <a href="Bernard%20Levin">Bernard Levin</a> wrote that the Old Vic company of 1944 to 1948 "was probably the most illustrious that has ever been assembled in this country". "The Times" said that the triumvirate's years were the greatest in the Old Vic's history; as "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" put it, "the governors summarily sacked them in the interests of a more mediocre company spirit".

By the end of the Australian tour, both Leigh and Olivier were exhausted and ill, and he told a journalist, "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." Later he would comment that he "lost Vivien" in Australia, a reference to Leigh's affair with the Australian actor <a href="Peter%20Finch">Peter Finch</a>, whom the couple met during the tour. Shortly afterwards Finch moved to London, where Olivier auditioned him and put him under a long-term contract with <a href="Laurence%20Olivier%20Productions">Laurence Olivier Productions</a>. Finch and Leigh's affair continued on and off for several years.

Although it was common knowledge that the Old Vic triumvirate had been dismissed, they refused to be drawn on the matter in public, and Olivier even arranged to play a final London season with the company in 1949, as Richard III, Sir Peter Teazle, and Chorus in his own production of <a href="Jean%20Anouilh">Anouilh</a>'s "<a href="Antigone%20%28Anouilh%29">Antigone</a>" with Leigh in the title role. After that, he was free to embark on a new career as an actor-manager. In partnership with <a href="Binkie%20Beaumont">Binkie Beaumont</a> he staged the English premiere of <a href="Tennessee%20Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>'s "<a href="A%20Streetcar%20Named%20Desire">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>", with Leigh in the central role of Blanche DuBois. The play was condemned by most critics, but the production was a considerable commercial success, and led to Leigh's casting as Blanche in the <a href="A%20Streetcar%20Named%20Desire%20%281951%20film%29">1951 film version</a>. Gielgud, who was a devoted friend of Leigh's, doubted whether Olivier was wise to let her play the demanding role of the mentally unstable heroine: "[Blanche] was so very like her, in a way. It must have been a most dreadful strain to do it night after night. She would be shaking and white and quite distraught at the end of it."
The production company set up by Olivier took a lease on the <a href="St%20James%27s%20Theatre">St James's Theatre</a>. In January 1950 he produced, directed and starred in <a href="Christopher%20Fry">Christopher Fry</a>'s verse play "<a href="Venus%20Observed">Venus Observed</a>". The production was popular, despite poor reviews, but the expensive production did little to help the finances of Laurence Olivier Productions. After a series of box-office failures, the company balanced its books in 1951 with productions of <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Shaw</a>'s "<a href="Caesar%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28play%29">Caesar and Cleopatra</a>" and Shakespeare's "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>" which the Oliviers played in London and then took to Broadway. Olivier was thought by some critics to be under par in both his roles, and some suspected him of playing deliberately below his usual strength so that Leigh might appear his equal. Olivier dismissed the suggestion, regarding it as an insult to his integrity as an actor. In the view of the critic and biographer <a href="W.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Darlington">W. A. Darlington</a>, he was simply miscast both as Caesar and Antony, finding the former boring and the latter weak. Darlington comments, "Olivier, in his middle forties when he should have been displaying his powers at their very peak, seemed to have lost interest in his own acting". Over the next four years Olivier spent much of his time working as a producer, presenting plays rather than directing or acting in them. His presentations at the St James's included seasons by <a href="Ruggero%20Ruggeri">Ruggero Ruggeri</a>'s company giving two <a href="Luigi%20Pirandello">Pirandello</a> plays in Italian, followed by a visit from the Comédie-Française playing works by <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>, <a href="Jean%20Racine">Racine</a>, <a href="Pierre%20de%20Marivaux">Marivaux</a> and <a href="Alfred%20de%20Musset">Musset</a> in French. Darlington considers a 1951 production of "Othello" starring <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> as the pick of Olivier's productions at the theatre.

While Leigh made "Streetcar" in 1951, Olivier joined her in Hollywood to film "<a href="Carrie%20%281952%20film%29">Carrie</a>", based on the controversial novel "<a href="Sister%20Carrie">Sister Carrie</a>"; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and a <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">BAFTA</a> nomination. Olivier began to notice a change in Leigh's behaviour, and he later recounted that "I would find Vivien sitting on the corner of the bed, wringing her hands and sobbing, in a state of grave distress; I would naturally try desperately to give her some comfort, but for some time she would be inconsolable." After a holiday with Coward in Jamaica, she seemed to have recovered, but Olivier later recorded, "I am sure that ... [the doctors] must have taken some pains to tell me what was wrong with my wife; that her disease was called manic depression and what that meant—a possibly permanent cyclical to-and-fro between the depths of depression and wild, uncontrollable mania. He also recounted the years of problems he had experienced because of Leigh's illness, writing, "throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness—an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble."

In January 1953 Leigh travelled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to film "<a href="Elephant%20Walk">Elephant Walk</a>" with Peter Finch. Shortly after filming started she suffered a breakdown, and returned to Britain where, between periods of incoherence, she told Olivier that she was in love with Finch, and had been having an affair with him; she gradually recovered over a period of several months. As a result of the breakdown, many of the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems. Niven said she had been "quite, quite mad", and in his diary, Coward expressed the view that "things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts."

For the <a href="Coronation%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Coronation</a> season of 1953, Olivier and Leigh starred in the West End in <a href="Terence%20Rattigan">Terence Rattigan</a>'s <a href="Ruritania">Ruritania</a>n comedy, "<a href="The%20Sleeping%20Prince%20%28play%29">The Sleeping Prince</a>". It ran for eight months but was widely regarded as a minor contribution to the season, in which other productions included Gielgud in "<a href="Venice%20Preserv%27d">Venice Preserv'd</a>", Coward in "<a href="The%20Apple%20Cart">The Apple Cart</a>" and Ashcroft and Redgrave in "Antony and Cleopatra".

Olivier directed his third Shakespeare film in September 1954, "<a href="Richard%20III%20%281955%20film%29">Richard III</a>" (1955), which he co-produced with Korda. The presence of four theatrical knights in the one film—Olivier was joined by <a href="Cedric%20Hardwicke">Cedric Hardwicke</a>, Gielgud and Richardson—led an American reviewer to dub it "An-All-Sir-Cast". The critic for "The Manchester Guardian" described the film as a "bold and successful achievement", but it was not a box-office success, which accounted for Olivier's subsequent failure to raise the funds for a planned film of "Macbeth". He won a BAFTA award for the role and was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award, which <a href="Yul%20Brynner">Yul Brynner</a> won.

In 1955 Olivier and Leigh were invited to play leading roles in three plays at the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Theatre">Shakespeare Memorial Theatre</a>, Stratford. They began with "Twelfth Night", directed by Gielgud, with Olivier as Malvolio and Leigh as Viola. Rehearsals were difficult, with Olivier determined to play his conception of the role despite the director's view that it was vulgar. Gielgud later commented:

The next production was "Macbeth". Reviewers were lukewarm about the direction by <a href="Glen%20Byam%20Shaw">Glen Byam Shaw</a> and the designs by <a href="Roger%20Furse">Roger Furse</a>, but Olivier's performance in the title role attracted superlatives. To <a href="J.%20C.%20Trewin">J. C. Trewin</a>, Olivier's was "the finest <a href="Macbeth%20%28character%29">Macbeth</a> of our day"; to Darlington it was "the best Macbeth of our time". Leigh's <a href="Lady%20Macbeth">Lady Macbeth</a> received mixed but generally polite notices, although to the end of his life Olivier believed it to have been the best Lady Macbeth he ever saw.
In their third production of the 1955 Stratford season, Olivier played the title role in "<a href="Titus%20Andronicus">Titus Andronicus</a>", with Leigh as Lavinia. Her notices in the part were damning, but the production by <a href="Peter%20Brook">Peter Brook</a> and Olivier's performance as Titus received the greatest ovation in Stratford history from the first-night audience, and the critics hailed the production as a landmark in post-war British theatre. Olivier and Brook revived the production for a continental tour in June 1957; its final performance, which closed the old <a href="Stoll%20Theatre">Stoll Theatre</a> in London, was the last time Leigh and Olivier acted together.

Leigh became pregnant in 1956 and withdrew from the production of Coward's comedy "<a href="South%20Sea%20Bubble%20%28play%29">South Sea Bubble</a>". The day after her final performance in the play she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. The same year Olivier decided to direct and produce a film version of "<a href="The%20Sleeping%20Prince%20%28play%29">The Sleeping Prince</a>", retitled "<a href="The%20Prince%20and%20the%20Showgirl">The Prince and the Showgirl</a>". Instead of appearing with Leigh, he cast <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> as the showgirl. Although the filming was challenging because of Monroe's behaviour, the film was appreciated by the critics.

During the production of "The Prince and the Showgirl", Olivier, Monroe and her husband, the American playwright <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a>, went to see the English Stage Company's production of <a href="John%20Osborne">John Osborne</a>'s "<a href="Look%20Back%20in%20Anger">Look Back in Anger</a>" at the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court</a>. Olivier had seen the play earlier in the run and disliked it, but Miller was convinced that Osborne had talent, and Olivier reconsidered. He was ready for a change of direction; in 1981 he wrote:

Osborne was already at work on a new play, "<a href="The%20Entertainer%20%28play%29">The Entertainer</a>", an allegory of Britain's post-colonial decline, centred on a seedy <a href="variety%20show">variety</a> comedian, Archie Rice. Having read the first act—all that was completed by then—Olivier asked to be cast in the part. He had for years maintained that he might easily have been a third-rate comedian called "Larry Oliver", and would sometimes play the character at parties. Behind Archie's brazen façade there is a deep desolation, and Olivier caught both aspects, switching, in the words of the biographer <a href="Anthony%20Holden">Anthony Holden</a>, "from a gleefully tacky comic routine to moments of the most wrenching pathos". <a href="Tony%20Richardson">Tony Richardson</a>'s production for the English Stage Company transferred from the Royal Court to the <a href="Palace%20Theatre%2C%20London">Palace Theatre</a> in September 1957; after that it toured and returned to the Palace. The role of Archie's daughter Jean was taken by three actresses during the various runs. The second of them was <a href="Joan%20Plowright">Joan Plowright</a>, with whom Olivier began a relationship that endured for the rest of his life. Olivier said that playing Archie "made me feel like a modern actor again". In finding an "avant-garde" play that suited him, he was, as Osborne remarked, far ahead of Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, who did not successfully follow his lead for more than a decade. Their first substantial successes in works by any of Osborne's generation were <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a>'s "<a href="Forty%20Years%20On%20%28play%29">Forty Years On</a>" (Gielgud in 1968) and <a href="David%20Storey">David Storey</a>'s "<a href="Home%20%28play%29">Home</a>" (Richardson and Gielgud in 1970).

Olivier received another BAFTA nomination for his supporting role in 1959's "<a href="The%20Devil%27s%20Disciple%20%281959%20film%29">The Devil's Disciple</a>". The same year, after a gap of two decades, Olivier returned to the role of Coriolanus, in a Stratford production directed by the 28-year-old <a href="Peter%20Hall%20%28director%29">Peter Hall</a>. Olivier's performance received strong praise from the critics for its fierce athleticism combined with an emotional vulnerability. In 1960 he made his second appearance for the Royal Court company in <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ionesco">Ionesco</a>'s <a href="Theatre%20of%20the%20Absurd">absurdist</a> play "<a href="Rhinoceros%20%28play%29">Rhinoceros</a>". The production was chiefly remarkable for the star's quarrels with the director, Orson Welles, who according to the biographer Francis Beckett suffered the "appalling treatment" that Olivier had inflicted on Gielgud at Stratford five years earlier. Olivier again ignored his director and undermined his authority. In 1960 and 1961 Olivier appeared in Anouilh's "<a href="Becket">Becket</a>" on Broadway, first in the title role, with <a href="Anthony%20Quinn">Anthony Quinn</a> as the king, and later exchanging roles with his co-star.
Two films featuring Olivier were released in 1960. The first—filmed in 1959—was "<a href="Spartacus%20%28film%29">Spartacus</a>", in which he portrayed the Roman general, <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a>. His second was "<a href="The%20Entertainer%20%28film%29">The Entertainer</a>", shot while he was appearing in "Coriolanus"; the film was well received by the critics, but not as warmly as the stage show had been. The reviewer for "The Guardian" thought the performances were good, and wrote that Olivier "on the screen as on the stage, achieves the tour de force of bringing Archie Rice ... to life". For his performance, Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He also made an adaptation of "<a href="The%20Moon%20and%20Sixpence">The Moon and Sixpence</a>" in 1960, winning an <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>.

The Oliviers' marriage was disintegrating during the late 1950s. While directing <a href="Charlton%20Heston">Charlton Heston</a> in the 1960 play "The Tumbler", Olivier divulged that "Vivien is several thousand miles away, trembling on the edge of a cliff, even when she's sitting quietly in her own drawing room", at a time when she was threatening suicide. In May 1960 divorce proceedings started; Leigh reported the fact to the press and informed reporters of Olivier's relationship with Plowright. The <a href="decree%20nisi">decree "nisi"</a> was issued in December 1960, which enabled him to marry Plowright in March 1961. A son, Richard, was born in December 1961; two daughters followed, Tamsin Agnes Margaret—born in January 1963—and Julie-Kate, born in July 1966.

In 1961 Olivier accepted the directorship of a new theatrical venture, the <a href="Chichester%20Festival">Chichester Festival</a>. For the opening season in 1962 he directed two neglected 17th-century English plays, <a href="John%20Fletcher%20%28playwright%29">John Fletcher</a>'s 1638 comedy "The Chances" and <a href="John%20Ford%20%28dramatist%29">John Ford</a>'s 1633 tragedy "<a href="The%20Broken%20Heart">The Broken Heart</a>", followed by "Uncle Vanya". The company he recruited was forty strong and included Thorndike, Casson, Redgrave, <a href="Athene%20Seyler">Athene Seyler</a>, <a href="John%20Neville%20%28actor%29">John Neville</a> and Plowright. The first two plays were politely received; the Chekhov production attracted rapturous notices. "The Times" commented, "It is doubtful if the <a href="Moscow%20Arts%20Theatre">Moscow Arts Theatre</a> itself could improve on this production." The second Chichester season the following year consisted of a revival of "Uncle Vanya" and two new productions—Shaw's "<a href="Saint%20Joan%20%28play%29">Saint Joan</a>" and <a href="John%20Arden">John Arden</a>'s "The Workhouse Donkey". In 1963 Olivier received another BAFTA nomination for his leading role as a schoolteacher accused of sexually molesting a student in the film "<a href="Term%20of%20Trial">Term of Trial</a>".

At around the time the Chichester Festival opened, plans for the creation of the National Theatre were coming to fruition. The British government agreed to release funds for a new building on the <a href="South%20Bank">South Bank</a> of the Thames. <a href="Oliver%20Lyttelton%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Chandos">Lord Chandos</a> was appointed chairman of the National Theatre Board in 1962, and in August Olivier accepted its invitation to be the company's first director. As his assistants, he recruited the directors <a href="John%20Dexter">John Dexter</a> and <a href="William%20Gaskill">William Gaskill</a>, with <a href="Kenneth%20Tynan">Kenneth Tynan</a> as literary adviser or "<a href="dramaturge">dramaturge</a>". Pending the construction of the new theatre, the company was based at the Old Vic. With the agreement of both organisations, Olivier remained in overall charge of the Chichester Festival during the first three seasons of the National; he used the festivals of 1964 and 1965 to give preliminary runs to plays he hoped to stage at the Old Vic.

The opening production of the National Theatre was "Hamlet" in October 1963, starring <a href="Peter%20O%27Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> and directed by Olivier. O'Toole was a guest star, one of occasional exceptions to Olivier's policy of casting productions from a regular company. Among those who made a mark during Olivier's directorship were <a href="Michael%20Gambon">Michael Gambon</a>, <a href="Maggie%20Smith">Maggie Smith</a>, <a href="Alan%20Bates">Alan Bates</a>, Derek Jacobi and <a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a>. It was widely remarked that Olivier seemed reluctant to recruit his peers to perform with his company. Evans, Gielgud and <a href="Paul%20Scofield">Paul Scofield</a> guested only briefly, and Ashcroft and Richardson never appeared at the National during Olivier's time. <a href="Robert%20Stephens">Robert Stephens</a>, a member of the company, observed, "Olivier's one great fault was a paranoid jealousy of anyone who he thought was a rival".

In his decade in charge of the National, Olivier acted in thirteen plays and directed eight. Several of the roles he played were minor characters, including a crazed butler in <a href="Georges%20Feydeau">Feydeau</a>'s "<a href="A%20Flea%20in%20Her%20Ear">A Flea in Her Ear</a>" and a pompous solicitor in <a href="Somerset%20Maugham">Maugham</a>'s "Home and Beauty"; the vulgar soldier Captain Brazen in <a href="George%20Farquhar">Farquhar</a>'s 1706 comedy "<a href="The%20Recruiting%20Officer">The Recruiting Officer</a>" was a larger role but not the leading one. Apart from his Astrov in the "Uncle Vanya", familiar from Chichester, his first leading role for the National was Othello, directed by Dexter in 1964. The production was a box-office success and was revived regularly over the next five seasons. His performance divided opinion. Most of the reviewers and theatrical colleagues praised it highly; <a href="Franco%20Zeffirelli">Franco Zeffirelli</a> called it "an anthology of everything that has been discovered about acting in the past three centuries." Dissenting voices included "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</a>", which called it "the kind of bad acting of which only a great actor is capable ... near the frontiers of self-parody"; the director <a href="Jonathan%20Miller">Jonathan Miller</a> thought it "a condescending view of an Afro Caribbean person". The burden of playing this demanding part at the same time as managing the new company and planning for the move to the new theatre took its toll on Olivier. To add to his load, he felt obliged to take over as Solness in "<a href="The%20Master%20Builder">The Master Builder</a>" when the ailing Redgrave withdrew from the role in November 1964. For the first time Olivier began to suffer from <a href="stage%20fright">stage fright</a>, which plagued him for several years. The National Theatre production of "Othello" was released <a href="Othello%20%281965%20British%20film%29">as a film</a> in 1965, which earned four Academy Award nominations, including another for Best Actor for Olivier.

During the following year Olivier concentrated on management, directing one production ("<a href="The%20Crucible">The Crucible</a>"), taking the comic role of the foppish Tattle in <a href="William%20Congreve">Congreve</a>'s "<a href="Love%20for%20Love">Love for Love</a>", and making one film, "<a href="Bunny%20Lake%20is%20Missing">Bunny Lake is Missing</a>", in which he and Coward were on the same bill for the first time since "Private Lives". In 1966, his one play as director was "<a href="Juno%20and%20the%20Paycock">Juno and the Paycock</a>". "The Times" commented that the production "restores one's faith in the work as a masterpiece". In the same year Olivier portrayed the <a href="Mahdi">Mahdi</a>, opposite Heston as <a href="Charles%20George%20Gordon">General Gordon</a>, in the film "<a href="Khartoum%20%28film%29">Khartoum</a>".

In 1967 Olivier was caught in the middle of a confrontation between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage <a href="Rolf%20Hochhuth">Rolf Hochhuth</a>'s "<a href="Rolf%20Hochhuth%23Soldiers">Soldiers</a>". As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Sikorski">Władysław Sikorski</a>, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28play%29">Three Sisters</a>" he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in <a href="August%20Strindberg">Strindberg</a>'s "<a href="The%20Dance%20of%20Death%20%28Strindberg%29">The Dance of Death</a>", the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.

Olivier had intended to step down from the directorship of the National Theatre at the end of his first five-year contract, having, he hoped, led the company into its new building. By 1968 because of bureaucratic delays construction work had not even begun, and he agreed to serve for a second five-year term. His next major role, and his last appearance in a Shakespeare play, was as <a href="Shylock">Shylock</a> in "The Merchant of Venice", his first appearance in the work. He had intended Guinness or Scofield to play Shylock, but stepped in when neither was available. The production by Jonathan Miller, and Olivier's performance, attracted a wide range of responses. Two different critics reviewed it for "The Guardian": one wrote "this is not a role which stretches him, or for which he will be particularly remembered"; the other commented that the performance "ranks as one of his greatest achievements, involving his whole range".

In 1969 Olivier appeared in two war films, portraying military leaders. He played Field Marshal <a href="John%20French%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Ypres">French</a> in the First World War film "<a href="Oh%21%20What%20a%20Lovely%20War">Oh! What a Lovely War</a>", for which he won another BAFTA award, followed by Air Chief Marshal <a href="Hugh%20Dowding%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dowding">Hugh Dowding</a> in "<a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%20%28film%29">Battle of Britain</a>". In June 1970 he became the first actor to be created a peer for services to the theatre. Although he initially declined the honour, <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, the incumbent prime minister, wrote to him, then invited him and Plowright to dinner, and persuaded him to accept.
After this Olivier played three more stage roles: James Tyrone in <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a>'s "<a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night">Long Day's Journey into Night</a>" (1971–72), Antonio in <a href="Eduardo%20de%20Filippo">Eduardo de Filippo</a>'s "Saturday, Sunday, Monday" and John Tagg in <a href="Trevor%20Griffiths">Trevor Griffiths</a>'s "The Party" (both 1973–74). Among the roles he hoped to play, but could not because of ill-health, was Nathan Detroit in the musical "<a href="Guys%20and%20Dolls">Guys and Dolls</a>". In 1972 he took leave of absence from the National to star opposite <a href="Michael%20Caine">Michael Caine</a> in <a href="Joseph%20L.%20Mankiewicz">Joseph L. Mankiewicz</a>'s film of <a href="Anthony%20Shaffer%20%28writer%29">Anthony Shaffer</a>'s "<a href="Sleuth%20%281972%20film%29">Sleuth</a>", which "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" considered to be "Olivier at his twinkling, eye-rolling best"; both he and Caine were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, losing to <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a> in "<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>".

The last two stage plays Olivier directed were <a href="Jean%20Giradoux">Jean Giradoux</a>'s "<a href="Amphitryon%2038">Amphitryon</a>" (1971) and Priestley's "<a href="Eden%20End">Eden End</a>" (1974). By the time of "Eden End", he was no longer director of the National Theatre; Peter Hall took over on 1 November 1973. The succession was tactlessly handled by the board, and Olivier felt that he had been eased out—although he had declared his intention to go—and that he had not been properly consulted about the choice of successor. The largest of the three theatres within the National's new building was named in his honour, but his only appearance on the stage of the Olivier Theatre was at its official opening by the Queen in October 1976, when he made a speech of welcome, which Hall privately described as the most successful part of the evening.

Olivier spent the last 15 years of his life in securing his finances and dealing with deteriorating health, which included thrombosis and <a href="dermatomyositis">dermatomyositis</a>, a degenerative muscle disorder. Professionally, and to provide financial security, he made a series of advertisements for <a href="Polaroid%20Corporation">Polaroid</a> cameras in 1972, although he stipulated that they must never be shown in Britain; he also took a number of cameo film roles, which were in "often undistinguished films", according to Billington. Olivier's move from leading parts to supporting and cameo roles came about because his poor health meant he could not get the necessary long insurance for larger parts, with only short engagements in films available.

Olivier's dermatomyositis meant he spent the last three months of 1974 in hospital, and he spent early 1975 slowly recovering and regaining his strength. When strong enough, he was contacted by the director <a href="John%20Schlesinger">John Schlesinger</a>, who offered him the role of a Nazi torturer in the 1976 film "<a href="Marathon%20Man%20%28film%29">Marathon Man</a>". Olivier shaved his pate and wore oversized glasses to enlarge the look of his eyes, in a role that the critic <a href="David%20Robinson%20%28film%20critic%29">David Robinson</a>, writing for "The Times", thought was "strongly played", adding that Olivier was "always at his best in roles that call for him to be seedy or nasty or both". Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and won the Golden Globe of the same category.

In the mid-1970s Olivier became increasingly involved in television work, a medium of which he was initially dismissive. In 1973 he provided the narration for a 26-episode documentary, "<a href="The%20World%20at%20War">The World at War</a>", which chronicled the events of the Second World War, and won a second Emmy Award for "<a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night%20%281973%20film%29">Long Day's Journey into Night</a>" (1973). In 1975 he won another Emmy for "<a href="Love%20Among%20the%20Ruins%20%28film%29">Love Among the Ruins</a>". The following year he appeared in adaptations of Tennessee Williams's "<a href="Cat%20on%20a%20Hot%20Tin%20Roof">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a>" and <a href="Harold%20Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>'s "<a href="The%20Collection%20%28play%29">The Collection</a>". Olivier portrayed the <a href="Pharisee">Pharisee</a> <a href="Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a> in Franco Zeffirelli's 1977 miniseries "<a href="Jesus%20of%20Nazareth">Jesus of Nazareth</a>". In 1978 he appeared in the film "<a href="The%20Boys%20from%20Brazil%20%28film%29">The Boys from Brazil</a>", playing the role of Ezra Lieberman, an ageing <a href="Nazi%20hunter">Nazi hunter</a>; he received his eleventh Academy Award nomination. Although he did not win the Oscar, he was presented with an Honorary Award for his lifetime achievement.

Olivier continued working in film into the 1980s, with roles in "<a href="The%20Jazz%20Singer%20%281980%20film%29">The Jazz Singer</a>" (1980), "<a href="Inchon%20%28film%29">Inchon</a>" (1981), "<a href="The%20Bounty%20%281984%20film%29">The Bounty</a>" (1984) and "<a href="Wild%20Geese%20II">Wild Geese II</a>" (1985). He continued to work in television; in 1981 he appeared as Lord Marchmain in "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited%20%28TV%20serial%29">Brideshead Revisited</a>", winning another Emmy, and the following year he received his tenth and last BAFTA nomination in the television adaptation of <a href="John%20Mortimer">John Mortimer</a>'s stage play "<a href="A%20Voyage%20Round%20My%20Father">A Voyage Round My Father</a>". In 1983 he played his last Shakespearean role as Lear in "<a href="King%20Lear%20%281983%20TV%20programme%29">King Lear</a>", for Granada Television, earning his fifth Emmy. He thought the role of Lear much less demanding than other tragic Shakespearean heroes: "No, Lear is easy. He's like all of us, really: he's just a stupid old fart." When the production was first shown on American television, the critic Steve Vineberg wrote:
The same year he also appeared in a cameo alongside Gielgud and Richardson in "<a href="Wagner%20%28film%29">Wagner</a>", with Burton in the title role; his final screen appearance was as an elderly, wheelchair-bound soldier in <a href="Derek%20Jarman">Derek Jarman</a>'s 1989 film "<a href="War%20Requiem%20%28film%29">War Requiem</a>".

After being ill for the last 22 years of his life, Olivier died of renal failure on 11 July 1989 aged 82 at his home near <a href="Steyning">Steyning</a>, <a href="West%20Sussex">West Sussex</a>. His cremation was held three days later; his ashes were buried in <a href="Poets%27%20Corner">Poets' Corner</a> of <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> during a memorial service in October that year.

Olivier was appointed <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> in the <a href="1947%20Birthday%20Honours">1947 Birthday Honours</a> for services to the stage and to films. A <a href="life%20peerage">life peerage</a> followed in the <a href="1970%20Birthday%20Honours">1970 Birthday Honours</a> for services to the theatre; he was subsequently created Baron Olivier, of Brighton in the County of Sussex. Olivier was later appointed to the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> in 1981. He also received honours from foreign governments. In 1949 he was made Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Dannebrog">Order of the Dannebrog</a> by the Danish King Frederik IX; the French appointed him ', <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a>, in 1953; the Italian government created him ', <a href="Order%20of%20Merit%20of%20the%20Italian%20Republic">Order of Merit of the Italian Republic</a>, in 1953; and in 1971 he was granted the Order of Yugoslav Flag with Golden Wreath.

From academic and other institutions, Olivier received honorary doctorates from <a href="Tufts%20University">Tufts University</a> in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> (1946), <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> (1957) and <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> (1964). He was also awarded the Danish <a href="Sonning%20Prize">Sonning Prize</a> in 1966, the Gold Medallion of the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Letters%2C%20History%20and%20Antiquities">Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities</a> in 1968; and the <a href="Albert%20Medal%20%28Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts%29">Albert Medal</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> in 1976.

For his work in films, Olivier received four <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>: an honorary award for "Henry V" (1947), a Best Actor award and one as producer for "Hamlet" (1948), and a second honorary award in 1979 to recognise his lifetime of contribution to the art of film. He was nominated for nine other acting Oscars and one each for production and direction. He also won two <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">British Academy Film Awards</a> out of ten nominations, five Emmy Awards out of nine nominations, and three <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>s out of six nominations. He was nominated once for a <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Play">Tony Award</a> (for best actor, as Archie Rice) but did not win.

In February 1960, for his contribution to the film industry, Olivier was inducted into the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, with a star at 6319 <a href="Hollywood%20Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a>; he is included in the <a href="American%20Theater%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Theater Hall of Fame</a>. In 1977 Olivier was awarded a <a href="British%20Film%20Institute%20Fellowship">British Film Institute Fellowship</a>.

In addition to the naming of the National Theatre's largest auditorium in Olivier's honour, he is commemorated in the <a href="Laurence%20Olivier%20Awards">Laurence Olivier Awards</a>, bestowed annually since 1984 by the <a href="The%20Society%20of%20London%20Theatre">Society of West End Theatre</a>. In 1991 Gielgud unveiled a memorial stone commemorating Olivier in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey. In 2007, the centenary of Olivier's birth, a life-sized statue of him was unveiled on the South Bank, outside the National Theatre; the same year the BFI held a retrospective season of his film work.

Olivier's acting technique was minutely crafted, and he was known for changing his appearance considerably from role to role. By his own admission, he was addicted to extravagant make-up, and unlike Richardson and Gielgud, he excelled at different voices and accents. His own description of his technique was "working from the outside in"; he said, "I can never act as myself, I have to have a pillow up my jumper, a false nose or a moustache or wig... I cannot come on looking like me and be someone else." Rattigan described how at rehearsals Olivier "built his performance slowly and with immense application from a mass of tiny details". This attention to detail had its critics: Agate remarked, "When I look at a watch it is to see the time and not to admire the mechanism. I want an actor to tell me Lear's time of day and Olivier doesn't. He bids me watch the wheels go round."
Tynan remarked to Olivier, "you aren't really a contemplative or philosophical actor"; Olivier was known for the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles. He told Tynan this was because he was influenced as a young man by <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a>, <a href="Ramon%20Navarro">Ramon Navarro</a> and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: "tremendously athletic. I admired that greatly, all of us did. ... One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as I was, as a sort of Tarzan." According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered "the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down." Olivier described the contrast thus: "I've always thought that we were the reverses of the same coin... the top half John, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity."

Together with Richardson and Gielgud, Olivier was internationally recognised as one of the "great trinity of theatrical knights" who dominated the British stage during the middle and later decades of the 20th century. In an obituary tribute in "The Times", Bernard Levin wrote, "What we have lost with Laurence Olivier is "glory". He reflected it in his greatest roles; indeed he walked clad in it—you could practically see it glowing around him like a nimbus... no one will ever play the roles he played as he played them; no one will replace the splendour that he gave his native land with his genius." Billington commented:
After Olivier's death, Gielgud reflected, "He followed in the theatrical tradition of Kean and Irving. He respected tradition in the theatre, but he also took great delight in breaking tradition, which is what made him so unique. He was gifted, brilliant, and one of the great controversial figures of our time in theatre, which is a virtue and not a vice at all."

Olivier said in 1963 that he believed he was born to be an actor, but his colleague <a href="Peter%20Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a> disagreed; he commented that although Olivier's great contemporaries were clearly predestined for the stage, "Larry could have been a notable ambassador, a considerable minister, a redoubtable cleric. At his worst, he would have acted the parts more ably than they are usually lived." The director David Ayliff agreed that acting did not come instinctively to Olivier as it did to his great rivals. He observed, "Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn't stop being a perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination." The American actor <a href="William%20Redfield%20%28actor%29">William Redfield</a> had a similar view:
In comparing Olivier and the other leading actors of his generation, Ustinov wrote, "It is of course vain to talk of who is and who is not the greatest actor. There is simply no such thing as a greatest actor, or painter or composer". Nonetheless, some colleagues, particularly film actors such as <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>, <a href="Humphrey%20Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> and <a href="Lauren%20Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>, came to regard Olivier as the finest of his peers. Peter Hall, though acknowledging Olivier as the head of the theatrical profession, thought Richardson the greater actor. Others, such as the critic <a href="Michael%20Coveney">Michael Coveney</a>, awarded the palm to Gielgud. Olivier's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in Hall's words, "the supreme man of the theatre of our time", pioneering Britain's National Theatre. As Bragg identified, "no one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument".

John McCain

John Sidney McCain III (August 29, 1936 – August 25, 2018) was an American politician and military officer who served as a <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> from <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> from January 1987 until his death. He previously served two terms in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> and was the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> nominee for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> in the <a href="2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election">2008 election</a>, which he lost to <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>.

McCain graduated from the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in 1958 and <a href="Early%20life%20and%20military%20career%20of%20John%20McCain">was commissioned</a> into the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. He became a <a href="naval%20aviator">naval aviator</a> and flew <a href="ground-attack%20aircraft">ground-attack aircraft</a> from <a href="aircraft%20carriers">aircraft carriers</a>. During the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, he almost died in the <a href="1967%20USS%20Forrestal%20fire">1967 USS "Forrestal" fire</a>. While on a bombing mission during <a href="Operation%20Rolling%20Thunder">Operation Rolling Thunder</a> over <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> in October 1967, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>ese. He was a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> until 1973. He experienced episodes of <a href="torture">torture</a> and refused an out-of-sequence early <a href="repatriation">release</a>. During the war, he sustained wounds that left him with lifelong physical disabilities. He retired from the Navy as a <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29">captain</a> in 1981 and moved to Arizona, where he entered politics. In 1982, he was elected to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>, where he served two terms. He entered the U.S. Senate in 1987 and easily won reelection five times, the final time in <a href="2016%20United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Arizona">2016</a>.

While generally adhering to <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">conservative</a> principles, McCain also had a media reputation as a "maverick" for his willingness to break from his party on certain issues. His stances on <a href="gun%20control">gun control</a> and <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States">LGBT issues</a> were significantly more liberal than the party's base. McCain was investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as one of the <a href="Keating%20Five">Keating Five</a>. He then made <a href="campaign%20finance%20reform">campaign finance reform</a> one of his signature concerns, which eventually resulted in passage of the <a href="McCain%E2%80%93Feingold%20Act">McCain–Feingold Act</a> in 2002. He was also known for his work in the 1990s to restore <a href="United%20States%E2%80%93Vietnam%20relations">diplomatic relations</a> with <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, and for his belief that the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> should have been fought to a successful conclusion. He chaired the <a href="Senate%20Commerce%20Committee">Senate Commerce Committee</a> and opposed <a href="pork%20barrel">pork barrel</a> spending. He belonged to the bipartisan "<a href="Gang%20of%2014">Gang of 14</a>" which played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations.

McCain entered the race for the Republican nomination for president in <a href="John%20McCain%202000%20presidential%20campaign">2000</a>, but lost a <a href="Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202000">heated primary season contest</a> to Governor <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> of Texas. He secured the <a href="John%20McCain%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">nomination in 2008</a> after making a comeback from early reversals, but lost the general election. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the <a href="Obama%20administration">Obama administration</a>, especially with regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, he became Chairman of the <a href="Senate%20Armed%20Services%20Committee">Senate Armed Services Committee</a>. He refused to support then-Republican presidential nominee <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> in <a href="2016%20United%20States%20presidential%20election">2016</a>. He opposed the <a href="Patient%20Protection%20and%20Affordable%20Care%20Act">Affordable Care Act</a>, but cast the deciding vote against the ACA-repealing <a href="American%20Health%20Care%20Act%20of%202017">American Health Care Act of 2017</a> bill.

After being diagnosed with <a href="brain%20cancer">brain cancer</a> in 2017, he reduced his role in the Senate in order to focus on treatment. He died on August 25, 2018, four days before his 82nd birthday. Following his death, McCain lay in state in the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol%20rotunda">United States Capitol rotunda</a>, and his funeral was televised from the <a href="Washington%20National%20Cathedral">Washington National Cathedral</a>.

John Sidney McCain III was born on August 29, 1936, at <a href="Coco%20Solo">Coco Solo</a> Naval Air Station in the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a>, to naval officer <a href="John%20S.%20McCain%20Jr.">John S. McCain Jr.</a>(1911–1981) and <a href="Roberta%20McCain">Roberta (Wright) McCain</a>(b. 1912). He had an older sister Sandy and a younger brother <a href="Joe%20McCain">Joe</a>. At that time, the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> was under U.S. control.

McCain's family tree includes <a href="Scotch-Irish%20Americans">Scots-Irish</a> and <a href="English%20Americans">English</a> ancestors. His father and his paternal grandfather, <a href="John%20S.%20McCain%20Sr.">John S. McCain Sr.</a>, were also Naval Academy graduates and both became four-star <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">admirals</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. The McCain family followed his father to various naval postings in the United States and the Pacific.

Altogether, he attended about 20 schools. In 1951, the family settled in <a href="Northern%20Virginia">Northern Virginia</a>, and McCain attended <a href="Episcopal%20High%20School%20%28Alexandria%29">Episcopal High School</a>, a private preparatory boarding school in <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria</a>. He excelled at <a href="scholastic%20wrestling">wrestling</a> and graduated in 1954. He referred to himself as an <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopalian</a> as recently as June 2007 after which date he said he came to identify as a Baptist.
Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>, where he was a friend and informal leader for many of his classmates and sometimes stood up for targets of <a href="bullying">bullying</a>. He also fought as a lightweight <a href="boxing">boxer</a>. McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low <a href="class%20rank">class rank</a> (894 of 899), despite a high <a href="Intelligence%20quotient">IQ</a>. McCain graduated in 1958.

<a href="Early%20life%20and%20military%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%23Naval%20training%2C%20early%20assignments%2C%20first%20marriage%2C%20and%20children">McCain began his early military career</a> when he was commissioned as an <a href="Ensign%20%28United%20States%29">ensign</a> and started two and a half years of training at <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola</a> to become a naval aviator. While there, he earned a reputation as a man who partied. He completed flight school in 1960 and became a naval pilot of <a href="ground-attack%20aircraft">ground-attack aircraft</a>; he was assigned to <a href="A-1%20Skyraider">A-1 Skyraider</a> squadrons aboard the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s and in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>s. McCain began as a sub-par flier who was at times careless and reckless; during the early to mid-1960s, two of his flight missions crashed and a third mission collided with power lines, but he received no major injuries. His aviation skills improved over time, and he was seen as a good pilot, albeit one who tended to "<a href="Flight%20envelope">push the envelope</a>" in his flying.
On July 3, 1965, McCain was 28 when he married <a href="Carol%20McCain">Carol Shepp</a>, who had worked as a runway model and secretary. McCain adopted her two young children Douglas and Andrew. He and Carol then had a daughter named Sidney.

McCain requested a combat assignment and was assigned to the aircraft carrier flying <a href="A-4%20Skyhawk">A-4 Skyhawk</a>s. <a href="Early%20life%20and%20military%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%23Vietnam%20operations">His combat duty</a> began when he was 30 years old in mid-1967, when "Forrestal" was assigned to a bombing campaign, <a href="Operation%20Rolling%20Thunder">Operation Rolling Thunder</a>, during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Stationed in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tonkin">Gulf of Tonkin</a>, McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by micromanagement from Washington, and he later wrote, "In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have the least notion of what it took to win the war."

On July 29, 1967, McCain was a <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant commander</a> when he was near the center of the <a href="1967%20USS%20Forrestal%20fire">USS "Forrestal" fire</a>. He escaped from his burning jet and was trying to help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded; McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments. The ensuing fire killed 134 sailors and took 24 hours to control. With the "Forrestal" out of commission, McCain volunteered for assignment with the , another <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> employed in <a href="Operation%20Rolling%20Thunder">Operation Rolling Thunder</a>. There he was awarded the <a href="Commendation%20Medal">Navy Commendation Medal</a> and the <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star Medal</a> for missions flown over North Vietnam.

McCain's capture and subsequent <a href="Early%20life%20and%20military%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%23Prisoner%20of%20war">POW imprisonment</a> occurred on October 26, 1967. He was flying his 23rd bombing mission over <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> when his <a href="A-4E%20Skyhawk">A-4E Skyhawk</a> was shot down by a missile over <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>. McCain fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected from the aircraft, and nearly drowned after he parachuted into <a href="Tr%C3%BAc%20B%E1%BA%A1ch%20Lake">Trúc Bạch Lake</a>. Some North Vietnamese pulled him ashore, then others crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him. McCain was then transported to Hanoi's main <a href="H%E1%BB%8Fa%20L%C3%B2%20Prison">Hỏa Lò Prison</a>, nicknamed the "Hanoi Hilton".

Although McCain was seriously wounded and injured, his captors refused to treat him. They beat and interrogated him to get information, and he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was an admiral. His status as a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> (POW) made the front pages of major American newspapers.

McCain spent six weeks in the hospital, where he received marginal care. He had lost , was in a chest cast, and his gray hair had turned white. McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi. In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live more than a week. In March 1968, McCain was placed into <a href="solitary%20confinement">solitary confinement</a>, where he remained for two years.

In mid-1968, his father <a href="John%20S.%20McCain%20Jr.">John S. McCain Jr.</a> was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially. McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released. Such early release was prohibited by the POWs' interpretation of the military <a href="Code%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Fighting%20Force">Code of Conduct</a> which states in Article III: "I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy". To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured.

Beginning in August 1968, McCain was subjected to a program of severe torture. He was bound and beaten every two hours; this punishment occurred at the same time that he was suffering from heat and <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. Further injuries brought McCain to "the point of suicide", but his preparations were interrupted by guards. Eventually, McCain made an anti-U.S. propaganda "confession". He had always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote, "I had learned what we all learned over there: every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine." Many U.S. POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract "confessions" and propaganda statements; virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors. McCain received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.

McCain refused to meet various anti-war groups seeking peace in Hanoi, wanting to give neither them nor the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory. From late 1969, treatment of McCain and many of the other POWs became more tolerable, while McCain continued to resist the camp authorities. McCain and other prisoners cheered the <a href="Operation%20Linebacker%20II">U.S. "Christmas Bombing" campaign</a> of December 1972, viewing it as a forceful measure to push North Vietnam to terms.

McCain was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years until his release on March 14, 1973. His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head. After the war, McCain returned to the site with his wife Cindy and family on a few occasions to try to come to terms with what had happened to him there during his capture.

McCain was reunited with his family when he <a href="Early%20life%20and%20military%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%23Return%20to%20United%20States">returned</a> to the United States. His wife <a href="Carol%20McCain">Carol</a> had been crippled by an automobile accident in December 1969. As a returned POW, he became a celebrity of sorts.

McCain underwent treatment for his injuries that included months of <a href="physical%20therapy">physical therapy</a>. He attended the <a href="National%20War%20College">National War College</a> at <a href="Fort%20McNair">Fort McNair</a> in Washington, D.C. during 1973–1974. He was rehabilitated by late 1974 and his flight status was reinstated. In 1976, he became <a href="Commanding%20Officer">Commanding Officer</a> of a training squadron that was stationed in Florida. He improved the unit's flight readiness and safety records, and won the squadron its first-ever <a href="Meritorious%20Unit%20Commendation">Meritorious Unit Commendation</a>. During this period in Florida, he had extramarital affairs and his marriage began to falter, about which he later stated, "The blame was entirely mine".

<a href="Early%20life%20and%20military%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%23Senate%20liaison%2C%20divorce%2C%20and%20second%20marriage">McCain served as the Navy's liaison</a> to the U.S. Senate beginning in 1977. In retrospect, he said that this represented his "real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant." His key behind-the-scenes role gained congressional financing for a new <a href="supercarrier">supercarrier</a> against the wishes of the <a href="Carter%20administration">Carter administration</a>.

In April 1979, McCain met <a href="Cindy%20McCain">Cindy Lou Hensley</a>, a teacher from <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, whose <a href="Jim%20Hensley">father</a> had founded <a href="Hensley%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">a large beer distributorship</a>. They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, which she did in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The settlement included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they remained on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators <a href="William%20Cohen">William Cohen</a> and <a href="Gary%20Hart">Gary Hart</a> attending as <a href="Participants%20in%20wedding%20ceremonies%23Groomsmen">groomsmen</a>. McCain's children did not attend, and several years passed before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a <a href="prenuptial%20agreement">prenuptial agreement</a> that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they kept their finances apart and filed separate <a href="Tax%20return%20%28United%20States%29">income tax returns</a>.

McCain decided to leave the Navy. It was doubtful whether he would ever be promoted to the rank of <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">full admiral</a>, as he had poor annual physicals and had not been given a major sea command. His chances of being promoted to <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28lower%20half%29">rear admiral</a> were better, but he declined that prospect, as he had already made plans to run for Congress and said he could "do more good there."

McCain retired from the Navy on April 1, 1981, as a <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29">captain</a>. He was designated as disabled and awarded a <a href="veteran%27s%20pension">disability pension</a>. Upon leaving the military, he moved to Arizona. His numerous military decorations and awards include the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>, two <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>s, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, three <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star Medal</a>s, two <a href="Purple%20Heart">Purple Heart</a>s, two <a href="Commendation%20Medal">Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals</a>, and the <a href="Prisoner%20of%20War%20Medal">Prisoner of War Medal</a>.

<a href="House%20and%20Senate%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%2C%20until%202000%23U.S.%20Congressman">McCain set his sights on becoming a representative</a> because he was interested in current events, was ready for a new challenge, and had developed political ambitions during his time as Senate liaison. Living in Phoenix, he went to work for <a href="Hensley%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Hensley & Co.</a>, his new father-in-law <a href="Jim%20Hensley">Jim Hensley</a>'s large <a href="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a> beer distributorship. As vice president of public relations at the distributorship, he gained political support among the local business community, meeting powerful figures such as banker <a href="Charles%20Keating%20Jr.">Charles Keating Jr.</a>, real estate developer <a href="Fife%20Symington%20III">Fife Symington III</a> (later Governor of Arizona) and newspaper publisher Darrow "Duke" Tully. In 1982, McCain ran as a Republican for an open seat in <a href="Arizona%27s%201st%20congressional%20district">Arizona's 1st congressional district</a>, which was being vacated by 30-year incumbent Republican <a href="John%20Jacob%20Rhodes">John Jacob Rhodes</a>. A newcomer to the state, McCain was hit with charges of being a <a href="carpetbagger">carpetbagger</a>. McCain responded to a voter making that charge with what a "<a href="Phoenix%20Gazette">Phoenix Gazette</a>" columnist later described as "the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I've ever heard":

McCain won a highly contested primary election with the assistance of local political endorsements, his Washington connections, and money that his wife lent to his campaign. He then easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district.
In 1983, McCain was elected to lead the incoming group of Republican representatives, and was assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Natural%20Resources">House Committee on Interior Affairs</a>. Also that year, he opposed creation of a federal <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.%20Day">Martin Luther King Jr. Day</a>, but admitted in 2008: "I was wrong and eventually realized that, in time to give full support [in 1990] for a state holiday in Arizona."

At this point, McCain's politics were mainly in line with those of President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>; this included support for <a href="Reaganomics">Reaganomics</a>, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the <a href="foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20Reagan%20administration">foreign policy of the Reagan administration</a>, including its <a href="Foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20Reagan%20administration%23Cold%20War">hardline stance against the Soviet Union</a> and <a href="Foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20Reagan%20administration%23Latin%20America">policy towards Central American conflicts</a>, such as backing the <a href="Contras">Contras</a> in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines <a href="Multinational%20Force%20in%20Lebanon">deployed in Lebanon</a>, citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the <a href="1983%20Beirut%20barracks%20bombing">1983 Beirut barracks bombing</a> killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained a spot on the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs">House Foreign Affairs Committee</a>. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to <a href="Chile">Chile</a> where he met with its military <a href="Government%20Junta%20of%20Chile%20%281973%29">junta</a> ruler, General <a href="Augusto%20Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>.

In 1984, McCain and Cindy had their first biological child, daughter <a href="Meghan%20McCain">Meghan</a>, who was followed two years later by son John IV and in 1988 by son James. In 1991, Cindy brought an abandoned three-month-old girl needing medical treatment to the U.S. from a <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>i orphanage run by <a href="Mother%20Teresa">Mother Teresa</a>. The McCains decided to adopt her and she was named Bridget.

<a href="House%20and%20Senate%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%2C%20until%202000%23U.S.%20Senator">McCain's Senate career began</a> in January 1987, after he defeated his Democratic opponent, former state legislator <a href="Richard%20Kimball">Richard Kimball</a>, by 20 percentage points in the 1986 election. McCain succeeded longtime <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">American conservative</a> icon and Arizona fixture <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a> upon the latter's retirement as <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Senators%20from%20Arizona">U.S. senator from Arizona</a>.
Senator McCain became a member of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Armed Services Committee</a>, with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Commerce%2C%20Science%20and%20Transportation">Commerce Committee</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Indian%20Affairs">Indian Affairs Committee</a>. He continued to support the Native American agenda. As first a House member and then a senator—and as a lifelong gambler with close ties to the gambling industry—McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 <a href="Indian%20Gaming%20Regulatory%20Act">Indian Gaming Regulatory Act</a>, which codified rules regarding <a href="Native%20American%20gambling%20enterprises">Native American gambling enterprises</a>. McCain was also a strong supporter of the <a href="Gramm-Rudman">Gramm-Rudman</a> legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.

McCain soon gained national visibility. He delivered a well-received speech at the <a href="1988%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1988 Republican National Convention</a>, was mentioned by the press as a <a href="short%20list">short list</a> vice-presidential running mate for Republican nominee <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush.

McCain became embroiled in a <a href="House%20and%20Senate%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%2C%20until%202000%23Keating%20Five%20scandal">scandal</a> during the 1980s, as one of five United States senators comprising the so-called <a href="Keating%20Five">Keating Five</a>. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful political contributions from <a href="Charles%20Keating%20Jr.">Charles Keating Jr.</a> and his associates at <a href="Lincoln%20Savings%20and%20Loan%20Association">Lincoln Savings and Loan Association</a>, along with trips on Keating's jets that McCain belatedly repaid, in 1989. In 1987, McCain was one of the five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government's seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln. In 1999, McCain said: "The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do." In the end, McCain was cleared by the <a href="Senate%20Ethics%20Committee">Senate Ethics Committee</a> of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule, but was mildly rebuked for exercising "poor judgment". In his 1992 re-election bid, the Keating Five affair was not a major issue, and he won handily, gaining 56 percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> activist Claire Sargent and independent former governor, <a href="Evan%20Mecham">Evan Mecham</a>.
McCain developed a reputation for <a href="House%20and%20Senate%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%2C%20until%202000%23A%20maverick%20senator">independence</a> during the 1990s. He took pride in challenging party leadership and establishment forces, becoming difficult to categorize politically.
As a member of the 1991–1993 <a href="Senate%20Select%20Committee%20on%20POW/MIA%20Affairs">Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs</a>, chaired by fellow Vietnam War veteran and Democrat, <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a>, McCain investigated the <a href="Vietnam%20War%20POW/MIA%20issue">Vietnam War POW/MIA issue</a>, to determine the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as <a href="missing%20in%20action">missing in action</a> during the Vietnam War. The committee's unanimous report stated there was "no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia." Helped by McCain's efforts, in 1995 the U.S. normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam. McCain was vilified by some POW/MIA activists who, despite the committee's unanimous report, believed large numbers of Americans were still held against their will in Southeast Asia. From January 1993 until his death, McCain was Chairman of the <a href="International%20Republican%20Institute">International Republican Institute</a>, an organization partly funded by the U.S. government that supports the emergence of political democracy worldwide.

In 1993 and 1994, McCain voted to confirm President Clinton's nominees <a href="Stephen%20Breyer">Stephen Breyer</a> and <a href="Ruth%20Bader%20Ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> whom he considered to be qualified for the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>. He later explained that "under our Constitution, it is the president's call to make." McCain had also voted to confirm nominees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, including <a href="Robert%20Bork">Robert Bork</a> and <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a>.

McCain attacked what he saw as the corrupting influence of large political contributions—from corporations, labor unions, other organizations, and wealthy individuals—and he made this his signature issue. Starting in 1994, he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator <a href="Russ%20Feingold">Russ Feingold</a> on <a href="campaign%20finance%20reform">campaign finance reform</a>; their McCain–Feingold bill attempted to put limits on "<a href="soft%20money">soft money</a>". The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well, and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as <a href="media%20bias">media bias</a>. Despite sympathetic coverage in the media, initial versions of the <a href="Bipartisan%20Campaign%20Reform%20Act">McCain–Feingold Act</a> were <a href="Filibuster%20in%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">filibustered</a> and never came to a vote.

The term "<a href="wikt%3Amaverick">maverick</a> Republican" became a label frequently applied to McCain, and he also used it himself. In 1993, McCain opposed <a href="Operation%20Gothic%20Serpent">military operations in Somalia</a>. Another target of his was <a href="pork%20barrel">pork barrel</a> spending by Congress, and he actively supported the <a href="Line%20Item%20Veto%20Act%20of%201996">Line Item Veto Act of 1996</a>, which gave the president power to veto individual spending items but was ruled unconstitutional by the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">Supreme Court</a> in 1998.

In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201996">1996 presidential election</a>, McCain was again on the <a href="short%20list">short list</a> of possible vice-presidential picks, this time for Republican nominee <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a>. The following year, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine named McCain as one of the "25 Most Influential People in America".

In 1997, McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received were not part of the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the <a href="tobacco%20industry">tobacco industry</a> in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the <a href="Clinton%20administration">Clinton administration</a> but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain <a href="cloture">cloture</a>.

In November 1998, McCain won re-election to a third Senate term; he prevailed in a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger. In the <a href="impeachment%20of%20Bill%20Clinton">February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton</a>, McCain voted to convict the president on both the <a href="perjury">perjury</a> and <a href="obstruction%20of%20justice">obstruction of justice</a> counts, saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office. In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the <a href="1999%20NATO%20bombing%20of%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>, saying that the ongoing genocide of the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a> must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction. Later in 1999, McCain shared the <a href="Profile%20in%20Courage%20Award">Profile in Courage Award</a> with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform, although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture.
In August 1999, McCain's memoir "<a href="Faith%20of%20My%20Fathers">Faith of My Fathers</a>", co-authored with <a href="Mark%20Salter">Mark Salter</a>, was published; a reviewer observed that its appearance "seems to have been timed to the unfolding Presidential campaign." The most successful of his writings, it received positive reviews, became a bestseller, and was later <a href="Faith%20of%20My%20Fathers%20%28film%29">made into a TV film</a>. The book traces McCain's family background and childhood, covers his time at Annapolis and his service before and during the Vietnam War, concluding with his release from captivity in 1973. According to one reviewer, it describes "the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine. It's a fascinating history of a remarkable military family."

McCain announced his candidacy for president on September 27, 1999, in <a href="Nashua%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Nashua, New Hampshire</a>, saying he was staging "a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests, and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve". The frontrunner for the Republican nomination was <a href="Governor%20of%20Texas">Texas Governor</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment.

McCain focused on the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20primary">New Hampshire primary</a>, where his message appealed to independents. He traveled on a <a href="campaign%20bus">campaign bus</a> called the Straight Talk Express. He held many <a href="town%20hall%20meeting">town hall meeting</a>s, answering every question voters asked, in a successful example of "retail politics", and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds. One reporter later recounted that, "McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him." On February 1, 2000, he won New Hampshire's primary with 49 percent of the vote to Bush's 30 percent. The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial <a href="South%20Carolina%20primary">South Carolina primary</a> might give his campaign unstoppable momentum.

"<a href="The%20Arizona%20Republic">The Arizona Republic</a>" wrote that the McCain–Bush primary contest in South Carolina "has entered national political lore as a low-water mark in presidential campaigns", while "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called it "a painful symbol of the brutality of American politics". A variety of interest groups, which McCain had challenged in the past, ran negative ads. Bush borrowed McCain's earlier language of reform, and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused McCain (in Bush's presence) of having "abandoned the veterans" on POW/MIA and <a href="Agent%20Orange">Agent Orange</a> issues.

Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, which Bush said was "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary". An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by <a href="push%20poll">push poll</a>s, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience <a href="plant%20%28person%29">plants</a>. The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a "<a href="The%20Manchurian%20Candidate">Manchurian Candidate</a>" who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks.

McCain lost South Carolina on February 19, with 42 percent of the vote to Bush's 53 percent, in part because Bush mobilized the state's evangelical voters and outspent McCain. The win allowed Bush to regain lost momentum. McCain said of the rumor spreaders, "I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those." According to one acquaintance, the South Carolina experience left him in a "very dark place".

McCain's campaign never completely recovered from his South Carolina defeat, although he did rebound partially by winning in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> a few days later. He made a speech in <a href="Virginia%20Beach">Virginia Beach</a> that criticized Christian leaders, including <a href="Pat%20Robertson">Pat Robertson</a> and <a href="Jerry%20Falwell">Jerry Falwell</a>, as divisive conservatives, declaring "... we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community. But that does not mean that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders." McCain lost the <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> primary on February 29, and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on <a href="Super%20Tuesday">Super Tuesday</a> to Bush. With little hope of overcoming Bush's delegate lead, McCain withdrew from the race on March 9, 2000. He endorsed Bush two months later, and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign.

McCain began 2001 by breaking with the new <a href="Presidency%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush administration</a> on a number of matters, including <a href="HMO">HMO</a> reform, climate change, and gun legislation; <a href="McCain%E2%80%93Feingold">McCain–Feingold</a> was opposed by Bush as well. In May 2001, McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the <a href="Economic%20Growth%20and%20Tax%20Relief%20Reconciliation%20Act%20of%202001">Bush tax cuts</a>. Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds, there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous year's campaign. Later, when a Republican senator, <a href="Jim%20Jeffords">Jim Jeffords</a>, became an Independent, thereby throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats, McCain defended Jeffords against "self-appointed enforcers of party loyalty". Indeed, there was speculation at the time, and in years since, about McCain himself leaving the Republican Party, but McCain had always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so. Beginning in 2001, McCain used <a href="political%20capital">political capital</a> gained from his presidential run, as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members, to become one of the Senate's most influential members.

After the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%2C%20attacks">September 11, 2001, attacks</a>, McCain supported Bush and the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">U.S.-led war in Afghanistan</a>. He and Democratic senator <a href="Joe%20Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> wrote the legislation that created the <a href="9/11%20Commission">9/11 Commission</a>, while he and Democratic senator <a href="Fritz%20Hollings">Fritz Hollings</a> co-sponsored the <a href="Aviation%20and%20Transportation%20Security%20Act">Aviation and Transportation Security Act</a> that federalized <a href="airport%20security">airport security</a>.

In March 2002, McCain–Feingold, officially known as the <a href="Bipartisan%20Campaign%20Reform%20Act">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> of 2002, passed in both Houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Bush. Seven years in the making, it was McCain's greatest legislative achievement.
Meanwhile, in discussions over proposed U.S. action against <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, McCain was a strong supporter of the Bush administration's position. He stated that Iraq was "a clear and present danger to the United States of America", and voted accordingly for the <a href="Iraq%20Resolution">Iraq War Resolution</a> in October 2002. He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the Iraqi people. In May 2003, McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts, saying it was unwise at a time of war. By November 2003, after a trip to Iraq, he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense <a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, saying that more U.S. troops were needed; the following year, McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld.

In October 2003, McCain and Lieberman co-sponsored the <a href="Climate%20Stewardship%20Acts">Climate Stewardship Act</a> that would have introduced a <a href="cap%20and%20trade">cap and trade</a> system aimed at returning <a href="greenhouse%20gases">greenhouse gas</a> emissions to 2000 levels; the bill was defeated with 55 votes to 43 in the Senate. They reintroduced modified versions of the Act two additional times, for the final time in January 2007 with the co-sponsorship of <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, among others.
In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">2004 U.S. presidential election campaign</a>, McCain was once again frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time as part of the Democratic ticket under nominee <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a>. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had. At the <a href="2004%20Republican%20National%20Convention">2004 Republican National Convention</a>, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the <a href="War%20on%20Terror">War on Terror</a> since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55 percent to 19 percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.

McCain was also up for re-election as senator, in 2004. He defeated little-known Democratic schoolteacher <a href="Stuart%20Starky">Stuart Starky</a> with his biggest margin of victory, garnering 77 percent of the vote.

In May 2005, McCain led the so-called <a href="Gang%20of%2014">Gang of 14</a> in the Senate, which established a compromise that preserved the ability of senators to <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a> judicial nominees, but only in "extraordinary circumstances". The compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement, but some Republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees in all circumstances. McCain subsequently cast <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> confirmation votes in favor of <a href="John%20Roberts">John Roberts</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Alito">Samuel Alito</a>, calling them "two of the finest justices ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court."
Breaking from his 2001 and 2003 votes, McCain supported the <a href="Tax%20Increase%20Prevention%20and%20Reconciliation%20Act%20of%202005">Bush tax cut extension</a> in May 2006, saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase. Working with Democratic Senator <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a>, McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, which would involve legalization, guest worker programs, and border enforcement components. The <a href="Secure%20America%20and%20Orderly%20Immigration%20Act">Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act</a> was never voted on in 2005, while the <a href="Comprehensive%20Immigration%20Reform%20Act%20of%202006">Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006</a> passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House. In June 2007, President Bush, McCain, and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill, the <a href="Comprehensive%20Immigration%20Reform%20Act%20of%202007">Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007</a>, but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others, some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an "amnesty" program, and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the Senate.

By the middle of the 2000s (decade), the increased <a href="Indian%20gaming">Indian gaming</a> that McCain had helped bring about was a $23 billion industry. He was twice chairman of the <a href="Senate%20Indian%20Affairs%20Committee">Senate Indian Affairs Committee</a>, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and his Committee helped expose the <a href="Jack%20Abramoff%20Indian%20lobbying%20scandal">Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal</a>. By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the <a href="Indian%20Gaming%20Regulatory%20Act">Indian Gaming Regulatory Act</a> which would have limited creation of off-reservation casinos, and also limited the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.
Owing to his time as a POW, McCain was recognized for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the <a href="War%20on%20Terrorism">War on Terror</a>. An opponent of the Bush administration's use of torture and detention without trial at <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp">Guantánamo Bay</a>, saying: "some of these guys are terrible, terrible killers and the worst kind of scum of humanity. But, one, they deserve to have some adjudication of their cases ... even <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> got a trial". In October 2005, McCain introduced the <a href="McCain%20Detainee%20Amendment">McCain Detainee Amendment</a> to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005, and the Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment. It prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at Guantánamo, by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the <a href="FM%2034-52%20Intelligence%20Interrogation">U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation</a>. Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain's amendment was included, the President announced in December 2005 that he accepted McCain's terms and would "make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture, whether it be here at home or abroad". This stance, among others, led to McCain being named by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine in 2006 as one of America's 10 Best Senators. McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on <a href="waterboarding">waterboarding</a>, which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush. However, the bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected, and his spokesman stated: "This wasn't a vote on waterboarding. This was a vote on applying the standards of the [Army] field manual to CIA personnel."

Meanwhile, McCain continued questioning the progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> <a href="Richard%20Myers">Richard Myers</a>' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: "Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers." In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: "We [have] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be." From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the <a href="Iraq%20troop%20surge%20of%202007">Iraq troop surge of 2007</a>. The strategy's opponents labeled it "McCain's plan" and <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a> political science professor <a href="Larry%20Sabato">Larry Sabato</a> said, "McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now." The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, "I would much rather lose a campaign than a war." In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.

McCain formally announced his intention to run for President of the United States on April 25, 2007, in <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Portsmouth, New Hampshire</a>. He stated that: "I'm not running for president to be somebody, but to do something; to do the hard but necessary things, not the easy and needless things."

McCain's oft-cited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346 events and helped raise more than $10.5 million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor of New York City</a> <a href="Rudy%20Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> in <a href="Nationwide%20opinion%20polling%20for%20the%20Republican%20Party%202008%20presidential%20candidates">national Republican polls</a> as the year progressed.

McCain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the <a href="Comprehensive%20Immigration%20Reform%20Act%20of%202007">Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007</a>, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, <a href="Nationwide%20opinion%20polling%20for%20the%20Republican%20Party%202008%20presidential%20candidates">often running third or fourth with 15 percent or less support.</a>
The Arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political <a href="Underdog%20%28competition%29">underdog</a>, riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events. By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, with none of the top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate. McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire—the scene of his 2000 triumph—and was bolstered further by the endorsements of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>", the "<a href="New%20Hampshire%20Union%20Leader">New Hampshire Union Leader</a>", and almost two dozen other state newspapers, as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an <a href="Independent%20Democrat">Independent Democrat</a>). McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, <a href="Iowa%20Republican%20caucuses%2C%202008">Iowa caucuses</a>, which saw a win by former <a href="Governor%20of%20Arkansas">Governor of Arkansas</a> <a href="Mike%20Huckabee">Mike Huckabee</a>.

McCain's comeback plan paid off when he won the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20Republican%20primary%2C%202008">New Hampshire primary</a> on January 8, defeating former <a href="Governor%20of%20Massachusetts">Governor of Massachusetts</a> <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> in a close contest, to once again become one of the front-runners in the race. In mid-January, McCain placed first in the <a href="South%20Carolina%20Republican%20primary%2C%202008">South Carolina primary</a>, narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee. Pundits credited the third-place finisher, <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>'s former U.S. Senator <a href="Fred%20Thompson">Fred Thompson</a>, with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina, thereby giving a narrow win to McCain.
A week later, McCain won the <a href="Florida%20Republican%20primary%2C%202008">Florida primary</a>, beating Romney again in a close contest; Giuliani then dropped out and endorsed McCain.

On February 5, McCain won both the majority of states and <a href="Delegate%20%28American%20politics%29">delegate</a>s in the <a href="Super%20Tuesday%20%282008%29">Super Tuesday</a> <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202008">Republican primaries</a>, giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination. Romney departed from the race on February 7. McCain's wins in the March 4 primaries clinched a majority of the delegates, and he became the presumptive Republican nominee.

McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, he would have become the first president who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> requires the president to be a <a href="natural-born%20citizen">natural-born citizen</a> of the United States. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he was a natural-born citizen. If inaugurated in 2009 at the age of 72 years and 144 days, he would have been the <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Presidents%20by%20age">oldest person to become president</a>.

McCain addressed concerns about his age and past health issues, stating in 2005 that his health was "excellent". He had been treated for a type of <a href="skin%20cancer">skin cancer</a> called <a href="melanoma">melanoma</a>, and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face. McCain's prognosis appeared favorable, according to independent experts, especially because he had already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years. In May 2008, McCain's campaign briefly let the press review his medical records, and he was described as appearing cancer-free, having a strong heart, and in general being in good health.

McCain clinched enough delegates for the nomination and his focus shifted toward the general election, while <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> and <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> fought a prolonged <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202008">battle for the Democratic nomination</a>. McCain introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising. Cindy McCain, who accounted for most of the couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100 million, made part of her tax returns public in May. After facing criticism about <a href="lobbyist">lobbyist</a>s on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflicts of interest</a>, causing five top aides to leave.

When Obama became the Democrats' <a href="presumptive%20nominee">presumptive nominee</a> in early June, McCain proposed joint <a href="town%20hall%20meetings">town hall meetings</a>, but Obama instead requested <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20debates%2C%202008">more traditional debates</a> for the fall. In July, a staff shake-up put <a href="Steve%20Schmidt">Steve Schmidt</a> in full operational control of the McCain campaign. <a href="Rick%20Davis%20%28politics%29">Rick Davis</a> remained as campaign manager but with a reduced role. Davis had also managed McCain's 2000 presidential campaign; in 2005 and 2006, <a href="United%20States%20Intelligence%20Community">U.S. intelligence</a> warned McCain's Senate staff about Davis's Russian links but gave no further warnings.

Throughout the summer of 2008, Obama typically led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due at least in part to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted <a href="Campaign%20finance%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Public%20financing%20of%20campaigns">public financing</a> for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.
On August 29, 2008, McCain revealed <a href="Governor%20of%20Alaska">Alaska Governor</a> <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a> as his surprise choice for a running mate. McCain was only the second U.S. major-party presidential nominee (after <a href="Walter%20Mondale">Walter Mondale</a>) to select a woman for his running mate and the first Republican to do so. On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party's presidential and vice presidential nominees, respectively, at the <a href="2008%20Republican%20National%20Convention">2008 Republican National Convention</a> in <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul, Minnesota</a>. McCain surged ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention, as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him. However, by the campaign's own later admission, the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly, and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.

McCain's decision to choose Sarah Palin as his running mate was criticised; "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" journalist <a href="David%20Brooks%20%28commentator%29">David Brooks</a> says that "he took a disease that was running through the Republican party – anti-intellectualism, disrespect for facts – and he put it right at the centre of the party". Laura McGann in "<a href="Vox%20%28website%29">Vox</a>" says that McCain gave the "reality TV politics" and <a href="Tea%20Party%20movement">Tea Party movement</a> more political legitimacy, as well as solidifying "the Republican Party's comfort with a candidate who would say absurdities ... unleashing a political style and a values system that animated the Tea Party movement and laid the groundwork for a Trump presidency." Although McCain said later that he expressed regret for not choosing the independent Senator <a href="Joe%20Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> as his VP candidate instead, he consistently defended Palin's performances at his events.

On September 24, McCain said he was temporarily suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying the first of the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20debates%2C%202008">general election debates with Obama</a>, in order to work on the <a href="Proposed%20bailout%20of%20U.S.%20financial%20system%20%282008%29">proposed U.S. financial system bailout</a> before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the <a href="subprime%20mortgage%20crisis">subprime mortgage crisis</a> and <a href="Liquidity%20crisis%20of%20September%202008">liquidity crisis</a>. McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15. Down the stretch, McCain was outspent by Obama by a four-to-one margin.

During and after the final debate, McCain compared Obama's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked "<a href="Joe%20the%20Plumber">Joe the Plumber</a>" as a symbol of American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency. He barred using the <a href="Jeremiah%20Wright%20controversy">Jeremiah Wright controversy</a> in ads against Obama, but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding <a href="Bill%20Ayers%20presidential%20election%20controversy">his purported relationship with Bill Ayers</a>. His rallies became increasingly vitriolic, with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African-American sentiment. During a campaign rally in Minnesota, Gayle Quinnell, a McCain supporter, told him she did not trust Obama because "he's an Arab". He replied, "No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues." McCain's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics. Meghan McCain said that she cannot "go a day without someone bringing up (that) moment," and noted that at the time "there were a lot of people really trying to get my dad to go (against Obama) with ... you're a Muslim, you're not an American aspect of that," but that her father had refused. "I can remember thinking that it was a morally amazing and beautiful moment, but that maybe there would be people in the Republican Party that would be quite angry," she said.
The election took place on November 4, and Barack Obama was projected the winner at about 11:00 pm Eastern Standard Time; McCain delivered his concession speech in Phoenix, Arizona about twenty minutes later. In it, he noted the historic and special significance of Obama being elected the nation's first African American president. In the end, McCain won 173 <a href="electoral%20college%20votes">electoral college votes</a> to Obama's 365; McCain failed to win most of the <a href="battleground%20state">battleground state</a>s and lost some traditionally Republican ones. McCain gained 46 percent of the nationwide popular vote, compared to Obama's 53 percent.

<a href="Senate%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%2C%202001%E2%80%932014%23Activities%20after%20Obama%20election%20to%20presidency">Following his defeat, McCain returned to the Senate</a> amid varying views about what role he might play there. In mid-November 2008 he met with President-elect Obama, and the two discussed issues they had commonality on. Around the same time, McCain indicated that he intended to run <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Arizona%2C%202010">for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010</a>. As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters, to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival, and President Obama's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself.
Nevertheless, McCain emerged as a leader of the Republican opposition to the <a href="American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">Obama economic stimulus package of 2009</a>, saying it had too much spending for too little stimulative effect. McCain also voted against Obama's Supreme Court nomination of <a href="Sonia%20Sotomayor">Sonia Sotomayor</a>—saying that while undeniably qualified, "I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint"—and by August 2009 was siding more often with his Republican Party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career. McCain reasserted that the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a> was winnable and criticized Obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional U.S. troops there.

McCain also harshly criticized Obama for scrapping construction of the <a href="U.S.%20missile%20defense%20complex%20in%20Poland">U.S. missile defense complex in Poland</a>, declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar to what he had proposed in the past, and strongly opposed the <a href="Obama%20health%20care%20plan">Obama health care plan</a>. McCain led a successful <a href="Filibuster%20in%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">filibuster</a> of a measure that would allow repeal of the military's "<a href="Don%27t%20ask%2C%20don%27t%20tell">Don't ask, don't tell</a>" policy towards gays. Factors involved in McCain's new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain's campaign edge being slow to wear off. As one longtime McCain advisor said, "A lot of people, including me, thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration. But he's been more like the guy blowing up the bridges."
In early 2010, a primary challenge from radio talk show host and former U.S. Congressman <a href="J.%20D.%20Hayworth">J. D. Hayworth</a> materialized in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Arizona%2C%202010">2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona</a> and drew support from some but not all elements of the <a href="Tea%20Party%20movement">Tea Party movement</a>. With Hayworth using the campaign slogan "The Consistent Conservative", McCain said—despite his own past use of the term on a number of occasions—"I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities." The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay%20detention%20camp">Guantánamo Bay detention camp</a>, campaign finance restrictions, and gays in the military.

When the health care plan, now called the <a href="Patient%20Protection%20and%20Affordable%20Care%20Act">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a>, passed Congress and became law in March 2010, McCain strongly opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on the way it had been handled in Congress. As a consequence, he warned that congressional Republicans would not work with Democrats on anything else: "There will be no cooperation for the rest of the year. They have poisoned the well in what they've done and how they've done it." McCain became a vocal defender of <a href="Arizona%20SB%201070">Arizona SB 1070</a>, the April 2010 tough anti-illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy, saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government's inability to control the border. In the August 24 primary, McCain beat Hayworth by a 56 to 32 percent margin. McCain proceeded to easily defeat Democratic <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson</a> city councilman Rodney Glassman in the general election.

In the lame duck session of the <a href="111th%20Congress">111th Congress</a>, McCain voted for the compromise <a href="Tax%20Relief%2C%20Unemployment%20Insurance%20Reauthorization%2C%20and%20Job%20Creation%20Act%20of%202010">Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010</a>, but against the <a href="DREAM%20Act">DREAM Act</a> (which he had once sponsored) and the <a href="New%20START%20Treaty">New START Treaty</a>. Most prominently, he continued to lead the eventually losing fight against "Don't ask, don't tell" repeal. In his opposition, he sometimes fell into anger or hostility on the Senate floor, and called its passage "a very sad day" that would compromise the battle effectiveness of the military.

While control of the House of Representatives went over to the Republicans in the <a href="112th%20Congress">112th Congress</a>, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain continued to be the ranking member of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Senate Armed Services Committee</a>. As the <a href="Arab%20Spring">Arab Spring</a> took center stage, McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president, <a href="Hosni%20Mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a>, step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power. McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the <a href="2011%20military%20intervention%20in%20Libya">2011 military intervention in Libya</a>. In April of that year he visited the <a href="Anti-Gaddafi%20forces">Anti-Gaddafi forces</a> and <a href="National%20Transitional%20Council">National Transitional Council</a> in <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>, the highest-ranking American to do so, and said that the rebel forces were "my heroes". In June, he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have <a href="War%20Powers%20Resolution%23Libya%20intervention%20in%202011">authorized the military intervention</a>, and said: "The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive." In August, McCain voted for the <a href="Budget%20Control%20Act%20of%202011">Budget Control Act of 2011</a> that resolved the <a href="United%20States%20debt-ceiling%20crisis%20of%202011">U.S. debt ceiling crisis</a>. In November, McCain and Senator <a href="Carl%20Levin">Carl Levin</a> were leaders in efforts to codify in the <a href="National%20Defense%20Authorization%20Act%20for%20Fiscal%20Year%202012">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> that terrorism suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by <a href="Military%20Commissions%20Act%20of%202006">the U.S. military and its tribunal system</a>; following objections by civil libertarians, some Democrats, and the White House, McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens.

In the <a href="Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202012">2012 Republican Party presidential primaries</a>, McCain endorsed former 2008 rival <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> and campaigned for him, but compared the contest to a <a href="Greek%20tragedy">Greek tragedy</a> due to its drawn-out nature with massive <a href="super%20PAC">super PAC</a>-funded attack ads damaging all the contenders. He labeled the Supreme Court's 2010 "<a href="Citizens%20United%20v.%20Federal%20Election%20Commission">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a>" decision as "uninformed, arrogant, naïve", and, decrying its effects and the future scandals he thought it would bring, said it would become considered the court's "worst decision ... in the 21st century". McCain took the lead in opposing the defense spending sequestrations brought on by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and gained attention for defending State Department aide <a href="Huma%20Abedin">Huma Abedin</a> against charges brought by a few House Republicans that she had ties to the <a href="Muslim%20Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a>.

McCain continued to be one of the most frequently appearing guests on the Sunday morning news talk shows.
He became one of the most vocal critics of the Obama administration's handling of the September 11, 2012, <a href="attack%20on%20the%20U.S.%20diplomatic%20mission%20in%20Benghazi">attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi</a>, saying it was a "debacle" that featured either "a massive cover-up or incompetence that is not acceptable" and that it was worse than the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a>. As an outgrowth of this strong oppositi, he and a few other senators were successful in blocking the planned nomination of Ambassador to the UN <a href="Susan%20Rice">Susan Rice</a> to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as U.S. Secretary of State; McCain's friend and colleague John Kerry was nominated instead.

Regarding the <a href="Syrian%20civil%20war">Syrian civil war</a> that had begun in 2011, McCain repeatedly argued for the U.S. intervening militarily in the conflict on the side of the anti-government forces. He staged a visit to rebel forces inside Syria in May 2013, the first senator to do so, and called for arming the <a href="Free%20Syrian%20Army">Free Syrian Army</a> with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a <a href="no-fly%20zone">no-fly zone</a> over the country. Following reports that two of the people he posed for pictures with had been responsible for the kidnapping of eleven Lebanese Shiite pilgrims the year before, McCain disputed one of the identifications and said he had not met directly with the other. Following the <a href="2013%20Ghouta%20chemical%20weapons%20attack">2013 Ghouta chemical weapons attack</a>, McCain argued again for strong American military action against the government of the Syrian president, <a href="Bashar%20al-Assad">Bashar al-Assad</a>, and in September 2013 cast a Foreign Relations committee vote in favor of Obama's request to Congress that it authorize a military response. McCain took the lead in criticizing a growing non-interventionist movement within the Republican Party, exemplified by his March 2013 comment that Senators <a href="Rand%20Paul">Rand Paul</a> and <a href="Ted%20Cruz">Ted Cruz</a> and Representative <a href="Justin%20Amash">Justin Amash</a> were "wacko birds".

During 2013, McCain was a member of a bi-partisan group of senators, the "<a href="Gang%20of%20Eight%20%28immigration%29">Gang of Eight</a>", which announced principles for another try at comprehensive immigration reform. The resulting <a href="Border%20Security%2C%20Economic%20Opportunity%2C%20and%20Immigration%20Modernization%20Act%20of%202013">Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013</a> passed the Senate by a 68–32 margin, but faced an uncertain future in the House. In July 2013, McCain was at the forefront of an agreement among senators to drop filibusters against Obama administration executive nominees without Democrats resorting to the "<a href="nuclear%20option">nuclear option</a>" that would disallow such filibusters altogether. However, the option would be imposed later in the year anyway, to the senator's displeasure. These developments and some other negotiations showed that McCain now had improved relations with the Obama administration, including the president himself, as well as with Democratic Senate Majority Leader <a href="Harry%20Reid">Harry Reid</a>, and that he had become the leader of a power center in the Senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment. They also led some observers to conclude that the "maverick" McCain had returned.

McCain was publicly skeptical about the Republican strategy that precipitated the <a href="United%20States%20federal%20government%20shutdown%20of%202013">U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013</a> and <a href="United%20States%20debt-ceiling%20crisis%20of%202013">U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2013</a> in order to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act; in October 2013 he voted in favor of the <a href="Continuing%20Appropriations%20Act%2C%202014">Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014</a>, which resolved them and said, "Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle, as I predicted weeks ago, that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable." Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the <a href="Bipartisan%20Budget%20Act%20of%202013">Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013</a> at the end of the year. By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the <a href="Arizona%20Republican%20Party">Arizona Republican Party</a> formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been "disastrous and harmful". McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the <a href="Islamic%20State%20in%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Iraq%20offensive%20%28June%202014%29">2014 Northern Iraq offensive</a>, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign. McCain said, "Could all this have been avoided? ... The answer is absolutely yes. If I sound angry it's because I am angry."

McCain was a supporter of the <a href="Euromaidan">Euromaidan</a> protests against Ukrainian President <a href="Viktor%20Yanukovych">Viktor Yanukovych</a> and his government, and appeared in <a href="Maidan%20Nezalezhnosti">Independence Square</a> in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> in December 2013. Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent <a href="2014%20Russian%20military%20intervention%20in%20Ukraine">2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine</a>, McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces, saying the <a href="International%20sanctions%20during%20the%202014%20pro-Russian%20unrest%20in%20Ukraine">sanctions imposed against Russia</a> were not enough. In 2014, McCain led the opposition to the appointments of <a href="Colleen%20Bell">Colleen Bell</a>, <a href="Noah%20Mamet">Noah Mamet</a>, and <a href="George%20James%20Tsunis">George Tsunis</a> to the ambassadorships in Hungary, Argentina, and Norway, respectively, arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising. Unlike many Republicans, McCain supported the release and contents of the <a href="Senate%20Intelligence%20Committee%20report%20on%20CIA%20torture">Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture</a> in December 2014, saying "The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it, nonetheless." He added that the CIA's practices following the September 11 attacks had "stained our national honor" while doing "much harm and little practical good" and that "Our enemies act without conscience. We must not." He opposed the Obama administration's December 2014 decision to normalize <a href="Cuba%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">relations with Cuba</a>.

As the <a href="114th%20United%20States%20Congress">114th United States Congress</a> assembled in January 2015 with Republicans in control of the Senate, McCain became chair of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Armed Services Committee</a>, a longtime goal of his. In this position, he led the writing of proposed Senate legislation that sought to modify parts of the <a href="Goldwater-Nichols%20Act%20of%201986">Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986</a> in order to return responsibility for major weapons systems acquisition back to the individual armed services and their secretaries and away from the <a href="Under%20Secretary%20of%20Defense%20for%20Acquisition%2C%20Technology%20and%20Logistics">Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics</a>. As chair, McCain tried to maintain a bipartisan approach and forged a good relationship with ranking member <a href="Jack%20Reed%20%28politician%29">Jack Reed</a>. In April 2015, McCain announced that he would run for a sixth term in <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Arizona%2C%202016">Arizona's 2016 Senate election</a>. While there was still conservative and Tea Party anger at him, it was unclear if they would mount an effective primary challenge against him. During 2015, McCain strongly opposed the Obama administration's proposed comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program (later finalized as the <a href="Joint%20Comprehensive%20Plan%20of%20Action">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action</a> (JCPOA)), saying that Secretary of State Kerry was "delusional" and "giv[ing] away the store" in negotiations with Iran. McCain supported the <a href="Saudi%20Arabian-led%20intervention%20in%20Yemen">Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen</a> against the <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a> <a href="Houthis">Houthis</a> and forces loyal to former President <a href="Ali%20Abdullah%20Saleh">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a>, saying: "I'm sure civilians die in war. Not nearly as many as the Houthis have executed."

McCain accused President Obama of being "directly responsible" for the <a href="2016%20Orlando%20nightclub%20shooting">2016 Orlando nightclub shooting</a> "because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al-Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama's failures."
During the <a href="Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202016">2016 Republican primaries</a>, McCain said he would support the Republican nominee even if it was <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, but following <a href="Mitt%20Romney%27s%202016%20anti-Trump%20speech">Mitt Romney's 2016 anti-Trump speech</a>, McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump's "uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues". Relations between the two had been fraught since early in the <a href="Donald%20Trump%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016</a>, when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as "crazies", and the real estate mogul then said of McCain: "He insulted me, and he insulted everyone in that room ... He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured ... perhaps he was a war hero, but right now he's said a lot of very bad things about a lot of people." Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3, McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump.

McCain himself faced a primary challenge from <a href="Kelli%20Ward">Kelli Ward</a>, a fervent Trump supporter, and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman <a href="Ann%20Kirkpatrick">Ann Kirkpatrick</a> in the general election. The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trump voters; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements. However McCain defeated Ward in the primary by a double-digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls, and when the <a href="Donald%20Trump%20Access%20Hollywood%20controversy">Donald Trump "Access Hollywood" controversy</a> broke, he felt secure enough to on October 8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump. McCain stated that Trump's "demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults" made it "impossible to continue to offer even conditional support" and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, but would instead "<a href="write%20in">write in</a> the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president." McCain, at 80 years of age, went on to defeat Kirkpatrick, securing a sixth term as United States Senator from Arizona.

In November 2016, McCain learned of the existence of a <a href="Trump%E2%80%93Russia%20dossier">dossier regarding the Trump presidential campaign's links to Russia</a> compiled by <a href="Christopher%20Steele">Christopher Steele</a>. McCain sent a representative to gather more information, who obtained a copy of the dossier. In December 2016, McCain passed on the dossier to FBI Director <a href="James%20Comey">James Comey</a> in a 1-on-1 meeting. McCain later wrote that he felt the dossier's "allegations were disturbing" but unverifiable by himself, so he let the FBI investigate.

On December 31, 2016, in <a href="Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>, McCain stated that the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> should strengthen its sanctions against Russia. One year later, on December 23, 2017, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a> announced that the United States would provide Ukraine with "enhanced defensive capabilities".

McCain chaired the January 5, 2017, hearing of the <a href="Senate%20Armed%20Services%20Committee">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> where Republican and Democratic senators and intelligence officers, including <a href="James%20R.%20Clapper%20Jr.">James R. Clapper Jr.</a>, the <a href="Director%20of%20National%20Intelligence">Director of National Intelligence</a>, <a href="Michael%20S.%20Rogers">Michael S. Rogers</a>, the head of the <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Cyber%20Command">United States Cyber Command</a> presented a "united front" that "forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the Russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election."

In June 2017, McCain voted to support President Trump's controversial <a href="2017%20United%20States%E2%80%93Saudi%20Arabia%20arms%20deal">arms deal with Saudi Arabia</a>.

Repeal and replacement of Obamacare (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) was a centerpiece of McCain's 2016 re-election campaign, and in July 2017 he said, "Have no doubt: Congress must replace Obamacare, which has hit Arizonans with some of the highest premium increases in the nation and left 14 of Arizona's 15 counties with only one provider option on the exchanges this year." He added that he supports affordable and quality health care, but objected that the pending Senate bill did not do enough to shield the <a href="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> system in Arizona.

In response to the death of <a href="China">Chinese</a> <a href="2010%20Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> laureate <a href="Liu%20Xiaobo">Liu Xiaobo</a>, who died of organ failure while in government custody, McCain said that "this is only the latest example of Communist China's assault on human rights, democracy, and freedom."

In September 2017, as the <a href="2017%20Rohingya%20persecution%20in%20Myanmar">Rohingya crisis in Myanmar</a> became ethnic cleansing of the <a href="Persecution%20of%20Muslims%20in%20Myanmar">Rohingya Muslim minority</a>, McCain announced moves to scrap planned future military cooperation with <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>.

In October 2017, McCain praised President Trump's decision to decertify Iran's compliance with the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) while not yet withdrawing the U.S. from the agreement, saying that the Obama-era policy failed "to meet the multifaceted threat Iran poses. The goals President Trump presented in his speech today are a welcomed long overdue change."

On July 14, 2017, McCain underwent a minimally invasive <a href="craniotomy">craniotomy</a> at <a href="Mayo%20Clinic%23Locations">Mayo Clinic Hospital</a> in Phoenix, Arizona, in order to remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted <a href="Senate%20Majority%20Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a> <a href="Mitch%20McConnell">Mitch McConnell</a> to delay a vote on the <a href="American%20Health%20Care%20Act%20of%202017">Better Care Reconciliation Act</a>. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a <a href="glioblastoma">glioblastoma</a>, which is a very aggressive <a href="brain%20tumor">brain tumor</a>. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain was a survivor of previous cancers, including <a href="melanoma">melanoma</a>.

<a href="Donald%20Trump">President Trump</a> made a public statement wishing Senator McCain well, as did many others, including President Obama. On July 19, McCain's senatorial office issued a statement that he "appreciates the outpouring of support he has received over the last few days. He is in good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family in Arizona. He is grateful to the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic for their outstanding care, and is confident that any future treatment will be effective." On July 24, McCain announced via Twitter that he would return to the United States Senate the following day.

McCain returned to the Senate on July 25, less than two weeks after brain surgery. He cast a deciding vote allowing the Senate to begin consideration of bills to replace the Affordable Care Act. Along with that vote, he delivered a speech criticizing the <a href="party-line%20vote">party-line voting</a> process used by the Republicans, as well as by the Democrats in passing the Affordable Care Act to begin with, and McCain also urged a "return to regular order" utilizing the usual committee hearings and deliberations. On July 28, he cast the decisive vote against the Republicans' final proposal that month, the so-called "skinny repeal" option, which failed 49–51.

McCain did not vote in the Senate after December 2017, remaining instead in Arizona to undergo cancer treatment. On April 15, 2018, he underwent surgery for an infection relating to <a href="diverticulitis">diverticulitis</a> and the following day was reported to be in stable condition.



On August 24, 2018, McCain's family announced that he would no longer receive treatment for his cancer. He died the following day at 4:28 p.m. <a href="Mountain%20Standard%20Time">MST</a> (11:28 p.m. <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>), with his wife and family beside him, at his home in <a href="Cornville%2C%20Arizona">Cornville, Arizona</a>. He was four days short of his 82nd birthday.

McCain <a href="Lying%20in%20state">lay in state</a> in the <a href="Arizona%20State%20Capitol">Arizona State Capitol</a> in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> on August 29 (McCain's birthday), followed by a service at North Phoenix Baptist Church on August 30. His body travelled to Washington to lie in state in the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol%20rotunda">rotunda</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a> on August 31, before a service at the <a href="Washington%20National%20Cathedral">Washington National Cathedral</a> on September 1. He was a "lifelong <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopalian</a>" who attended, but did not join, a <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist</a> church for at least 17 years; memorial services were scheduled in both denominations. He was buried at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy%20Cemetery">United States Naval Academy Cemetery</a> on September 2, next to his Naval Academy classmate and lifelong friend Admiral <a href="Charles%20R.%20Larson">Charles R. Larson</a>. Prior to his death, McCain requested that former <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Presidents</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> and <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> deliver eulogies at his funeral, and asked that both President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> and former <a href="Governor%20of%20Alaska">Alaska Governor</a> and 2008 vice presidential nominee <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a> not attend any of the services. McCain himself planned the funeral arrangements and selected his pallbearers for the service in Washington, including former <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a>, former Wisconsin Senator <a href="Russ%20Feingold">Russ Feingold</a>, former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="William%20Cohen">William Cohen</a>, actor <a href="Warren%20Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, and Russian dissident <a href="Vladimir%20Vladimirovich%20Kara-Murza">Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza</a>.

Multiple foreign leaders attended McCain's service including; <a href="Secretary%20General%20of%20NATO">Secretary General of NATO</a> <a href="Jens%20Stoltenberg">Jens Stoltenberg</a>, <a href="President%20of%20Ukraine">President of Ukraine</a> <a href="Petro%20Poroshenko">Petro Poroshenko</a>, <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Taiwanese%20Congress">Speaker of Taiwan's Congress</a> <a href="Su%20Jia-chyuan">Su Jia-chyuan</a>, <a href="National%20Defense%20Minister%20of%20Canada">National Defense Minister of Canada</a> <a href="Harjit%20Sajjan">Harjit Sajjan</a>, <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Estonia%29">Defense Minister</a> <a href="J%C3%BCri%20Luik">Jüri Luik</a> and <a href="Foreign%20Minister%20of%20Estonia">Foreign Minister</a> <a href="Sven%20Mikser">Sven Mikser</a> of Estonia, <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Latvia%29">Foreign Minister of Latvia</a> <a href="Edgars%20Rink%C4%93vi%C4%8Ds">Edgars Rinkēvičs</a>, <a href="Foreign%20Minister%20of%20Lithuania">Foreign Minister of Lithuania</a> <a href="Linas%20Antanas%20Linkevi%C4%8Dius">Linas Antanas Linkevičius</a>, and <a href="Foreign%20Affairs%20Minister%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia">Foreign Affairs Minister of Saudi Arabia</a> <a href="Adel%20al-Jubeir">Adel al-Jubeir</a>.

Dignitaries who gave eulogies at the Memorial Service in Washington National Cathedral included <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, <a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>, <a href="Joe%20Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a>, and his daughter <a href="Meghan%20McCain">Meghan McCain</a>. The New Yorker hailed the service as the biggest resistance meeting of the Trump era.

Many American political figures went to the funeral to pay tribute. Those who attended included Former United States Presidents (Obama, Bush, Clinton, Carter), First Ladies (Michelle, Laura, Hillary, Rosalyn), and Vice Presidents (Biden, Cheney, Gore, and Quayle). Of those absent President <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> was too ill to attend the service and Donald Trump was asked not to attend. Many figures from political life both current and former from both political parties attended. Figures included, <a href="John%20Kelly%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Kelly</a>, <a href="James%20Mattis">John Mattis</a>, <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a>, <a href="Madeleine%20Albright">Madeleine Albright</a>, <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a>, <a href="Mitch%20McConnell">Mitch McConnell</a>, <a href="Paul%20Ryan">Paul Ryan</a>, <a href="Nancy%20Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>, <a href="Chuck%20Schumer">Chuck Schumer</a>, <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a>, <a href="Lindsey%20Graham">Lindsey Graham</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Flake">Jeff Flake</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20Warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>, <a href="Jon%20Huntsman%20Jr.">Jon Huntsman</a>.

<a href="Ivanka%20Trump">Ivanka Trump</a> and <a href="Jared%20Kushner">Jared Kushner</a> attended to the displeasure of <a href="Meghan%20McCain">Meghan McCain</a>.

Celebrities invited included <a href="Carl%20Bernstein">Carl Bernstein</a>, <a href="Tom%20Brokaw">Tom Brokaw</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Rose">Charlie Rose</a>, <a href="Warren%20Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, <a href="Annette%20Benning">Annette Benning</a>, <a href="Jay%20Leno">Jay Leno</a>, and <a href="Joy%20Behar">Joy Behar</a>.

Many celebrities paid tribute to the late Senator on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>. Those included, <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a> who tweeted "Duty. Honor. Country. Our nation thanks you, John McCain. There has been no finer son of America". <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, <a href="Ellen%20DeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a>, <a href="Reese%20Witherspoon">Reese Witherspoon</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a>, and <a href="Khloe%20Kardashian">Khloe Kardashian</a> also tweeted out remembrances of the late Senator.

Arizona Governor <a href="Doug%20Ducey">Doug Ducey</a> was empowered to appoint McCain's interim replacement until a <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20special%20election%20in%20Arizona%2C%202020">special election</a> is held in 2020 to determine who is to serve out the remainder of McCain's term, which ends in January 2023 and thus appointed the then former Arizona U.S. Senator <a href="Jon%20Kyl">Jon Kyl</a> to fill the vacancy. Under Arizona law, the appointed replacement must be of the same party as McCain, a Republican. Newspaper speculation about potential appointees has included McCain's widow <a href="Cindy%20McCain">Cindy</a>, former Senator <a href="Jon%20Kyl">Jon Kyl</a>, and former Representatives <a href="Matt%20Salmon">Matt Salmon</a> and <a href="John%20Shadegg">John Shadegg</a>. Ducey said that he would not make a formal appointment until after McCain's final funeral and burial; on September 4, two days after McCain was buried, Ducey appointed Kyl to fill McCain's seat.

Colonel Trần Trọng Duyệt, who ran the <a href="H%E1%BB%8Fa%20L%C3%B2%20Prison">Hỏa Lò Prison</a> when McCain was held there, remarked, "At that time I liked him personally for his toughness and strong stance. Later on, when he became a US Senator, he and Senator John Kerry greatly contributed to promote <a href="United%20States%E2%80%93Vietnam%20relations">Vietnam-US relations</a> so I was very fond of him. When I learnt about his death early this morning, I feel very sad. I would like to send condolences to his family." In a TV interview, Senator <a href="Lindsey%20Graham">Lindsey Graham</a> said McCain's last words to him were "I love you, I have not been cheated." His daughter, <a href="Meghan%20McCain">Meghan McCain</a>, shared her grief, stating that she was present at the moment he died.

<a href="Senate%20Minority%20Leader">Senate Minority Leader</a> <a href="Chuck%20Schumer">Chuck Schumer</a> (D-NY) announced that he would introduce a resolution to rename the <a href="Russell%20Senate%20Office%20Building">Russell Senate Office Building</a> after McCain. A <a href="Method%20ringing%23%26quot%3BPerformances%26quot%3B">quarter peal</a> of <a href="Grandsire">Grandsire Caters</a> in memory of McCain was rung by the bellringers of <a href="Washington%20National%20Cathedral">Washington National Cathedral</a> the day following his death. Another memorial quarter peal was rung on September 6 on the <a href="Bells%20of%20Congress">Bells of Congress</a> at the <a href="Old%20Post%20Office%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Old Post Office</a> in Washington.

President Trump reportedly rejected the White House's plans to release a statement praising McCain's life, and he initially said nothing about McCain himself in a tweet that extended condolences to McCain's family. In addition, the flag at the White House, which had been lowered to <a href="Half-mast%23United%20States">half-staff</a> the day of McCain's death (August 25), was raised back to full-staff at midnight on August 27. President Trump reportedly felt that media coverage of McCain's death was excessive given that McCain was never president. In contrast with the White House's initial decision, many governors, both Democratic and Republican, had ordered flags in their states to fly at half-staff until McCain's interment, and Senate leaders <a href="Mitch%20McConnell">Mitch McConnell</a> and <a href="Chuck%20Schumer">Chuck Schumer</a> requested support from the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Defense Department</a> so that flags would be flown at half-staff on all government buildings. The White House relented following the public backlash (including from the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> and <a href="AMVETS">AMVETS</a>) and lowered its flag back to half-staff later on August 27, while President Trump belatedly issued a statement praising McCain's service to the country, and signed a proclamation ordering flags to be flown at half-staff until McCain's interment.

Various <a href="advocacy%20group">advocacy group</a>s have given McCain scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group. The <a href="American%20Conservative%20Union">American Conservative Union</a> awarded McCain a lifetime rating of 82 percent through 2015, while McCain registered an average lifetime 12 percent "Liberal Quotient" from <a href="Americans%20for%20Democratic%20Action">Americans for Democratic Action</a> through 2015. CrowdPac, which rates politicians based on donations made and received, gave Senator McCain a score of 4.3C with 10C being the most conservative and 10L being the most liberal.

The non-partisan "<a href="National%20Journal">National Journal</a>" rates a Senator's votes by what percentage of the Senate voted more liberally than he or she, and what percentage more conservatively, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006 (as reported in the 2008 "<a href="Almanac%20of%20American%20Politics">Almanac of American Politics</a>"), McCain's average ratings were as follows: economic policy: 59 percent conservative and 41 percent liberal; social policy: 54 percent conservative and 38 percent liberal; and foreign policy: 56 percent conservative and 43 percent liberal. In 2012, the "National Journal" gave McCain a composite score of 73 percent conservative and 27 percent liberal, while in 2013 he received a composite score of 60 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal.

Columnists such as Robert Robb and <a href="Matthew%20Continetti">Matthew Continetti</a> used a formulation devised by <a href="William%20F.%20Buckley%20Jr.">William F. Buckley Jr.</a> to describe McCain as "conservative" but not "a conservative", meaning that while McCain usually tended towards conservative positions, he was not "anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern American conservatism". Following his 2008 presidential election loss, McCain began adopting more orthodox conservative views; the magazine "<a href="National%20Journal">National Journal</a>" rated McCain along with seven of his colleagues as the "most conservative" Senators for 2010 and he achieved his first 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union for that year. During Barack Obama's presidency, McCain was one of the top five Republicans most likely to vote with Obama's position on significant votes; McCain voted with Obama's position on such votes more than half the time in 2013 and was "censured by the Arizona Republican party for a so-called 'liberal' voting record".

From the late 1990s until 2008, McCain was a board member of <a href="Project%20Vote%20Smart">Project Vote Smart</a> which was set up by Richard Kimball, his 1986 Senate opponent. The project provides non-partisan information about the political positions of McCain and other candidates for political office. Additionally, McCain used his Senate website to describe his political positions.

McCain's personal character was a dominant feature of his public image. This image includes the military service of both himself and his family, the circumstances and tensions surrounding the end of his first marriage and beginning of second, his maverick political persona, his temper, his admitted problem of occasional ill-considered remarks, and his close ties to his children from both his marriages.

McCain's political appeal was more nonpartisan and less ideological compared to many other national politicians. His stature and reputation stemmed partly from his service in the Vietnam War. He also carried physical vestiges of his war wounds, as well as his melanoma surgery. When campaigning, he quipped: "I am older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein."

Writers often extolled McCain for his courage not just in war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him. McCain's shift of political stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the McCain they thought they had known. By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies, including, as one writer listed, "the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter."

In his own estimation, the senator from Arizona was straightforward and direct, but impatient. McCain's other traits included a penchant for lucky charms, a fondness for hiking, and a sense of humor that sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers: "Do you know why <a href="Chelsea%20Clinton">Chelsea Clinton</a> is so ugly? – Because <a href="Janet%20Reno">Janet Reno</a> is her father." McCain subsequently apologized profusely, and the Clinton White House accepted his apology. McCain did not shy away from addressing his shortcomings, and apologizing for them. He was known for sometimes being prickly and hot-tempered with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff were more cordial, and inspired loyalty towards him. He formed a strong bond with two senators, <a href="Joe%20Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> and <a href="Lindsey%20Graham">Lindsey Graham</a>, over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel, and they became dubbed the "Three Amigos".

McCain acknowledged having said intemperate things in years past, though he also said that many stories have been exaggerated. One <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalytic</a> comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic <a href="Julia%20Keller">Julia Keller</a> argues that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents became less frequent over the years. Lieberman made this observation: "It is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person." Senator <a href="Thad%20Cochran">Thad Cochran</a>, who knew McCain for decades and had battled him over <a href="Earmark%20%28politics%29">earmarks</a>, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: "He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me." Yet Cochran supported McCain for president when it was clear he would win the nomination. The "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" editorial board called McCain a patriot, who although sometimes wrong was fearless, and that he deserves to be thought of among the few US senators in history, whose names are more recognizable than some presidents.

All of McCain's family members were on good terms with him, and he defended them against some of the negative consequences of his high-profile political lifestyle. His family's military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV ("Jack") graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009, becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so, and is a helicopter pilot; son James served two tours with the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a> in the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>; and son Doug flew jets in the navy. His daughter <a href="Meghan%20McCain">Meghan</a> became a <a href="blogging">blogging</a> and <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>ing presence in the debate about the future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies. In 2017 Meghan joined the cast of the popular ABC talk show <a href="The%20View%20%28talk%20show%29">The View</a> as a co-host. Senator McCain himself also appeared as a guest on the program.

McCain appeared in several television shows and films while he was a sitting senator. He made uncredited <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a>s in "<a href="Wedding%20Crashers">Wedding Crashers</a>" and "<a href="24%20%28TV%20series%29">24</a>" and had two uncredited cameos in "<a href="Parks%20and%20Recreation">Parks and Recreation</a>". McCain also hosted "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" in 2002 and appeared in two episodes in 2008.

In addition to <a href="Early%20life%20and%20military%20career%20of%20John%20McCain%23Military%20awards">his military honors and decorations</a>, McCain was granted a number of civilian awards and honors.

In 1997, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine named McCain as one of the "25 Most Influential People in America".
In 1999, McCain shared the <a href="Profile%20in%20Courage%20Award">Profile in Courage Award</a> with Senator <a href="Russ%20Feingold">Russ Feingold</a> for their work towards campaign finance reform. The following year, the same pair shared the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government. In 2005, <a href="The%20Eisenhower%20Institute">The Eisenhower Institute</a> awarded McCain the Eisenhower Leadership Prize. The prize recognizes individuals whose lifetime accomplishments reflect <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>'s legacy of integrity and leadership. In 2006, the Bruce F. Vento Public Service Award was bestowed upon McCain by the National Park Trust. The same year, McCain was awarded the Henry M. Jackson Distinguished Service Award by the <a href="Jewish%20Institute%20for%20National%20Security%20Affairs">Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs</a>, in honor of Senator <a href="Henry%20M.%20Jackson">Henry M. "Scoop" Jackson</a>. In 2007, the <a href="World%20Leadership%20Forum">World Leadership Forum</a> presented McCain with the Policymaker of the Year Award; it is given internationally to someone who has "created, inspired or strongly influenced important policy or legislation". In 2010, President <a href="Mikheil%20Saakashvili">Mikheil Saakashvili</a> of <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> awarded McCain the <a href="Order%20of%20National%20Hero%20%28Georgia%29">Order of National Hero</a>, an award never previously given to a non-<a href="Georgians">Georgian</a>. In 2015, the <a href="Ukrainian%20Orthodox%20Church%20%E2%80%93%20Kiev%20Patriarchate">Kiev Patriarchate</a> awarded McCain its own version of the <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Vladimir">Order of St. Vladimir</a>. In 2016, <a href="Allegheny%20College">Allegheny College</a> awarded McCain, along with Vice President <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a>, its Prize for Civility in Public Life. In August 2016, <a href="Petro%20Poroshenko">Petro Poroshenko</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20Ukraine">President of Ukraine</a>, awarded McCain with the highest award for foreigners, the <a href="Order%20of%20Liberty%20%28Ukraine%29">Order of Liberty</a>. In 2017, <a href="Hashim%20Tha%C3%A7i">Hashim Thaçi</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20Kosovo">President of Kosovo</a>, awarded McCain the "Urdhër i Lirisë" (Order of Freedom) medal for his contribution to the freedom and independence of Kosovo, and its partnership with the U.S. McCain also received the <a href="Philadelphia%20Liberty%20Medal">Liberty Medal</a> from the <a href="National%20Constitution%20Center">National Constitution Center</a> in 2017. In the spring of 2018 McCain was decorated with the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun%231st%20Class%2C%20Grand%20Cordon">Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun</a> from the Japanese Emperor for 'strengthening bilateral relations and promoting friendship between Japan and the United States'.

American Beauty (1999 film)

American Beauty is a 1999 American <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama</a> film written by <a href="Alan%20Ball%20%28screenwriter%29">Alan Ball</a> and directed by <a href="Sam%20Mendes">Sam Mendes</a>. <a href="Kevin%20Spacey">Kevin Spacey</a> stars as Lester Burnham, a 42-year-old advertising executive who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, played by <a href="Mena%20Suvari">Mena Suvari</a>. <a href="Annette%20Bening">Annette Bening</a> stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and <a href="Thora%20Birch">Thora Birch</a> plays their insecure daughter, Jane. <a href="Wes%20Bentley">Wes Bentley</a>, <a href="Chris%20Cooper">Chris Cooper</a>, and <a href="Allison%20Janney">Allison Janney</a> also feature. Academics have described the film as a satire of <a href="American%20middle-class">American middle-class</a> notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; further analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.

Ball began writing "American Beauty" as a play in the early 1990s, partly inspired by the media circus around the <a href="Amy%20Fisher">Amy Fisher</a> trial in 1992. He shelved the play after realizing the story would not work on stage. After several years as a television screenwriter, Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry. The rewritten script had a cynical outlook influenced by Ball's frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms. Producers <a href="Dan%20Jinks">Dan Jinks</a> and <a href="Bruce%20Cohen">Bruce Cohen</a> took the script for "American Beauty" to the fledgling <a href="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> studio, which bought it for $250,000, outbidding several other production bodies. DreamWorks financed the $15 million production and served as its North American distributor. "American Beauty" marked acclaimed theater director Mendes' film debut; courted after his successful productions of the musicals "<a href="Oliver%21">Oliver!</a>" and "<a href="Cabaret%20%28musical%29">Cabaret</a>", Mendes was nevertheless only given the job after twenty others were considered and several A-list directors reportedly turned down the opportunity.

Spacey was Mendes' first choice for the role of Lester, though DreamWorks urged him to consider better-known actors. Similarly, the studio suggested several actresses for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Bening without the studio's knowledge. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on sound stages at the Warner Bros. <a href="backlot">backlot</a> in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a>, California and on location in Los Angeles. Mendes' dominant directorial style was deliberate and composed; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms generate tension. Cinematographer <a href="Conrad%20Hall">Conrad Hall</a> complemented Mendes' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events. During editing, Mendes made several changes that softened the cynical tone of Ball's script.

Released in North America on September 17, 1999, "American Beauty" was positively received by critics and audiences; it was the best-reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $350 million worldwide. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey and Ball; criticism tended to focus on the familiarity of the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase "American Beauty"s chances of <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> success; at <a href="72nd%20Academy%20Awards">the 2000 ceremony</a> the film won <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> (for Spacey), <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Screenplay">Best Original Screenplay</a>, and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a>. The film was nominated for and won many other awards and honors, mainly for directing, writing and acting.

Lester Burnham is a middle-aged office worker who despises his job. His wife, Carolyn, is an ambitious real estate broker; their sixteen-year-old daughter, Jane, abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are retired <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> Frank Fitts and his near-catatonic wife, Barbara. The Fitts' teenage son, Ricky, obsessively films his surroundings with a camcorder, collecting hundreds of recordings on video tapes in his bedroom. He also secretly deals marijuana, using a job as a part-time bar caterer to help keep it secret from his father. Having been previously forced into a military academy and a psychiatric hospital, Ricky is subjected by Col. Fitts to a strict disciplinarian lifestyle. Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, a gay couple who live nearby, welcome the family to the neighborhood; Col. Fitts later reveals his homophobia when angrily discussing the incident with Ricky.

Lester becomes infatuated with Jane's vain cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes, after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine at a high school basketball game. He starts having sexual fantasies about Angela, in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with a married business rival, Buddy Kane. Lester is told he is to be laid off, but instead blackmails his boss and quits his job, taking employment serving fast food. He buys his dream car and starts working out after he overhears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he improved his physique. He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Ricky, and flirts with Angela whenever she visits Jane. The girls' friendship wanes after Jane starts a relationship with Ricky; they bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has ever filmed: a plastic bag blowing in the wind.

Lester discovers Carolyn's infidelity, but reacts indifferently. Buddy ends the affair, fearing an expensive divorce. Col. Fitts becomes suspicious of Lester and Ricky's friendship and later finds his son's footage of a nude Lester lifting weights, which Ricky captured by chance. After watching Ricky and Lester through Lester's garage window, Col. Fitts mistakenly concludes they are sexually involved. He later beats Ricky and accuses him of being gay. Ricky falsely admits the charge and goads his father into expelling him from their home. Carolyn is shown sitting in her car, where she takes a handgun from the glove box. Ricky goes to Jane, finding her arguing with Angela about her flirtation with Lester. Ricky convinces Jane to flee with him to New York City and tells Angela she is boring and ordinary.

Col. Fitts confronts Lester and attempts to kiss him, but Lester rebuffs the colonel, who flees. Lester finds a distraught Angela sitting alone in the dark. She asks him to tell her she is beautiful; he does, and the pair kiss. However, moments before they are about to have sex, Angela admits she is a virgin and Lester decides not to go through with the act. Instead, they talk, and bond over their shared frustrations. Angela goes to the bathroom and Lester smiles at a family photograph in his kitchen. An unseen figure points a gun at the back of Lester's head; a gunshot sounds and blood sprays onto the wall in front of him. Ricky and Jane find Lester's body, while Carolyn is seen crying in the closet. A bloodied Col. Fitts returns home, where a gun is missing from his collection. Lester's closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life; he says that, despite his death, he is happy because there is so much beauty in the world.

Scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of "American Beauty"; film critics are similarly divided, not so much about the quality of the film, as their interpretations of it. Described by many as about "the meaning of life" or "the hollow existence of the American suburbs", the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: "a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories; [...] it was about imprisonment, [...] loneliness, [and] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad." The literary critic and author <a href="Wayne%20C.%20Booth">Wayne C. Booth</a> concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: "["American Beauty"] cannot be adequately summarized as 'here is a satire on what's wrong with American life'; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as 'a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds', but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball's disgust with our mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live." He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center—a controlling voice who "[unites] all of the choices". He contends that in "American Beauty"s case, it is neither Mendes nor Ball. Mendes considers the voice to be Ball's, but even while the writer was "strongly influential" on set, he often had to accept deviations from his vision, particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic. With "innumerable voices intruding on the original author's," Booth says, those who interpret "American Beauty" "have forgotten to probe for the elusive center". According to Booth, the film's true controller is the creative energy "that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting".

Mendes called "American Beauty" a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment. The monotony of Lester's existence is established through his gray, nondescript workplace and characterless clothing. In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, "reiterating rituals that hardly please him". He masturbates in the confines of his shower; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames, such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor, "confined [and] nearly crossed out". The academic and author Jody W. Pennington argues that Lester's journey is the story's center. His sexual reawakening through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to "[throw] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise". After Lester shares a <a href="joint%20%28cannabis%29">joint</a> with Ricky, his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn. Changed by Ricky's "attractive, profound confidence", Lester is convinced that Angela is attainable and sees that he must question his "banal, numbingly materialist suburban existence"; he takes a job at a fast-food outlet, which allows him to regress to a point when he could "see his whole life ahead of him".

When Lester is caught masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her. By confronting the issue and Carolyn's "superficial investments in others", Lester is trying to "regain a voice in a home that [only respects] the voices of mother and daughter". His final turning point comes when Angela and he almost have sex; after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter. He holds her close and "wraps her up". Mendes called it "the most satisfying end to [Lester's] journey there could possibly have been". With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a "mythical quest". After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks "to meet his fate". Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure. As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester's death. His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is "the culmination of the theme" of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.

Like other <a href="List%20of%20American%20films%20of%201999">American films of 1999</a>—such as "<a href="Fight%20Club">Fight Club</a>", "<a href="Bringing%20Out%20the%20Dead">Bringing Out the Dead</a>", and "<a href="Magnolia%20%28film%29">Magnolia</a>", "American Beauty" instructs its audience to "[lead] more meaningful lives". The film argues the case against conformity, but does not deny that people need and want it; even the gay characters just want to fit in. Jim and Jim, the Burnhams' other neighbors, are a satire of "gay bourgeois coupledom", who "[invest] in the numbing sameness" that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples. The feminist academic and author <a href="Sally%20Rowena%20Munt">Sally R. Munt</a> argues that "American Beauty" uses its "art house" trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the middle classes, and that this approach is a ""cliché" of bourgeois preoccupation; [...] the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual 'self' through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose, and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel."

Professor Roy M. Anker argues that the film's thematic center is its direction to the audience to "look closer". The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission that this is the last day of his life, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, "from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he telling this story? If he's already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died—or will die." Anker believes the preceding scene—Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father—adds further mystery. Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside "to view the film and its philosophical issues". Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, "American Beauty" satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a "willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness". Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in "<a href="House%20Beautiful">house beautiful</a>" domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a "fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Eden</a>". The Burnhams are unaware that they are "materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically" who expect the "rudiments of American beauty" to give them happiness. Anker argues that "they are helpless in the face of the prettified economic and sexual stereotypes [...] that they and their culture have designated for their salvation."

The film presents Ricky as its "visionary, [...] spiritual and mystical center". He sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life, videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was "an entire life behind things"; he feels that "sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in." Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the "cultural dross", has "[grasped] the radiant splendor of the created world" to see God. As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world. Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"—he has finally seen the world as it is.

According to Patti Bellantoni, colors are used symbolically throughout the film, none more so than red, which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and "[defines] Lester's arc". First seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity, Lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality. The <a href="Rosa%20%27American%20Beauty%27">American Beauty rose</a> is repeatedly used as symbol; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester's desire for her. When associated with Carolyn, the rose represents a "façade for suburban success". Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams' home, where they signify "a mask covering a bleak, unbeautiful reality". Carolyn feels that "as long as there can be roses, all is well". She cuts the roses and puts them in vases, where they adorn her "meretricious vision of what makes for beauty" and begin to die. The roses in the vase in the Angela–Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester's previous life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer, finally taking the roses—and thus Carolyn—out of the shot. Lester's epiphany at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red, building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels. The constant use of red "lulls [the audience] subliminally" into becoming used to it; consequently, it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood spatters on the wall.

Pennington argues that "American Beauty" defines its characters through their sexuality. Lester's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela, and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from "cold perfectionist" to a more carefree soul who "[sings] happily along with" the music in her car. Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other. Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability. By the end of the film, Angela's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester's attraction to her. Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim; he asks, "How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face? How can they be so shameless?" To which Ricky replies, "That's the thing, Dad—they don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of." Pennington argues that Col. Fitts' reaction is not homophobic, but an "anguished self-interrogation".

With other turn-of-the-millennium films such as "<a href="Fight%20Club">Fight Club</a>", "<a href="In%20the%20Company%20of%20Men">In the Company of Men</a>" (1997), "<a href="American%20Psycho%20%28film%29">American Psycho</a>" (2000), and "<a href="Boys%20Don%27t%20Cry%20%28film%29">Boys Don't Cry</a>" (1999), "American Beauty" "raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis". Professor Vincent Hausmann charges that in their reinforcement of masculinity "against threats posed by war, by consumerism, and by feminist and queer challenges", these films present a need to "focus on, and even to privilege" aspects of maleness "deemed 'deviant. Lester's transformation conveys "that he, and not the woman, has borne the brunt of [lack of being]" and he will not stand for being emasculated. Lester's attempts to "strengthen traditional masculinity" conflict with his responsibilities as a father. Although the film portrays the way Lester returns to that role positively, he does not become "the hypermasculine figure implicitly celebrated in films like "Fight Club"". Hausmann concludes that Lester's behavior toward Angela is "a misguided but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again".

Hausmann says the film "explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against incest"; a recurring theme of Ball's work is his comparison of the taboos against incest and homosexuality. Instead of making an overt distinction, "American Beauty" looks at how their repression can lead to violence. Col. Fitts is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester. Ball said, "The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what [they] can do." The film implies two unfulfilled incestuous desires: Lester's pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter, while Col. Fitts' repression is exhibited through the almost sexualized discipline with which he controls Ricky. Consequently, Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual, while Angela's vulnerability and submission to Lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy. Col. Fitts represents Ball's father, whose repressed homosexual desires led to his own unhappiness. Ball rewrote Col. Fitts to delay revealing him as homosexual, which Munt reads as a possible "deferment of Ball's own patriarchal-incest fantasies".

"American Beauty" follows a traditional narrative structure, only deviating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story. Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Jacqueline Furby says that the plot "occupies [...] no time [or] all time", citing Lester's claim that life did not flash before his eyes, but that it "stretches on forever like an ocean of time". Furby argues that a "rhythm of repetition" forms the core of the film's structure. For example, two scenes have the Burnhams sitting down to an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester's new-found assertiveness. Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other. Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra, and the image is reversed later for a similarly "voyeuristic and exhibitionist" scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment.
Lester's fantasies are emphasized by slow- and repetitive-motion shots; Mendes uses double-and-triple cutbacks in several sequences, and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy. One example is the gymnasium scene—Lester's first encounter with Angela. While the cheerleaders perform their half-time routine to "<a href="On%20Broadway%20%28song%29">On Broadway</a>", Lester becomes increasingly fixated on Angela. Time slows to represent his "voyeuristic hypnosis" and Lester begins to fantasize that Angela's performance is for him alone. "On Broadway"—which provides a conventional underscore to the onscreen action—is replaced by discordant, percussive music that lacks melody or progression. This <a href="diegesis">nondiegetic</a> score is important to creating the narrative stasis in the sequence; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length. The effect is one that Stan Link likens to "vertical time", described by the composer and music theorist <a href="Jonathan%20Kramer">Jonathan Kramer</a> as music that imparts "a single present stretched out into an enormous duration, a potentially infinite 'now' that nonetheless feels like an instant". The music is used like a visual cue, so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela. The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of "On Broadway" and <a href="teleology">teleological</a> time.

According to Drew Miller of "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus</a>", the soundtrack "[gives] unconscious voice" to the characters' psyches and complements the subtext. The most obvious use of pop music "accompanies and gives context to" Lester's attempts to recapture his youth; reminiscent of how the <a href="counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">counterculture of the 1960s</a> combated American repression through music and drugs, Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music. Mendes' song choices "progress through the history of American popular music". Miller argues that although some may be over familiar, there is a parodic element at work, "making good on [the film's] encouragement that viewers look closer". Toward the end of the film, <a href="Thomas%20Newman">Thomas Newman</a>'s score features more prominently, creating "a disturbing tempo" that matches the tension of the visuals. The exception is "<a href="Don%27t%20Let%20It%20Bring%20You%20Down">Don't Let It Bring You Down</a>", which plays during Angela's seduction of Lester. At first appropriate, its tone clashes as the seduction stops. The lyrics, which speak of "castles burning", can be seen as a metaphor for Lester's view of Angela—"the rosy, fantasy-driven exterior of the 'American Beauty—as it burns away to reveal "the timid, small-breasted girl who, like his wife, has willfully developed a false public self".

In 1997, Alan Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms "<a href="Grace%20Under%20Fire%20%28TV%20series%29">Grace Under Fire</a>" and "<a href="Cybill">Cybill</a>". He joined the <a href="United%20Talent%20Agency">United Talent Agency</a>, where his representative, Andrew Cannava, suggested he write a <a href="spec%20script">spec script</a> to "reintroduce [himself] to the town as a screenwriter". Ball pitched three ideas to Cannava: two conventional romantic comedies and "American Beauty", which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s. Despite the story's lack of an easily marketable concept, Cannava selected "American Beauty" because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion. While developing the script, Ball created another television sitcom, "<a href="Oh%2C%20Grow%20Up">Oh, Grow Up</a>". He channeled his anger and frustration at having to accede to network demands on that show—and during his tenures on "Grace Under Fire" and "Cybill"—into writing "American Beauty".

Ball did not expect to sell the script, believing it would act as more of a calling card, but "American Beauty" drew interest from several production bodies. Cannava passed the script to several producers, including <a href="Dan%20Jinks">Dan Jinks</a> and <a href="Bruce%20Cohen">Bruce Cohen</a>, who took it to <a href="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a>. With the help of executives Glenn Williamson and Bob Cooper, and <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> in his capacity as studio partner, Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks; he received assurances from the studio—known at the time for its more conventional fare—that it would not "iron the [edges] out". In an unusual move, DreamWorks decided not to <a href="option%20%28filmmaking%29">option</a> the script; instead, in April 1998, the studio bought it outright for $250,000, outbidding <a href="Fox%20Searchlight%20Pictures">Fox Searchlight Pictures</a>, <a href="October%20Films">October Films</a>, <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>, and <a href="Lakeshore%20Entertainment">Lakeshore Entertainment</a>. DreamWorks planned to make the film for $6–8 million.

Jinks and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film's development, including casting and director selection. The producers met with about 20 interested directors, several of whom were considered <a href="A-list">A-list</a> at the time. Ball was not keen on the more well-known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become "nervous about the content". Nevertheless, the studio offered the film to <a href="Mike%20Nichols">Mike Nichols</a> and <a href="Robert%20Zemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a>; neither accepted. In the same year, Mendes (then a theater director) revived the musical "<a href="Cabaret%20%28musical%29">Cabaret</a>" in New York with fellow director <a href="Rob%20Marshall">Rob Marshall</a>. Beth Swofford of the <a href="Creative%20Artists%20Agency">Creative Artists Agency</a> arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility. Mendes came across "American Beauty" in a pile of eight scripts at Swofford's house, and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make; early in his career, he had been inspired by how the film "<a href="Paris%2C%20Texas%20%28film%29">Paris, Texas</a>" (1984) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in "American Beauty", as well as parallels with his own childhood. Mendes later met with Spielberg; impressed by Mendes' productions of "<a href="Oliver%21">Oliver!</a>" and "Cabaret", Spielberg encouraged him to consider "American Beauty".

Mendes found that he still had to convince DreamWorks' production executives to let him direct. He had already discussed the film with Jinks and Cohen, and felt they supported him. Ball was also keen; having seen "Cabaret", he was impressed with Mendes' "keen visual sense" and thought he did not make obvious choices. Ball felt that Mendes liked to look under the story's surface, a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of "American Beauty". Mendes' background also reassured him, because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production. Over two meetings—the first with Cooper, <a href="Walter%20F.%20Parkes">Walter Parkes</a>, and <a href="Laurie%20MacDonald">Laurie MacDonald</a>, the second with Cooper alone—Mendes <a href="pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitched</a> himself to the studio. The studio soon approached Mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under <a href="Directors%20Guild%20of%20America">Directors Guild of America</a> rules—$150,000. Mendes accepted, and later recalled that after taxes and his agent's commission, he only earned $38,000. In June 1998, DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted Mendes to direct the film.

Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s. In about 1991–92, Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973-2001%29">World Trade Center</a>. He watched the bag for 10 minutes, saying later that it provoked an "unexpected emotional response". In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the <a href="Amy%20Fisher">Amy Fisher</a> trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized. He said he "felt like there was a real story underneath [that was] more fascinating and way more tragic" than the story presented to the public, and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages, but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character's story was "intensely personal", it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.

Ball based Lester's story on aspects of his own life. Lester's re-examination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid-30s; like Lester, Ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect. Scenes in Ricky's household reflect Ball's own childhood experiences. Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col. Fitts, a man who "gave up his chance to be himself". Ball said the script's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional, but that it came unconsciously from his own outlook on life. He said the juxtaposition produced a starker contrast, giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone.

In the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors, Lester and Angela had sex; by the time of shooting, Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version. Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script, feeling they were being puritanical; the final impetus to alter the scene came from DreamWorks' then-president Walter Parkes. He convinced Ball by indicating that in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the hero "has a moment of epiphany before [...] tragedy occurs". Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey—to achieve redemption. Jinks and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene right away, as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired. Early drafts also included a flashback to Col. Fitts' service in the Marines, a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual leanings. In love with another Marine, Col. Fitts sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the "sin" of being gay. Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film—Col. Fitts was the only character to have a flashback—and because it removed the element of surprise from Col. Fitts' later pass at Lester. Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to Col. Fitts, though all that remained in later drafts was subtext.

Ball remained involved throughout production; he had signed a television show development deal, so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to "American Beauty". Ball was on-set for rewrites and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming. His original bookend scenes—in which Ricky and Jane are prosecuted for Lester's murder after being framed by Col. Fitts—were excised in <a href="post-production">post-production</a>; the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary, saying they were a reflection of his "anger and cynicism" at the time of writing (see "<a href="%23Editing">Editing</a>"). Ball and Mendes revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors, and twice more before the first read-through.

The shooting script features a scene in Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a "big scene on a freeway" in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: "When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." Jane asks: "And what do you see?" Ricky: "Beauty." Ball said, "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of your fucking mind. It's one of the most important scenes in the movie!' [...] If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line." Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a "turning point" for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.

Mendes had Spacey and Bening in mind for the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks executives were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including <a href="Bruce%20Willis">Bruce Willis</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Costner">Kevin Costner</a> and <a href="John%20Travolta">John Travolta</a> to play Lester, and <a href="Helen%20Hunt">Helen Hunt</a> or <a href="Holly%20Hunter">Holly Hunter</a> to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films "<a href="The%20Usual%20Suspects">The Usual Suspects</a>" and "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Seven</a>", and 1992's "<a href="Glengarry%20Glen%20Ross%20%28film%29">Glengarry Glen Ross</a>". Spacey was surprised; he said, "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. [...] I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living one step at a time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts." Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.

Spacey loosely based Lester's early "schlubby" deportment on <a href="Walter%20Matthau">Walter Matthau</a>. During the film, Lester's physique improves from flabby to toned; Spacey worked out during filming to improve his body, but because Mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order, Spacey varied postures to portray the stages. Before filming, Mendes and Spacey analyzed <a href="Jack%20Lemmon">Jack Lemmon</a>'s performance in "<a href="The%20Apartment">The Apartment</a>" (1960), because Mendes wanted Spacey to emulate "the way [Lemmon] moved, the way he looked, the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man". Spacey's voiceover is a throwback to "<a href="Sunset%20Boulevard%20%28film%29">Sunset Boulevard</a>" (1950), which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character. Mendes felt it evoked Lester's—and the film's—loneliness. Bening recalled women from her youth to inform her performance: "I used to babysit constantly. You'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside, and then be inside their house and see the difference." Bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a "<a href="Parent-Teacher%20Association">PTA</a> president coif" hairstyle, and Mendes and production designer Naomi Shohan researched mail-order catalogs to better establish Carolyn's environment of a "spotless suburban manor". To help Bening get into Carolyn's mindset, Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like. He lent Bening the <a href="Bobby%20Darin">Bobby Darin</a> version of the song "<a href="Don%27t%20Rain%20on%20My%20Parade">Don't Rain on My Parade</a>", which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car.

For the roles of Jane, Ricky, and Angela, DreamWorks gave Mendes "carte blanche". By November 1998, <a href="Thora%20Birch">Thora Birch</a>, <a href="Wes%20Bentley">Wes Bentley</a>, and <a href="Mena%20Suvari">Mena Suvari</a> had been cast in the parts—in Birch's case, despite the fact she was underage for her nude scene. As Birch was 16 at the time she made the film, and thus classified as a <a href="Minor%20%28law%29">minor</a> in the United States, her parents had to approve her brief topless scene in the movie. Child labor representatives were on the set for the shooting of the scene. Bentley overcame competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast. The 2009 documentary "<a href="My%20Big%20Break">My Big Break</a>" followed Bentley, and several other young actors, before and after he landed the part. To prepare, Mendes provided Bentley with a video camera, telling the actor to film what Ricky would. <a href="Peter%20Gallagher">Peter Gallagher</a> and <a href="Alison%20Janney">Alison Janney</a> were cast (as Buddy Kane and Barbara Fitts) after filming began in December 1998. Mendes gave Janney a book of paintings by <a href="Edvard%20Munch">Edvard Munch</a>. He told her, "Your character is in there somewhere." Mendes cut much of Barbara's dialogue, including conversations between Colonel Frank Fitts and her, as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair—their humanity and vulnerability—was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence. <a href="Chris%20Cooper">Chris Cooper</a> plays Colonel Frank Fitts, <a href="Scott%20Bakula">Scott Bakula</a> plays Jim Olmeyer, and <a href="Sam%20Robards">Sam Robards</a> plays Jim Berkley. Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal, happy—and boring—couple in the film. Ball's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a "bland, boring, heterosexual couple" who wore matching clothes: "I can't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring." Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same forename.

Mendes insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals, although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater, and the actors could not be present at every one. Several improvisations and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script. An early scene showing the Burnhams leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester's relationship had reached. Spacey and Bening worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another; for example, the scene in which Lester almost seduces Carolyn after the pair argues over Lester's buying a car was originally "strictly contentious".

Principal photography lasted about 50 days from December 14, 1998, to February 1999. "American Beauty" was filmed on soundstages at the Warner Bros. <a href="backlot">backlot</a> in Burbank, California, and at <a href="Hancock%20Park%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Hancock Park</a> and <a href="Brentwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Brentwood</a> in Los Angeles. The aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>, and many of the school scenes were shot at <a href="South%20High%20School%20%28Torrance%29">South High School</a> in <a href="Torrance%2C%20California">Torrance, California</a>; several extras in the gym crowd were South High students. The film is set in an <a href="upper%20middle-class">upper middle-class</a> neighborhood in an unidentified American town. Production designer Naomi Shohan likened the locale to <a href="Evanston%2C%20Illinois">Evanston, Illinois</a>, but said, "it's not about a place, it's about an archetype. [...] The milieu was pretty much Anywhere, USA—upwardly mobile suburbia." The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters, who are also archetypes. Shohan said, "All of them are very strained, and their lives are constructs." The Burnhams' household was designed as the reverse of the Fitts'—the former a pristine ideal, but graceless and lacking in "inner balance", leading to Carolyn's desire to at least give it the appearance of a "perfect all-American household"; the Fitts' home is depicted in "exaggerated darkness [and] symmetry".
The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner backlot's "Blondie Street" for the Burnham and Fitts' homes. The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight—between Ricky and Jane's bedroom windows, and between Ricky's bedroom and Lester's garage. The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. Fitts—watching from Ricky's bedroom—mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex. Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot. The house interiors were filmed on the backlot, on location, and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed. The inside of the Burnhams' home was shot at a house close to <a href="Interstate%20405%20%28California%29">Interstate 405</a> and <a href="Sunset%20Boulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a> in Los Angeles; the inside of the Fitts' home was shot in the city's Hancock Park neighborhood. Ricky's bedroom was designed to be cell-like to suggest his "monkish" personality, while at the same time blending with the high-tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side. The production deliberately minimized the use of red, as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere. The Burnhams' home uses cool blues, while the Fitts' is kept in a "depressed military palette".

Mendes' dominating visual style was deliberate and composed, with a minimalist design that provided "a sparse, almost surreal feeling—a bright, crisp, hard edged, near <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Magritte">Magritte</a>-like take on American suburbia"; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers to empty the frame. He made Lester's fantasy scenes "more fluid and graceful", and Mendes made minimal use of <a href="steadicam">steadicam</a>s, feeling that stable shots generated more tension. For example, when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams' dinner table, he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters. He wanted to keep the tension in the scene, so he only cut away when Jane left the table. Mendes did use a hand-held camera for the scene in which Col. Fitts beats Ricky. Mendes said the camera provided the scene with a "kinetic [...] off-balance energy". He also went hand-held for the excerpts of Ricky's camcorder footage. Mendes took a long time to get the quality of Ricky's footage to the level he wanted. For the plastic-bag footage, Mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air. The scene took four takes; two by the <a href="second%20unit">second unit</a> did not satisfy Mendes, so he shot the scene himself. He felt his first take lacked grace, but for the last attempt, he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground. Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag.

Mendes avoided using <a href="close-up">close-up</a>s, as he believed the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted at the bottom of the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a "great idea" toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. "American Beauty" cost DreamWorks $15 million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: [...] it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault [...]; and everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault." Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: "I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.

Mendes encouraged some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in bed beside Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, "I wanted that not just because it was funny [...] but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [Spacey] is so in control—I wanted him to break through." Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a>. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.

"American Beauty" was edited by <a href="Christopher%20Greenbury">Christopher Greenbury</a> and <a href="Tariq%20Anwar%20%28film%20editor%29">Tariq Anwar</a>; Greenbury began in the position, but had to leave halfway through post-production because of a scheduling conflict with "<a href="Me%2C%20Myself%20and%20Irene">Me, Myself and Irene</a>" (2000). Mendes and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the appointments. Mendes realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned. He believed he had been making a "much more whimsical, [...] kaleidoscopic" film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines. In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit. The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against <a href="chroma%20key">bluescreen</a>, but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical—"like a <a href="Coen%20brothers">Coen brothers</a> movie"—and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set. The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father. This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester's death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane's request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening—and when the full scene plays out later—Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt. The subsequent shot—an aerial view of the neighborhood—was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence.

Mendes spent more time recutting the first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together. He trialled several versions of the opening; the first edit included bookend scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester's murder, but Mendes excised these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery, and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production. Mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film "into an episode of "<a href="NYPD%20Blue">NYPD Blue</a>"". Instead, he wanted the ending to be "a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution". When Ball first saw a completed edit, it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes. He felt that they were so short that they "didn't really register". Mendes and he argued, but Ball was more accepting after Mendes cut the sequences completely; Ball felt that without the scenes, the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that "for all its darkness had a really romantic heart".

<a href="Conrad%20Hall">Conrad Hall</a> was not the first choice for director of photography; Mendes believed he was "too old and too experienced" to want the job, and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with. Instead, Mendes asked <a href="Frederick%20Elmes">Fred Elmes</a>, who turned the job down because he did not like the script. Hall was recommended to Mendes by <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, because of Hall's work on "<a href="Without%20Limits">Without Limits</a>" (1998), which Cruise had executive produced. Mendes was directing Cruise's then-wife <a href="Nicole%20Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> in the play "<a href="The%20Blue%20Room%20%28play%29">The Blue Room</a>" during preproduction on "American Beauty", and had already <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>ed the whole film. Hall was involved for one month during preproduction; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script, and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting Mendes. Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals, which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals.

Hall's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked <a href="classicism">classicism</a>, to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences to take in the action. Hall and Mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary. In most cases, Hall first lit the scene's subject by "painting in" the blacks and whites, before adding <a href="fill%20light">fill light</a>, which he reflected from <a href="rigid%20panel">beadboard</a> or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill. Hall shot "American Beauty" in a <a href="Aspect%20ratio%20%28image%29">2.39:1 aspect ratio</a> in the <a href="Super%2035">Super 35</a> format, using <a href="List%20of%20motion%20picture%20film%20stocks%23VISION%20color%20negative%20%28ECN-2%20process%201996%E2%80%932002%29">Kodak Vision 500T 5279</a> <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm film stock</a>. He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within. He shot the whole film at the same <a href="T-stops">T-stop</a> (T1.9); given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects. He used <a href="Panavision%20cameras">Panavision Platinum</a> cameras with the company's Primo series of <a href="prime%20lens">prime</a> and <a href="zoom%20lens">zoom lens</a>es. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and <a href="List%20of%20motion%20picture%20film%20stocks%23EXR%20color%20negative%20%28ECN-2%20process%201989%E2%80%931996%29">EXR 5248</a> stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak's newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5% lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8 inch <a href="Tiffen">Tiffen</a> Black ProMist <a href="Photographic%20filter">filter</a> for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its <a href="anamorphic%20format">anamorphic</a> release print led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the <a href="Photon%20diffusion">diffusion</a> from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35–anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended.

A shot where Lester and Ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light from the top of the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot "worked perfectly for the tone of the scene". Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester. He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.

<a href="Thomas%20Newman">Thomas Newman</a>'s score was recorded in <a href="Santa%20Monica%2C%20California">Santa Monica, California</a>. He used mainly percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm, the inspiration for which was provided by Mendes. Newman "favored pulse, rhythm, and color over melody", making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created. He built each cue around "small, endlessly repeating phrases"—often, the only variety through a "thinning of the <a href="texture%20%28music%29">texture</a> for eight <a href="bar%20%28music%29">bars</a>". The percussion instruments included <a href="tabla">tabla</a>s, <a href="bongos">bongos</a>, cymbals, piano, xylophones, and <a href="marimba">marimba</a>s; also featured were guitars, flute, and <a href="world%20music">world music</a> instruments. Newman also used <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> and on "quirkier" tracks employed more unorthodox methods, such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a detuned <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>. Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the "moral ambiguity" of the script: "It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve [that]."

The soundtrack features songs by Newman, Bobby Darin, <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a>, <a href="Free%20%28band%29">Free</a>, <a href="Eels%20%28band%29">Eels</a>, <a href="The%20Guess%20Who">The Guess Who</a>, <a href="Bill%20Withers">Bill Withers</a>, <a href="Betty%20Carter">Betty Carter</a>, <a href="Peggy%20Lee">Peggy Lee</a>, <a href="The%20Folk%20Implosion">The Folk Implosion</a>, <a href="Gomez%20%28band%29">Gomez</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, as well as two <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a>s—<a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' "<a href="Because%20%28The%20Beatles%20song%29">Because</a>", performed by <a href="Elliott%20Smith">Elliott Smith</a>, and <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a>'s "Don't Let It Bring You Down", performed by <a href="Annie%20Lennox">Annie Lennox</a>. Produced by the film's music supervisor <a href="Chris%20Douridas">Chris Douridas</a>, an abridged soundtrack album was released on October 5, 1999, and went on to be nominated for a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Compilation%20Soundtrack%20Album%20for%20a%20Motion%20Picture%2C%20Television%20or%20Other%20Visual%20Media">Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album</a>. An album featuring 19 tracks from Newman's score was released on January 11, 2000, and won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Score%20Soundtrack%20Album%20for%20a%20Motion%20Picture%2C%20Television%20or%20Other%20Visual%20Media">Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album</a>. "<a href="Filmmaker%20%28magazine%29">Filmmaker</a>" considered the score to be one of Newman's best, saying it "[enabled] the film's transcendentalist aspirations". In 2006, the magazine chose the score as one of 20 essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the "complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling".

DreamWorks contracted <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> to create the official website, marking the first time that Amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film. The website included an overview, a photo gallery, cast and crew filmographies, and exclusive interviews with Spacey and Bening. The film's tagline—"look closer"—originally came from a cutting pasted on Lester's workplace cubicle by the set dresser. DreamWorks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers—one aimed at adults, the other at teenagers. Both trailers ended with the poster image of a girl holding a rose. Reviewing the posters of several 1999 films, David Hochman of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" rated "American Beauty"s highly, saying it evoked the tagline; he said, "You return to the poster again and again, thinking, this time you're gonna find something." DreamWorks did not want to <a href="test%20screening">test screen</a> the film; according to Mendes, the studio was pleased with it, but he insisted on one where he could question the audience afterward. The studio reluctantly agreed and showed the film to a young audience in <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose, California</a>. Mendes claimed the screening went very well.

The film had its world premiere on September 8, 1999, at <a href="Grauman%27s%20Egyptian%20Theatre">Grauman's Egyptian Theatre</a> in Los Angeles. Three days later, the film appeared at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>. With the filmmakers and cast in attendance, it screened at several American universities, including the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California at Berkeley</a>, <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California at Los Angeles</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>, and <a href="Northwestern%20University">Northwestern University</a>.
On September 15, 1999, "American Beauty" opened to the public in <a href="limited%20release">limited release</a> at three theaters in Los Angeles and three in New York. More theaters were added during the limited run, and on October 1, the film officially entered <a href="wide%20release">wide release</a> by screening in 706 theaters across North America. The film grossed $8,188,587 over the weekend, ranking third at the box office. Audiences polled by the market research firm <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> gave "American Beauty" a "B+" grade on average. The theater count hit a high of 1,528 at the end of the month, before a gradual decline. Following "American Beauty"s wins at the <a href="57th%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards">57th Golden Globe Awards</a>, DreamWorks re-expanded the theater presence from a low of 7 in mid-February, to a high of 1,990 in March. The film ended its North American theatrical run on June 4, 2000, having grossed $130.1 million.

"American Beauty" had its European premiere at the <a href="London%20Film%20Festival">London Film Festival</a> on November 18, 1999; in January 2000, it began to screen in various territories outside North America. It debuted in Israel to "potent" returns, and limited releases in Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Finland followed on January 21. After January 28 opening weekends in Australia, the United Kingdom, Spain and Norway, "American Beauty" had earned $7 million in 12 countries for a total of $12.1 million outside North America. On February 4, "American Beauty" debuted in France and Belgium. Expanding to 303 theaters in the United Kingdom, the film ranked first at the box office with $1.7 million. On the weekend of February 18—following "American Beauty"s eight nominations for the <a href="72nd%20Academy%20Awards">72nd Academy Awards</a>—the film grossed $11.7 million from 21 territories, for a total of $65.4 million outside North America. The film had "dazzling" debuts in Hungary, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and New Zealand.

As of February 18, the most successful territories were the United Kingdom ($15.2 million), Italy ($10.8 million), Germany ($10.5 million), Australia ($6 million), and France ($5.3 million). The Academy Award nominations meant strong performances continued across the board; the following weekend, "American Beauty" grossed $10.9 million in 27 countries, with strong debuts in Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea. Other high spots included robust returns in Argentina, Greece, and Turkey. On the weekend of March 3, 2000, "American Beauty" debuted strongly in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, markets traditionally "not receptive to this kind of upscale fare". The impressive South Korean performance continued, with a return of $1.2 million after nine days. In total, "American Beauty" grossed $130.1 million in North America and $226.2 million internationally, for $356.3 million worldwide.

"American Beauty" was released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> on May 9, 2000, and on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> with the <a href="DTS%20%28sound%20system%29">DTS</a> format on October 24, 2000. Before the North American rental release on May 9, <a href="Blockbuster%20Inc.">Blockbuster Video</a> wanted to purchase hundreds of thousands of extra copies for its "guaranteed title" range, whereby anyone who wanted to rent the film would be guaranteed a copy. Blockbuster and DreamWorks could not agree on a profit-sharing deal, so Blockbuster ordered two-thirds the number of copies it originally intended. DreamWorks made around one million copies available for rental; Blockbuster's share would usually have been about 400,000 of these. Some Blockbuster stores only displayed 60 copies, and others did not display the film at all, forcing customers to ask for it. The strategy required staff to read a statement to customers explaining the situation; Blockbuster claimed it was only "[monitoring] customer demand" due to the reduced availability. Blockbuster's strategy leaked before May 9, leading to a 30% order increase from other retailers. In its first week of rental release, "American Beauty" made $6.8 million. This return was lower than would have been expected had DreamWorks and Blockbuster reached an agreement. In the same year, "<a href="The%20Sixth%20Sense">The Sixth Sense</a>" made $22 million, while "Fight Club" made $8.1 million, though the latter's North American theatrical performance was just 29% that of "American Beauty". Blockbuster's strategy also affected rental fees; "American Beauty" averaged $3.12, compared with $3.40 for films that Blockbuster fully promoted. Only 53% of the film's rentals were from large outlets in the first week, compared with the usual 65%.

The DVD release included a behind-the-scenes featurette, film audio commentary from Mendes and Ball, and a storyboard presentation with discussion from Mendes and Hall. In the film commentary, Mendes refers to deleted scenes he intended to include in the release. However, these scenes are not on the DVD, as he changed his mind after recording the commentary; Mendes felt that to show scenes he previously chose not to use would detract from the film's integrity.

On September 21, 2010, <a href="Paramount%20Home%20Entertainment">Paramount Home Entertainment</a> released "American Beauty" on <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a>, as part of Paramount's Sapphire Series. All the extras from the DVD release were present, with the theatrical trailers upgraded to <a href="High-definition%20video">HD</a>.

"American Beauty" was widely considered the best film of 1999 by the American press. It received overwhelming praise, chiefly for Spacey, Mendes and Ball. "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" reported that "no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal raves." It was the best-received title at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a> (TIFF), where it won the People's Choice award after a ballot of the festival's audiences. TIFF's director, Piers Handling, said, ""American Beauty" was the buzz of the festival, the film most talked-about."

Writing in "Variety", <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a> said the cast ensemble "could not be better"; he praised Spacey's "handling of innuendo, subtle sarcasm, and blunt talk" and the way he imbued Lester with "genuine feeling". <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> in "The New York Times" said Spacey was at his "wittiest and most agile" to date, and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who "does reckless and foolish things [but who] doesn't deceive himself". Kevin Jackson of "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances, the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of "both sap and hero". Writing in "<a href="Film%20Quarterly">Film Quarterly</a>", Gary Hentzi praised the actors, but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. Fitts were stereotypes. Hentzi accused Mendes and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky, saying the latter was their "fantasy figure"—a teenaged boy who's an absurdly wealthy artist able to "finance [his] own projects". Hentzi said Angela was the most believable teenager, in particular with her "painfully familiar" attempts to "live up to an unworthy image of herself". Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal, but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable. <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> of the "Los Angeles Times" said the actors coped "faultlessly" with what were difficult roles; he called Spacey's performance "the energy that drives the film", saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester not always being sympathetic. "Against considerable odds, we do like [these characters]," Turan concluded.

Maslin felt that Mendes directed with "terrific visual flair", saying his minimalist style balanced "the mordant and bright" and that he evoked the "delicate, eroticized power-playing vignettes" of his theater work. Jackson said Mendes' theatrical roots rarely showed, and that the "most remarkable" aspect was that Spacey's performance did not overshadow the film. He said that Mendes worked the script's intricacies smoothly, to the ensemble's strengths, and staged the tonal shifts skillfully. McCarthy believed "American Beauty" a "stunning card of introduction" for film débutantes Mendes and Ball. He said Mendes' "sure hand" was "as precise and controlled" as his theater work. McCarthy cited Hall's involvement as fortunate for Mendes, as the cinematographer was "unsurpassed" at conveying the themes of a work. Turan agreed that Mendes' choice of collaborators was "shrewd", naming Hall and Newman in particular. Turan suggested that "American Beauty" may have benefited from Mendes' inexperience, as his "anything's possible daring" made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided. Turan felt that Mendes' accomplishment was to "capture and enhance [the] duality" of Ball's script—the simultaneously "caricatured [...] and painfully real" characters. Hentzi, while critical of many of Mendes and Ball's choices, admitted the film showed off their "considerable talents".

Turan cited Ball's lack of constraint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness, in particular the script's subtle changes in tone. McCarthy said the script was "as fresh and distinctive" as any of its American film contemporaries, and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball's dialogue "tart" and said the characters—Carolyn excepted—were "deeply drawn". One other flaw, McCarthy said, was the revelation of Col. Fitts' homosexuality, which he said evoked "hoary <a href="Sigmund%20Freud%23Freud%27s%20ideas">Freudianism</a>". Jackson said the film transcended its clichéd setup to become a "wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy". He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs, it did so with "unexpected nuance". Hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester's murder, believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense. McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses, and said the soundtrack was good at creating "ironic counterpoint[s]" to the story. Hentzi concluded that "American Beauty" was "vital but uneven"; he felt the film's examination of "the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other's lives" was its best point, and that although Lester and Angela's dynamic was familiar, its romantic irony stood beside "the most enduring literary treatments" of the theme, such as "<a href="Lolita">Lolita</a>". Nevertheless, Hentzi believed that the film's themes of materialism and conformity in American suburbia were "hackneyed". McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar, but said it merely provided the film with a "starting point" from which to tell its "subtle and acutely judged tale". Maslin agreed; she said that while it "takes aim at targets that are none too fresh", and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise, the film had its own "corrosive novelty". Ebert awarded "American Beauty" four stars out of four, and Turan said it was layered, subversive, complex, and surprising, concluding it was "a hell of a picture".

A few months after the film's release, reports of a backlash appeared in the American press, and the years since have seen its critical regard wane. In 2005, "<a href="Premiere%20%28magazine%29">Premiere</a>" named "American Beauty" as one of 20 "most overrated movies of all time"; Mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappraisal, saying, "I thought some of it was entirely justified—it was a little overpraised at the time." 

"American Beauty" was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season. Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999, and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists. The <a href="Chicago%20Film%20Critics%20Association">Chicago Film Critics Association</a> and the <a href="Broadcast%20Film%20Critics%20Association">Broadcast Film Critics Association</a> named the film the best of 1999, but while the <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Critics%20Circle">New York Film Critics Circle</a>, the <a href="National%20Society%20of%20Film%20Critics">National Society of Film Critics</a> and the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Film%20Critics%20Association">Los Angeles Film Critics Association</a> recognized "American Beauty", they gave their top awards to other films. By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested "American Beauty" was the underdog in the race for Best Picture; however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, "American Beauty" won <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Motion%20Picture%20%E2%80%93%20Drama">Best Film</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a> and <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Screenplay">Best Screenplay</a>.

As the nominations for the <a href="72nd%20Academy%20Awards">72nd Academy Awards</a> approached, a frontrunner had not emerged. DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for "American Beauty" five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5,600 Academy Award voters. Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies. Although <a href="advertising%20mail">direct mail</a> campaigning was prohibited, DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in "casual, comfortable settings" in voters' communities. The studio's candidate for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a> the previous year, "<a href="Saving%20Private%20Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a>", lost to "<a href="Shakespeare%20in%20Love">Shakespeare in Love</a>", so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign. It hired three veteran consultants, who told the studio to "think small". Nancy Willen encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of "American Beauty", to set up displays of the film in the communities' bookstores, and to arrange a question-and-answer session with Mendes for the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a>. <a href="Dale%20Olson">Dale Olson</a> advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in <a href="Beverly%20Hills">Beverly Hills</a>—home to many voters—in addition to major newspapers. Olson arranged to screen "American Beauty" to about 1,000 members of the Actors Fund of America, as many participating actors were also voters. Bruce Feldman took writer Alan Ball to the <a href="Santa%20Barbara%20International%20Film%20Festival">Santa Barbara International Film Festival</a>, where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of <a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a>, meeting several voters who were in attendance.

In February 2000, "American Beauty" was nominated for eight Academy Awards; its closest rivals, "<a href="The%20Cider%20House%20Rules%20%28film%29">The Cider House Rules</a>" and "<a href="The%20Insider%20%28film%29">The Insider</a>", received seven nominations each. In March 2000, the major industry labor organizations all awarded their top honors to "American Beauty"; perceptions had shifted—the film was now the favorite to dominate the Academy Awards. "American Beauty"s closest rival for Best Picture was still "The Cider House Rules", from <a href="Miramax">Miramax</a>. Both studios mounted aggressive campaigns; DreamWorks bought 38% more advertising space in "Variety" than Miramax. On March 26, 2000, "American Beauty" won five Academy Awards: Best Picture, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> (Spacey), <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Screenplay">Best Original Screenplay</a> and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a>. At the <a href="53rd%20British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">53rd British Academy Film Awards</a>, "American Beauty" won six of the 14 awards for which it was nominated: <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">Best Film</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">Best Actor</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">Best Actress</a> (Bening), <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Music">Best Film Music</a> and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Editing">Best Editing</a>. In 2000, the Publicists Guild of America recognized DreamWorks for the best film publicity campaign. In September 2008, "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" named "American Beauty" the 96th "Greatest Movie of All Time" after a poll of 10,000 readers, 150 filmmakers, and 50 film critics, the fourth-highest ranked movie from 1999 (behind "Fight Club", "The Matrix", and "Magnolia"). In 2006, the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> ranked the screenplay number 38 on its list of the 101 greatest screenplays.

Catherine de' Medici

Catherine de Medici (<a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>: "Caterina de Medici", ; <a href="French%20language">French</a>: "Catherine de Médicis", ; 13 April 1519 – 5 January 1589), daughter of <a href="Lorenzo%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Duke%20of%20Urbino">Lorenzo II de' Medici</a> and <a href="Madeleine%20de%20La%20Tour%20d%27Auvergne">Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne</a>, was an <a href="Italians">Italian</a> noblewoman who was <a href="List%20of%20French%20consorts">queen of France</a> from 1547 until 1559, by marriage to <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">King Henry II</a>. As the mother of kings <a href="Francis%20II%20of%20France">Francis II</a>, <a href="Charles%20IX%20of%20France">Charles IX</a> and <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20France">Henry III</a>, she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France. From 1560 to 1563, she ruled France as <a href="regent">regent</a> for her son <a href="Charles%20IX%20of%20France">Charles IX, King of France</a>.

In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, second son of <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">King Francis I</a> and <a href="Claude%20of%20France">Queen Claude of France</a>. Throughout his reign, Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favors on his chief mistress, <a href="Diane%20de%20Poitiers">Diane de Poitiers</a>, who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail fifteen-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life (he would outlive her by seven months).

Catherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant <a href="French%20Wars%20of%20Religion">civil and religious war in France</a>. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Calvinist Protestants, or <a href="Huguenots">Huguenots</a>, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the <a href="St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Day%20massacre">St. Bartholomew's Day massacre</a> of 1572, in which thousands of <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>s were killed in Paris and throughout France.

Some historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters. In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the <a href="House%20of%20Valois">Valois monarchy</a> on the throne at all costs, and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline. Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power. The years during which they reigned have been called "the age of Catherine de' Medici". According to Mark Strage, one of her biographers, Catherine was the most powerful woman in sixteenth-century Europe.

Catherine de Medici was born on 13 April 1519 in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Florence">Republic of Florence</a>, the only child of <a href="Lorenzo%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Duke%20of%20Urbino">Lorenzo de' Medici, duke of Urbino</a>, and his wife, <a href="Madeleine%20de%20la%20Tour%20d%27Auvergne">Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne</a>, the countess of Boulogne. The young couple had been married the year before at <a href="Amboise">Amboise</a> as part of the alliance between King <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a> and Lorenzo's uncle <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a> against the <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I</a>. According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine was born, her parents were "as pleased as if it had been a boy".

Within a month of Catherine's birth, both her parents were dead: Madeleine died on 28 April of <a href="puerperal%20fever">puerperal fever</a> or <a href="plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>, and Lorenzo died on 4 May, his title over Urbino reverting to <a href="Francesco%20Maria%20I%20della%20Rovere">Francesco Maria I della Rovere</a>. King Francis wanted Catherine to be raised at the French court, but Pope Leo had other plans for her.

Catherine was first cared for by her paternal grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of <a href="Piero%20di%20Lorenzo%20de%27%20Medici">Piero de' Medici</a>). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, <a href="Clarice%20de%27%20Medici">Clarice de' Medici</a>. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VII">Pope Clement VII</a> in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the <a href="Palazzo%20Medici%20Riccardi">Palazzo Medici Riccardi</a> in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her "duchessina" ("the little duchess"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Urbino">Duchy of Urbino</a>.

In 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction opposed to the regime of Clement's representative, Cardinal <a href="Silvio%20Passerini">Silvio Passerini</a>, and Catherine was taken hostage and placed in a series of convents. The final one, the "Santissima Annuziata delle Murate" was her home for three years. Mark Strage described these years as "the happiest of her entire life". Clement had no choice but to crown <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles</a> Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city. In October 1529, Charles's troops laid <a href="Siege%20of%20Florence%20%281529%E2%80%931530%29">siege to Florence</a>. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed naked and chained to the city walls. Some even suggested that she be handed over to the troops to be used for their sexual gratification. The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement summoned Catherine from her beloved convent to join him in Rome where he greeted her with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.

On her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described Catherine as "small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family". Suitors, however, lined up for her hand, including <a href="James%20V%20of%20Scotland">James V of Scotland</a> who sent the <a href="John%20Stewart%2C%20Duke%20of%20Albany">Duke of Albany</a> to Clement to conclude a marriage in April and November 1530. When Francis I of France proposed his second son, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry, Duke of Orléans</a>, in early 1533, Clement jumped at the offer. Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who despite her wealth was of common origin.

The wedding, a grand affair marked by extravagant display and gift-giving, took place in the <a href="%C3%89glise%20Saint-Ferr%C3%A9ol%20les%20Augustins">Église Saint-Ferréol les Augustins</a> in <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> on 28 October 1533. Prince Henry danced and <a href="jousting">jousted</a> for Catherine. The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to perform their nuptial duties. Henry arrived in the bedroom with King Francis, who is said to have stayed until the marriage was consummated. He noted that "each had shown valour in the joust". Clement visited the newlyweds in bed the next morning and added his blessings to the night's proceedings.

Catherine saw little of her husband in their first year of marriage, but the ladies of the court treated her well, impressed with her intelligence and keenness to please. The death of Pope Clement VII on 25 September 1534, however, undermined Catherine's standing in the French court. The next pope, <a href="Pope%20Paul%20III">Paul III</a>, broke the alliance with France and refused to pay her huge dowry. King Francis lamented, "The girl has come to me stark naked."

Prince Henry showed no interest in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children. In 1537, <a href="Filippa%20Duci">Philippa Duci</a>, one of Henry's mistresses, gave birth to a daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged. This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.

In 1536, Henry's older brother, <a href="Francis%2C%20Dauphin%20of%20France%20%281518-1536%29">Francis</a>, caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever and died shortly after, leaving Henry the heir. As <a href="Dauphine%20of%20France">dauphine</a>, Catherine was expected to provide a future heir to the throne. According to the court chronicler <a href="Pierre%20de%20Bourdeille%2C%20seigneur%20de%20Brant%C3%B4me">Brantôme</a>, "many people advised the king and the <a href="Dauphin%20of%20France">Dauphin</a> to repudiate her, since it was necessary to continue the line of France". Divorce was discussed. In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her "source of life", and drinking mule's urine. On 19 January 1544, she at last gave birth to a <a href="Francis%20II%20of%20France">son</a>, named after King Francis.

After becoming pregnant once, Catherine had no trouble doing so again. She may have owed her change of fortune to the physician <a href="Jean%20Fernel">Jean Fernel</a>, who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem. Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Valois">Elisabeth</a>. She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, six of whom survived infancy, including the future <a href="Charles%20IX%20of%20France">Charles IX</a> (born 27 June 1550); the future <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20France">Henry III</a> (born 19 September 1551); and <a href="Francis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anjou">Francis, Duke of Anjou</a> (born 18 March 1555). The long-term future of the <a href="House%20of%20Valois">Valois dynasty</a>, which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.

Catherine's ability to bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1534, at the age of 15, Henry had taken as his mistress the 38-year-old <a href="Diane%20de%20Poitiers">Diane de Poitiers</a>, whom he adored for the rest of his life. Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort. When King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the <a href="Basilique%20Saint-Denis">basilica of Saint-Denis</a> on 10 June 1549.

Henry allowed Catherine almost no political influence as queen. Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal. Henry gave the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chenonceau">Château of Chenonceau</a>, which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, who took her place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours.
The imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts. Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king to spend more time with Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb. The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.

Henry's reign also saw the rise of the Guise brothers, <a href="Charles%2C%20Cardinal%20of%20Lorraine">Charles</a>, who became a <a href="cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinal</a>, and Henry's boyhood friend <a href="Francis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Guise">Francis</a>, who became <a href="Counts%20and%20Dukes%20of%20Guise">Duke of Guise</a>. Their sister <a href="Mary%20of%20Guise">Mary of Guise</a> had married <a href="James%20V%20of%20Scotland">James V of Scotland</a> in 1538 and was the mother of <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. At the age of five and a half, Mary was brought to the French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis. Catherine brought her up with her own children at the French court, while Mary of Guise governed Scotland as her daughter's <a href="regent">regent</a>.
On 3–4 April 1559, Henry signed the <a href="Italian%20War%20of%201551%E2%80%931559">Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis</a> with the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and England, ending a long period of <a href="Italian%20Wars">Italian wars</a>. The treaty was sealed by the betrothal of Catherine's thirteen-year-old daughter <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Valois">Elisabeth</a> to <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>. Their <a href="proxy%20wedding">proxy wedding</a>, in Paris on 22 June 1559, was celebrated with festivities, balls, <a href="masque">masque</a>s, and five days of <a href="jousting">jousting</a>.

King Henry took part in the jousting, sporting Diane's black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young <a href="Gabriel%2C%20comte%20de%20Montgomery">Gabriel, comte de Montgomery</a>, knocked him half out of the saddle. Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery's lance shattered in the king's face. Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters "of a good bigness" sticking out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Château de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, "for fear", in the words of a chronicler, "of being expelled by the Queen". For the next ten days, Henry's state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died, aged 40. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words ""lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor"" ("from this come my tears and my pain"), and wore black <a href="mourning">mourning</a> in memory of Henry.

<a href="Francis%20II%20of%20France">Francis II</a> became king at the age of fifteen. In what has been called a "<a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>", the Cardinal of Lorraine and the <a href="Francis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Guise">Duke of Guise</a>—whose niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, had married Francis the year before—seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved themselves into the <a href="Louvre%20Palace">Louvre Palace</a> with the young couple. The English ambassador reported a few days later that "the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king". For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity. She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself. Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: "This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that ..." Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority. One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chenonceau">Château de Chenonceau</a> to the crown. She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.

The Guise brothers set about persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke against the Guise persecutions, though she had no particular sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to <a href="Antoine%20of%20Navarre">Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre</a>, the <a href="First%20Prince%20of%20the%20Blood">First Prince of the Blood</a>, and then, with more success, to his brother, <a href="Louis%2C%20Prince%20of%20Cond%C3%A9%20%281530%E2%80%931569%29">Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé</a>, who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force. When the Guises heard of the plot, they moved the court to the fortified <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Amboise">Château of Amboise</a>. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the château. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many of them on the spot, including the commander, La Renaudie. Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.

In June 1560, <a href="Michel%20de%20l%27H%C3%B4pital">Michel de l'Hôpital</a> was appointed <a href="List%20of%20Justice%20Ministers%20of%20France">Chancellor of France</a>. He sought the support of France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend the law in the face of the growing anarchy. Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a>. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Condé raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an <a href="abscess">abscess</a> in his ear.

When Catherine had realized Francis was going to die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, <a href="Charles%20IX%20of%20France">Charles IX</a>, in return for the release of his brother Condé. As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France ("gouvernante de France"), with sweeping powers. She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: "My principal aim is to have the honour of God before my eyes in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers".

At first Catherine kept the nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage. However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.

She summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the resulting <a href="Colloquy%20of%20Poissy">Colloquy of Poissy</a> ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission. Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, "she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if only she could get the party leaders to agree". In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant <a href="Edict%20of%20Saint-Germain">Edict of Saint-Germain</a> in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants. On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the <a href="Massacre%20of%20Vassy">Massacre of Vassy</a>, the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at <a href="Wassy">Vassy (Wassy)</a>, killing 74 and wounding 104. Guise, who called the massacre "a regrettable accident", was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the <a href="French%20Wars%20of%20Religion">French Wars of Religion</a>. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.

Within a month <a href="Louis%2C%20Prince%20of%20Cond%C3%A9%20%281530%E2%80%931569%29">Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé</a>, and <a href="Gaspard%20II%20de%20Coligny">Admiral Gaspard de Coligny</a> had raised an army of 1,800. They formed an alliance with England and seized town after town in France. Catherine met Coligny, but he refused to back down. She therefore told him: "Since you rely on your forces, we will show you ours". The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>. Catherine visited the deathbed of <a href="Antoine%20of%20Navarre">Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre</a>, after he was fatally wounded by an <a href="arquebus">arquebus</a> shot. Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, "My courage is as great as yours". The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short lived. On 18 February 1563, a spy called <a href="Jean%20de%20Poltrot">Poltrot de Méré</a> fired an arquebus into the back of the <a href="Francis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Guise">Duke of Guise</a>, at the siege of Orléans. The murder triggered an aristocratic <a href="feud">blood feud</a> that complicated the French civil wars for years to come. Catherine, however, was delighted with the death of her ally. "If Monsieur de Guise had perished sooner", she told the Venetian ambassador, "peace would have been achieved more quickly". On 19 March 1563, the <a href="Edict%20of%20Amboise">Edict of Amboise</a>, also known as the Edict of Pacification, ended the war. Catherine now rallied both Huguenot and Catholic forces to retake <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> from the English.

On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was declared of age at the <a href="Parlement">Parlement</a> of Rouen, but he was never able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government. Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the <a href="Edict%20of%20Amboise">Edict of Amboise</a> and revive loyalty to the crown. To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a <a href="royal%20entry">progress</a> around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565. Catherine held talks with <a href="Jeanne%20d%27Albret">Jeanne d'Albret</a>, the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of <a href="Antoine%20de%20Bourbon">Antoine de Bourbon</a>) at <a href="M%C3%A2con">Mâcon</a> and <a href="N%C3%A9rac">Nérac</a>. She also met her daughter <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Valois">Elisabeth</a> at <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a> near the Spanish border, amidst lavish <a href="Catherine%20de%27%20Medici%27s%20court%20festivals">court festivities</a>. <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II</a> excused himself from the occasion. He sent the <a href="Fernando%20%C3%81lvarez%20de%20Toledo%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Alba">Duke of Alba</a> to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.

In 1566, through the ambassador to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, <a href="Guillaume%20de%20Grandchamp%20de%20Grantrie">Guillaume de Grandchamp de Grantrie</a>, and because of a long-standing <a href="Franco-Ottoman%20alliance">Franco-Ottoman alliance</a>, Charles and Catherine proposed to the Ottoman Court a plan to resettle French <a href="Huguenots">Huguenots</a> and French and German <a href="Lutherans">Lutherans</a> in Ottoman-controlled <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>, in order to create a military colony and a buffer against the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a>. This plan also had the added advantage of removing the Huguenots from <a href="France">France</a>, but it failed to interest the Ottomans.

On 27 September 1567, in a swoop known as the <a href="Surprise%20of%20Meaux">Surprise of Meaux</a>, Huguenot forces attempted to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war. Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray. The war was ended by the <a href="Peace%20of%20Longjumeau">Peace of Longjumeau</a> of 22–23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued. The Surprise of Meaux marked a turning point in Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots. From that moment, she abandoned compromise for a policy of repression. She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one could expect from Huguenots was deceit, and she praised the Duke of Alba's reign of terror in the Netherlands, where <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a>s and rebels were put to death in the thousands.

The Huguenots retreated to the fortified stronghold of <a href="La%20Rochelle">La Rochelle</a> on the west coast, where Jeanne d'Albret and her fifteen-year-old son, <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry of Bourbon</a>, joined them. "We have come to the determination to die, all of us", Jeanne wrote to Catherine, "rather than abandon our God, and our religion". Catherine called Jeanne, whose decision to rebel posed a dynastic threat to the Valois, "the most shameless woman in the world". Nevertheless, the <a href="Peace%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye">Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>, signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.

Catherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Austria%20%281554-1592%29">Elisabeth of Austria</a>, daughter of <a href="Maximilian%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Catherine was also eager for a match between one of her two youngest sons and <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a>. After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter <a href="Margaret%20of%20Valois">Margaret</a> as a bride for <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20Navarre">Henry III of Navarre</a>, Jeanne' son, with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with <a href="Henry%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Guise">Henry of Guise</a>, the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.

Catherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret to attend court. Writing that she wanted to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: "Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children". When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine pressured her hard, playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves. The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at <a href="Notre-Dame%20de%20Paris">Notre-Dame</a>, Paris. Frieda dismisses this accusation based on the fact Catherine had nothing to gain from her death, once the marriage contract had been signed, although Frieda considered Catherine responsible for Philibert le Vayer, who was Duke of Anjou's favourite.

Three days later, <a href="Gaspard%20II%20de%20Coligny">Admiral Coligny</a> was walking back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm. A smoking arquebus was discovered in a window, but the culprit had made his escape from the rear of the building on a waiting horse. Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon <a href="Ambroise%20Par%C3%A9">Ambroise Paré</a> removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king. Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.

The <a href="St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Day%20massacre">St. Bartholomew's Day massacre</a>, which began two days later, has stained Catherine's reputation ever since. There is reason to believe she was party to the decision when on 23 August Charles IX is said to have ordered, "Then kill them all! Kill them all!" Historians have suggested that Catherine and her advisers expected a Huguenot uprising to avenge the attack on Coligny. They chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the Huguenot leaders while they were still in Paris after the wedding.

The slaughter in Paris lasted for almost a week. It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn. In the words of historian <a href="Jules%20Michelet">Jules Michelet</a>, "St Bartholomew was not a day, but a season". On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed. From this time dates the legend of the wicked Italian queen. Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a>'s principles to kill all enemies in one blow.

Two years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were "oh, my mother ...". The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the <a href="Polish-Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, where he had been elected <a href="List%20of%20Polish%20monarchs%23Polish-Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">king</a> the year before. However, three months after his coronation at <a href="Wawel%20Cathedral">Wawel Cathedral</a>, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end ... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you."

Henry was Catherine's favourite son. Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>s and <a href="flagellation">flagellation</a>.

Henry married <a href="Louise%20de%20Lorraine-Vaud%C3%A9mont">Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont</a> in February 1575, two days after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal <a href="nuncio">nuncio</a> Salviati observed, "it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring ... physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long." As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, <a href="Francis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anjou">Francis, Duke of Alençon</a>, known as "Monsieur", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion. Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.

In 1576, in a move that endangered Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown. On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the <a href="Edict%20of%20Beaulieu">Edict of Beaulieu</a>. The treaty became known as the "Peace of Monsieur" because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown. Francis died of <a href="tuberculosis">consumption</a> in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred. Catherine wrote, the next day: "I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that he lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us." The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams. Under <a href="Salic%20law">Salic law</a>, by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown.

Catherine had at least taken the precaution of marrying Margaret, her youngest daughter, to Navarre. Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers. Catherine sent <a href="Pomponne%20de%20Belli%C3%A8vre">Pomponne de Bellièvre</a> to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again. She retreated to her property at <a href="Agen">Agen</a> and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough "to put food on her table". Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Usson">Château d'Usson</a>. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret. Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never saw her again.

Catherine was unable to control Henry in the way she had Francis and Charles. Her role in his government became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people. On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: "She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner." She was under no illusions, however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, "You are on the eve of a general revolt. Anyone who tells you differently is a liar."

Many leading Roman Catholics were appalled by Catherine's attempts to appease the Huguenots. After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion. The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the <a href="Catholic%20League%20%28French%29">Catholic League</a>. He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle <a href="Charles%2C%20Cardinal%20de%20Bourbon">Cardinal Charles de Bourbon</a> on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the <a href="treaty%20of%20Joinville">treaty of Joinville</a> with Spain, and prepared to make war on the "heretics". By 1585, Henry III had no choice but to go to war against the League. As Catherine put it, "peace is carried on a stick" ("bâton porte paix"). "Take care", she wrote to the king, "especially about your person. There is so much treachery about that I die of fear."

Henry was unable to fight the Catholics and the Protestants at once, both of whom had stronger armies than his own. In the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Nemours">Treaty of Nemours</a>, signed on 7 July 1585, he was forced to give in to all the League's demands, even that he pay its troops. He went into hiding to fast and pray, surrounded by a bodyguard known as "<a href="The%20forty-five%20guards">the Forty-five</a>", and left Catherine to sort out the mess. The monarchy had lost control of the country, and was in no position to assist England in the face of the coming Spanish attack. The Spanish ambassador told Philip II that the abscess was about to burst.

By 1587, the Catholic backlash against the Protestants had become a campaign across Europe. <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a>'s execution of <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, on 8 February 1587 outraged the Catholic world. <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> prepared for an invasion of England. The League took control of much of northern France to secure French ports for his <a href="Spanish%20Armada">armada</a>.

Henry hired Swiss troops to help him defend himself in Paris. The Parisians, however, claimed the right to defend the city themselves. On 12 May 1588, they set up barricades in the streets and refused to take orders from anyone except the Duke of Guise. When Catherine tried to go to Mass, she found her way barred, though she was allowed through the barricades. The chronicler L'Estoile reported that she cried all through her lunch that day. She wrote to Bellièvre, "Never have I seen myself in such trouble or with so little light by which to escape." As usual, Catherine advised the king, who had fled the city in the nick of time, to compromise and live to fight another day. On 15 June 1588, Henry duly signed the Act of Union, which gave in to all the League's latest demands.

On 8 September 1588 at Blois, where the court had assembled for a meeting of the Estates, Henry dismissed all his ministers without warning. Catherine, in bed with a lung infection, had been kept in the dark. The king's actions effectively ended her days of power.

At the meeting of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a solution to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Blois">Château de Blois</a>. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died at the foot of the king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, <a href="Louis%20II%2C%20Cardinal%20of%20Guise">Louis II, Cardinal of Guise</a>, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me." Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, "Oh, wretched man! What has he done? ... Pray for him ... I see him rushing towards his ruin." She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery." She left in tears.
On 5 January 1589, Catherine died at the age of sixty-nine, probably from <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a>. L'Estoile wrote: "those close to her believed that her life had been shortened by displeasure over her son's deed." He added that she had no sooner died than she was treated with as much consideration as a dead goat. Because Paris was held by enemies of the crown, Catherine had to be buried provisionally at Blois. Eight months later, <a href="Jacques%20Cl%C3%A9ment">Jacques Clément</a> stabbed Henry III to death. At the time, Henry was besieging Paris with the King of Navarre, who would <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France%27s%20succession">succeed him as Henry IV of France</a>. Henry III's assassination ended nearly three centuries of <a href="House%20of%20Valois">Valois</a> rule and brought the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon dynasty</a> into power. Years later, <a href="Diane%20de%20France">Diane</a>, daughter of Henry II and Philippa Duci, had Catherine's remains reinterred in the <a href="Basilique%20Saint-Denis">Saint-Denis basilica</a> in Paris. In 1793, a revolutionary mob tossed her bones into a mass grave with those of the other kings and queens.

Henry IV was later reported to have said of Catherine:

Catherine believed in the <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">humanist</a> ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms. She was inspired by the example of her father-in-law, <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">King Francis I of France</a>, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her <a href="Medici">Medici</a> ancestors. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late <a href="French%20Renaissance">French Renaissance</a> culture in all branches of the arts.

An <a href="inventory">inventory</a> drawn up at the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20de%20la%20Reine">Hôtel de la Reine</a> after Catherine's death shows her to have been a keen collector. Listed works of art included <a href="tapestry">tapestries</a>, hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, <a href="ebony">ebony</a> furniture inlaid with <a href="ivory">ivory</a>, sets of china, and <a href="Limoges">Limoges</a> pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by <a href="Jean%20Clouet">Jean Clouet</a> (1480–1541) and his son <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Clouet">François Clouet</a> (1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court. After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.

Beyond portraiture, little is known about the painting at Catherine de' Medici's court. In the last two decades of her life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities: <a href="Jean%20Cousin%20the%20Younger">Jean Cousin the Younger</a> (), few of whose works survive, and <a href="Antoine%20Caron">Antoine Caron</a> (1599), who became Catherine's official painter after working at <a href="Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a> under <a href="Francesco%20Primaticcio">Primaticcio</a>. Caron's vivid <a href="Mannerism">Mannerism</a>, with its love of ceremonial and its preoccupation with massacres, reflects the neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the <a href="French%20Wars%20of%20Religion">Wars of Religion</a>.

Many of Caron's paintings, such as those of the "Triumphs of the Seasons", are of <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> subjects that echo the <a href="Catherine%20de%27%20Medici%27s%20court%20festivals">festivities</a> for which Catherine's court was famous. His designs for the <a href="Valois%20Tapestries">Valois Tapestries</a> celebrate the "fêtes," picnics, and mock battles of the "magnificent" entertainments hosted by Catherine. They depict events held at Fontainebleau in 1564; at <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a> in 1565 for the summit meeting with the Spanish court; and at the <a href="Tuileries%20Palace">Tuileries</a> in 1573 for the visit of the Polish ambassadors who presented the Polish crown to Catherine's son <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20France">Henry of Anjou</a>. Biographer Leonie Frieda suggests that "Catherine, more than anyone, inaugurated the fantastic entertainments for which later French monarchs also became renowned".

The musical shows in particular allowed Catherine to express her creative gifts. They were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm and based on <a href="Mythology">mythological</a> themes. To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day. Historian Frances Yates has called her "a great creative artist in festivals." Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. A distinctive new art form, the "<a href="ballets%20de%20cour">ballet de cour</a>," emerged from these creative advances. Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the "<a href="Ballet%20Comique%20de%20la%20Reine">Ballet Comique de la Reine</a>" in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.

Catherine de' Medici's great love among the arts was architecture. "As the daughter of the Medici," suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, "she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died." After Henry II's death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband's memory and to enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects. These included work on châteaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, <a href="Saint-Maur-des-Foss%C3%A9s">Saint-Maur-des-Fossés</a>, and Chenonceau. Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the Hôtel de la Reine. She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.

Catherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings. Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after <a href="Artemisia%20II%20of%20Caria">Artemisia II of Caria</a>, who built the <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Maussollos">Mausoleum</a> at <a href="Halicarnassus">Halicarnassus</a> as a tomb for her dead husband. As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis. It was designed by <a href="Francesco%20Primaticcio">Francesco Primaticcio</a> (1504–1570), with sculpture by Germain Pilon (1528–1590). Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument "the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance." Catherine also commissioned <a href="Germain%20Pilon">Germain Pilon</a> to carve the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. A poem by Ronsard, engraved on its base, tells the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast.

Although Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts, most of her patronage left no permanent legacy. The end of the Valois dynasty so soon after her death brought a change in priorities.

The legend that de' Medici introduced a long list of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France for the first time is a myth routinely discredited by most food historians. Items whose introduction to France have been attributed to Catherine include the dinner <a href="fork">fork</a>, <a href="parsley">parsley</a>, the <a href="artichoke">artichoke</a>, <a href="lettuce">lettuce</a>, <a href="broccoli">broccoli</a>, the <a href="garden%20pea">garden pea</a>, <a href="pasta">pasta</a>, <a href="Parmesan">Parmesan</a>, as well as the <a href="turkey%20%28bird%29">turkey</a> and <a href="tomato">tomato</a> of the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>. She has also received credit for introducing <a href="sauces">sauces</a> and a variety of dishes such as duck à l’orange and <a href="deviled%20eggs">deviled eggs</a>.

<a href="Barbara%20Ketcham%20Wheaton">Barbara Ketcham Wheaton</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Mennell">Stephen Mennell</a> provided the definitive arguments against these claims. They point out that Catherine’s father-in-law, King Francis I, and the flower of the French aristocracy had dined at some of Italy’s most élite tables during the king’s Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during <a href="Charles%20VIII%20of%20France">King Charles VIII</a>’s invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de’ Medici’s father to her French-born mother; and that she had little influence at court until her husband’s death because he was so besotted by his mistress, <a href="Diane%20de%20Poitiers">Diane de Poitiers</a>. In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.

The earliest known reference to Catherine as the popularizer of Italian culinary innovation is the entry for "cuisine" in <a href="Diderot">Diderot</a> and <a href="d%E2%80%99Alembert">d’Alembert</a>’s "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A9die">Encyclopédie</a>" published in 1754, which describes <a href="haute%20cuisine">haute cuisine</a> as decadent and effeminate and explains that fussy sauces and fancy fricassees arrived in France via "that crowd of corrupt Italians who served at the court of Catherine de’ Medici."

Catherine de' Medici has been labelled a "sinister Queen… noted for her interest in the <a href="occult">occult</a> arts". To some, Catherine and Henry's inability to produce an heir for the first ten years of their marriage gave rise to suspicion of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>. Labouvie suggested that women's power was believed to be the ability to create and sustain life, whilst witches were believed to have the opposite power; that of attacking health, life and fertility. An infertile woman, and in particular an infertile queen, was therefore regarded as 'unnatural' and a small step from supernatural. <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> was treated with similar suspicion—she too entertained questionable characters (such as her advisor, <a href="John%20Dee">John Dee</a>), and produced no official heir. Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that either woman took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine's trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II</a>'s penile deformity.
Suspicion was fuelled to some degree by her entertainment of questionable characters at court—for example, the reputed seer <a href="Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a>, who was rumoured to have created a <a href="talisman">talisman</a> for Catherine, made from a mixture of metals, goat blood and human blood. Catherine also gave patronage to the Ruggeri brothers, who were renowned astrologers, but were also known for their involvement in <a href="necromancy">necromancy</a> and the black arts. <a href="Cosimo%20Ruggeri">Cosimo Ruggeri</a>, in particular, was believed to be Catherine's own "trusted necromancer, and specialist in the dark arts", although there is not a great deal of surviving documentation to tell of his life. Though some suggest that they were simply magicians, for many living in Italy at the time, the distinction between 'magician' and 'witch' was unclear. Entertaining individuals that appeared to subvert the natural religious order during the most intense period of witch hunting and a time of great religious conflict was therefore an easy way to arouse suspicion.

Catherine herself had been educated in <a href="astrology">astrology</a> and <a href="Astronomy%20and%20Astrophysics">astronomy</a>. Though these were largely considered respectable subjects, Catherine's biographer <a href="Leonie%20Frieda">Leonie Frieda</a> believes that it was her fascination with these subjects that has earned her the reputation history and her peers accorded her. Indeed, it has been suggested that Catherine educated her son, <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20France">Henry III</a>, in the dark arts, and that "the two devoted themselves to sorceries that were scandals of the age". As a result, some (more extreme) authors believe Catherine to be the creator of the <a href="Black%20Mass">Black Mass</a>, a Satanic inversion of the traditional Catholic <a href="Mass%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Mass</a>, although there is little to prove this aside from <a href="Jean%20Bodin">Jean Bodin</a>'s account in his book "De la démonomanie des sorciers". Nevertheless, Catherine was never formally accused or prosecuted despite the fact that her reign experienced the greatest number of prosecutions for Witchcraft in Italy. This lends some weight to the suggestion that people were labelled 'witches' simply because they did not act the way a woman should (humble and grateful), or simply to suit personal agendas. This may be particularly true for Catherine as an Italian woman ruling in France; several historians argue that she was disliked by her French subjects, who labelled her "the Italian woman". In any event, the rumours have made a mark on Catherine's reputation over time, and there are now many dramaticised works about her involvement in the occult.

Catherine de' Medici married Henry, Duke of Orléans, the future <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II of France</a>, in <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> on 28 October 1533. She gave birth to ten children, of whom four sons and three daughters survived into adulthood. Three of her sons became kings of France, while two of her daughters married kings and one married a duke. Catherine outlived all her children except Henry III, who died seven months after her, and Margaret, who inherited her robust health.

Ezra Pound

Ezra Weston Loomis Pound (30 October 1885 – 1 November 1972) was an <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a> American poet and critic, and a major figure in the early <a href="modernist%20poetry">modernist poetry</a> movement. His contribution to poetry began with his development of <a href="Imagism">Imagism</a>, a movement derived from classical <a href="Chinese%20poetry">Chinese</a> and <a href="Japanese%20poetry">Japanese</a> poetry, stressing clarity, precision and economy of language. His works include "<a href="Ripostes">Ripostes</a>" (1912), "<a href="Hugh%20Selwyn%20Mauberley">Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</a>" (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, "<a href="The%20Cantos">The Cantos</a>" (1917–1969).

Pound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>, <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>. Angered by the carnage of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Pound lost faith in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and blamed the war on <a href="usury">usury</a> and international capitalism. He moved to Italy in 1924 and throughout the 1930s and 1940s embraced <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s <a href="Italian%20Fascism">fascism</a>, expressed support for <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, and wrote for publications owned by the British fascist <a href="Sir%20Oswald%20Mosley">Sir Oswald Mosley</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> and <a href="Jews">Jews</a>, as a result of which he was arrested in 1945 by American forces in Italy on charges of <a href="treason">treason</a>. He spent months in detention in a U.S. military camp in <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>, including three weeks in a outdoor steel cage, which he said triggered a mental breakdown: "when the raft broke and the waters went over me". The following year he was deemed unfit to stand trial, and incarcerated in <a href="St.%20Elizabeths%20Hospital">St. Elizabeths</a> psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over 12 years.

Pound began work on sections of "The Cantos" while in custody in Italy. These parts were published as "<a href="The%20Pisan%20Cantos">The Pisan Cantos</a>" (1948), for which he was awarded the <a href="Bollingen%20Prize">Bollingen Prize</a> in 1949 by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>, leading to enormous controversy. Largely due to a campaign by his fellow writers, he was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958 and returned to live in Italy until his death. His political views ensure that his work remains as controversial now as it was during his lifetime; in 1933, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine called him "a cat that walks by himself, tenaciously unhousebroken and very unsafe for children". Hemingway wrote: "The best of Pound's writing—and it is in the "Cantos"—will last as long as there is any literature."

Pound was born in a small, two-story house in <a href="Hailey%2C%20Idaho">Hailey</a>, <a href="Idaho%20Territory">Idaho Territory</a>, the only child of Homer Loomis Pound (1858–1942) and Isabel Weston (1860–1948). His father had worked in Hailey since 1883 as registrar of the <a href="General%20Land%20Office">General Land Office</a>.

Both parents' ancestors had emigrated from England in the 17th century. On his mother's side, Pound was descended from <a href="William%20Wadsworth%20%28patriarch%29">William Wadsworth</a> (1594–1675), a <a href="Puritanism">Puritan</a> who emigrated to Boston on the "<a href="English%20ship%20Lion%20%281557%29">Lion</a>" in 1632. The Wadsworths married into the Westons of New York. Harding Weston and Mary Parker were the parents of Isabel Weston, Ezra's mother. Harding apparently spent most of his life without work, with his brother, Ezra Weston, and his brother's wife, Frances, looking after Mary and Isabel's needs.

On his father's side, the immigrant ancestor was John Pound, a <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>, who arrived from England around 1650. Ezra's grandfather, <a href="Thaddeus%20C.%20Pound">Thaddeus Coleman Pound</a> (1832–1914), was a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> Congressman from northwest <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> who had made and lost a fortune in the lumber business. Thaddeus's son Homer, Pound's father, worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business until Thaddeus secured him the appointment as registrar of the Hailey land office. Homer and Isabel married the following year and Homer built a <a href="Homer%20Pound%20House">house in Hailey</a>. Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887, when he was 18 months old. Homer followed them, and in 1889 he found a job as an <a href="Metallurgical%20assay">assayer</a> at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>. The family moved to <a href="Jenkintown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Jenkintown, Pennsylvania</a>, and in 1893 bought a six-bedroom house in <a href="Wyncote%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wyncote</a>.

Pound's education began in a series of <a href="dame%20school">dame school</a>s, some of them run by Quakers: Miss Elliott's school in Jenkintown in 1892, the Heathcock family's Chelten Hills School in Wyncote in 1893, and the Florence Ridpath school from 1894, also in Wyncote. His first publication was on 7 November 1896 in the "Jenkintown Times-Chronicle" ("by E. L. Pound, Wyncote, aged 11 years"), a <a href="Limerick%20%28poetry%29">limerick</a> about <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, who had just lost the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">1896 presidential election</a>: "There was a young man from the West, / He did what he could for what he thought best; / But election came round, / He found himself drowned, / And the papers will tell you the rest."

Between 1897 and 1900 Pound attended Cheltenham Military Academy, sometimes as a boarder, where he specialized in Latin. The boys wore <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>-style uniforms and besides Latin were taught English, history, arithmetic, marksmanship, military drilling and the importance of submitting to authority. Pound made his first trip overseas in mid-1898 when he was 13, a three-month tour of Europe with his mother and Frances Weston (Aunt Frank), who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. After the academy he may have attended Cheltenham Township High School for one year, and in 1901, aged 15, he was admitted to the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>'s College of Liberal Arts.
Pound met Hilda Doolittle (later known as the poet <a href="H.D.">H.D.</a>) at Pennsylvania in 1901, and she became his first serious romance. In 1911 she followed Pound to London and became involved in developing the Imagism movement. Between 1905 and 1907 Pound wrote a number of poems for her, 25 of which he hand-bound and called "Hilda's Book", and in 1908 he asked her father, the astronomy professor Charles Doolittle, for permission to marry her, but Doolittle dismissed Pound as a nomad. Pound was seeing two other women at the same time—Viola Baxter and Mary Moore—later dedicating a book of poetry, "Personae" (1909), to the latter. He asked Moore to marry him too, but she turned him down.

His parents and Frances Weston took Pound on another three-month European tour in 1902, after which he transferred, in 1903, to <a href="Hamilton%20College%20%28New%20York%29">Hamilton College</a> in Clinton, New York, possibly because of poor grades. Signed up for the Latin–Scientific course, he studied the <a href="Proven%C3%A7al%20dialect">Provençal dialect</a> with William Pierce Shephard and <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> with Joseph D. Ibbotson; with Shephard he read <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a> and from this began the idea for a long poem in three parts—of emotion, instruction and contemplation—planting the seeds for "The Cantos". He wrote in 1913, in "How I Began":

I resolved that at thirty I would know more about poetry than any man living ... that I would know what was accounted poetry everywhere, what part of poetry was 'indestructible', what part could "not be lost" by translation and—scarcely less important—what effects were obtainable in "one" language only and were utterly incapable of being translated.In this search I learned more or less of nine foreign languages, I read Oriental stuff in translations, I fought every University regulation and every professor who tried to make me learn anything except this, or who bothered me with "requirements for degrees".

Pound graduated from Hamilton College with a BPhil in 1905, then studied <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a> under Hugo A. Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), where he obtained an MA in early 1906 and registered to write a PhD thesis on the jesters in <a href="Lope%20de%20Vega">Lope de Vega</a>'s plays. A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees and gave him a travel grant of $500, which he used to return to Europe. Pound spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace. There, on 31 May 1906, he happened to be standing outside when the attempted assassination of <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">King Alfonso</a> took place, and Pound subsequently left the country for fear he would be identified with the anarchists. After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris, attending lectures at the <a href="Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a>, followed by a week in London.

In July he returned to the United States, where in September his first essay, "Raphaelite Latin", was published in "Book News Monthly". He took courses in the English department at Penn in 1907, where he fell out with several lecturers; during lectures on Shakespeare by <a href="Felix%20Emanuel%20Schelling">Felix Schelling</a>, the department head, he would wind an enormous tin watch very slowly while Schelling spoke. His fellowship was not renewed. Schelling told him that he was wasting everyone's time, and Pound left without finishing his doctorate.

From late 1907 Pound taught Romance languages at <a href="Wabash%20College">Wabash College</a> in <a href="Crawfordsville%2C%20Indiana">Crawfordsville, Indiana</a>, a conservative town that he called "the <a href="Inferno%20%28Dante%29%23Sixth%20Circle%20%28Heresy%29">sixth circle of hell</a>". The equally conservative college dismissed him after he deliberately provoked the college authorities. Smoking was forbidden, but he would smoke <a href="cigarillo">cigarillo</a>s in his office down the corridor from the president's. He annoyed his landlords by entertaining friends, including women, and was forced out of one house after "[t]wo stewdents found me sharing my meagre repast with the lady–gent impersonator in my privut apartments", he told a friend.

He was asked to leave the college in 1908 after offering a stranded chorus girl tea and his bed for the night when she was caught in a snowstorm. When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, his insistence that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief. Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.

Pound arrived in <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 23 March 1908, where for a few weeks he earned $15 a day working as a guide to American tourists. By the end of April he was in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, living over a bakery near the San Vio bridge. In July he self-published his first book of poetry, "<a href="A%20Lume%20Spento">A Lume Spento</a>" ("With Tapers Quenched"). The "London Evening Standard" called it "wild and haunting stuff, absolutely poetic, original, imaginative, passionate, and spiritual". The title was from the third canto of <a href="Dante">Dante</a>'s "<a href="Purgatorio">Purgatorio</a>", which alluded to the death of <a href="Manfred%2C%20King%20of%20Sicily">Manfred, King of Sicily</a>. The book was dedicated to his friend, the Philadelphia artist <a href="William%20Brooke%20Smith">William Brooke Smith</a>, who had recently died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>.
In August Pound moved to London, where he lived almost continuously for the next 12 years; he told his university friend <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a>: "London, deah old Lundon, is the place for poesy." English poets such as <a href="Maurice%20Hewlett">Maurice Hewlett</a>, <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred Lord Tennyson</a> had made a particular kind of <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> verse—stirring, pompous and propagandistic—popular with the public. According to modernist scholar James Knapp, Pound rejected the idea of poetry as "versified moral essay"; he wanted to focus on the individual experience, the concrete rather than the abstract.

Arriving in the city with just ₤3, he moved into lodgings at 48 Langham Street, near <a href="Great%20Titchfield%20Street">Great Titchfield Street</a>, a penny bus ride from the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. The house sat across an alley from the Yorkshire Grey pub, which made an appearance in the "Pisan Cantos", "concerning the landlady's "doings" / with a lodger unnamed / az waz near Gt Titchfield St. next door to the pub".

Pound persuaded the bookseller <a href="Charles%20Elkin%20Mathews">Elkin Mathews</a> to display "A Lume Spento", and by October 1908 he was being discussed by the literati. In December he published a second collection, "A Quinzaine for This Yule", and after the death of a lecturer at the <a href="University%20of%20Westminster">Regent Street Polytechnic</a> he managed to acquire a position lecturing in the evenings, from January to February 1909, on "The Development of Literature in Southern Europe". He would spend his mornings in the <a href="British%20Museum%20Reading%20Room">British Museum Reading Room</a>, then lunch at the Vienna Café on <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a>. <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a> wrote:

Ezra ... would approach with the step of a dancer, making passes with a cane at an imaginary opponent. He would wear trousers made of green billiard cloth, a pink coat, a blue shirt, a tie hand-painted by a Japanese friend, an immense sombrero, a flaming beard cut to a point, and a single, large blue earring.

Hemingway described Pound as "tall ... [with] a patchy red beard, fine eyes, strange haircuts and ... very shy": "But he has the temperament of a "<a href="Spanish%20Fighting%20Bull">toro di lidia</a>" from the breeding establishments of <a href="Miura%20bull">Don Eduardo Miura</a>. No one ever presents a cape, or shakes a <a href="muleta">muleta</a> at him without getting a charge."

At a literary <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a> in January 1909, Pound met the novelist <a href="Olivia%20Shakespear">Olivia Shakespear</a> and her daughter <a href="Dorothy%20Shakespear">Dorothy</a>, who became his wife in 1914. Through Olivia Shakespear he was introduced to her former lover <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>, in Pound's view the greatest living poet. Pound had sent Yeats a copy of "A Lume Spento" the previous year, before he left for Venice, and Yeats had apparently found it charming. The men became close friends, although Yeats was older by 20 years.
Pound was also introduced to sculptor <a href="Henri%20Gaudier-Brzeska">Henri Gaudier-Brzeska</a>, painter <a href="Wyndham%20Lewis">Wyndham Lewis</a> and to the cream of London's literary circle, including the poet <a href="T.%20E.%20Hulme">T. E. Hulme</a>. The American heiress Margaret Lanier Cravens (1881–1912) became a patron; after knowing him a short time she offered a large annual sum to allow him to focus on his work. Cravens killed herself in 1912, after the pianist <a href="Walter%20Morse%20Rummel">Walter Rummel</a>, long the object of her affection, married someone else. She may also have been discouraged by Pound's engagement to Dorothy.

In June 1909 the "Personae" collection became the first of Pound's works to have any commercial success. It was favorably reviewed; one review said it was "full of human passion and natural magic". <a href="Rupert%20Brooke">Rupert Brooke</a> was unimpressed, complaining that Pound had fallen under the influence of <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>, writing in "unmetrical sprawling lengths". In September a further 27 poems appeared as "Exultations". Around the same time Pound moved into new rooms at Church Walk, off <a href="Kensington%20High%20Street">Kensington High Street</a>, where he lived most of the time until 1914.

In June 1910 Pound returned to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided with the publication of his first book of literary criticism", <a href="The%20Spirit%20of%20Romance">The Spirit of Romance</a>", based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays on the United States were written during this period, compiled as "Patria Mia" and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there. He found the <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Library">New York Public Library</a>, then being built, especially offensive and, according to <a href="Paul%20L.%20Montgomery">Paul L. Montgomery</a>, visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.

Pound persuaded his parents to finance his passage back to Europe. It was nearly 30 years before he visited the United States again. On 22 February 1911 he sailed from New York on the <a href="RMS%20Mauretania%20%281906%29">R.M.S. "Mauretania"</a>, arriving in Southampton six days later. After a few days in London he went to Paris, where he worked on a new collection of poetry, "Canzoni" (1911), panned by the "Westminster Gazette" as a "medley of pretension". When he returned to London in August 1911, <a href="Alfred%20Richard%20Orage">A. R. Orage</a>, editor of the socialist journal "<a href="The%20New%20Age">The New Age</a>," hired him to write a weekly column, giving him a steady income.

Hilda Doolittle arrived in London from Philadelphia in May 1911 with the poet Frances Gregg and Gregg's mother; when they returned in September, Doolittle decided to stay on. Pound introduced her to his friends, including the poet <a href="Richard%20Aldington">Richard Aldington</a>, whom she would marry in 1913. Before that the three of them lived in Church Walk, Kensington—Pound at no. 10, Doolittle at no. 6, and Aldington at no. 8—and worked daily in the British Museum Reading Room.

At the museum Pound met regularly with the curator and poet <a href="Laurence%20Binyon">Laurence Binyon</a>, who introduced him to the East Asian artistic and literary concepts that inspired the imagery and technique of his later poetry. The museum's visitors' books show that Pound was often found during 1912 and 1913 in the Print Room examining Japanese <a href="ukiyo-e">ukiyo-e</a>, some inscribed with <a href="Waka%20%28poetry%29">Japanese "waka" verse</a>, a genre of poetry whose economy and strict conventions likely contributed to Imagist techniques of composition. He was working at the time on the poems that became "Ripostes" (1912), trying to move away from his earlier work; he wrote that the "stilted language" of "Canzoni" had reduced Ford Madox Ford to rolling on the floor with laughter. He realized with his translation work that the problem lay not in his knowledge of the other languages, but in his use of English:

What obfuscated me was not the Italian but the crust of dead English, the sediment present in my own available vocabulary ... You can't go round this sort of thing. It takes six or eight years to get educated in one's art, and another ten to get rid of that education.

Neither can anyone learn English, one can only learn a series of Englishes. Rossetti made his own language. I hadn't in 1910 made a language, I don't mean a language to use, but even a language to think in.

While living at Church Walk in 1912, Pound, Aldington and Doolittle started working on ideas about language. While in the British Museum tearoom one afternoon, they decided to begin a 'movement' in poetry, called Imagism. "Imagisme", Pound would write in "Riposte", is "concerned solely with "language" and "presentation"". The aim was clarity: a fight against abstraction, romanticism, rhetoric, inversion of word order, and over-use of adjectives. They agreed on three principles:

1. Direct treatment of the "thing" whether subjective or objective.
2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.
3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome.

Superfluous words, particularly adjectives, should be avoided, as well as expressions like "dim lands of peace", which Pound thought dulled the image by mixing the abstract with the concrete. He wrote that the natural object was always the "adequate symbol". Poets should "go in fear of abstractions", and should not re-tell in mediocre verse what has already been told in good prose.

A typical example is Pound's "<a href="In%20a%20Station%20of%20the%20Metro">In a Station of the Metro</a>" (1913), inspired by an experience on the <a href="Paris%20M%C3%A9tro">Paris Underground</a>, about which he wrote, "I got out of a train at, I think, <a href="Concorde%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29">La Concorde</a>, and in the jostle I saw a beautiful face, and then, turning suddenly, another and another, and then a beautiful child's face, and then another beautiful face. All that day I tried to find words for what this made me feel." He worked on the poem for a year, reducing it to its essence in the style of a Japanese <a href="haiku">haiku</a>.

Like other modernist artists of the period, Pound was inspired by Japanese art, but the aim was to re-make—or as Pound said, "make it new"—and blend cultural styles, instead of copying directly or slavishly. He may have been inspired by a <a href="Suzuki%20Harunobu">Suzuki Harunobu</a> print he almost certainly saw in the British Library (Richard Aldington mentions the specific prints he matched to verse), and probably attempted to write haiku-like verse during this period.

"<a href="Ripostes">Ripostes</a>", published in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. <a href="Michael%20J.%20Alexander">Michael Alexander</a> describes the poems as showing a greater concentration of meaning and economy of rhythm than his earlier work. It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward <a href="Imagism">Imagism</a>; his first use of the word "Imagiste" appears in his prefatory note to the volume. The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century <a href="Old%20English%20literature">Old English</a> poem "<a href="The%20Seafarer%20%28poem%29">The Seafarer</a>", although not a literal translation. It upset scholars, as would Pound's other translations from Latin, Italian, French and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context. Alexander writes that in some circles, Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to "The Seafarer" was a rehearsal for the negative response to "Homage to Sextus Propertius" in 1919. His translation from the Italian of "Sonnets and ballate of <a href="Guido%20Cavalcanti">Guido Cavalcanti</a>" was also published in 1912.

Pound was fascinated by the translations of <a href="Japanese%20poetry">Japanese poetry</a> and <a href="Noh">Noh</a> plays which he discovered in the papers of <a href="Ernest%20Fenollosa">Ernest Fenollosa</a>, an American professor who had taught in Japan. Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, Mary McNeil Fenollosa, decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work; she was looking for someone who cared about poetry rather than philology. Pound edited and published Fenellosa's "The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry" in 1918.

The title page of the collection "<a href="Cathay%20%28poetry%20collection%29">Cathay</a>" (1915), refers to the poet "Rihaku", the pronunciation in Japanese of the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> Chinese poet, <a href="Li%20Bai">Li Bai</a>, whose poems were much beloved in China and Japan for their technical mastery and much translated in the West because of their seeming simplicity. Alexander thinks this is the most attractive of Pound's work. Chinese critic <a href="Wai-lim%20Yip">Wai-lim Yip</a> writes of it: "One can easily excommunicate Pound from the Forbidden City of Chinese studies, but it seems clear that in his dealings with "Cathay," even when he is given only the barest details, he is able to get into the central concerns of the original author by what we may perhaps call a kind of clairvoyance."

Pound could not understand Chinese himself, yet some critics see his translations of Chinese poetry as among the best (others complain of their mistakes). "Cathay" was the first of many translations Pound would make from the Chinese. Pound often followed the translations made by <a href="Herbert%20Giles">Herbert Giles</a> in his "<a href="History%20of%20Chinese%20Literature">History of Chinese Literature</a> " and used Fenollosa's work as a starting point for what he called the <a href="ideogrammic%20method">ideogrammic method</a>, which proceeded on Fenollosa's entirely mistaken but fruitful idea that each character represented an image or pictograph, based on sight rather than sound. <a href="Robert%20Graves">Robert Graves</a> recalled "I once asked Arthur Waley how much Chinese Pound knew; Waley shook his head despondently." Steven Yao, scholar of American and Asian literature, sees "Cathay" as a "major feat"; a work where Pound shows that translation is possible without a thorough knowledge of the source language. Yao does not view Pound's lack of Chinese as an obstacle, and states that the poet's trawl through centuries of scholarly interpretations resulted in a genuine understanding of the original poem.

In August 1912 <a href="Harriet%20Monroe">Harriet Monroe</a> hired Pound as a regular contributor to "<a href="Poetry%20%28magazine%29">Poetry</a>". He submitted his own poems, as well as poems by <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a>, <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>, Yeats, H.D. and Aldington, and collected material for a 64-page anthology, "Des Imagistes" (1914). The Imagist movement began to attract attention from critics. In November 1913 Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, rented Stone Cottage in <a href="Coleman%27s%20Hatch">Coleman's Hatch</a>, Sussex, and invited Pound to accompany him as his secretary. They stayed there for 10 weeks, reading and writing, walking in the woods and fencing. It was the first of three winters they spent together at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Pound married on 20 April 1914.

The marriage had proceeded despite opposition from her parents, who worried about Pound's meager income, earned from contributions to literary magazines and probably less than £300 a year. Dorothy's annual income was £50, aided by £150 from her family. Her parents eventually consented, perhaps out of fear that she was getting older with no other suitor in sight. Pound's concession to marry in church helped convince them. Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, with the newly wed Hilda (H.D.) and Richard Aldington living next door.

Pound wrote for Wyndham Lewis' literary magazine "<a href="Blast%20%28magazine%29">Blast</a>," although only two issues were published. An advertisement in "The Egoist" promised it would cover "Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art". Pound took the opportunity to extend the definition of Imagisme to art, naming it <a href="Vorticism">Vorticism</a>: "The image is a radiant node or cluster; it is ... a "vortex", from which, and through which, and into which, ideas are constantly rushing." Reacting to the magazine, the poet <a href="Lascelles%20Abercrombie">Lascelles Abercrombie</a> called for the rejection of Imagism and a return to the traditionalism of <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>; Pound challenged him to a duel on the basis that "Stupidity carried beyond a certain point becomes a public menace". Abercrombie suggested their choice of weapon be unsold copies of their own books. The publication of "Blast" was celebrated at a dinner attended by New England poet <a href="Amy%20Lowell">Amy Lowell</a>, then in London to meet the Imagists. But Hilda and Richard were already moving away from Pound's understanding of the movement, as he aligned more with Wyndham Lewis's ideas. When Lowell agreed to finance an anthology of Imagist poets, Pound's work was not included. Upset at Lowell, he began to call "Imagisme" "Amygism", and in July 1914 he declared the movement dead and asked that the group not continue to call themselves Imagists. They dissented, not believing that the movement was Pound's invention, and Lowell eventually Anglicized the term.

Between 1914 and 1916 Pound assisted in the serialisation of James Joyce's "<a href="A%20Portrait%20of%20the%20Artist%20as%20a%20Young%20Man">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a>" in "<a href="The%20Egoist%20%28periodical%29">The Egoist</a>", then helped to have it published in book form. In 1915 he persuaded "Poetry" to publish <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s "<a href="The%20Love%20Song%20of%20J.%20Alfred%20Prufrock">The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</a>". Eliot had sent "Prufrock" to almost every editor in England, but was rejected. He eventually sent it to Pound, who instantly saw it as a work of genius and submitted it to "Poetry". "[Eliot] has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN", Pound wrote to Monroe in October 1914. "The rest of the promising young have done one or the other but never both. Most of the swine have done neither."

After the publication in 1915 of "Cathay", Pound mentioned he was working on a long poem, casting about for the correct form. He told a friend in August: "It is a huge, I was going to say, gamble, but shan't", and in September described it as a "cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore". About a year later, in January 1917, he had the first three trial cantos, distilled to one, published as Canto I in "Poetry". He was now a regular contributor to three literary magazines. From 1917 he wrote music reviews for "The New Age" under the pen name William Atheling, and weekly pieces for "The Egoist" and "<a href="The%20Little%20Review">The Little Review</a>"; many of the latter were directed against provincialism and ignorance. The volume of writing exhausted him. He feared he was wasting his time writing outside poetry, exclaiming that he ""must" stop writing so much prose".
Pound was deeply affected by the war. He was devastated when Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, from whom he had commissioned a sculpture of himself two years earlier, was killed in the trenches in 1915. He published "Gaudier-Brzeska: A Memoir" the following year, in reaction to what he saw as an unnecessary loss. In the autumn of 1917 his depression worsened. He blamed American provincialism for the seizure of the October issue of "The Little Review". The <a href="New%20York%20Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">New York Society for the Suppression of Vice</a> applied the <a href="Comstock%20Laws">Comstock Laws</a> against an article Lewis wrote, describing it as lewd and indecent. Around the same time, Hulme was killed by shell-fire in Flanders, and Yeats married <a href="Georgie%20Hyde-Lees">Georgie Hyde-Lees</a>. In 1918, after a bout of illness which was presumably the <a href="Spanish%20influenza">Spanish influenza</a>, Pound decided to stop writing for "The Little Review", mostly because of the volume of work. He asked the publisher for a raise to hire 23-year-old <a href="Iseult%20Gonne">Iseult Gonne</a> as a typist, causing rumors that Pound was having an affair with her, but he was turned down.

In 1919 he published a collection of his essays for "The Little Review" as "Instigations", and in the March 1919 issue "Poetry," he published "Poems from the Propertius Series", which appeared to be a translation of the Latin Poet <a href="Sextus%20Propertius">Sextus Propertius</a>. When he included this in his next poetry collection in 1921, he had renamed it "Homage to Sextus Propertius" in response to criticism of his translation skills. "Propertius" is not a strict translation; biographer David Moody describes it as "the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence". Harriet Monroe, editor of "Poetry", published a letter from a professor of Latin, <a href="William%20Gardner%20Hale">W. G. Hale</a>, saying that Pound was "incredibly ignorant" of the language, and alluded to "about three-score errors" in "Homage". Monroe did not publish Pound's response, which began "Cat-piss and porcupines!!" and continued, "The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than <a href="Edward%20FitzGerald%20%28poet%29">Fitzgerald</a>'s <a href="Rubaiyat%20of%20Omar%20Khayyam">Omar</a> is a translation". Moore interpreted Pound's silence after that as his resignation as foreign editor.

His poem "<a href="Hugh%20Selwyn%20Mauberley">Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</a>" consists of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless. Published in June 1920, it marked his farewell to London. He was disgusted by the massive loss of life during the war and was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word "usury" appears in his work for the first time. The critic <a href="F.%20R.%20Leavis">F. R. Leavis</a> saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.

The war had shattered Pound's belief in modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own future as a poet. He had only the "New Age" to write for; his relationship with "Poetry" was finished, "The Egoist" was quickly running out of money because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's "Ulysses", and the funds for "The Little Review" had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over and resolved to move to Paris.

"The New Age" published Pound's "Axiomata" in January 1921, a statement of his views on consciousness and the universe: "the intimate essence of the universe is "not" of the same nature as our own consciousness." Orage wrote in the same issue:

Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country. ... [He] has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon more than one of the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture, and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus ... With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends ... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual ... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.

The Pounds settled in Paris in January 1921, and several months later moved into an inexpensive apartment at 70 "bis" . Pound became friendly with <a href="Marcel%20Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>, <a href="Tristan%20Tzara">Tristan Tzara</a>, <a href="Fernand%20L%C3%A9ger">Fernand Léger</a> and others of the <a href="Dada">Dada</a> and <a href="Surrealism">Surrealist</a> movements, as well as <a href="Basil%20Bunting">Basil Bunting</a>, Ernest Hemingway and his wife, <a href="Hadley%20Richardson">Hadley Richardson</a>. He spent most of his time building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for the bookstore <a href="Shakespeare%20and%20Company%20%28bookstore%29">Shakespeare and Company</a>, and in 1921 the volume "Poems 1918–1921" was published. In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of "<a href="The%20Waste%20Land">The Waste Land</a>", then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who <a href="Blue%20pencil%20%28editing%29">blue-inked</a> the manuscript with comments like "make up yr. mind ..." and "georgian". Eliot wrote: "I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius."

In 1924 Pound secured funding for Ford Madox Ford's "<a href="The%20Transatlantic%20Review">The Transatlantic Review</a>" from American attorney <a href="John%20Quinn%20%28collector%29">John Quinn</a>. The "Review" published works by Pound, Hemingway and <a href="Gertrude%20Stein">Gertrude Stein</a>, as well as extracts from Joyce's "<a href="Finnegans%20Wake">Finnegans Wake</a>", before the money ran out in 1925. It also published several Pound music reviews, later collected into "Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony".

Hemingway asked Pound to blue-ink his short stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong relationship of mutual respect and friendship, living on the same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. "They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work", writes Hemingway biographer <a href="Jeffrey%20Meyers">Jeffrey Meyers</a>, with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told <a href="Sherwood%20Anderson">Sherwood Anderson</a>, "[Ezra] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish".

Pound was 36 when he met the 26-year-old American violinist <a href="Olga%20Rudge">Olga Rudge</a> in Paris in late 1922, beginning a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer <a href="John%20Tytell">John Tytell</a> believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had turned a blind eye to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress <a href="Natalie%20Barney">Natalie Barney</a> in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the <a href="Boulevard%20Saint-Germain">Boulevard Saint-Germain</a>. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy <a href="Youngstown%2C%20Ohio">Youngstown, Ohio</a>, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the <a href="Rive%20Droite">Right Bank</a>, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the <a href="Rive%20Gauche">Left Bank</a>. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with <a href="George%20Antheil">George Antheil</a> to apply the concept of <a href="Vorticism">Vorticism</a> to music, and managed to write two operas, including "Le Testament de Villon". He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.

The Pounds were unhappy in Paris; Dorothy complained about the winters and Ezra's health was poor. At one dinner, a guest randomly tried to stab him; to Pound this underlined that their time in France was over. Hemingway saw how Pound "indulged in a small nervous breakdown", leading to two days in an American hospital. They decided to move to a quieter place, choosing <a href="Rapallo">Rapallo</a>, Italy, a town of 15,000. "Italy is my place for starting things", he told a friend. During this period they lived on Dorothy's income, supplemented by dividends from stock she had invested in.

Olga Rudge, pregnant with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had little interest in raising a child, but may have felt that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, <a href="Mary%20de%20Rachewiltz">Mary</a>. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.

When Pound told Dorothy about the birth, she separated from him for much of that year and the next. In December 1925, she left on an extended trip to Egypt. She was pregnant by her return in March. In June she and Pound left Rapallo for Paris for the premiere of "<a href="Le%20Testament%20de%20Villon">Le Testament de Villon</a>", without mentioning the pregnancy to his friends or parents. In September, Hemingway drove Dorothy to the <a href="American%20Hospital%20of%20Paris">American Hospital of Paris</a> for the birth of a son, <a href="Omar%20Pound">Omar Pound</a>. In a letter to his parents in October, Pound wrote, "next generation (male) arrived. Both D & it appear to be doing well". Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had bought her a house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had a single pair of shoes, and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother.

In 1925 the literary magazine "This Quarter" dedicated its first issue to Pound, including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce. Pound published "Cantos XVII–XIX" in the winter editions. In March 1927 he launched his own literary magazine, "The Exile", but only four issues were published. It did well in the first year, with contributions from Hemingway, <a href="E.%20E.%20Cummings">E. E. Cummings</a>, Basil Bunting, Yeats, William Carlos Williams and <a href="Robert%20McAlmon">Robert McAlmon</a>; some of the poorest work in the magazine were Pound's rambling editorials on <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and or in praise of Lenin, according to biographer J. J. Wilhelm. He continued to work on Fenollosa's manuscripts, and in 1928 won "<a href="The%20Dial">The Dial</a>"'s poetry award for his translation of the <a href="Confucian%20classic">Confucian classic</a> "<a href="Great%20Learning">Great Learning</a>" ("Dà Xué", transliterated as "Ta Hio"). That year his parents Homer and Isabel visited him in Rapallo, seeing him for the first time since 1914. By then Homer had retired, so they decided to move to Rapallo themselves. They took a small house, Villa Raggio, on a hill above the town.

Pound began work on "<a href="The%20Cantos">The Cantos</a>" in earnest after relocating to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to "paradiso terrestre". Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922. The first three appear in "Poetry" in June–August 1917. The "Malatesta Cantos" appeared in "<a href="The%20Criterion">The Criterion</a>" in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in "The Transatlantic Review" in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of "A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book".

Pound came to believe that the cause of World War I was finance capitalism, which he called "<a href="usury">usury</a>", that the solution lay in <a href="C.%20H.%20Douglas">C. H. Douglas</a>'s idea of <a href="social%20credit">social credit</a>, and that <a href="fascism">fascism</a> was the vehicle for reform. He had met Douglas in the "New Age" offices and had been impressed by his ideas. He gave a series of lectures on economics, and made contact with politicians in the United States to discuss education, interstate commerce and international affairs. Although Hemingway advised against it, on 30 January 1933 Pound met <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>. Olga Rudge played for Mussolini and told him about Pound, who had earlier sent him a copy of "Cantos XXX". During the meeting Pound tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas, but Mussolini brushed them aside, though he called the "Cantos" ""divertente"" (entertaining). The meeting was recorded in "Canto XLI": "'Ma questo' / said the boss, 'è divertente.'" Pound said he had "never met anyone who seemed to "get" my ideas so quickly as the boss".

When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to organize the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar for the first time in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C., where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.

In June 1939 he received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College, and a week later returned to Italy from the States and began writing <a href="antisemitism">antisemitic</a> material for Italian newspapers. He wrote to <a href="James%20Laughlin">James Laughlin</a> that Roosevelt represented Jewry, and signed the letter with "<a href="Heil%20Hitler">Heil Hitler</a>". He started writing for "Action", a newspaper owned by the British fascist <a href="Sir%20Oswald%20Mosley">Sir Oswald Mosley</a>, arguing that the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> was the "natural civilizer of Russia". After war broke out in September that year, he began a furious letter-writing campaign to the politicians he had petitioned six months earlier, arguing that the war was the result of an international banking conspiracy and that the United States should keep out of it.

Tytell writes that, by the 1940s, no American or English poet had been so active politically since <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>. Pound wrote over a thousand letters a year during the 1930s and presented his ideas in hundreds of articles, as well as in "The Cantos". His greatest fear was an economic structure dependent on the armaments industry, where the profit motive would govern war and peace. He read <a href="George%20Santayana">George Santayana</a> and "The Law of Civilization and Decay" by <a href="Brooks%20Adams">Brooks Adams</a>, finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant. He wrote in "<a href="The%20Japan%20Times">The Japan Times</a>" that "Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a 'country run by Jews,'" and told Sir Oswald Mosley's newspaper that the English were a slave race governed since Waterloo by the <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschilds</a>.

Pound broadcast over Rome Radio, although the Italian government was at first reluctant, concerned that he might be a double agent. He told a friend: "It took me, I think it was, "two" years, insistence and wrangling etc., to "get hold" of their microphone." He recorded over a hundred broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940 he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a "rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar", that throughout the "disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage". The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped—his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo—and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.

The broadcasts were monitored by the United States <a href="Foreign%20Broadcast%20Monitoring%20Service">Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service</a> listening station at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, and in July 1943 Pound was indicted "in absentia" for treason. He answered the charge by writing a letter to Attorney General <a href="Francis%20Biddle">Francis Biddle</a>, which Tytell describes as "long, reasoned, and temperate", defending his right to free speech. He continued to broadcast and write under pseudonyms until April 1945, shortly before his arrest.

The war years threw Pound's domestic arrangements into disarray. Olga lost possession of her house in Venice and took a small house with Mary above Rapallo at Sant' Ambrogio. In 1943 Pound and Dorothy were evicted from their apartment in Rapallo. His mother's apartment was too small, and the couple moved in with Olga. Mary, then 19 and finished with convent school, was quickly sent back to Gais in Switzerland, leaving Pound, as she would later write, "pent up with two women who loved him, whom he loved, and who coldly hated each other."

Pound was in Rome early in September when <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">Italy surrendered</a>. He borrowed a pair of hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked the rest of the way; he apparently traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.

He returned home to Rapallo, where on 3 May 1945, four days after Mussolini was shot, armed <a href="Italian%20resistance%20movement">partisans</a> arrived at the house to find Pound alone. He stuffed a copy of Confucius and a Chinese dictionary in his pocket before he was taken to their headquarters in <a href="Chiavari">Chiavari</a>. He was released shortly afterwards, then with Olga gave himself up to an American military post in the nearby town of <a href="Lavagna">Lavagna</a>.
Pound was transferred to U.S. <a href="Counterintelligence%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Counter Intelligence Corps</a> headquarters in Genoa, where he was interrogated by Frank L. Amprin, an FBI agent assigned by <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a>. Pound asked to send a cable to <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">President Truman</a> to offer to help negotiate peace with Japan. He also asked to be allowed a final broadcast, a script called "Ashes of Europe Calling", in which he recommended peace with Japan, American management of Italy, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, and leniency toward Germany. His requests were denied and the script was forwarded to Hoover.

On 8 May, the day Germany surrendered, Pound told an American reporter, Ed Johnston, that Hitler was "a Jeanne d'Arc, a saint", and that Mussolini was an "imperfect character who lost his head". On 24 May he was transferred to the United States Army Disciplinary Training Center north of Pisa, where he was placed in one of the camp's "death cells", a series of six-by-six-foot outdoor steel cages lit up at night by floodlights; engineers reinforced his cage with heavier steel for fear the fascists would try to break him out.

Pound spent three weeks in isolation in the heat, sleeping on the concrete, denied exercise and communication, except for conversations with the chaplain. After two and a half weeks he began to break down under the strain. <a href="Richard%20Sieburth">Richard Sieburth</a> wrote that Pound recorded it in "Canto LXXX", where <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> is saved from drowning by <a href="Leucothea">Leucothea</a>: "hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me." Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week. On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists, one of whom found symptoms of a mental breakdown, after which he was transferred to his own tent and allowed reading material. He began to write, drafting what became known as "<a href="The%20Pisan%20Cantos">The Pisan Cantos</a>". The existence of a few sheets of toilet paper showing the beginning of "Canto LXXIV" suggests he started it while in the cage.

On 15 November 1945 Pound was transferred to the United States. An escorting officer's impression was that "he is an intellectual 'crackpot' who imagined that he could correct all the economic ills of the world and who resented the fact that ordinary mortals were not sufficiently intelligent to understand his aims and motives". He was arraigned in Washington, D.C., on the 25th of that month on charges of treason. The charges included broadcasting for the enemy, attempting to persuade American citizens to undermine government support of the war, and strengthening morale in Italy against the United States.

He was admitted to <a href="St.%20Elizabeths%20Hospital">St. Elizabeths Hospital</a>, and in June the following year Dorothy was declared his legal guardian. He was held for a time in the hospital's prison ward—Howard's Hall, known as the "hell-hole", a building without windows—in a room with a thick steel door and nine peepholes to allow the psychiatrists to observe him as they tried to agree on a diagnosis. Visitors were admitted for only 15 minutes at a time, while patients wandered around screaming and frothing at the mouth.

Pound's lawyer, <a href="Julien%20Cornell">Julien Cornell</a>, whose efforts to have him declared insane are credited with having saved him from life imprisonment, requested his release at a bail hearing in January 1947. The hospital's superintendent, <a href="Winfred%20Overholser">Winfred Overholser</a>, agreed instead to move him to the more pleasant surroundings of Chestnut Ward, close to Overholser's private quarters, which is where he spent the next 12 years. The historian <a href="Stanley%20Kutler">Stanley Kutler</a> was given access in the 1980s to military intelligence and other government documents about Pound, including his hospital records, and wrote that the psychiatrists believed Pound had a <a href="narcissistic%20personality%20disorder">narcissistic personality</a>, but they considered him sane. Kutler believes that Overholser protected Pound from the criminal justice system because he was fascinated by him.

Tytell writes that Pound was in his element in Chestnut Ward. He was at last provided for, and was allowed to read, write and receive visitors, including Dorothy for several hours a day. He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, and turned it into his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>'s "<a href="Women%20of%20Trachis">Women of Trachis</a>" and "<a href="Electra%20%28Sophocles%29">Electra</a>", and continued work on "The Cantos". It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release. She wrote to a friend: "E.P. has—as he had before—bats in the belfry but it strikes me that he has fewer not more than before his incarceration."

James Laughlin had "Cantos LXXIV–LXXXIV" ready for publication in 1946 under the title "The Pisan Cantos", and gave Pound an advance copy, but he held back, waiting for an appropriate time to publish. A group of Pound's friends—Eliot, Cummings, <a href="W.%20H.%20Auden">W. H. Auden</a>, Allen Tate, and Julien Cornell—met Laughlin to discuss how to get him released. They planned to have Pound awarded the first <a href="Bollingen%20Prize">Bollingen Prize</a>, a new national poetry award by the Library of Congress, with $1,000 prize money donated by the <a href="Mellon%20family">Mellon family</a>.

The awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the Library of Congress, including several of Pound's supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, Amy Lowell, <a href="Katherine%20Anne%20Porter">Katherine Anne Porter</a> and <a href="Theodore%20Spencer">Theodore Spencer</a>. The idea was that the Justice Department would be placed in an untenable position if Pound won a major award and was not released. Laughlin published "The Pisan Cantos" on 30 July 1948, and the following year the prize went to Pound. There were two dissenting voices, Francis Biddle's wife, Katherine Garrison Chapin, and <a href="Karl%20Shapiro">Karl Shapiro</a>, who said that he could not vote for an antisemite because he was Jewish himself. Pound responded to the award with "No comment from the bughouse."

There was uproar. The "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" quoted critics who said "poetry [cannot] convert words into maggots that eat at human dignity and still be good poetry". <a href="Robert%20Hillyer">Robert Hillyer</a>, a Pulitzer Prize winner and president of the Poetry Society of America, attacked the committee in "The Saturday Review of Literature", telling journalists that he "never saw anything to admire in Pound, not one line". Congressman <a href="Jacob%20K.%20Javits">Jacob K. Javits</a> demanded an investigation into the awards committee. It was the last time the prize was administered by the Library of Congress.

Although Pound repudiated his antisemitism in public, he maintained his views in private. He refused to talk to psychiatrists with Jewish-sounding names, dismissed people he disliked as "Jews", and urged visitors to read the "<a href="Protocols%20of%20the%20Elders%20of%20Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>" (1903), a forgery claiming to represent a Jewish plan for world domination. He struck up a friendship with the conspiracy theorist and antisemite <a href="Eustace%20Mullins">Eustace Mullins</a>, believed to be associated with the Aryan League of America, and author of the 1961 biography "This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound".

Even more damaging was his friendship with <a href="John%20Kasper">John Kasper</a>, a far-right activist and <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> member. Kasper had come to admire Pound during literature classes at university, and after he wrote to Pound in 1950 the two had become friends. Kasper opened a bookstore in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> in 1953 called "Make it New", reflecting his commitment to Pound's ideas; the store specialized in far-right material, including Nazi literature, and Pound's poetry and translations were displayed on the window front. Kasper and another follower of Pound's, David Horton, set up a publishing imprint, Square Dollar Series, which Pound used as a vehicle for his tracts about economic reform. Wilhelm writes that there were a lot of conventional people visiting Pound too, such as the classicist J.P. Sullivan and the writer <a href="Guy%20Davenport">Guy Davenport</a>, but it was the association with Mullins and Kasper that stood out and delayed his release from St Elizabeths.

Pound's friends continued to try to get him out. Shortly after Hemingway won the <a href="List%20of%20Nobel%20laureates%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> in 1954, he told "Time" magazine that "this would be a good year to release poets". The poet <a href="Archibald%20MacLeish">Archibald MacLeish</a> asked Hemingway in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound's behalf. Hemingway believed Pound was unable to abstain from awkward political statements or from friendships with people like Kasper, but he signed a letter of support anyway and pledged $1,500 to be given to Pound when he was released. In an interview for the "Paris Review" in early 1958, Hemingway said that Kasper should be jailed and Pound released. Kasper was eventually jailed, for inciting a riot in connection with the <a href="Hattie%20Cotton%20School">Hattie Cotton School</a> in Nashville, targeted because a black girl had registered as a student. He was also questioned relating to the bombing of the school.

Several publications began campaigning for Pound's release in 1957. "Le Figaro" published an appeal entitled "The Lunatic at St Elizabeths". "The New Republic", "Esquire" and "The Nation" followed suit; "The Nation" argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man, but had rights. In 1958 MacLeish hired <a href="Thurman%20Arnold">Thurman Arnold</a>, a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment. Overholser, the hospital's superintendent, supported the application with an affidavit saying Pound was permanently and incurably insane, and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose. The motion was heard on 18 April 1958 by the judge who had committed Pound to St Elizabeths. The Department of Justice did not oppose the motion, and Pound was free.

Pound arrived in Naples in July 1958, where he was photographed giving a <a href="Roman%20salute%23Italy">fascist salute</a> to the waiting press. When asked when he had been released from the mental hospital, he replied: "I never was. When I left the hospital I was still in America, and all America is an insane asylum." He and Dorothy went to live with Mary at <a href="Schloss%20Brunnenburg">Schloss Brunnenburg</a>, near <a href="Merano">Merano</a> in the Province of <a href="South%20Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>, where he met his grandson, Walter, and his granddaughter, Patrizia, for the first time, then returned to Rapallo, where Olga Rudge was waiting to join them.

They were accompanied by a teacher Pound had met in hospital, Marcella Spann, 40 years his junior, ostensibly acting as his secretary and collecting poems for an anthology. The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; "Canto CXIII": alluded to it: "Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell." Pound was in love with Spann, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in "Canto CXIII": "The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill." Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to the United States.

By December 1959, Pound was mired in depression. He saw his work as worthless and "The Cantos" botched. In a 1960 interview given in Rome to <a href="Donald%20Hall">Donald Hall</a> for "Paris Review", he said: "You—find me—in fragments." Hall wrote that he seemed in an "abject despair, <a href="Acedia">accidie</a>, meaninglessness, <a href="Aboulia">abulia</a>, waste". He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then suddenly sagging, and at one point seemed about to collapse. Hall said it was clear that he "doubted the value of everything he had done in his life".

Those close to him thought he was suffering from dementia, and in mid-1960, Mary placed him in a clinic near Merano when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: "I spoil everything I touch. I have always blundered ... All my life I believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning."

William Carlos Williams died in 1963, followed by Eliot in 1965. Pound went to Eliot's funeral in London and on to Dublin to visit Yeats's widow. Two years later he went to New York where he attended the opening of an exhibition featuring his blue-inked version of Eliot's "The Waste Land". He went on to Hamilton College where he received a standing ovation.
Shortly before his death in 1972 it was proposed that he be awarded the <a href="Emerson-Thoreau%20Medal">Emerson-Thoreau Medal</a> of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, but after a storm of protest the academy's council opposed it by 13 to 9. The sociologist <a href="Daniel%20Bell">Daniel Bell</a>, who was on the committee, argued that it was important to distinguish between those who explore hate and those who approve it. Two weeks before he died, Pound read for a gathering of friends at a café: "re "usury"/ I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is "avarice"."

On his 87th birthday, 30 October 1972, he was too weak to leave his bedroom. The next night he was admitted to the Civil Hospital of Venice, where he died in his sleep of an <a href="intestinal%20blockage">intestinal blockage</a> on 1 November, with Olga at his side. Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, <a href="Isola%20di%20San%20Michele">Isola di San Michele</a>, where he was buried near <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Diaghilev</a> and <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>. Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.

Critics generally agree that Pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist, particularly in his early work, such as "The River Merchant's Wife". According to Witmeyer a modern style is evident as early as "Ripostes", and Nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began "The Cantos", writing that Pound wanted his poetry to represent an "objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own" without use of symbolism or romanticism.

Drawing on literature from a variety of disciplines, Pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions, yet led the reader to an intended conclusion, believing the "thoughtful man" would apply a sense of organization and uncover the underlying symbolism and structure. Ignoring Victorian and Edwardian grammar and structure, he created a unique form of speech, employing odd and strange words, jargon, avoiding verbs, and using rhetorical devices such as <a href="parataxis">parataxis</a>.

Pound's relationship to music is essential to his poetry. Although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as "raucous, nasal, scratchy", Michael Ingam writes that Pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound, an "ear" for words, imbuing his poetry with <a href="Ezra%20Pound%27s%20Three%20Kinds%20of%20Poetry">melopoeia</a>. His study of troubadour poetry—words written to be sung ("motz et son")—led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly. He wrote that rhythm is "the hardest quality of a man's style to counterfeit". Ingham compares the form of "The Cantos" to a <a href="fugue">fugue</a>; without adhering strictly to the traditions of the form, nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously. He goes on to write that Pound's use of <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> is integral to the structure and cohesion of "The Cantos", which show multi-voiced counterpoint and, with the juxtaposition of images, non-linear themes. The pieces are presented in fragments "which taken together, can be seen to unfold in time as music does".

Opinion varies about the nature of Pound's writing style. Nadel writes that imagism was to change Pound's poetry. Like Wyndham Lewis, Pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in Edwardian writing, saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that the poet should always use the "exact" word, stripping the writing down to the "barest essence". According to Nadel, "Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction ... replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics." Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate "all but the hardest kernel" from a poem, such as in the two-line poem "In a Station of the Metro". However, Pound learned that Imagism did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic, so he turned to the more dynamic structure of Vorticism for "The Cantos".

Pound's translations represent a substantial part of his work. He began his career with translations of <a href="Occitan%20language">Occitan</a> ballads and ended with translations of Egyptian poetry. Yao says the body of translations by modernist poets in general, much of which Pound started, consists of some of the most "significant modernist achievements in English". Pound was the first English language poet since <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a>, some three centuries earlier, to give primacy to translations in English literature. The fullness of the achievement for the modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism, multilingualism, and, perhaps of greater importance, they treated translations not in a strict sense of the word but instead saw a translation as the creation of an original work.

<a href="Michael%20J.%20Alexander">Michael Alexander</a> writes that, as a translator, Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as <a href="Guido%20Cavalcanti">Guido Cavalcanti</a> and <a href="Du%20Fu">Du Fu</a>, and brought <a href="Occitan%20language">Provençal</a> and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.

In Pound's Fenollosa translations, unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry, which tended to work with strict <a href="metre%20%28poetry%29">metrical</a> and <a href="stanza">stanza</a>ic patterns, Pound created <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a> translations. Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy. <a href="Hugh%20Kenner">Hugh Kenner</a> contends that "Cathay" should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems. The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to "rethink the nature of an English poem". These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West. Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound's use of language in his translation of "The Seafarer" is deliberate, in that he avoids merely "trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language".

"The Cantos" is difficult to decipher. In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, <a href="Elegy">elegies</a>, essays and memoirs. Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of the 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century <a href="comparative%20literature">comparative literature</a>. Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing "themes and history" from <a href="Homer">Homer</a> to <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> and <a href="Dante">Dante</a>, from <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a>, and many others. The work presents a multitude of protagonists as "travellers between nations". The nature of "The Cantos", she says, is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against "a Poundian standard" of modernism.

Pound layered ideas, cultures and historical periods, writing in as many as 15 different languages, using modern <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a>, Classical languages and Chinese ideograms. Ira Nadel says "The Cantos" is an <a href="Epic%20poetry">epic</a>, that is "a poem including history", and that the "historical figures lend referentiality to the text". It functions as a contemporary memoir, in which "personal history [and] lyrical retrospection mingle"—most clearly represented in the "Pisan Cantos". Michael Ingham sees in "The Cantos" an American tradition of experimental literature, writing about it, "These works include everything but the kitchen sink, and then add the kitchen sink". In the 1960s William O'Connor described "The Cantos" as filled with "cryptic and gnomic utterances, dirty jokes, obscenities of various sorts".

<a href="Allen%20Tate">Allen Tate</a> believes the poem is not about anything and is without beginning, middle or end. He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and "at the mercy of random flights of 'angelic insight,' an <a href="Icarians">Icarian</a> self-indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated". This perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of "The Cantos". Pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure, and regretted that he could not "make it cohere".

Pound's literary criticism and essays are, according to <a href="Massimo%20Bacigalupo">Massimo Bacigalupo</a>, a "form of intellectual journal". In early works, such as "The Spirit of Romance" and "I Gather the Limbs of Osiris", Pound paid attention to medieval <a href="troubadour">troubadour</a> poets—<a href="Arnaut%20Daniel">Arnaut Daniel</a> and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Villon">François Villon</a>. The former piece was to "remain one of Pound's principal sourcebooks for his poetry"; in the latter he introduces the concept of "luminous details". The <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s in Pound's literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events, which, he believed, through the use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth; and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures.

Pound wrote intensively about economic theory with the "ABC of Economics" and "Jefferson and/or Mussolini", published in the mid-1930s right after he was introduced to Mussolini. These were followed by "The Guide to Kulchur", covering 2500 years of history, which <a href="Tim%20Redman">Tim Redman</a> describes as the "most complete synthesis of Pound's political and economic thought". Pound thought writing the cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics, and he wove his economic theories throughout; neither can be understood without the other. In these pamphlets and in "<a href="The%20ABC%20of%20Reading">The ABC of Reading</a>", he sought to emphasize the value of art and to "aestheticize the political", written forcefully, according to Nadel, and in a "determined voice". In form his criticism and essays are direct, repetitive and reductionist, his rhetoric minimalist, filled with "strident impatience", according to Pound scholar Jason Coats, and frequently failing to make a coherent claim. He rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own, although not very successfully, in Coats's view.

In 1922, the literary critic <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a> reviewed Pound's latest published volume of poetry, "Poems 1918–21", and took the opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of Pound as poet. In his essay on Pound, titled "Ezra Pound's Patchwork", Wilson wrote:

Ezra Pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It is true that he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho. ... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself ...

According to Wilson, the lines in Pound's poems stood isolated, with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that "do not hang together". Citing Pound's first seven cantos, Wilson dubbed the writing "unsatisfactory". He found "The Cantos" disjointed and its contents reflecting a too-obvious reliance on the literary works of other authors, and an awkward use of Latin and Chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of Pound's own life.

The rise of <a href="New%20Criticism">New Criticism</a> during the 1950s, in which author is separated from text, secured Pound's poetic reputation. Nadel writes that the publication of T.S. Eliot's "Literary Essays" in 1954 "initiated the recuperation of Ezra Pound". Eliot's essays coincided with the work of <a href="Hugh%20Kenner">Hugh Kenner</a>, who visited Pound extensively at St. Elizabeths. Kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound, adding that there is also no one to appeal more through "sheer beauty of language". Along with <a href="Donald%20Davie">Donald Davie</a>, Kenner brought a new appreciation to Pound's work in the 1960s and 1970s. Donald Gallup's Pound bibliography was published in 1963 and Kenner's "<a href="The%20Pound%20Era">The Pound Era</a>" in 1971. In the 1970s a literary journal dedicated to Pound studies ("Paideuma") was established, and Ronald Bush published the first dedicated critical study of "The Cantos", to be followed by a number of research editions of "The Cantos".

Following Mullins' biography, described by Nadel as "partisan" and "melodramatic", was Noel Stock's factual 1970 "Life of Ezra Pound", although the material included was subject to Dorothy's approval. The 1980s saw three significant biographies: <a href="John%20Tytell">John Tytell</a>'s "neutral" account in 1987, followed by Wilhelm's multi-volume biography. <a href="Humphrey%20Carpenter">Humphrey Carpenter</a>'s sprawling narrative, a "complete life", built on what Stock began; unlike Stock, Carpenter had the benefit of working without intervention from Pound's relatives. In 2007 David Moody published the first of his multi-volume biography, combining narrative with literary criticism, the first work to link the two.

In the 1980s Mary de Rachewiltz released the first dual-language edition of "The Cantos", including "Canto LXXII" and "Canto LXXIII". These cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines, and are characterized by 21st-century literary scholars as no more than war-time propaganda. In 1991 a complete facsimile edition of Pound's prose and poetry was published, now considered a "fundamental research tool", according to Nadel. Scholarship in the 1990s turned toward in-depth investigations of his antisemitism and Rome years. Tim Redman writes about Pound's fascism and his relationship with Mussolini, and Leon Surrette about Pound's economic theories, especially during the Italian period, investigating how Pound the poet became Pound the fascist. In 1999 Surrette wrote about the state of Pound criticism, that "the effort to uncover coherence in a ... crazy quilt of verse styles, critical principles, crankish economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive the genesis and development of any of these components". He emphasized that Pound's "economic and political opinions have not been properly dated, nor has the suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated".

Nadel's 2010 "Pound in Context" is a contextual literary approach to Pound scholarship. Pound's life, "the social, political, historical, and literary developments of his period", is fully investigated, which, according to Nadel is "the grid for reading Pound's poetry". In 2012 Matthew Feldman wrote that the more than 1,500 documents in the "Pound files" held by the FBI have been ignored by scholars, and almost certainly contain evidence that "Pound was politically cannier, was more bureaucratically involved with Italian Fascism, and was more involved with Mussolini's regime than has been posited".

Pound helped advance the careers of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century. In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway and <a href="Conrad%20Aiken">Conrad Aiken</a>, he befriended and helped <a href="Marianne%20Moore">Marianne Moore</a>, <a href="Louis%20Zukofsky">Louis Zukofsky</a>, <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Jacob Epstein</a>, <a href="Basil%20Bunting">Basil Bunting</a>, <a href="E.%20E.%20Cummings">E. E. Cummings</a>, <a href="Margaret%20C.%20Anderson">Margaret Anderson</a>, <a href="George%20Oppen">George Oppen</a> and <a href="Charles%20Olson">Charles Olson</a>. Hugh Witemeyer argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th-century English-language poetry because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him. In 1917, <a href="Carl%20Sandburg">Carl Sandburg</a> wrote in "Poetry": "All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant. Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch. The point is, he will be mentioned."
The outrage after Pound's wartime collaboration with Mussolini's regime was so deep that the imagined method of his execution dominated the discussion. <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a> considered him worse than Hitler: "In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra ... he knew all America's weaknesses and he played them as expertly as <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Goebbels</a> ever did." The response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists, and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re-evaluation. <a href="Macha%20Rosenthal">Macha Rosenthal</a> wrote that it was "as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest" in Ezra Pound.

Pound's antisemitism has soured evaluation of his poetry. Pound scholar Wendy Stallard Flory writes that separating the poetry from the antisemitism is perceived as apologetic. She believes the positioning of Pound as "National Monster" and "designated fascist intellectual" made him a stand-in for the silent majority in Germany, occupied France and Belgium, as well as Britain and the United States, who, she argues, made the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> possible by aiding or standing by.

Later in his life, Pound analyzed what he judged to be his own failings as a writer attributable to his adherence to ideological fallacies. <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> states that, in a private conversation in 1967, Pound told the young poet, "my poems don't make sense." He went on to say that he "was not a lunatic, but a moron", and to characterize his writing as "stupid and ignorant", "a mess". Ginsberg reassured Pound that he "had shown us the way", but Pound refused to be mollified:

'Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions—the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things,' [he] replied. Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-semitism.'

Gary Cooper

Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American actor.

Known for his natural, authentic, understated acting style and screen performances, Cooper's career spanned 36 years, from 1925 to 1961, and included leading roles in 84 feature films. He was a major movie star from the end of the <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> era through to the end of the golden age of <a href="Classical%20Hollywood%20cinema">Classical Hollywood</a>. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major film genres. His ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his natural and authentic appearance on screen. Throughout his career, he sustained a screen persona that represented the ideal American hero.

Cooper began his career as a film <a href="Extra%20%28acting%29">extra</a> and <a href="Stunt%20performer">stunt rider</a>, but soon landed acting roles. After establishing himself as a Western hero in his early silent films, he became a movie star in 1929 with his first sound picture, "<a href="The%20Virginian%20%281929%20film%29">The Virginian</a>". In the early 1930s, he expanded his heroic image to include more cautious characters in adventure films and dramas such as "<a href="A%20Farewell%20to%20Arms%20%281932%20film%29">A Farewell to Arms</a>" (1932) and "<a href="The%20Lives%20of%20a%20Bengal%20Lancer%20%28film%29">The Lives of a Bengal Lancer</a>" (1935). During the height of his career, Cooper portrayed a new type of hero—a champion of the common man—in films such as "<a href="Mr.%20Deeds%20Goes%20to%20Town">Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</a>" (1936), "<a href="Meet%20John%20Doe">Meet John Doe</a>" (1941), "<a href="Sergeant%20York%20%28film%29">Sergeant York</a>" (1941), "<a href="The%20Pride%20of%20the%20Yankees">The Pride of the Yankees</a>" (1942), and "<a href="For%20Whom%20the%20Bell%20Tolls%20%28film%29">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>" (1943). In the postwar years, he portrayed more mature characters at odds with the world in films such as "<a href="The%20Fountainhead%20%28film%29">The Fountainhead</a>" (1949) and "<a href="High%20Noon">High Noon</a>" (1952). In his final films, Cooper played non-violent characters searching for redemption in films such as "<a href="Friendly%20Persuasion%20%281956%20film%29">Friendly Persuasion</a>" (1956) and "<a href="Man%20of%20the%20West">Man of the West</a>" (1958).

In 1933, Cooper married New York debutante <a href="Veronica%20Cooper">Veronica Balfe</a>, and they had one daughter. The marriage was interrupted by a three-year separation that was precipitated by Cooper's affair with <a href="Patricia%20Neal">Patricia Neal</a>. Cooper received the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for his roles in "Sergeant York" and "High Noon", and he received an <a href="33rd%20Academy%20Awards">Academy Honorary Award</a> for his career achievements in 1961. He was one of the top 10 film personalities for 23 consecutive years and was one of the top money-making stars for 18 years. The <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> (AFI) ranked Cooper 11th on its list of the <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Stars">25 greatest male stars of classic Hollywood cinema</a>.

Cooper was born on May 7, 1901, in <a href="Helena%2C%20Montana">Helena, Montana</a>, the son of English parents Alice ("née" Brazier; 1873–1967) and Charles Henry Cooper (1865–1946). His father had emigrated from <a href="Houghton%20Regis">Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire</a>, and was a prominent lawyer, rancher, and (later) <a href="Montana%20Supreme%20Court">Montana Supreme Court</a> justice. His mother had emigrated from <a href="Gillingham%2C%20Kent">Gillingham, Kent</a>, and married Charles in Montana. In 1906, Charles purchased the Seven-Bar-Nine cattle ranch about north of Helena near the town of <a href="Craig%2C%20Montana">Craig</a> on the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a>. Frank and his older brother Arthur spent their summers there and learned to ride horses, hunt, and fish. Cooper attended Central Grade School in Helena.

Alice wanted her sons to have an English education, so in 1909 she took them to England to enroll them in <a href="Dunstable%20Grammar%20School">Dunstable Grammar School</a> in Bedfordshire. While there Cooper and his brother lived with their father's cousins, William and Emily Barton, in their ancestral home in <a href="Houghton%20Regis">Houghton Regis</a>. Cooper studied Latin, French, and English history at Dunstable until 1912. While he adapted to English school discipline and learned the requisite social graces, he never adjusted to the rigid class structure and formal Eton <a href="Detachable%20collar">collars</a> he was required to wear. Cooper was <a href="Baptism">baptized</a> into the <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican Church</a> on December 3, 1911, at the <a href="Church%20of%20All%20Saints%2C%20Houghton%20Regis">Church of All Saints</a> in Houghton Regis. Cooper's mother accompanied her sons back to the United States in August 1912, and Cooper resumed his education at Johnson Grammar School in Helena.

When Cooper was fifteen his hip was injured in a car accident. On his doctor's recommendation he returned to the Seven-Bar-Nine ranch to recuperate by horseback riding. The misguided therapy left him with his characteristic stiff, off-balanced walk and slightly angled riding style. He left <a href="Helena%20High%20School">Helena High School</a> after two years in 1918 and returned to the family ranch to work full-time as a cowboy. In 1919, Charles arranged for Cooper to attend <a href="Gallatin%20County%20High%20School%20%28Montana%29">Gallatin County High School</a> in <a href="Bozeman%2C%20Montana">Bozeman, Montana</a>, where English teacher Ida Davis encouraged him to focus on academics and participate in debating and dramatics. Cooper later called Davis "the woman partly responsible for me giving up cowboy-ing and going to college."

Cooper was still attending high school in 1920 when he took three art courses at <a href="Montana%20State%20University">Montana Agricultural College</a> in Bozeman. His interest in art was inspired years earlier by the Western paintings of <a href="Charles%20Marion%20Russell">Charles Marion Russell</a> and <a href="Frederic%20Remington">Frederic Remington</a>. Cooper especially admired and studied Russell's "Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross' Hole" (1910), which still hangs in the state capitol building in Helena. In 1922, he enrolled in <a href="Grinnell%20College">Grinnell College</a> in <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> to continue his art education. Cooper did well academically in most of his courses, but was not accepted into the school's drama club. His drawings and watercolors were exhibited throughout the dormitory, and he was named art editor for the college yearbook. During the summers of 1922 and 1923, Cooper worked at <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> as a tour guide driving the yellow open-top buses. Despite a promising first eighteen months at Grinnell, he left college suddenly in February 1924, spent a month in Chicago looking for work as an artist, and then returned to Helena, where he sold editorial cartoons to the "Independent", a local newspaper.

In the autumn of 1924, Cooper's father left the <a href="Montana%20Supreme%20Court">Montana Supreme Court</a> bench and moved with his wife to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to administer the estates of two relatives, and at his father's request Cooper joined them there in late November. After briefly working a series of unpromising jobs, Cooper met two friends from Montana who were working as film <a href="Extra%20%28acting%29">extras</a> and <a href="Stunt%20performer">stunt riders</a> in low-budget <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Western</a> films for the small movie studios on <a href="Poverty%20Row">Poverty Row</a> on <a href="Gower%20Street%2C%20Hollywood">Gower Street</a>. They introduced him to another Montana cowboy, rodeo champion Jay "Slim" Talbot, who took him to see a casting director. Wanting money for a professional art course, Cooper worked as a film extra for five dollars a day, and as a stunt rider for twice that amount. (Cooper and Talbot became close friends and hunting companions, and Talbot later worked as Cooper's stuntman and stand-in for over thirty years.)

In early 1925, Cooper began his film career in silent pictures such as "<a href="The%20Thundering%20Herd%20%281925%20film%29">The Thundering Herd</a>" and "<a href="Wild%20Horse%20Mesa%20%281925%20film%29">Wild Horse Mesa</a>" with <a href="Jack%20Holt%20%28actor%29">Jack Holt</a>, "<a href="Riders%20of%20the%20Purple%20Sage%20%281925%20film%29">Riders of the Purple Sage</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lucky%20Horseshoe">The Lucky Horseshoe</a>" with <a href="Tom%20Mix">Tom Mix</a>, and "<a href="The%20Trail%20Rider">The Trail Rider</a>" with <a href="Buck%20Jones">Buck Jones</a>. He worked for several Poverty Row studios, but also the already emergent <a href="Major%20film%20studio%23The%20majors%20before%20the%20Golden%20Age">major studios</a>, <a href="Famous%20Players-Lasky">Famous Players-Lasky</a> and <a href="Fox%20Film">Fox Film</a> Corporation. While his skilled horsemanship led to steady work in Westerns, Cooper found the stunt workwhich sometimes injured horses and riders"tough and cruel". Hoping to move beyond the risky stunt work and obtain acting roles, Cooper paid for a screen test and hired casting director Nan Collins to work as his agent. Knowing that other actors were using the name "Frank Cooper", Collins suggested he change his first name to "Gary" after her hometown of <a href="Gary%2C%20Indiana">Gary, Indiana</a>. Cooper immediately liked the name.

Cooper also found work in a variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked <a href="Cossacks">Cossack</a> in "<a href="The%20Eagle%20%281925%20film%29">The Eagle</a>" (1925), as a Roman guard in "<a href="Ben-Hur%20%281925%20film%29">Ben-Hur</a>" (1925), and as a flood survivor in "<a href="The%20Johnstown%20Flood%20%281926%20film%29">The Johnstown Flood</a>" (1926). Gradually, he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as "Tricks" (1925), in which he played the film's <a href="antagonist">antagonist</a>, and the <a href="short%20film">short film</a> "Lightnin' Wins" (1926). As a featured player, he began to attract the attention of major film studios. On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Productions">Samuel Goldwyn Productions</a> for fifty dollars a week.

Cooper's first important film role was in "<a href="The%20Winning%20of%20Barbara%20Worth">The Winning of Barbara Worth</a>" (1926) with <a href="Ronald%20Colman">Ronald Colman</a> and <a href="Vilma%20B%C3%A1nky">Vilma Bánky</a>, in which he plays a young engineer who helps a rival suitor save the woman he loves and her town from an impending dam disaster. Cooper's experience living among the Montana cowboys gave his performance an "instinctive authenticity", according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers. The film was a major success. Critics singled out Cooper as a "dynamic new personality" and future star. Goldwyn rushed to offer Cooper a long-term contract, but he held out for a better deal—finally signing a five-year contract with <a href="Jesse%20L.%20Lasky">Jesse L. Lasky</a> at <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> for $175 a week. In 1927, with help from <a href="Clara%20Bow">Clara Bow</a>, Cooper landed high-profile roles in "<a href="Children%20of%20Divorce%20%281927%20film%29">Children of Divorce</a>" and "<a href="Wings%20%281927%20film%29">Wings</a>" (both 1927), the latter being the first film to win an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>. That year, Cooper also appeared in his first starring roles in "<a href="Arizona%20Bound%20%281927%20film%29">Arizona Bound</a>" and "<a href="Nevada%20%281927%20film%29">Nevada</a>"—both films directed by <a href="John%20Waters%20%28director%20born%201893%29">John Waters</a>.

Paramount paired Cooper with <a href="Fay%20Wray">Fay Wray</a> in "<a href="The%20Legion%20of%20the%20Condemned">The Legion of the Condemned</a>" and "<a href="The%20First%20Kiss%20%28American%20film%29">The First Kiss</a>" (both 1928)—advertising them as the studio's "glorious young lovers". Their on-screen chemistry failed to generate much excitement with audiences. With each new film, Cooper's acting skills improved and his popularity continued to grow, especially among female movie-goers. During this time, he was earning as much as $2,750 per film and receiving a thousand fan letters a week. Looking to exploit Cooper's growing audience appeal, the studio placed him opposite popular leading ladies such as <a href="Evelyn%20Brent">Evelyn Brent</a> in "<a href="Beau%20Sabreur">Beau Sabreur</a>", <a href="Florence%20Vidor">Florence Vidor</a> in "<a href="Doomsday%20%281928%20film%29">Doomsday</a>", and <a href="Esther%20Ralston">Esther Ralston</a> in "<a href="Half%20a%20Bride">Half a Bride</a>" (also both 1928). Around the same time, Cooper made "<a href="Lilac%20Time%20%281928%20film%29">Lilac Time</a>" (1928) with <a href="Colleen%20Moore">Colleen Moore</a> for <a href="First%20National%20Pictures">First National Pictures</a>, his first movie with synchronized music and sound effects. It became one of the most commercially successful films of 1928.

Cooper became a major movie star in 1929 with the release of his first talking picture, "<a href="The%20Virginian%20%281929%20film%29">The Virginian</a>" (1929), which was directed by <a href="Victor%20Fleming">Victor Fleming</a> and co-starred <a href="Mary%20Brian">Mary Brian</a> and <a href="Walter%20Huston">Walter Huston</a>. Based on the popular <a href="The%20Virginian%20%28novel%29">novel</a> by <a href="Owen%20Wister">Owen Wister</a>, "The Virginian" was one of the first sound films to define the Western code of honor and helped establish many of the conventions of the Western movie genre that have lasted to the present day. According to biographer <a href="Jeffrey%20Meyers">Jeffrey Meyers</a>, the romantic image of the tall, handsome, and shy cowboy hero who embodied male freedom, courage, and honor was created in large part by Cooper in the film. Unlike some silent film actors who had trouble adapting to the new sound medium, Cooper transitioned naturally, with his "deep and clear" and "pleasantly drawling" voice, which was perfectly suited for the characters he portrayed on screen, also according to Meyers. Looking to capitalize on Cooper's growing popularity, Paramount cast him in several Westerns and <a href="War%20film">wartime dramas</a>, including "<a href="Only%20the%20Brave%20%281930%20film%29">Only the Brave</a>", "<a href="The%20Texan%20%28film%29">The Texan</a>", "<a href="Seven%20Days%27%20Leave%20%281930%20film%29">Seven Days' Leave</a>", "<a href="A%20Man%20from%20Wyoming">A Man from Wyoming</a>", and "<a href="The%20Spoilers%20%281930%20film%29">The Spoilers</a>" (all released in 1930).

One of the more important performances in Cooper's early career was his portrayal of a sullen <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">legionnaire</a> in <a href="Josef%20von%20Sternberg">Josef von Sternberg</a>'s film "<a href="Morocco%20%28film%29">Morocco</a>" (also 1930) with <a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> in her introduction to American audiences. During production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively. Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German. The actor approached the director, picked him up by the collar, and said, "If you expect to work in this country you'd better get on to the language we use here." Despite the tensions on the set, Cooper produced "one of his best performances", according to Thornton Delehanty of the "New York Evening Post". 

After returning to the Western genre in <a href="Zane%20Grey">Zane Grey</a>'s "<a href="Fighting%20Caravans">Fighting Caravans</a>" (1931) with French actress <a href="Lili%20Damita">Lili Damita</a>, Cooper appeared in the <a href="Dashiell%20Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a> <a href="crime%20film">crime film</a> "<a href="City%20Streets%20%281931%20film%29">City Streets</a>" (also 1931), co-starring <a href="Sylvia%20Sidney">Sylvia Sidney</a> and <a href="Paul%20Lukas">Paul Lukas</a>, playing a westerner who gets involved with big-city gangsters in order to save the woman he loves. Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two unsuccessful films: "<a href="I%20Take%20This%20Woman%20%281931%20film%29">I Take This Woman</a>" (also 1931) with <a href="Carole%20Lombard">Carole Lombard</a>, and "<a href="His%20Woman">His Woman</a>" with <a href="Claudette%20Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a>. The demands and pressures of making ten films in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health, suffering from <a href="anemia">anemia</a> and <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a>. He had lost during that period, and felt lonely, isolated, and depressed by his sudden fame and wealth. In May 1931, Cooper left Hollywood and sailed to <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> and then Italy, where he lived for the next year.

During his time abroad, Cooper stayed with the Countess Dorothy di Frasso at the <a href="Villa%20Madama">Villa Madama</a> in Rome, where she taught him about good food and vintage wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how to socialize among Europe's nobility and upper classes. After guiding him through the great art museums and galleries of Italy, she accompanied him on a ten-week <a href="big-game%20hunting">big-game hunting</a> safari on the slopes of <a href="Mount%20Kenya">Mount Kenya</a> in East Africa, where he was credited with over sixty kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, and various antelopes. His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his love of the wilderness. After returning to Europe, he and the countess set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the <a href="Italian%20Riviera">Italian</a> and <a href="French%20Riviera">French Riviera</a>s. Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932 and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 a week, and director and script approval.

In 1932, after completing "<a href="Devil%20and%20the%20Deep">Devil and the Deep</a>" with <a href="Tallulah%20Bankhead">Tallulah Bankhead</a> to fulfill his old contract, Cooper appeared in "<a href="A%20Farewell%20to%20Arms%20%281932%20film%29">A Farewell to Arms</a>", the first film adaptation of an <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> novel. Co-starring <a href="Helen%20Hayes">Helen Hayes</a>, a leading New York theatre star and Academy Award winner, and <a href="Adolphe%20Menjou">Adolphe Menjou</a>, the film presented Cooper with one of his most ambitious and challenging dramatic roles, playing an American ambulance driver wounded in Italy who falls in love with an English nurse during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Critics praised his highly intense and emotional performance, and the film became one of the year's most commercially successful pictures. In 1933, after making "<a href="Today%20We%20Live">Today We Live</a>" with <a href="Joan%20Crawford">Joan Crawford</a> and "<a href="One%20Sunday%20Afternoon">One Sunday Afternoon</a>" with Fay Wray, Cooper appeared in the <a href="Ernst%20Lubitsch">Ernst Lubitsch</a> <a href="comedy%20film">comedy film</a> "<a href="Design%20for%20Living%20%28film%29">Design for Living</a>", based on the successful <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> play. Co-starring <a href="Miriam%20Hopkins">Miriam Hopkins</a> and <a href="Fredric%20March">Fredric March</a>, the film received mixed reviews and did not do well at the box office. Cooper's performance — playing an American artist in Europe competing with his playwright friend for the affections of a beautiful woman — was singled out for its versatility and revealed his genuine ability to do light comedy. Cooper changed his name legally to "Gary Cooper" in August 1933.

In 1934, Cooper was loaned out to <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> for the Civil War <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama film</a> "<a href="Operator%2013">Operator 13</a>" with <a href="Marion%20Davies">Marion Davies</a>, about a beautiful Union spy who falls in love with a Confederate soldier. Despite <a href="Richard%20Boleslawski">Richard Boleslawski</a>'s imaginative direction and <a href="George%20J.%20Folsey">George J. Folsey</a>'s lavish cinematography, the film did poorly at the box office.

Back at Paramount, Cooper appeared in his first of seven films by director <a href="Henry%20Hathaway">Henry Hathaway</a>, "<a href="Now%20and%20Forever%20%281934%20film%29">Now and Forever</a>", with Carole Lombard and <a href="Shirley%20Temple">Shirley Temple</a>. In the film, he plays a confidence man who tries to sell his daughter to the relatives who raised her, but is eventually won over by the adorable girl. Impressed by Temple's intelligence and charm, Cooper developed a close rapport with her, both on and off screen. The film was a box-office success.

The following year, Cooper was loaned out to Samuel Goldwyn Productions to appear in <a href="King%20Vidor">King Vidor</a>'s <a href="romance%20film">romance film</a> "<a href="The%20Wedding%20Night">The Wedding Night</a>" with <a href="Anna%20Sten">Anna Sten</a>, who was being groomed as "another <a href="Greta%20Garbo">Garbo</a>". In the film, Cooper plays an alcoholic novelist who retreats to his family's New England farm where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful Polish neighbor. Cooper delivered a performance of surprising range and depth, according to biographer Larry Swindell. Despite receiving generally favorable reviews, the film was not popular with American audiences, who may have been offended by the film's depiction of an extramarital affair and its tragic ending.

That same year, Cooper appeared in two Henry Hathaway films: the <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a> "<a href="Peter%20Ibbetson">Peter Ibbetson</a>" with <a href="Ann%20Harding">Ann Harding</a>, about a man caught up in a dream world created by his love for a childhood sweetheart, and the <a href="adventure%20film">adventure film</a> "<a href="The%20Lives%20of%20a%20Bengal%20Lancer%20%28film%29">The Lives of a Bengal Lancer</a>", about a daring British officer and his men who defend their stronghold at <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> against rebellious local tribes. While the former was more successful in Europe than in the United States, the latter was nominated for six Academy Awards and became one of Cooper's most popular and successful adventure films. Hathaway had the highest respect for Cooper's acting ability, calling him "the best actor of all of them".

Cooper's career took an important turn in 1936. After making <a href="Frank%20Borzage">Frank Borzage</a>'s <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a> film "<a href="Desire%20%281936%20film%29">Desire</a>" with Marlene Dietrich at Paramount—in which he delivered a performance considered by some contemporary critics as one of his finest—Cooper returned to Poverty Row for the first time since his early silent film days to make <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>'s <a href="Screwball%20comedy%20film">screwball comedy</a> "<a href="Mr.%20Deeds%20Goes%20to%20Town">Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</a>" with <a href="Jean%20Arthur">Jean Arthur</a> for <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. In the film, Cooper plays the character of Longfellow Deeds, a quiet, innocent writer of greeting cards who inherits a fortune, leaves behind his idyllic life in Vermont, and travels to New York where he faces a world of corruption and deceit. Capra and screenwriter <a href="Robert%20Riskin">Robert Riskin</a> were able to use Cooper's well-established screen persona as the "quintessential American hero"—a symbol of honesty, courage, and goodness—to create a new type of "<a href="folk%20hero">folk hero</a>" for the common man. Commenting on Cooper's impact on the character and the film, Capra observed:

Both "Desire" and "Mr. Deeds" opened in April 1936 to critical praise and were major box-office successes. In his review in "The New York Times", <a href="Frank%20Nugent">Frank Nugent</a> wrote that Cooper was "proving himself one of the best light comedians in Hollywood". For his performance in "Mr. Deeds", Cooper received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

Cooper appeared in two other Paramount films in 1936. In <a href="Lewis%20Milestone">Lewis Milestone</a>'s adventure film "<a href="The%20General%20Died%20at%20Dawn">The General Died at Dawn</a>" with <a href="Madeleine%20Carroll">Madeleine Carroll</a>, he plays an American soldier of fortune in China who helps the peasants defend themselves against the oppression of a cruel <a href="warlord">warlord</a>. Written by playwright <a href="Clifford%20Odets">Clifford Odets</a>, the film was a critical and commercial success.

In <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a>'s sprawling frontier epic "<a href="The%20Plainsman">The Plainsman</a>"—his first of four films with the director—Cooper portrays <a href="Wild%20Bill%20Hickok">Wild Bill Hickok</a> in a highly fictionalized version of the opening of the American western frontier. The film was an even greater box-office hit than its predecessor, due in large part to Jean Arthur's definitive depiction of <a href="Calamity%20Jane">Calamity Jane</a> and Cooper's inspired portrayal of Hickock as an enigmatic figure of "deepening mythic substance". That year, Cooper appeared for the first time on the "<a href="Motion%20Picture%20Herald">Motion Picture Herald</a>" exhibitor's poll of top ten film personalities, where he would remain for the next twenty-three years.

In late 1936, Paramount was preparing a new contract for Cooper that would raise his salary to $8,000 a week when Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn for six films over six years with a minimum guarantee of $150,000 per picture. Paramount brought suit against Goldwyn and Cooper, and the court ruled that Cooper's new Goldwyn contract afforded the actor sufficient time to also honor his Paramount agreement. Cooper continued to make films with both studios, and by 1939 the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">United States Treasury</a> reported that Cooper was the country's highest wage earner, at $482,819 (equivalent to $ million in ).

In contrast to his output the previous year, Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937, Henry Hathaway's adventure film "<a href="Souls%20at%20Sea">Souls at Sea</a>". A critical and box-office failure, Cooper referred to it as his "almost picture", saying, "It was almost exciting, and almost interesting. And I was almost good." In 1938, he appeared in <a href="Archie%20Mayo">Archie Mayo</a>'s biographical film "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Marco%20Polo">The Adventures of Marco Polo</a>". Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay, the film became Goldwyn's biggest failure to that date, losing $700,000. During this period, Cooper turned down several important roles, including the role of <a href="Rhett%20Butler">Rhett Butler</a> in "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>". Cooper was producer <a href="David%20O.%20Selznick">David O. Selznick</a>'s first choice for the part. He made several overtures to the actor, but Cooper had doubts about the project, and did not feel suited to the role. Cooper later admitted, "It was one of the best roles ever offered in Hollywood ... But I said no. I didn't see myself as quite that dashing, and later, when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection, I knew I was right."

Back at Paramount, Cooper returned to a more comfortable genre in <a href="Ernst%20Lubitsch">Ernst Lubitsch</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Bluebeard%27s%20Eighth%20Wife">Bluebeard's Eighth Wife</a>" (1938) with Claudette Colbert. In the film, Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France who falls in love with an impoverished aristocrat's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife. Despite the clever screenplay by <a href="Charles%20Brackett">Charles Brackett</a> and <a href="Billy%20Wilder">Billy Wilder</a>, and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert, American audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer. It succeeded only at the European box office market.

In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in <a href="H.%20C.%20Potter">H. C. Potter</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="The%20Cowboy%20and%20the%20Lady%20%281938%20film%29">The Cowboy and the Lady</a>" with <a href="Merle%20Oberon">Merle Oberon</a>, about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be a poor, hard-working lady's maid. The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage what could have been a fine vehicle for Cooper. While more successful than its predecessor, the film was Cooper's fourth consecutive box-office failure in the American market.

In the next two years, Cooper was more discerning about the roles he accepted and made four successful large-scale adventure and cowboy films. In <a href="William%20A.%20Wellman">William A. Wellman</a>'s adventure film "<a href="Beau%20Geste%20%281939%20film%29">Beau Geste</a>" (1939), he plays one of three daring English brothers who join the French Foreign Legion in the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> to fight local tribes. Filmed in the same <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a> locations as the original <a href="Beau%20Geste%20%281926%20film%29">1926 version</a> with Ronald Colman, "Beau Geste" provided Cooper with magnificent sets, exotic settings, high-spirited action, and a role tailored to his personality and screen persona. This was the last film in Cooper's contract with Paramount.

In <a href="Henry%20Hathaway">Henry Hathaway</a>'s "<a href="The%20Real%20Glory">The Real Glory</a>" (1939), he plays a military doctor who accompanies a small group of American Army officers to the Philippines to help the Christian Filipinos defend themselves against Muslim radicals. Many film critics praised Cooper's performance, including author and film critic <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> who recognized that he "never acted better".

Cooper returned to the Western genre in <a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a>'s "<a href="The%20Westerner%20%28film%29">The Westerner</a>" (1940) with <a href="Walter%20Brennan">Walter Brennan</a> and <a href="Doris%20Davenport">Doris Davenport</a>, about a drifting cowboy who defends homesteaders against <a href="Roy%20Bean">Roy Bean</a>, a corrupt judge known as the "law west of the <a href="Pecos%20River">Pecos</a>". Screenwriter <a href="Niven%20Busch">Niven Busch</a> relied on Cooper's extensive knowledge of <a href="American%20frontier">Western</a> history while working on the script. The film received positive reviews and did well at the box-office, with reviewers praising the performances of the two lead actors. That same year, Cooper appeared in his first all-<a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> feature, <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a>'s adventure film "<a href="North%20West%20Mounted%20Police%20%28film%29">North West Mounted Police</a>" (1940). In the film, Cooper plays a <a href="Texas%20Ranger%20Division">Texas Ranger</a> who pursues an outlaw into western Canada where he joins forces with the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> who are after the same man, a leader of the <a href="North-West%20Rebellion">North-West Rebellion</a>. While not as popular with critics as its predecessor, the film was another box-office success—the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1940.
The early 1940s were Cooper's prime years as an actor. In a relatively short period, he appeared in five critically successful and popular films that produced some of his finest performances. When Frank Capra offered him the lead role in "<a href="Meet%20John%20Doe">Meet John Doe</a>" before <a href="Robert%20Riskin">Robert Riskin</a> even developed the script, Cooper accepted his friend's offer, saying, "It's okay, Frank, I don't need a script." In the film, Cooper plays Long John Willoughby, a down-and-out bush-league pitcher hired by a newspaper to pretend to be a man who promises to commit suicide on Christmas Eve to protest all the hypocrisy and corruption in the country. Considered by some critics to be Capra's best film at the time, "Meet John Doe" was received as a "national event" with Cooper appearing on the front cover of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine on March 3, 1941. In his review in the "New York Herald Tribune", Howard Barnes called Cooper's performance a "splendid and utterly persuasive portrayal" and praised his "utterly realistic acting which comes through with such authority". <a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a>, in "The New York Times", wrote, "Gary Cooper, of course, is 'John Doe' to the life and in the whole—shy, bewildered, non-aggressive, but a veritable tiger when aroused."

That same year, Cooper made two films with director and good friend <a href="Howard%20Hawks">Howard Hawks</a>. In the biographical film "<a href="Sergeant%20York%20%28film%29">Sergeant York</a>", Cooper portrays war hero <a href="Alvin%20C.%20York">Alvin C. York</a>, one of the most decorated American soldiers in World War I. The film chronicles York's early backwoods days in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, his religious conversion and subsequent piety, his stand as a conscientious objector, and finally his heroic actions at the <a href="Meuse-Argonne%20Offensive">Battle of the Argonne Forest</a>, which earned him the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. Initially, Cooper was nervous and uncertain about playing a living hero, so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his home, and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered they had much in common. Inspired by York's encouragement, Cooper delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the "New York Herald Tribune" called "one of extraordinary conviction and versatility", and that Archer Winston of the "New York Post" called "one of his best". After the film's release, Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the <a href="Veterans%20of%20Foreign%20Wars">Veterans of Foreign Wars</a> for his "powerful contribution to the promotion of patriotism and loyalty". York admired Cooper's performance and helped promote the film for <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> "Sergeant York" became the top-grossing film of the year and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards. Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend <a href="James%20Stewart">James Stewart</a>, Cooper said, "It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award. Shucks, I've been in the business sixteen years and sometimes dreamed I might get one of these. That's all I can say ... Funny when I was dreaming I always made a better speech."

Cooper concluded the year back at Goldwyn with Howard Hawks to make the romantic comedy "<a href="Ball%20of%20Fire">Ball of Fire</a>" with <a href="Barbara%20Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>. In the film, Cooper plays a shy linguistics professor who leads a team of seven scholars who are writing an encyclopedia. While researching slang, he meets Stanwyck's flirtatious burlesque stripper Sugarpuss O'Shea who blows the dust off their staid life of books. The screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder provided Cooper the opportunity to exercise the full range of his light comedy skills. In his review for the "New York Herald Tribune", Howard Barnes wrote that Cooper handled the role with "great skill and comic emphasis" and that his performance was "utterly delightful". Though small in scale, "Ball of Fire" was one of the top-grossing films of the year—Cooper's fourth consecutive picture to make the top twenty.

Cooper's only film appearance in 1942 was also his last under his Goldwyn contract. In <a href="Sam%20Wood">Sam Wood</a>'s biographical film "<a href="The%20Pride%20of%20the%20Yankees">The Pride of the Yankees</a>", Cooper portrays baseball star <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a> who established a record with the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> for playing in 2,130 consecutive games. Cooper was reluctant to play the seven-time <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a>, who only died the previous year from <a href="amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> (ALS) — now commonly called "Lou Gehrig's disease". Beyond the challenges of effectively portraying such a popular and nationally recognized figure, Cooper knew very little about baseball and was not left-handed like Gehrig.

After Gehrig's widow visited the actor and expressed her desire that he portray her husband, Cooper accepted the role that covered a twenty-year span of Gehrig's life—his early love of baseball, his rise to greatness, his loving marriage, and his struggle with illness, culminating in his farewell speech at <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> on July 4, 1939 before 62,000 fans. Cooper quickly learned the physical movements of a baseball player and developed a fluid, believable swing. The <a href="handedness">handedness</a> issue was solved by reversing the print for certain batting scenes. The film was one of the year's top ten pictures and received eleven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Cooper's third).

Soon after the publication of Ernest Hemingway's novel "<a href="For%20Whom%20the%20Bell%20Tolls">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>", Paramount paid $150,000 for the film rights with the express intent of casting Cooper in the lead role of Robert Jordan, an American explosives expert who fights alongside the <a href="Republican%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Republican</a> loyalists during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The original director, Cecil B. DeMille, was replaced by Sam Wood who brought in <a href="Dudley%20Nichols">Dudley Nichols</a> for the screenplay. After the start of principal photography in the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> in late 1942, <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a> was brought in to replace ballerina <a href="Vera%20Zorina">Vera Zorina</a> as the female lead—a change supported by Cooper and Hemingway. The love scenes between Bergman and Cooper were "rapturous" and passionate. Howard Barnes in the "New York Herald Tribune" wrote that both actors performed with "the true stature and authority of stars". While the film distorted the novel's original political themes and meaning, "<a href="For%20Whom%20the%20Bell%20Tolls%20%28film%29">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>" was a critical and commercial success and received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Cooper's fourth).

Due to his age and health, Cooper did not serve in the military during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, but like many of his colleagues, he got involved in the <a href="war%20effort">war effort</a> by entertaining the troops. In June 1943, he visited military hospitals in San Diego, and often appeared at the <a href="Hollywood%20Canteen">Hollywood Canteen</a> serving food to the servicemen. In late 1943, Cooper undertook a tour of the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a> with actresses <a href="Una%20Merkel">Una Merkel</a> and <a href="Phyllis%20Brooks">Phyllis Brooks</a>, and accordionist Andy Arcari.

Traveling on a <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24A Liberator</a> bomber, the group toured the <a href="Cook%20Islands">Cook Islands</a>, <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>—where General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> told Cooper he was watching "Sergeant York" in a Manila theater when Japanese bombs began falling—<a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, <a href="Jayapura">Jayapura</a>, and throughout the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>.

The group often shared the same sparse living conditions and <a href="K-ration">K-ration</a>s as the troops. Cooper met with the servicemen and women, visited military hospitals, introduced his attractive colleagues, and participated in occasional skits. The shows concluded with Cooper's moving recitation of Lou Gehrig's farewell speech. When he returned to the United States, he visited military hospitals throughout the country. Cooper later called his time with the troops the "greatest emotional experience" of his life.

In 1944, Cooper appeared in Cecil B. DeMille's wartime adventure film "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Dr.%20Wassell">The Story of Dr. Wassell</a>" with <a href="Laraine%20Day">Laraine Day</a> — his third movie with the director. In the film, Cooper plays American doctor and missionary <a href="Corydon%20M.%20Wassell">Corydon M. Wassell</a>, who leads a group of wounded sailors through the jungles of Java to safety. Despite receiving poor reviews, "Dr. Wassell" was one of the top-grossing films of the year. With his Goldwyn and Paramount contracts now concluded, Cooper decided to remain independent and formed his own production company, International Pictures, with <a href="Leo%20Spitz">Leo Spitz</a>, <a href="William%20Goetz">William Goetz</a>, and <a href="Nunnally%20Johnson">Nunnally Johnson</a>. The fledgling studio's first offering was Sam Wood's romantic comedy "<a href="Casanova%20Brown">Casanova Brown</a>" with <a href="Teresa%20Wright">Teresa Wright</a>, about a man who learns his soon-to-be ex-wife is pregnant with his child, just as he is about to marry another woman. The film received poor reviews, with the "New York Daily News" calling it "delightful nonsense", and Bosley Crowther, in "The New York Times", criticizing Cooper's "somewhat obvious and ridiculous clowning". The film was barely profitable.

In 1945, Cooper starred in and produced <a href="Stuart%20Heisler">Stuart Heisler</a>'s Western comedy "<a href="Along%20Came%20Jones%20%28film%29">Along Came Jones</a>" with <a href="Loretta%20Young">Loretta Young</a> for International. In this lighthearted parody of his past heroic image, Cooper plays comically inept cowboy Melody Jones who is mistaken for a ruthless killer. Audiences embraced Cooper's character, and the film was one of the top box-office pictures of the year—a testament to Cooper's still vital audience appeal. It was also International's biggest financial success during its brief history before being sold off to <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> in 1946.
Cooper's career during the post-war years drifted in new directions as American society was changing. While he still played conventional heroic roles, his films now relied less on his heroic screen persona and more on novel stories and exotic settings. In November 1945, Cooper appeared in Sam Wood's nineteenth-century period drama "<a href="Saratoga%20Trunk">Saratoga Trunk</a>" with <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>, about a Texas cowboy and his relationship with a beautiful fortune-hunter. Filmed in early 1943, the movie's release was delayed for two years due to the increased demand for war movies. Despite poor reviews, "Saratoga Trunk" did well at the box office and became one of the top money-makers of the year for Warner Bros. Cooper's only film in 1946 was <a href="Fritz%20Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s romantic thriller "<a href="Cloak%20and%20Dagger%20%281946%20film%29">Cloak and Dagger</a>", about a mild-mannered physics professor recruited by the <a href="Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services">OSS</a> during the last years of World War II to investigate the German atomic bomb program. Playing a part loosely based on physicist <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, Cooper was uneasy with the role and unable to convey the "inner sense" of the character. The film received poor reviews and was a box-office failure. In 1947, Cooper appeared in Cecil B. DeMille's epic adventure film "<a href="Unconquered">Unconquered</a>" with <a href="Paulette%20Goddard">Paulette Goddard</a>, about a Virginia militiaman who defends settlers against an unscrupulous gun trader and hostile Indians on the Western frontier during the eighteenth century. The film received mixed reviews, but even long-time DeMille critic <a href="James%20Agee">James Agee</a> acknowledged the picture had "some authentic flavor of the period". This last of four films made with DeMille was Cooper's most lucrative, earning the actor over $300,000 (equal to $ today) in salary and percentage of profits. "Unconquered" would be his last unqualified box-office success for the next five years.

In 1948, after making <a href="Leo%20McCarey">Leo McCarey</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Good%20Sam">Good Sam</a>", Cooper sold his company to Universal Studios and signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. that gave him script and director approval and a guaranteed $295,000 (equal to $ today) per picture. His first film under the new contract was King Vidor's drama "<a href="The%20Fountainhead%20%28film%29">The Fountainhead</a>" (1949) with <a href="Patricia%20Neal">Patricia Neal</a> and <a href="Raymond%20Massey">Raymond Massey</a>. In the film, Cooper plays an idealistic and uncompromising architect who struggles to maintain his integrity and individualism in the face of societal pressures to conform to popular standards.

Based on the <a href="The%20Fountainhead">novel</a> by <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a> who also wrote the screenplay, the film reflects her <a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">Objectivist</a> philosophy and attacks the concepts of <a href="Altruism%20%28ethics%29">altruism</a> and <a href="collectivism">collectivism</a> while promoting the virtues of selfishness and <a href="individualism">individualism</a>. For most critics, Cooper was hopelessly miscast in the role of Howard Roark. In his review for "The New York Times", Bosley Crowther concluded he was "Mr. Deeds out of his element". Cooper returned to his element in <a href="Delmer%20Daves">Delmer Daves</a>' war drama "<a href="Task%20Force%20%28film%29">Task Force</a>" (1949), about a retiring <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a> who reminisces about his long career as a <a href="United%20States%20naval%20aviator">naval aviator</a> and his role in the development of aircraft carriers. Cooper's performance and the Technicolor newsreel footage supplied by the United States Navy made the film one of Cooper's most popular during this period. In the next two years, Cooper made four poorly received films: <a href="Michael%20Curtiz">Michael Curtiz</a>' period drama "<a href="Bright%20Leaf">Bright Leaf</a>" (1950), Stuart Heisler's Western melodrama "<a href="Dallas%20%28film%29">Dallas</a>" (1950), Henry Hathaway's wartime comedy "<a href="You%27re%20in%20the%20Navy%20Now">You're in the Navy Now</a>" (1951), and <a href="Raoul%20Walsh">Raoul Walsh</a>'s Western action film "<a href="Distant%20Drums">Distant Drums</a>" (1951).

Cooper's most important film during the post-war years was <a href="Fred%20Zinnemann">Fred Zinnemann</a>'s Western drama "<a href="High%20Noon">High Noon</a>" (1952) with <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace Kelly</a> for <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a>. In the film, Cooper plays retiring sheriff <a href="Will%20Kane">Will Kane</a> who is preparing to leave town on his <a href="honeymoon">honeymoon</a> when he learns that an outlaw he helped put away and his three henchmen are returning to seek their revenge. Unable to gain the support of the frightened townspeople, and abandoned by his young bride, Kane nevertheless stays to face the outlaws alone. During the filming, Cooper was in poor health and in considerable pain from stomach ulcers. His ravaged face and discomfort in some scenes "photographed as self-doubt", according to biographer Hector Arce, and contributed to the effectiveness of his performance. Considered one of the first "adult" Westerns for its theme of moral courage, "High Noon" received enthusiastic reviews for its artistry, with "Time" magazine placing it in the ranks of "<a href="Stagecoach%20%281939%20film%29">Stagecoach</a>" and "<a href="The%20Gunfighter">The Gunfighter</a>". Bosley Crowther, in "The New York Times", wrote that Cooper was "at the top of his form", and John McCarten, in "The New Yorker", wrote that Cooper was never more effective. The film earned $3.75 million in the United States and $18 million worldwide. Following the example of his friend James Stewart, Cooper accepted a lower salary in exchange for a percent of the profits, and ended up making $600,000. Cooper's understated performance was widely praised, and earned him his second Academy Award for Best Actor.

After appearing in <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20de%20Toth">André de Toth</a>'s Civil War drama "<a href="Springfield%20Rifle%20%281952%20film%29">Springfield Rifle</a>" (1952)—a standard Warner Bros. film that was overshadowed by the success of its predecessor—Cooper made four films outside the United States. In <a href="Mark%20Robson">Mark Robson</a>'s drama "<a href="Return%20to%20Paradise%20%281953%20film%29">Return to Paradise</a>" (1953), Cooper plays an American wanderer who liberates the inhabitants of a <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>n island from the puritanical rule of a misguided pastor. Cooper endured spartan living conditions, long hours, and ill health during the three-month location shoot on the island of <a href="Upolu">Upolu</a> in <a href="Samoa">Western Samoa</a>. Despite its beautiful cinematography, the film received poor reviews. Cooper's next three films were shot in Mexico. In <a href="Hugo%20Fregonese">Hugo Fregonese</a>'s action adventure film "<a href="Blowing%20Wild">Blowing Wild</a>" (1953) with Barbara Stanwyck, he plays a <a href="wildcatter">wildcatter</a> in Mexico who gets involved with an oil company executive and his unscrupulous wife with whom he once had an affair.

In 1954, Cooper appeared in Henry Hathaway's Western drama "<a href="Garden%20of%20Evil">Garden of Evil</a>", with <a href="Susan%20Hayward">Susan Hayward</a>, about three soldiers of fortune in Mexico hired to rescue a woman's husband. That same year, he appeared in <a href="Robert%20Aldrich">Robert Aldrich</a>'s Western adventure "<a href="Vera%20Cruz%20%28film%29">Vera Cruz</a>" with <a href="Burt%20Lancaster">Burt Lancaster</a>. In the film, Cooper plays an American adventurer hired by Emperor <a href="Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico">Maximilian I</a> to escort a countess to <a href="Veracruz">Vera Cruz</a> during the <a href="Second%20Mexican%20Empire">Mexican Rebellion</a> of 1866. All of these films received poor reviews but did well at the box-office. For his work in "Vera Cruz", Cooper earned $1.4 million in salary and percent of the gross.

During this period, Cooper struggled with health problems. As well as his ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of "Blowing Wild" when he was hit by metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of "Vera Cruz", he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing.

In 1955, he appeared in <a href="Otto%20Preminger">Otto Preminger</a>'s biographical war drama "<a href="The%20Court-Martial%20of%20Billy%20Mitchell">The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell</a>", about the <a href="Billy%20Mitchell">World War I general</a> who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> in <a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a>'s Civil War drama "<a href="Friendly%20Persuasion%20%281956%20film%29">Friendly Persuasion</a>" with <a href="Dorothy%20McGuire">Dorothy McGuire</a>. Like "Sergeant York" and "High Noon", the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the <a href="1957%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1957 Cannes Film Festival</a>, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.

In 1956, Cooper traveled to France to make Billy Wilder's romantic comedy "<a href="Love%20in%20the%20Afternoon%20%281957%20film%29">Love in the Afternoon</a>" with <a href="Audrey%20Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Chevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a>. In the film, Cooper plays a middle-aged American playboy in Paris who pursues and eventually falls in love with a much younger woman. Despite receiving some positive reviews—including from Bosley Crowther who praised the film's "charming performances"—most reviewers concluded that Cooper was simply too old for the part. While audiences may not have welcomed seeing Cooper's heroic screen image tarnished by his playing an aging <a href="Rake%20%28character%29">roué</a> trying to seduce an innocent young girl, the film was still a box-office success. The following year, Cooper appeared in <a href="Philip%20Dunne%20%28writer%29">Philip Dunne</a>'s romantic drama "<a href="Ten%20North%20Frederick%20%28film%29">Ten North Frederick</a>".

In the film, which was based on the <a href="Ten%20North%20Frederick">novel</a> by <a href="John%20O%27Hara">John O'Hara</a>, Cooper plays an attorney whose life is ruined by a double-crossing politician and his own secret affair with his daughter's young roommate. While Cooper brought "conviction and controlled anguish" to his performance, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, it was not enough to save what Bosley Crowther called a "hapless film".

Despite his ongoing health problems and several operations for ulcers and <a href="hernia">hernia</a>s, Cooper continued to work in action films. In 1958, he appeared in <a href="Anthony%20Mann">Anthony Mann</a>'s Western drama "<a href="Man%20of%20the%20West">Man of the West</a>" (1958) with <a href="Julie%20London">Julie London</a> and <a href="Lee%20J.%20Cobb">Lee J. Cobb</a>, about a reformed outlaw and killer who is forced to confront his violent past when the train he is riding in is held up by his former gang members. The film has been called Cooper's "most pathological Western", with its themes of impotent rage, sexual humiliation, and sadism. According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, Cooper, who struggled with moral conflicts in his personal life, "understood the anguish of a character striving to retain his integrity ... [and] brought authentic feeling to the role of a tempted and tormented, yet essentially decent man". Mostly ignored by critics at the time, the film is now well-regarded by film scholars and is considered Cooper's last great film.

After his Warner Bros. contract ended, Cooper formed his own production company, Baroda Productions, and made three unusual films in 1959 about redemption. In Delmer Daves' Western drama "<a href="The%20Hanging%20Tree">The Hanging Tree</a>", Cooper plays a frontier doctor who saves a criminal from a lynch mob, and later tries to exploit his sordid past. Cooper delivered a "powerful and persuasive" performance of an emotionally scarred man whose need to dominate others is transformed by the love and sacrifice of a woman. In <a href="Robert%20Rossen">Robert Rossen</a>'s historical adventure "<a href="They%20Came%20to%20Cordura">They Came to Cordura</a>" with <a href="Rita%20Hayworth">Rita Hayworth</a>, he plays an army officer who is found guilty of cowardice and assigned the degrading task of recommending soldiers for the Medal of Honor during the <a href="Pancho%20Villa%20Expedition">Pancho Villa Expedition</a> of 1916.

While Cooper received positive reviews, "Variety" and "Films in Review" felt he was too old for the part. In <a href="Michael%20Anderson%20%28director%29">Michael Anderson</a>'s action drama "<a href="The%20Wreck%20of%20the%20Mary%20Deare%20%28film%29">The Wreck of the Mary Deare</a>" with <a href="Charlton%20Heston">Charlton Heston</a>, Cooper plays a disgraced merchant marine officer who decides to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship in order to prove the vessel was deliberately scuttled and to redeem his good name. Like its two predecessors, the film was physically demanding. Cooper, who was a trained scuba diver, did most of his own underwater scenes. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers observed that in all three roles, Cooper effectively conveyed the sense of lost honor and desire for redemption—what <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> in "<a href="Lord%20Jim">Lord Jim</a>" called the "struggles of an individual trying to save from the fire his idea of what his moral identity should be".

Cooper was formally introduced to his future wife, twenty-year-old New York <a href="debutante">debutante</a> <a href="Veronica%20Cooper">Veronica Balfe</a>, on Easter Sunday 1933 at a party given by her uncle, art director <a href="Cedric%20Gibbons">Cedric Gibbons</a>. Called "Rocky" by her family and friends, she grew up on <a href="Park%20Avenue">Park Avenue</a> and attended <a href="finishing%20school">finishing school</a>s. Her stepfather was Wall Street tycoon Paul Shields. Cooper and Rocky were quietly married at her parents' Park Avenue residence on December 15, 1933. According to his friends, the marriage had a positive impact on Cooper, who turned away from past indiscretions and took control of his life. Athletic and a lover of the outdoors, Rocky shared many of Cooper's interests, including riding, skiing, and skeet-shooting. She organized their social life, and her wealth and social connections provided Cooper access to New York high society. Cooper and his wife owned homes in the Los Angeles area in <a href="Encino%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Encino</a> (1933–36), <a href="Brentwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Brentwood</a> (1936–53), and <a href="Holmby%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Holmby Hills</a> (1954–61), and owned a vacation home in <a href="Aspen%2C%20Colorado">Aspen, Colorado</a> (1949–53).

Gary and Veronica Cooper's daughter, Maria Veronica Cooper, was born on September 15, 1937. By all accounts, he was a patient and affectionate father, teaching Maria to ride a bicycle, play tennis, ski, and ride horses. Sharing many of her parents' interests, she accompanied them on their travels and was often photographed with them. Like her father, she developed a love for art and drawing. As a family they vacationed together in <a href="Sun%20Valley%2C%20Idaho">Sun Valley, Idaho</a>, spent time at Rocky's parents' country house in <a href="Southampton%2C%20New%20York">Southampton, New York</a>, and took frequent trips to Europe. Cooper and Rocky were legally separated on May 16, 1951, when Cooper moved out of their home. For over two years, they maintained a fragile and uneasy family life with their daughter. Cooper moved back into their home in November 1953, and their formal reconciliation occurred in February 1954.

Prior to his marriage, Cooper had a series of romantic relationships with leading actresses, beginning in 1927 with <a href="Clara%20Bow">Clara Bow</a>, who advanced his career by helping him get one of his first leading roles in "Children of Divorce". Bow was also responsible for getting Cooper a role in "Wings", which generated an enormous amount of fan mail for the young actor. In 1928, he had a relationship with another experienced actress, <a href="Evelyn%20Brent">Evelyn Brent</a>, whom he met while filming "Beau Sabreur". In 1929, while filming "<a href="The%20Wolf%20Song">The Wolf Song</a>", Cooper began an intense affair with <a href="Lupe%20V%C3%A9lez">Lupe Vélez</a>, which was the most important romance of his early life. During their two years together, Cooper also had brief affairs with <a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> while filming "Morocco" in 1930 and with <a href="Carole%20Lombard">Carole Lombard</a> while making "I Take This Woman" in 1931. During his year abroad in 1931–32, Cooper had an affair with the married Countess Dorothy di Frasso, while staying at her <a href="Villa%20Madama">Villa Madama</a> near Rome.

After he was married in December 1933, Cooper remained faithful to his wife until the summer of 1942, when he began an affair with <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a> during the production of "For Whom the Bell Tolls". Their relationship lasted through the completion of filming "Saratoga Trunk" in June 1943. In 1948, after finishing work on "The Fountainhead", Cooper began an affair with actress <a href="Patricia%20Neal">Patricia Neal</a>, his co-star. At first they kept their affair discreet, but eventually it became an open secret in Hollywood, and Cooper's wife confronted him with the rumors, which he admitted were true. He also confessed that he was in love with Neal, and continued to see her. Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951, but he did not seek a divorce. Neal later claimed that Cooper hit her after she went on a date with <a href="Kirk%20Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>, and that he arranged for her to have an abortion when she became pregnant with Cooper's child. Neal ended their relationship in late December 1951. During his three-year separation from his wife, Cooper was rumored to have had affairs with <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace Kelly</a>, Lorraine Chanel, and <a href="Gis%C3%A8le%20Pascal">Gisèle Pascal</a>.

Cooper biographers have explored his friendship in the late twenties with the openly gay actor <a href="Anderson%20Lawler">Anderson Lawler</a>, with whom Cooper shared a house on and off for a year, while at the same time seeing Clara Bow, Evelyn Brent and Lupe Velez. Lupe Velez once told Hedda Hopper that during Velez' affair with Cooper, whenever he would come home after seeing Lawler, she would take down his pants and sniff for Lawler's cologne. Velez' biographer Michelle Vogel has reported that Velez consented to Cooper's sexual behavior with Lawler, but only as long as she, too, could participate. In later life, he became involved in a relationship with the costume designer, Irene, and was, according to Irene, "the only man she ever loved". A year after his death in 1961, Irene committed suicide by jumping from the 11th floor of the Knickerbocker Hotel, after telling Doris Day of her grief over Cooper's death.

Cooper's twenty-year friendship with Ernest Hemingway began at Sun Valley in October 1940. The previous year, Hemingway drew upon Cooper's image when he created the character of Robert Jordan for the novel "For Whom the Bell Tolls". The two shared a passion for the outdoors, and for years they hunted duck and pheasant, and skied together in Sun Valley. Both men admired the work of <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>—Cooper kept a copy of the poem "<a href="If%E2%80%94">If—</a>" in his dressing room—and retained as adults Kipling's sense of boyish adventure.

As well as admiring Cooper's hunting skills and knowledge of the outdoors, Hemingway believed his character matched his screen persona, once telling a friend, "If you made up a character like Coop, nobody would believe it. He's just too good to be true." They saw each other often, and their friendship remained strong through the years.

Cooper's social life generally centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties with his family and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor. As well as hunting, Cooper enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving. He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including works by <a href="Pierre-Auguste%20Renoir">Pierre-Auguste Renoir</a>, <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>, and <a href="Georgia%20O%27Keeffe">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>. Cooper owned several works by <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, whom he met in 1956. Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 <a href="Duesenberg">Duesenberg</a>.

Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective, and loved the solitude of outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional "yup" and "shucks". He once said, "If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet." According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, "Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him."

Like his father, Cooper was a conservative <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>; he voted for <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> in 1924, <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> in 1928 and 1932, and campaigned for <a href="Wendell%20Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a> in 1940. When <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> ran for an unprecedented fourth presidential term in 1944, Cooper campaigned for <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a> and criticized Roosevelt for being dishonest and adopting "foreign" ideas. In a radio address that he paid for himself just prior to the election, Cooper said, "I disagree with the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> belief that the America all of us love is old and worn-out and finished—and has to borrow foreign notions that don't even seem to work any too well where they come from ... Our country is a young country that just has to make up its mind to be itself again." He also attended a Republican rally at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Memorial%20Coliseum">Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</a> that drew 93,000 Dewey supporters.

Cooper was one of the founding members of the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Alliance%20for%20the%20Preservation%20of%20American%20Ideals">Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals</a>, a conservative organization dedicated, according to its statement of principles, to preserving the "American way of life" and opposing <a href="communism">communism</a> and <a href="fascism">fascism</a>. The organization — whose membership included <a href="Walter%20Brennan">Walter Brennan</a>, <a href="Laraine%20Day">Laraine Day</a>, <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>, <a href="Clark%20Gable">Clark Gable</a>, <a href="Hedda%20Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, <a href="Barbara%20Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>, and <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> — advised the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> to investigate communist influence in the motion picture industry. On October 23, 1947, Cooper appeared before the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC) and was asked if he had observed any "communistic influence" in Hollywood.

Cooper recounted statements he'd heard suggesting that the Constitution was out of date and that Congress was an unnecessary institution—comments that Cooper said he found to be "very un-American" and testified that he had rejected several scripts because he thought they were "tinged with communist ideas". Unlike some other witnesses, Cooper did not name any individuals, nor did he name any scripts, during his testimony.

In 1951, while making "High Noon", Cooper became friends with the film's screenwriter, Carl Foreman, who had been a member of the Communist Party. When Foreman was subpoenaed by the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, Cooper put his career on the line to defend Foreman. When <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> and others threatened Cooper with blacklisting himself and the loss of his passport if he didn't walk off the film, Cooper gave a statement to the press in support of Foreman, calling him "the finest kind of American". When producer <a href="Stanley%20Kramer">Stanley Kramer</a> removed Foreman's name as screenwriter, Cooper and director <a href="Fred%20Zinnemann">Fred Zinnemann</a> threatened to walk off the film if Foreman's name wasn't put back on. Foreman later said that, of all his friends and allies and colleagues in Hollywood, ""Cooper was the only big one who tried to help him. The only one"". Cooper even offered to testify in Foreman's behalf before <a href="HUAC">HUAC</a>, but character witnesses were not allowed. Foreman always sent future scripts to Cooper for first refusal, including: "<a href="The%20Bridge%20on%20the%20River%20Kwai">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a>, <a href="The%20Key%20%281958%20film%29">The Key</a>" and "<a href="The%20Guns%20of%20Navarone%20%28film%29">The Guns of Navarone</a>". Cooper had to turn them down because of his age.

Cooper was baptized in the Anglican Church in December 1911 in England, and was raised in the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a> in the United States. While he was never an observant Christian during his adult life, many of his friends believed he had a deeply spiritual side.

On June 26, 1953, Cooper accompanied his wife and daughter, who were devout Catholics, to Rome, where they had an audience with <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a>. Cooper and his wife were still separated at the time, but the papal visit marked the beginning of their gradual reconciliation. In the coming years, Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal behavior, and started discussing <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> with his family. He began attending church with them regularly, and met with their parish priest, who offered Cooper spiritual guidance. After several months of study, Cooper was baptized as a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> on April 9, 1959, before a small group of family and friends at the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Good%20Shepherd%20%28Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California%29">Church of the Good Shepherd</a> in Beverly Hills.

On April 14, 1960, Cooper underwent surgery at <a href="Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital">Massachusetts General Hospital</a> in Boston for an aggressive form of <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> that had metastasized to his <a href="colon%20%28anatomy%29">colon</a>. He fell ill again on May 31 and underwent further surgery at Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles in early June to remove a malignant tumor from his large intestine. After recuperating over the summer, Cooper took his family on vacation to the south of France before traveling to England in the fall to star in "<a href="The%20Naked%20Edge">The Naked Edge</a>". In December 1960, he worked on the NBC television documentary "The Real West", which was part of the company's "Project 20" series.

On December 27, his wife learned from their family doctor that Cooper's cancer had spread to his <a href="lung%20cancer">lungs</a> and <a href="bone%20cancer">bones</a> and was inoperable. His family decided not to tell him immediately.

On January 9, 1961, Cooper attended a dinner that was given in his honor and hosted by <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> and <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a> at the <a href="Friars%20Club%20of%20Beverly%20Hills">Friars Club</a>. The dinner was attended by many of his industry friends and concluded with a brief speech by Cooper who said, "The only achievement I'm proud of is the friends I've made in this community."

In mid-January, Cooper took his family to Sun Valley for their last vacation together. Cooper and Hemingway hiked through the snow together for the last time. On February 27, after returning to Los Angeles, Cooper learned that he was dying. He later told his family, "We'll pray for a miracle; but if not, and that's God's will, that's all right too." On April 17, Cooper watched the Academy Awards ceremony on television and saw his good friend James Stewart, who had presented Cooper with his first Oscar years earlier, accept on Cooper's behalf an honorary award for lifetime achievement—his third Oscar. Holding back tears, Stewart said, "Coop, I'll get this to you right away. And Coop, I want you to know this, that with this goes all the warm friendship and the affection and the admiration and the deep, the deep respect of all of us. We're very, very proud of you, Coop. All of us are tremendously proud." The following day, newspapers around the world announced the news that Cooper was dying. In the coming days he received numerous messages of appreciation and encouragement, including telegrams from <a href="Pope%20John%20XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a> and Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, and a telephone call from President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>.

In his last public statement on May 4, Cooper said, "I know that what is happening is God's will. I am not afraid of the future." He received the <a href="Last%20rites%23In%20the%20Latin%20Catholic%20church">last rites</a> on May 12. Cooper died quietly the following day, Saturday, May 13, 1961, at 12:47 p.m., six days after his sixtieth birthday.

A <a href="requiem">requiem</a> mass was held on May 18 at the Church of the Good Shepherd, attended by many of Cooper's friends, including <a href="James%20Stewart">James Stewart</a>, <a href="Henry%20Hathaway">Henry Hathaway</a>, <a href="Joel%20McCrea">Joel McCrea</a>, <a href="Audrey%20Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>, <a href="Jack%20L.%20Warner">Jack L. Warner</a>, <a href="John%20Ford">John Ford</a>, <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a>, <a href="Edward%20G.%20Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>, <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a>, <a href="Randolph%20Scott">Randolph Scott</a>, <a href="Walter%20Pidgeon">Walter Pidgeon</a>, <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> and <a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a>. Cooper was buried in the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in <a href="Holy%20Cross%20Cemetery%2C%20Culver%20City">Holy Cross Cemetery</a> in <a href="Culver%20City%2C%20California">Culver City, California</a>. In May 1974, after his family relocated to New York, Cooper's remains were <a href="exhume">exhume</a>d and reburied in <a href="Basilica%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Hearts%20of%20Jesus%20and%20Mary%20%28Southampton%2C%20New%20York%29">Sacred Hearts</a> Cemetery in Southampton. His grave is marked by a three-ton boulder from a <a href="Montauk%2C%20New%20York">Montauk</a> quarry.

Cooper's acting style consisted of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher <a href="Lee%20Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a> once observed: "The simplest examples of <a href="Konstantin%20Stanislavski">Stanislavsky</a>'s ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to say or do anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters." Film director <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a> ranked Cooper among "the greatest actors" because of his ability to deliver great performances "without direction". This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply "playing himself".

Cooper's ability to project his personality onto his characters played an important part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor <a href="John%20Barrymore">John Barrymore</a> said of Cooper, "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural." <a href="Charles%20Laughton">Charles Laughton</a>, who played opposite Cooper in "Devil and the Deep" agreed, "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life." William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a "superb actor, a master of movie acting". In his review of Cooper's performance in "The Real Glory", <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> wrote, "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore."

Cooper's style of underplaying before the camera surprised many of his directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in "Sergeant York", director Howard Hawks observed, "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't going to be any good. But when you saw the <a href="dailies">rushes</a> in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in "Pride of the Yankees", noting, "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures."

Fellow actors admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with."

"In only one scene in the first film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, we see the future of screen acting in the form of Gary Cooper. He is quiet and natural, somehow different from the other cast members. He does something mysterious with his eyes and shoulders that is much more like 'being' than 'acting'." <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>

"I don't particularly like westerns as a genre, but I do love certain westerns. 'High Noon' means a lot to me - I love the purity and the honesty, I love Gary Cooper in that film, the idea of the last man standing. I do not like John Wayne: I find it hard to watch him." <a href="Daniel%20Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a>

"I started watching Westerns when I was shooting in London about four or five years ago. I really fell in love with Gary Cooper, and his stuff. That sucked me into the Westerns. Before, I never got engrossed in the story. I’d just dip in, and there were guys in horses in black and white. High Noon‘s later Gary Cooper, I liked that. But I liked 'The Westerner'. That’s my favorite one. I have that poster hung up in my house because I really like that one." <a href="Chris%20Pratt">Chris Pratt</a>

"Gary Cooper was a phenomenon—his ability to take some thing and elevate it, give it such dignity. One of the great presences." <a href="Al%20Pacino">Al Pacino</a>

Cooper's career spanned thirty-six years, from 1925 to 1961. During that time, he appeared in eighty-four feature films in a leading role. He was a major movie star from the end of the <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> era to the end of the golden age of <a href="Classical%20Hollywood%20cinema">Classical Hollywood</a>. His natural and authentic acting style appealed powerfully to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres, including Westerns, war films, adventure films, drama films, crime films, romance films, comedy films, and romantic comedy films. He appeared on the "Motion Picture Herald" exhibitor's poll of top ten film personalities for twenty-three consecutive years, from 1936 to 1958. According to Quigley's annual poll, Cooper was one of the top money-making stars for eighteen years, appearing in the top ten in 1936–37, 1941–49, and 1951–57. He topped the list in 1953. In Quigley's list of all-time money-making stars, Cooper is listed fourth, after John Wayne, <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, and <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>. At the time of his death, it was estimated that his films grossed well over $200 million (equivalent to $ billion in ).

In over half of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men of action. In the rest he played a wide range of characters, included doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players. Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career. In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues ("The Virginian"). After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas ("A Farewell to Arms"). During the height of his career, from 1936–43, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others ("Mr. Deeds", "Meet John Doe", and "For Whom the Bell Tolls").

In the post-war years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone ("The Fountainhead" and "High Noon"). In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects the violence of the past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption ("Friendly Persuasion" and "Man of the West"). The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.

On February 6, 1960, Cooper was awarded a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to the film industry. He was awarded a star on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana.

On May 6, 1961, he was awarded the French <a href="Ordre%20des%20Arts%20et%20des%20Lettres">Order of Arts and Letters</a> in recognition of his significant contribution to the arts. On July 30, 1961, he was posthumously awarded the <a href="David%20di%20Donatello">David di Donatello</a> Special Award in Italy for his career achievements.

In 1966, he was inducted into the <a href="Hall%20of%20Great%20Western%20Performers">Hall of Great Western Performers</a> at the <a href="National%20Cowboy%20%26amp%3B%20Western%20Heritage%20Museum">National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum</a> in Oklahoma City. In 2015, he was inducted into the Utah Cowboy and Western Heritage Hall of Fame. The <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> (AFI) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Stars">25 male stars of classic Hollywood</a>. Three of his characters—Will Kane, Lou Gehrig, and Sergeant York—made AFI's list of the <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Villains">one hundred greatest heroes and villains</a>, all of them as heroes. His Lou Gehrig line, "Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.", is ranked by AFI as the thirty-eighth greatest movie quote of all time.

More than a half century after his death, Cooper's enduring legacy, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, is his image of the ideal American hero preserved in his film performances. Charlton Heston once observed, "He projected the kind of man Americans would like to be, probably more than any actor that's ever lived."

The following is a list of feature films in which Cooper appeared in a leading role.

Thomas Francis Bayard (October 29, 1828 – September 28, 1898) was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat from <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Delaware">Wilmington, Delaware</a>. A <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a>, he served three terms as <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senator</a> from Delaware and made three unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. In 1885, President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> appointed him <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>. After four years in private life, he returned to the diplomatic arena as <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Ambassador to the United Kingdom</a>.

Born in Delaware to a prominent family, Bayard learned politics from his father, <a href="James%20A.%20Bayard%20Jr.">James A. Bayard Jr.</a>, who also served in the Senate. In 1869, the Delaware legislature elected Bayard to the Senate upon his father's retirement. A <a href="Peace%20Democrat">Peace Democrat</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, Bayard spent his early years in the Senate in opposition to <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> policies, especially the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> of the defeated <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. His conservatism extended to financial matters, as he became known as a staunch supporter of the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> and an opponent of <a href="United%20States%20Note">greenbacks</a> and silver coinage, which he believed would cause inflation. Bayard's conservative politics made him popular in the South and with Eastern financial interests, but never popular enough to obtain the Democratic nomination for President, which he attempted to win in 1876, 1880, and 1884.

In 1885, President Cleveland appointed Bayard Secretary of State. Bayard worked with Cleveland to promote American trade in the Pacific while avoiding the acquisition of colonies at a time when many Americans clamored for them. He sought increased cooperation with Great Britain, working to resolve disputes over fishing and seal-hunting rights in the waters around the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canada–United States border</a>. As ambassador, Bayard continued to strive for Anglo-American friendship. This brought him into conflict with his successor at the State Department, <a href="Richard%20Olney">Richard Olney</a>, when Olney and Cleveland demanded more aggressive diplomatic overtures than Bayard wished in the <a href="Venezuela%20Crisis%20of%201895">Venezuela Crisis of 1895</a>. His term at the American embassy ended in 1897, and he died the following year.

Thomas F. Bayard was born in <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Delaware">Wilmington, Delaware</a> in 1828, the second son of <a href="James%20A.%20Bayard%20Jr.">James A. Bayard Jr.</a> and Anne "née" Francis. The <a href="Bayard%20family">Bayard family</a> was prominent in Delaware: Bayard's father would be elected to the United States Senate in 1851. Among Thomas Bayard's ancestors were his grandfather, <a href="James%20A.%20Bayard%20%28elder%29">James A. Bayard</a>, also a Senator; and great-grandfather, <a href="Richard%20Bassett%20%28politician%29">Richard Bassett</a>, who served as Senator from, and Governor of, Delaware. Several other relatives served in high office, including Bayard's uncle, <a href="Richard%20H.%20Bayard">Richard H. Bayard</a>, another Delaware Senator, and his great-great-uncle, <a href="Nicholas%20Bayard">Nicholas Bayard</a>, who was <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor of New York City</a>. On his mother's side, Bayard descended from Philadelphia lawyer and financier <a href="Tench%20Francis%20Jr.">Tench Francis Jr.</a>

Thomas Bayard was educated in private academies in Wilmington and, after his father moved to New York City for business reasons, in <a href="Flushing%2C%20Queens">Flushing</a>, New York. James Bayard returned to Delaware in 1843, but Thomas remained in New York, working as a clerk in the mercantile firm of his brother-in-law, August Schermerhorn. In 1846, his father secured him a job in a banking firm in Philadelphia, and Bayard worked there for the next two years. Bayard was unsatisfied with his progress at the firm, and returned to Wilmington to <a href="read%20law">read law</a> at his father's office.

Bayard was admitted to the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> in 1851, the year his father was elected to the United States Senate. Thomas took on greater responsibilities in the family law office, and rose quickly in the legal profession. In 1853, after the election of a Democratic president, <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, Thomas Bayard was appointed <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">United States Attorney</a> for Delaware. He spent only a year in the position before moving to Philadelphia to open a practice with his friend William Shippen, a partnership that lasted until Shippen's death in 1858. While in Philadelphia, Bayard met Louise Lee, whom he married in October 1856. The marriage produced twelve children.

Thomas Bayard's return to Wilmington in 1858 brought greater involvement in the political scene. James Bayard was a delegate to the <a href="1860%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1860 Democratic National Convention</a>, and Thomas attended with him. The elder Bayard supported <a href="Robert%20M.%20T.%20Hunter">Robert M. T. Hunter</a> of Virginia for the nomination. When the convention deadlocked and the Southern Democrats split from the main party, James Bayard adhered to the regular Democrats, but told Thomas that he thought the nominee, <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> of Illinois, was untrustworthy. The subsequent election of <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a> of the seven states of the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a> led both Bayards to fear for the future of the Union, and the elder Bayard to propose a convention of all the states to resolve their differences. In the meantime, as four more Southern states seceded, James Bayard encouraged his son to help organize an independent militia unit, the Delaware Guard; Thomas Bayard was commissioned as its First Lieutenant.

In 1860, Delaware occupied an unusual position in the free state-slave state divide; nominally a slave state, Delaware's slave population had been in steep decline for decades and represented just 1.6% of the state's people. Opinion on secession was mixed in Delaware, but the Bayards were <a href="Peace%20Democrat">Peace Democrat</a>s and leaned to the Southern perspective. They blamed the war on <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> Republicans and believed that secession, while unwise, should not be suppressed with military force. Thomas Bayard spoke at a public meeting in Dover in June 1861, saying that "with this secession, or revolution, or rebellion, or by whatever name it may be called, the State of Delaware has naught to do." Even after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>'s first battles erupted in Virginia, Bayard continued to hope for peace. By early 1862, the Delaware Guard came under suspicion of Southern sympathies, and Major General <a href="Henry%20du%20Pont">Henry du Pont</a>, commander of the state militia, ordered it disarmed. When Bayard refused to comply, he was briefly arrested before being released on <a href="Parole%23Prisoners%20of%20war">parole</a>.

Bayard's father was reelected to the Senate in 1862, but resigned shortly thereafter in protest of the new oath of office, which demanded that Senators swear they had never borne arms against the United States nor given aid and encouragement to its enemies. Bayard and his father continued in private law practice through the war. Both were pleased with the Democrats' peace platform in 1864, but disappointed in the choice of nominee, Major General <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a>, a <a href="War%20Democrat">War Democrat</a>. In 1866, Thomas Bayard successfully represented four South Carolinians in "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" cases against the military. The following year, Senator <a href="George%20R.%20Riddle">George R. Riddle</a> died and the legislature elected James Bayard to fill the remainder of the term, which ended in 1869.

Thomas Bayard became more politically active, speaking at a public meeting in September 1867 against constitutional proposals for ending racial discrimination in voting rights. The following year, he condemned the <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">impeachment proceedings against</a> President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, who had succeeded to the presidency in 1865 after <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln's assassination</a> and had threatened the Republican Congress's plans for <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> of the Southern states. Both Bayards attended the <a href="1868%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1868 Democratic National Convention</a> and, although they were unenthusiastic about the nominee, <a href="Horatio%20Seymour">Horatio Seymour</a>, supported the unsuccessful ticket that year.

James Bayard retired from the Senate when his term ended in 1869, and the legislature elected his son to the seat with little opposition. Thomas Bayard entered a Senate in which his fellow Democrats were greatly outnumbered by Republicans; the new president, <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, was also a Republican. In the Reconstruction Era, Bayard took up the cause of the defeated South, speaking against the continued military rule of the conquered states and advocating a return to civilian (and conservative) government. He protested the requirement that readmitted Southern states ratify the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, which guaranteed equal protection of the laws to all Americans. Bayard also inveighed against the continued presence of federal troops in the South. He spoke against each of the three <a href="Enforcement%20Acts">Enforcement Acts</a>, which increased the federal government's power to protect black Southerners' civil and political rights in the face of rising violence by the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> and other groups.

Although his protests were to little effect, Bayard continued to voice opposition to the majority party's plans for reconstructing the South. In 1871, he was named to a joint committee sent by Congress to investigate conditions in the South. The committee, like the Congress, had a Republican majority, and their report detailed many of the Klan's outrages against the newly freed slaves. Bayard dissented, questioning the veracity of the witnesses' testimony and stating that there were few incidents of lawlessness and that the South was generally at peace. The majority disagreed, and their findings were the basis for the <a href="Enforcement%20Act%20of%201871%20%28third%20act%29">Third Enforcement Act</a> later that year.

As more Democrats returned to the Senate, and as Republican goals shifted elsewhere, Bayard's ideas gained some traction, but were still largely in vain. In 1873, the Senate passed a resolution he introduced that demanded that Grant disclose how much government money was being expended in enforcing Reconstruction laws in the South, and to whom it was paid; the President ignored the resolution. The next year, Bayard opposed a Republican bill authorizing federal supervision of the upcoming election in Louisiana, attacking the Republican administration there as corrupt; he was unsuccessful, and the election was supervised by federal troops. He spoke forcefully against the proposed <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201875">Civil Rights Act of 1875</a>, which was to be the last such act for nearly a century. Again, he was unsuccessful and the bill, which guaranteed equal treatment in public accommodations regardless of race, passed Congress and became law. Although ultimately unsuccessful, Bayard's actions endeared him to his conservative constituents, and he was elected to another six-year term in 1874.

From the start of his congressional career, Bayard was an advocate of <a href="hard%20money%20%28policy%29">hard money</a>, i.e., a dollar backed by gold. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized a new form of currency, redeemable not in specie (gold or silver coin) but in 6% government bonds. These <a href="United%20States%20Note">United States Note</a>s, popularly known as "greenbacks," had helped to finance the war when the government's gold supply did not keep pace with the expanding costs of maintaining the armies. When the crisis had passed, many in Congress (including Bayard) wanted to return the nation's currency to a <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> as soon as possible. The process of retiring the greenbacks had already begun when Bayard was elected, but stopped when many congressmen thought the fiscal contraction too severe, and likely to be harmful to the economy. In 1869, Congress passed the <a href="Public%20Credit%20Act%20of%201869">Public Credit Act of 1869</a>, which required that the government pay its bond holders in gold, not greenbacks. Bayard thought the bill not strong enough, since it did not require removing greenbacks from circulation, and he voted against it.

In 1873, a business depression (known as the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>), increased the pressure for retaining greenbacks, as some in Congress believed that inflating the currency would ease the economic problems. Grant's Treasury Secretary, <a href="William%20Adams%20Richardson">William Adams Richardson</a>, reissued $26 million of the redeemed greenbacks, reversing the administration's previous policy of removing them from circulation. This ignited a four-month debate in the Senate over whether and when the government should return to backing all of its currency with gold—including the remaining greenbacks. The majority, including Bayard, favored resumption, but in wording the resolution that passed the Senate, Republican <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a> of Ohio left vague the exact timing; Bayard feared it would be put off indefinitely. The Sherman bill also proposed to remove greenbacks from circulation by exchanging them for bonds payable in gold; in response, Bayard proposed an amendment limiting the amount of debt the government could incur. When the amendment was rejected, Bayard voted against the bill (known as the <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">Specie Payment Resumption Act</a>), believing that it was likely to cause inflation.

Bayard's popularity with his party had grown during his time in the Senate, and by 1875 he was seen as a contender for the presidency. His advocacy of hard money had won him friends in some of the Northern cities, and his stance against Reconstruction made him popular throughout the South. Competing for those same factions of the Democratic party was New York governor <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a>, who had gained national fame for fighting the political corruption of <a href="William%20M.%20Tweed">William M. Tweed</a>'s <a href="Tammany%20Hall">Tammany Hall</a> machine in New York City. Other contenders included Governor <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Hendricks">Thomas A. Hendricks</a> of Indiana and Major General <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>. Tilden's wealth and national renown helped gather delegates to his cause, and in June 1876, he entered the convention with 404½ votes; Bayard placed fifth with 33. Tilden was nominated on the second ballot.
Displeased with the result, Bayard nonetheless supported the Democratic nominee against Governor <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> of Ohio, the Republican candidate, speaking to large crowds in cities across the North and Midwest. On election day, the vote was close, but appeared to favor a Tilden victory. Three days later, Tilden looked to have won 184 electoral votes, one short of a majority, while Hayes appeared to have 166 votes, with the votes of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina still in doubt. Each party sent their people to observe the vote in the disputed states. <a href="Abram%20Hewitt">Abram Hewitt</a>, chairman of the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a>, asked Bayard to travel to Louisiana along with several others, but Bayard refused to go.

The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, with each state producing two sets of returns, one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. There was debate about which person or house of Congress was authorized to decide between the competing slates of electors, with the Republican Senate and the Democratic House each claiming priority. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral Commission</a>, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes. Bayard supported the idea, and visited Tilden in New York to convince him that it was the only alternative to stalemate and possible renewed civil war. The bill passed, with Bayard's vote, and provided for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member was to be a Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice <a href="David%20Davis%20%28Supreme%20Court%20justice%29">David Davis</a>, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice. Bayard was among the seven Democrats chosen.

Davis upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission. The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Bradley">Joseph P. Bradley</a> to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8-7 Republican majority. The commission met and considered all of the disputed ballots, awarding each to Hayes by an 8-7 party-line vote. Bayard and his fellow Democrats were outraged, and the Democratic majority in the House threatened to filibuster to prevent the results from being accepted. As the March 4 inauguration day approached, leaders of both parties met at <a href="Wormley%27s%20Hotel">Wormley's Hotel</a> in Washington to negotiate <a href="Compromise%20of%201877">a compromise</a>. Republicans promised that, in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the Committee's decision, Hayes would order federal troops to withdraw from the South and accept the election of Democratic governments in the remaining "unredeemed" states there. The Democrats agreed and the filibuster ended. Tilden later blamed Bayard, among others, for his role in creating the Electoral Commission, but Bayard defended his position, believing that the only alternative to the result was civil war.

In 1873, Congress had passed a <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act</a> that regulated which coins were legal tender. The list of legal coins duplicated that of the previous coinage act, leaving off only the silver dollar and three smaller coins. The rationale in the Treasury report accompanying the draft bill was that to mint a gold dollar and a silver dollar with different intrinsic values was problematic; as the silver dollar did not circulate and the gold did, it made sense to drop the unused coin. The bill passed easily, with Bayard's support, but quickly thereafter became unpopular. Opponents of the bill would later call this omission the "Crime of '73," and would mean it literally, circulating tales of bribery of Congressmen by foreign agents.

Over the next few years, pressure to reintroduce silver coinage grew, and cut across party lines. In 1877, Republican Senator <a href="Stanley%20Matthews%20%28lawyer%29">Stanley Matthews</a> of Ohio introduced a resolution to pay the national debt in silver instead of gold. Bayard joined several Republicans in speaking and voting against the measure, calling it "folly," but it passed the Senate 42 to 20. Meanwhile, Democrat <a href="Richard%20P.%20Bland">Richard P. Bland</a> of Missouri furthered the silver cause from the House, proposing a <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a> bill that would require the United States to buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins, a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors. In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents, and receive back a silver dollar. <a href="William%20B.%20Allison">William B. Allison</a>, a pro-silver Republican from Iowa, offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints. Thus, the <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a>, or difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it accrued to the government's credit, not private citizens. Bayard saw the whole effort as the path to inflation and economic ruin. Again, he spoke against the bill, but like the Matthews resolution, the <a href="Bland%E2%80%93Allison%20Act">Bland–Allison Act</a> passed both houses of Congress in 1878. President Hayes shared Bayard's fear of inflation, and vetoed the bill, but Congress mustered the two-thirds vote necessary to overturn the veto, and it became law.

The elections of 1878 returned control of both houses of Congress to the Democrats for the first time since before the Civil War. The new Democratic majority passed an army <a href="appropriation%20bill">appropriation bill</a> in 1879 with a <a href="Rider%20%28legislation%29">rider</a> that repealed the <a href="Enforcement%20Acts">Enforcement Acts</a>. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race and allowed the use of federal troops to supervise elections. Bayard supported the effort, which passed both houses and sent to the President. Hayes was determined to preserve the law to protect black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. Bayard spoke in favor of the bill, believing the time had come to end the military's involvement in Southern politics. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Force Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were cut off.

Bayard also clashed with Hayes on the issue of Chinese immigration. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the <a href="Burlingame%20Treaty">Burlingame Treaty</a> with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of <a href="Chinese%20American%20history">Chinese immigrants</a> into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the <a href="Great%20Railroad%20Strike%20of%201877">Great Railroad Strike of 1877</a>, anti-Chinese riots broke out in San Francisco, and a <a href="Third%20party%20%28United%20States%29">third party</a>, the <a href="Workingman%27s%20Party">Workingman's Party</a>, was formed with an emphasis on stopping Chinese immigration. Bayard favored some restriction on Chinese immigration and voted in favor of a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, which passed both houses that year. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United States should not abrogate treaties without negotiation. The veto drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. After the veto, <a href="United%20States%20Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20State">Assistant Secretary of State</a> <a href="Frederick%20W.%20Seward">Frederick W. Seward</a> suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration. Congress passed a new law to that effect, the <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>, in 1882. Bayard supported this new act, which became law with President <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>'s signature that year.

As the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201880">election of 1880</a> drew near, Bayard was again regarded as a likely candidate. Hayes had pledged himself to a one-term presidency, which meant the Republicans would not have the advantage of incumbency. On the Democratic side, Tilden was regarded as the natural choice, as many Democrats were still convinced he had been robbed of the office in 1876. Tilden's supporters saw Bayard as a rival, and sought to smear him by suggesting he had colluded with Republicans to defeat Tilden in 1876. Meanwhile, in the House, Tilden supporter <a href="Clarkson%20Nott%20Potter">Clarkson Nott Potter</a> of New York began an investigation into the 1876 election, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. In fact, the Potter committee's investigation had the opposite effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, <a href="William%20Tilden%20Pelton">William Tilden Pelton</a>, that offered bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The telegrams doomed Tilden's hopes for the nomination, and boosted Bayard's chance among the erstwhile Tilden supporters.

As Tilden's star began to fade, many Democrats looked to Bayard. He remained popular in the Eastern cities for his conservatism and hard money beliefs, but many in the South, including Senator <a href="Augustus%20Hill%20Garland">Augustus Hill Garland</a> of <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, advised Bayard to embrace silver to help halt the defections of Southern and Western Democrats to the new <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a>. Bayard declined to do so. He was also reluctant to strike a deal with John Kelly of New York, whose Tammany faction of the Democratic party was currently at odds with the Tilden machine there. After the party rift caused the defeat of the Democratic governor in <a href="New%20York%20state%20election%2C%201879">New York's 1879 election</a>, many Tilden adherents began to think their candidate could not win his home state, and drifted to Bayard, among others. Tilden's supporters attempted to weaken Bayard in February 1880 by publishing the speech he gave in Dover in 1861, in which he said that the United States should acquiesce in Southern secession. At the same time, Bayard's uncompromising stance on the money question pushed some Democrats to support Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, who had not been identified with either extreme in the gold-silver debate and had a military record that appealed to Northerners.

Leading up to <a href="1880%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">the convention</a> in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Tilden remained ambiguous about his intentions. <a href="George%20Gray%20%28senator%29">George Gray</a>, Delaware's attorney general, placed Bayard's name in nomination, calling the senator "a veteran, covered in scars of many a hard-fought battle, where the principles of constitutional liberty have been at stake ... Bayard is a statesman who will need no introduction to the American people." When the convention took its first ballot on June 23, Bayard placed second with 153½ votes, trailing only Hancock, who had 171. On the second ballot, the delegates broke for Hancock, and he was nominated. The Southern delegates, whom Bayard thought would be most loyal to him, were among the first to desert him. The convention nominated <a href="William%20Hayden%20English">William Hayden English</a> of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, a Bayard supporter and hard-money man, for vice president, and then closed. Bayard's supporters were disappointed, but he supported the ticket as usual, in the interest of party unity. Hancock and English fought to a near-draw in the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote to <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> and Chester A. Arthur by 214 to 155.

The Delaware legislature re-elected Bayard to the Senate for a third term in 1881 without serious opposition. The Senate in the <a href="47th%20United%20States%20Congress">47th Congress</a> was evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, with the new vice president, Arthur, holding the tie-breaking vote. After spending the special session of March 1881 in an intra-Republican Party fight over the confirmation of Garfield's cabinet nominees, the Senate went into recess until October. By that time, <a href="Assassination%20of%20James%20A.%20Garfield">Garfield had been assassinated</a> and Arthur was president. When the Senate reconvened, the Democrats held the majority briefly, and Bayard was elected <a href="President%20pro%20tempore%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">president pro tempore</a> on October 10; Republicans regained the majority three days later as Republican latecomers arrived and were sworn in, and David Davis took over the office.

Among the issues confronting the Senate was the surplus of government funds. With high revenue held over from wartime taxes, the federal government had collected more than it spent since 1866; by 1882 the surplus reached $145 million. Opinions varied on how to <a href="Balanced%20budget">balance the budget</a>; the Democrats wished to lower <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s, in order to reduce revenues and the cost of imported goods, while Republicans believed that high tariffs ensured high wages in manufacturing and mining. They preferred the government spend more on <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> and pensions for Civil War soldiers while reducing <a href="excise">excise</a> taxes. Bayard did not oppose some veterans' pensions, but worried that pensions would require continued high tariffs, which he opposed. He supported the movement for a commission to examine the tariff and suggest improvements, but opposed the resulting <a href="Tariff%20of%201883">Tariff of 1883</a>, which reduced tariffs by an average of 1.47%. Congressional Republicans also sought to deplete the surplus through a Rivers and Harbors Act that increased spending on internal improvements; Bayard opposed the bill and was gratified when Arthur vetoed it against his own party's wishes.

Bayard and Arthur also agreed on the need for civil service reform. Garfield's assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified the public demand for civil service reform. Leaders of both parties, including Bayard, realized that they could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the <a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a> and, by 1882, a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform. In 1880, Democratic Senator <a href="George%20H.%20Pendleton">George H. Pendleton</a> of Ohio introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an <a href="Civil%20service%20examination">examination</a>, but the bill did not pass. After the 1882 congressional elections, in which Democrats campaigned successfully on the reform issue, the Pendleton bill was proposed again, and again Bayard supported it, saying that "the offices of this Government are created ... for the public service and not for the private use of incumbents." The Senate approved the bill 38–5 and the House soon concurred by a vote of 155–47. Arthur signed the <a href="Pendleton%20Civil%20Service%20Reform%20Act">Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act</a> into law on January 16, 1883.

Despite his rebukes at the Democratic national conventions in 1876 and 1880, Bayard was again considered among the leading candidates for the nomination in 1884. Tilden again was ambiguous about his willingness to run, but by 1883 New York's new governor, <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, began to surpass Tilden as a likely candidate. After Tilden definitively bowed out in June 1884, many of his former supporters began to flock to Bayard. Many Democrats were concerned with Cleveland's ability to carry his home state after he, like Tilden before him, became embroiled in a feud with the Tammany Hall wing of the party. At the same time, the Tammany Democrats became more friendly to Bayard.

By the time the Democrats had assembled in Chicago on July 8, 1884 to begin their convention, the Republicans had already picked their nominee: <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> of <a href="Maine">Maine</a>. Blaine's nomination turned many reform-minded Republicans (known as <a href="Mugwump">Mugwump</a>s) away from their party. Bayard and Cleveland, seen as honest politicians, were the Democrats most favored by the renegade Republican faction. Bayard was optimistic at the start of <a href="1884%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">the convention</a>, but the results of the first ballot ran heavily against him: 170 votes to Cleveland's 392. The reason was the same as in 1880: as Congressman <a href="Robert%20S.%20Stevens">Robert S. Stevens</a> of New York said, "I believe if he were President his Administration would be one in which every American citizen would take pride. I believe he is a patriot, but it would be a suicidal attempt to nominate him. His [1861] Dover speech would be sent into every household in the North." The voting the next day demonstrated the point, as Cleveland was nominated on the second ballot.

The resulting campaign between Cleveland and Blaine focused more on scandal and mudslinging than the issues of the day. In the end, Cleveland eked out a narrow victory. Carrying New York was crucial for the Democrat; a shift of just 550 votes in that state would have given the election to Blaine. Instead, Cleveland carried his home state and a Democrat was elected president for the first time since 1856. Cleveland recognized Bayard's status in the party hierarchy by offering him the top spot in his cabinet: <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>. Bayard did not think himself an expert in foreign affairs and enjoyed the sixteen years he had spent in the Senate; even so, he accepted the post and joined the administration.

Among the first foreign policy challenges Bayard and Cleveland faced was that concerning American influence in the <a href="Samoan%20Islands">Samoan Islands</a>. The United States, Great Britain, and Germany all had treaties with the Samoan government that guaranteed their right to trade and establish naval bases there. In the 1880s, German chancellor <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> began to increase German influence in Samoa, and attempted to replace the Samoan king, <a href="Malietoa%20Laupepa">Malietoa Laupepa</a>, with <a href="Tamasese%20Titimaea">Tamasese Titimaea</a>, a claimant to the throne who favored German <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a>. Bayard and Cleveland opposed any change that would undermine Samoan independence, as did the British government. Bayard filed a note of protest with the German government, and the three powers agreed to meet for a conference in Washington in June 1887, but they failed to achieve any agreement.

Shortly thereafter, Tamasese's unpopularity led another claimant, <a href="Mata%27afa%20Iosefo">Mata'afa Iosefo</a>, to start a rebellion that led to the <a href="Samoan%20Civil%20War">Samoan Civil War</a>. When Tamasese's German guards were killed, Bismarck considered it an attack on Germany, and sent warships to Samoa. Cleveland dispatched three American warships, <a href="USS%20Nipsic">"Nipsic"</a>, <a href="USS%20Trenton%20%281876%29">"Trenton"</a>, and <a href="USS%20Vandalia%20%281876%29">"Vandalia"</a>, in response, and a British warship joined them. As the threat of war grew, Bismarck backed down and agreed to another conference in 1889; two weeks later, <a href="1889%20Apia%20cyclone">a hurricane</a> struck the harbor and all of the German and American warships were damaged or sunk. As tempers cooled, the parties met in conference in Berlin. By that time, Cleveland had been defeated for re-election and James G. Blaine took Bayard's place as Secretary of State. The three powers agreed to a tripartite protectorate of Samoa with Malietoa Laupepa restored as king; that situation prevailed until 1899, when <a href="Second%20Samoan%20Civil%20War">renewed civil war</a> led to a <a href="Tripartite%20Convention">second convention</a> partitioning the islands between Germany and the United States.

In the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>, Bayard and Cleveland pursued a similar goal of maintaining the Hawaiian kingdom's independence while expanding access for American trade. As a Senator, Bayard had voted for <a href="Reciprocity%20Treaty%20of%201875">free trade with Hawaii</a>, but the treaty was allowed to lapse in 1884. As Secretary of State the following year, Bayard hoped to again have free trade with Hawaii, and also endorsed the idea of establishing an American naval base there, although he preferred <a href="Midway%20Atoll">Midway Atoll</a> to the eventual location, <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>. A treaty to that effect passed the Senate in 1887 by a 43–11 vote. As in Samoa, the administration sought to curb foreign influence, encouraging the Hawaiian government to reject a loan from Britain that would have required pledging future government revenues toward its repayment.

Despite their agreement on Samoa, much of Bayard's term of office was taken up in settling disputes with Great Britain. The largest of these concerned the Canadian fisheries off the Atlantic coasts of Canada and <a href="Newfoundland%20Colony">Newfoundland</a>. The rights of American fisherman in Canadian waters had been disputed since American independence, but the most recent disagreement stemmed from Congress's decision in 1885 to abrogate part of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Washington%20%281871%29">1871 treaty</a> that governed the situation. Under that treaty, American fishermen had the right to fish in Canadian waters; in return, fishermen from Canada and Newfoundland had the right to export fish to the United States <a href="Duty%20%28economics%29">duty</a>-free. Protectionists in Congress thought the arrangement hurt American fisherman, and convinced their colleagues to repeal it. In response, Canadian authorities fell back on an interpretation of the earlier <a href="Treaty%20of%201818">Treaty of 1818</a>, and began to seize American vessels. In 1887, the <a href="Lame-duck%20session">lame duck</a> <a href="49th%20United%20States%20Congress">49th Congress</a> then passed the <a href="Fisheries%20Retaliation%20Act">Fisheries Retaliation Act</a>, which empowered the president to bar Canadian ships from American ports if he thought Canadians were treating American fishermen "unjustly;" Cleveland signed the bill, but did not enforce it and hoped he and Bayard would be able to find a diplomatic solution to the escalating trade war.

Britain agreed to negotiate, and a six-member commission convened in Washington in June 1887. Bayard led the American delegation, joined by <a href="James%20Burrill%20Angell">James Burrill Angell</a>, president of the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, and <a href="William%20LeBaron%20Putnam">William LeBaron Putnam</a>, a Maine lawyer and international law scholar. <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, a leading statesman in the British Parliament, led their delegation, which also included <a href="Lionel%20Sackville-West%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Sackville">Lionel Sackville-West</a>, the British ambassador to the United States, and <a href="Charles%20Tupper">Charles Tupper</a>, a future Prime Minister of Canada. By February 1888, the commission agreed on a new treaty, which would create a mixed commission to determine which bays were open to American fishermen. Americans could purchase provisions and bait in Canada if they purchased a license, but if Canadian fisherman were allowed to sell their catch in the United States duty-free, then the Americans' licenses to fish in Canada would be free. Bayard believed that the treaty, "if observed honorably and honestly, will prevent future friction ... between the two nations." The Senate, controlled by Republicans, disagreed, and rejected the treaty by a 27–30 vote. Aware of the risk that the treaty might be rejected, Bayard and Chamberlain agreed on a two-year working agreement, allowing Americans to continue their fishing in Canadian waters by paying a fee. This arrangement was renewed every two years until 1912, when a permanent solution was found.

A similar dispute with Britain arose in the Pacific, over the rights of Canadians to <a href="Seal%20hunting">hunt seals</a> in waters off the <a href="Pribilof%20Islands">Pribilof Islands</a>, a part of Alaska. While only Americans had the right to take seals on the islands, the right to hunt in the waters around them was less well-defined, and Americans believed foreign sealers were depleting the herd too quickly by hunting off-shore. Bayard and Cleveland believed the waters around the islands to be exclusively American, but when Cleveland ordered the seizure of Canadian ships there, Bayard tried to convince him to search for a diplomatic solution instead. The situation remained unresolved when the administration left office in 1889, and remained so until the <a href="North%20Pacific%20Fur%20Seal%20Convention%20of%201911">North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911</a>.

Relations with Britain were also impaired when Sackville-West <a href="Murchison%20letter">intervened in the 1888 election</a>. A Republican, posing as a British immigrant to the United States, asked Sackville-West whether voting for Cleveland or his Republican opponent, <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, would best serve British interests. Sackville-West wrote that Cleveland was better for Britain; Republicans published the letter in October 1888, hoping to diminish Cleveland's popularity among <a href="Irish%20American">Irish-Americans</a>. Cleveland's cabinet discussed the matter and instructed Bayard to inform the ambassador his services would no longer be required in Washington. Bayard attempted to limit the electoral damage, and gave a speech in Baltimore condemning Republicans for scheming to portray Cleveland as a British tool. Cleveland was defeated for re-election the following month in a close election.

Bayard's term as Secretary of State ended in March 1889 after Cleveland's defeat, and he returned to Wilmington to resume his law practice. He lived in "very comfortable circumstances" there, with a fortune estimated at $300,000, although his income from the law practice was modest. His wife having died in 1886, Bayard remarried in 1889 to Mary Willing Clymer, the granddaughter and namesake of the Philadelphia socialite <a href="Mary%20Willing%20Clymer">Mary Willing Clymer</a>. Bayard remained involved with Democratic politics and stayed informed on foreign affairs. When Cleveland was re-elected in 1892, many assumed Bayard would resume his position in the cabinet. Instead, Cleveland selected Judge <a href="Walter%20Q.%20Gresham">Walter Q. Gresham</a> of Indiana for the State Department and appointed Bayard <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Great%20Britain">Ambassador to Great Britain</a>, the first American envoy to Britain to hold that rank (his predecessors had been <a href="Envoy%20%28title%29">envoys</a>). Bayard accepted the appointment, which the Senate quickly confirmed.

On June 12, 1893, <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Lord Rosebury</a>, the British Foreign Secretary, received Bayard in London. Bayard began his tenure as ambassador with an "instinctive feeling of friendship for England," and a desire for peace and cooperation between the two nations. That desire was quickly impaired when Cleveland took the side of <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> when that nation insisted on taking <a href="Venezuela%20Crisis%20of%201895">a boundary dispute</a> between it and <a href="British%20Guiana">British Guiana</a> to <a href="international%20arbitration">international arbitration</a>. The exact boundary had been in dispute for decades, but Britain had consistently denied any arbitration except over a small portion of the line; Venezuela wished the entire boundary included in any arbitration.

Bayard spent mid-1894 in the United States conferring with Gresham. The tension in the Venezuelan boundary dispute continued to escalate, while British disagreements with <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> also threatened to involve the United States. Britain had once ruled the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua (the <a href="Mosquito%20Coast">Mosquito Coast</a>) but had abandoned it in 1860. Nicaragua had annexed the area while guaranteeing the inhabitants (the <a href="Miskito%20people">Miskito people</a>) a degree of autonomy. When Nicaragua expanded their control of the area in 1894, the Miskito chief, <a href="Robert%20Henry%20Clarence">Robert Henry Clarence</a>, protested with the support of the British ambassador. Bayard agreed with Cleveland and Gresham that the British were not attempting to reestablish their colony, but Nicaraguans (and many Anglophobic Americans) saw a more sinister motive, including a possible British-controlled <a href="Nicaragua%20Canal">canal through Nicaragua</a>. Returning to England, Bayard met with the new Foreign Secretary, <a href="John%20Wodehouse%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Kimberley">Lord Kimberley</a>, to emphasize Nicaragua's right to govern the area.

The tension over Nicaragua soon abated, but the May 1895 death of Secretary Gresham, who like Bayard had favored cooperation with the British, led to increased disagreement over the Venezuela issue. Cleveland appointed <a href="Richard%20Olney">Richard Olney</a> to take over the State Department, and Olney soon proved more confrontational than his predecessor. <a href="Olney%20interpretation">Olney's opinion</a>, soon adopted by Cleveland, was that the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. Olney drafted a long dispatch on the history of the problem, declaring that "to-day the United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition ..." Bayard delivered the note to the British Prime Minister (<a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>, who was also serving as Foreign Secretary) on August 7, 1895.

Olney's note was met with vehement disagreement and delay, but when tempers cooled, the British agreed to arbitration later that year. Bayard disagreed with the bellicose tone of the message, which he attributed to an effort to satisfy Anglophobia among "Radical Republicans and the foolish Irishmen." Olney, for his part, thought Bayard soft-pedaled the note and asked Cleveland to remove Bayard from office, which Cleveland declined. The House of Representatives agreed with Olney, and passed a resolution of <a href="Censure%20in%20the%20United%20States">censure</a> against Bayard in December 1895. Britain and Venezuela formally agreed to arbitration in February 1897, one month before the Cleveland administration came to an end. The panel's final judgement, delivered in 1899, awarded Britain almost all of the disputed territory.

Bayard remained in London until the arrival of his successor, <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a>, in April 1897. He returned to Wilmington that May and visited ex-President Cleveland at his home in Princeton the following month, remaining friendly with him despite their differences on the Venezuela question. Bayard's health had begun to decline in England, and he was often ill after his return to the United States. He died on September 28, 1898, while visiting his daughter Mabel Bayard Warren in <a href="Dedham%2C%20Massachusetts">Dedham, Massachusetts</a>. Bayard was buried in the <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%20%28Old%20Swedes%29">Old Swedes Episcopal Church Cemetery</a> at Wilmington. He was survived by his second wife and seven of his twelve children, including <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard%20Jr.">Thomas F. Bayard Jr.</a>, who would serve in the United States Senate from 1922 to 1929.

Thirteen years after his death, the <a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition">1911 "Encyclopædia Britannica"</a> said of Bayard that "his tall dignified person, unfailing courtesy, and polished, if somewhat deliberate, eloquence made him a man of mark in all the best circles. He was considered indeed by many Americans to have become too partial to English ways; and, for the expression of some criticisms regarded as unfavorable to his own countrymen, the House of Representatives went so far as to pass ... a vote of censure on him. The value of Bayard's diplomacy was, however, fully recognized in the United Kingdom where he worthily upheld the traditions of a famous line of American ministers." In 1929, the <a href="Dictionary%20of%20American%20Biography">Dictionary of American Biography</a> described Bayard, as a Senator, as being "remembered rather for his opposition to Republican policies ... than for constructive legislation of the successful solution of great problems", and said that he had "the convictions of an earlier day ... and was never inclined, either politically or socially, to seek popularity with the country at large." Charles C. Tansill, a conservative historian, found much to praise in Bayard; he published a volume on Bayard's diplomatic career in 1940 and another about his congressional career in 1946, the only full-length biographies to appear since Bayard's death. Later historians took a dimmer view of Bayard's diplomatic career; in a 1989 book, Henry E. Mattox numbered Bayard among the Gilded Age foreign service officers who were "demonstrably incompetent."

Battle of Hastings

The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 between the Norman-French army of <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William, the Duke of Normandy</a>, and an English army under the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> King <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a>, beginning the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest of England</a>. It took place approximately northwest of <a href="Hastings">Hastings</a>, close to the present-day town of <a href="Battle%2C%20East%20Sussex">Battle, East Sussex</a>, and was a decisive <a href="Normans">Norman</a> victory.

The background to the battle was the death of the childless King <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death, but faced invasions by William, his own brother <a href="Tostig%20Godwinson">Tostig</a>, and the Norwegian King <a href="Harald%20Hardrada">Harald Hardrada</a> (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fulford">Battle of Fulford</a> on 20 September 1066, and were in turn defeated by Harold at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a> five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at <a href="Pevensey">Pevensey</a> on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.

The exact numbers present at the battle are unknown; modern estimates are around 10,000 for William and about 7,000 for Harold. The composition of the forces is clearer; the English army was composed almost entirely of <a href="infantry">infantry</a> and had few <a href="Archery">archers</a>, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect; therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.

There continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are hard to come by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded <a href="Battle%20Abbey">a monastery</a> at the site of the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.

In 911, the <a href="Carolingian%20dynasty">Carolingian</a> ruler <a href="Charles%20the%20Simple">Charles the Simple</a> allowed a group of Vikings to settle in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> under their leader <a href="Rollo">Rollo</a>. Their settlement proved successful, and they quickly adapted to the indigenous culture, renouncing <a href="paganism">paganism</a>, converting to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and intermarrying with the local population. Over time, the frontiers of the duchy expanded to the west. In 1002, King <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred II</a> married <a href="Emma%20of%20Normandy">Emma</a>, the sister of <a href="Richard%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">Richard II, Duke of Normandy</a>. Their son <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> spent many years in exile in Normandy, and succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led to the establishment of a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Edward was childless and embroiled in conflict with the formidable <a href="Godwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Godwin, Earl of Wessex</a>, and his sons, and he may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.

King Edward's death on 5 January 1066 left no clear heir, and several contenders laid claim to the throne of England. Edward's immediate successor was the <a href="Earl%20of%20Wessex">Earl of Wessex</a>, Harold Godwinson, the richest and most powerful of the English aristocrats and son of Godwin, Edward's earlier opponent. Harold was elected king by the <a href="Witenagemot">Witenagemot</a> of England and crowned by <a href="Ealdred%20%28archbishop%20of%20York%29">Ealdred</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, although Norman propaganda claimed that the ceremony was performed by <a href="Stigand">Stigand</a>, the uncanonically elected <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Harold was at once challenged by two powerful neighbouring rulers. Duke William claimed that he had been promised the throne by King Edward and that Harold had sworn agreement to this. <a href="Harald%20Hardrada">Harald Hardrada</a> of <a href="Norway">Norway</a> also contested the succession. His claim to the throne was based on an agreement between his predecessor <a href="Magnus%20the%20Good">Magnus the Good</a> and the earlier King of England <a href="Harthacnut">Harthacnut</a>, whereby, if either died without heir, the other would inherit both England and Norway. William and Harald Hardrada immediately set about assembling troops and ships for separate invasions.

In early 1066, Harold's exiled brother <a href="Tostig%20Godwinson">Tostig Godwinson</a> raided southeastern England with a fleet he had recruited in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, later joined by other ships from <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>. Threatened by Harold's fleet, Tostig moved north and raided in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> and <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. He was driven back to his ships by the brothers <a href="Edwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Edwin, Earl of Mercia</a> and <a href="Morcar">Morcar, Earl of Northumbria</a>. Deserted by most of his followers, he withdrew to Scotland, where he spent the middle of the year recruiting fresh forces. Hardrada invaded northern England in early September, leading a fleet of more than 300 ships carrying perhaps 15,000 men. Hardrada's army was further augmented by the forces of Tostig, who supported the Norwegian king's bid for the throne. Advancing on York, the Norwegians occupied the city after defeating a northern English army under Edwin and Morcar on 20 September at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fulford">Battle of Fulford</a>.

The <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20military%20organization">English army</a> was organised along regional lines, with the "<a href="fyrd">fyrd</a>", or local levy, serving under a local magnate – whether an <a href="earl">earl</a>, bishop, or <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a>. The "fyrd" was composed of men who owned their own land, and were equipped by their community to fulfil the king's demands for military forces. For every five <a href="hide%20%28unit%29">hides</a>, or units of land nominally capable of supporting one household, one man was supposed to serve. It appears that the <a href="Hundred%20%28country%20subdivision%29">hundred</a> was the main organising unit for the "fyrd". As a whole, England could furnish about 14,000 men for the "fyrd", when it was called out. The "fyrd" usually served for two months, except in emergencies. It was rare for the whole national "fyrd" to be called out; between 1046 and 1065 it was only done three times, in 1051, 1052, and 1065. The king also had a group of personal armsmen, known as <a href="housecarl">housecarl</a>s, who formed the backbone of the royal forces. Some earls also had their own forces of housecarls. <a href="Thegn">Thegn</a>s, the local landowning elites, either fought with the royal housecarls or attached themselves to the forces of an earl or other magnate. The "fyrd" and the housecarls both fought on foot, with the major difference between them being the housecarls' superior armour. The English army does not appear to have had a significant number of archers.

Harold had spent mid-1066 on the south coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. The bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold dismissed the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a> on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.

William assembled a large invasion fleet and an army gathered from Normandy and the rest of France, including large contingents from <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> and Flanders. He spent almost nine months on his preparations, as he had to construct a fleet from nothing. According to some Norman chronicles, he also secured diplomatic support, although the accuracy of the reports has been a matter of historical debate. The most famous claim is that Pope <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20II">Alexander II</a> gave a papal banner as a token of support, which only appears in <a href="William%20of%20Poitiers">William of Poitiers</a>'s account, and not in more contemporary narratives. In April 1066 <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a> appeared in the sky, and was widely reported throughout Europe. Contemporary accounts connected the comet's appearance with the succession crisis in England.

William mustered his forces at <a href="Saint-Valery-sur-Somme">Saint-Valery-sur-Somme</a>, and was ready to cross the English Channel by about 12 August. But the crossing was delayed, either because of unfavourable weather or to avoid being intercepted by the powerful English fleet. The Normans crossed to England a few days after Harold's victory over the Norwegians, following the dispersal of Harold's naval force, and landed at <a href="Pevensey">Pevensey</a> in Sussex on 28 September. A few ships were blown off course and landed at <a href="Romney%20Marsh">Romney</a>, where the Normans fought the local "fyrd". After landing, William's forces built a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. More fortifications were erected at Pevensey.

The exact numbers and composition of William's force are unknown. A contemporary document claims that William had 776 ships, but this may be an inflated figure. Figures given by contemporary writers for the size of the army are highly exaggerated, varying from 14,000 to 150,000. Modern historians have offered a range of estimates for the size of William's forces: 7,000–8,000 men, 1,000–2,000 of them cavalry; 10,000–12,000 men; 10,000 men, 3,000 of them cavalry; or 7500 men. The army consisted of cavalry, infantry, and archers or crossbowmen, with about equal numbers of cavalry and archers and the foot soldiers equal in number to the other two types combined. Later lists of <a href="companions%20of%20William%20the%20Conqueror">companions of William the Conqueror</a> are extant, but most are padded with extra names; only about 35 named individuals can be reliably identified as having been with William at Hastings.

The main armour used was <a href="chainmail">chainmail</a> hauberks, usually knee-length, with slits to allow riding, some with sleeves to the elbows. Some hauberks may have been made of scales attached to a tunic, with the scales made of metal, horn or hardened leather. Headgear was usually a conical metal helmet with a band of metal extending down to protect the nose. Horsemen and infantry carried shields. The infantryman's shield was usually round and made of wood, with reinforcement of metal. Horsemen had changed to a kite-shaped shield and were usually armed with a lance. The couched lance, carried tucked against the body under the right arm, was a relatively new refinement and was probably not used at Hastings; the terrain was unfavourable for long cavalry charges. Both the infantry and cavalry usually fought with a straight sword, long and double-edged. The infantry could also use javelins and long spears. Some of the cavalry may have used a mace instead of a sword. Archers would have used a <a href="self%20bow">self bow</a> or a crossbow, and most would not have had armour.

After defeating his brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada in the north, Harold left much of his forces in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest of his army south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion. It is unclear when Harold learned of William's landing, but it was probably while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London, and was there for about a week before Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about per day, for the approximately . Harold camped at Caldbec Hill on the night of 13 October, near what was described as a "hoar-apple tree". This location was about from William's castle at Hastings. Some of the early contemporary French accounts mention an emissary or emissaries sent by Harold to William, which is likely. Nothing came of these efforts.

Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy. Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of <a href="Senlac%20Hill">Senlac Hill</a> (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about from William's castle at Hastings.

The exact number of soldiers in Harold's army is unknown. The contemporary records do not give reliable figures; some Norman sources give 400,000 to 1,200,000 men on Harold's side. The English sources generally give very low figures for Harold's army, perhaps to make the English defeat seem less devastating. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5,000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, and most modern historians argue for a figure of 7,000–8,000 English troops. These men would have been a mix of the "fyrd" and housecarls. Few individual Englishmen are known to have been at Hastings; about 20 named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including Harold's brothers <a href="Gyrth">Gyrth</a> and <a href="Leofwine%20Godwinson">Leofwine</a> and two other relatives.

The English army consisted entirely of infantry. It is possible that some of the higher class members of the army rode to battle, but when battle was joined they dismounted to fight on foot. The core of the army was made up of housecarls, full-time professional soldiers. Their armour consisted of a conical helmet, a <a href="Mail%20%28armour%29">mail</a> <a href="hauberk">hauberk</a>, and a shield, which might be either kite-shaped or round. Most housecarls fought with the two-handed <a href="Dane%20Axe">Danish battleaxe</a>, but they could also carry a sword. The rest of the army was made up of levies from the "fyrd", also infantry but more lightly armoured and not professionals. Most of the infantry would have formed part of the <a href="shield%20wall">shield wall</a>, in which all the men in the front ranks locked their shields together. Behind them would have been axemen and men with javelins as well as archers.

Because many of the primary accounts contradict each other at times, it is impossible to provide a description of the battle that is beyond dispute. The only undisputed facts are that the fighting began at 9 am on Saturday 14 October 1066 and that the battle lasted until dusk. Sunset on the day of the battle was at 4:54 pm, with the battlefield mostly dark by 5:54 pm and in full darkness by 6:24 pm. Moonrise that night was not until 11:12 pm, so once the sun set, there was little light on the battlefield. <a href="William%20of%20Jumi%C3%A8ges">William of Jumièges</a> reports that Duke William kept his army armed and ready against a surprise night attack for the entire night before. The battle took place north of Hastings at the present-day town of <a href="Battle%2C%20East%20Sussex">Battle</a>, between two hills – Caldbec Hill to the north and Telham Hill to the south. The area was heavily wooded, with a marsh nearby. The name traditionally given to the battle is unusual – there were several settlements much closer to the battlefield than Hastings. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" called it the battle "at the hoary apple tree". Within 40 years, the battle was described by the Anglo-Norman chronicler <a href="Orderic%20Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a> as "Senlac", a Norman-French adaptation of the Old English word "Sandlacu", which means "sandy water". This may have been the name of the stream that crosses the battlefield. The battle was already being referred to as "bellum Hasestingas" or "Battle of Hastings" by 1087, in the "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>".

Sunrise was at 6:48 am that morning, and reports of the day record that it was unusually bright. The weather conditions are not recorded. The route that the English army took to the battlefield is not known precisely. Several roads are possible: one, an old Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings has long been favoured because of a large coin hoard found nearby in 1876. Another possibility is a Roman road between London and Lewes and then over local tracks to the battlefield. Some accounts of the battle indicate that the Normans advanced from Hastings to the battlefield, but the contemporary account of William of Jumièges places the Normans at the site of the battle the night before. Most historians incline towards the former view, but M. K. Lawson argues that William of Jumièges's account is correct.

Harold's forces deployed in a small, dense formation at the top of steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to provide protection from attack. Sources differ on the exact site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.

More is known about the Norman deployment. Duke William appears to have arranged his forces in three groups, or "battles", which roughly corresponded to their origins. The left units were the <a href="Breton%20people">Bretons</a>, along with those from <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a>, <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a> and <a href="Maine%20%28province%29">Maine</a>. This division was led by <a href="Alan%20Rufus">Alan the Red</a>, a relative of the Breton count. The centre was held by the Normans, under the direct command of the duke and with many of his relatives and kinsmen grouped around the ducal party. The final division, on the right, consisted of the Frenchmen, along with some men from <a href="Picardy">Picardy</a>, <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a>, and <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a>. The right was commanded by <a href="William%20fitzOsbern">William fitzOsbern</a> and Count <a href="Eustace%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Boulogne">Eustace II of Boulogne</a>. The front lines were made up of archers, with a line of foot soldiers armed with spears behind. There were probably a few crossbowmen and slingers in with the archers. The cavalry was held in reserve, and a small group of clergymen and servants situated at the base of Telham Hill was not expected to take part in the fighting.

William's disposition of his forces implies that he planned to open the battle with archers in the front rank weakening the enemy with arrows, followed by infantry who would engage in close combat. The infantry would create openings in the English lines that could be exploited by a cavalry charge to break through the English forces and pursue the fleeing soldiers.

The battle opened with the Norman archers shooting uphill at the English shield wall, to little effect. The uphill angle meant that the arrows either bounced off the shields of the English or overshot their targets and flew over the top of the hill. The lack of English archers hampered the Norman archers, as there were few English arrows to be gathered up and reused. After the attack from the archers, William sent the spearmen forward to attack the English. They were met with a barrage of missiles, not arrows but spears, axes and stones. The infantry was unable to force openings in the shield wall, and the cavalry advanced in support. The cavalry also failed to make headway, and a general retreat began, blamed on the Breton division on William's left. A rumour started that the duke had been killed, which added to the confusion. The English forces began to pursue the fleeing invaders, but William rode through his forces, showing his face and yelling that he was still alive. The duke then led a counter-attack against the pursuing English forces; some of the English rallied on a hillock before being overwhelmed.

It is not known whether the English pursuit was ordered by Harold or if it was spontaneous. Wace relates that Harold ordered his men to stay in their formations but no other account gives this detail. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the death of Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine occurring just before the fight around the hillock. This may mean that the two brothers led the pursuit. The "<a href="Carmen%20de%20Hastingae%20Proelio">Carmen de Hastingae Proelio</a>" relates a different story for the death of Gyrth, stating that the duke slew Harold's brother in combat, perhaps thinking that Gyrth was Harold. William of Poitiers states that the bodies of Gyrth and Leofwine were found near Harold's, implying that they died late in the battle. It is possible that if the two brothers died early in the fighting their bodies were taken to Harold, thus accounting for their being found near his body after the battle. The military historian Peter Marren speculates that if Gyrth and Leofwine died early in the battle, that may have influenced Harold to stand and fight to the end.

A lull probably occurred early in the afternoon, and a break for rest and food would probably have been needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.

Although the feigned flights did not break the lines, they probably thinned out the housecarls in the English shield wall. The housecarls were replaced with members of the "fyrd", and the shield wall held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by the duke. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to shoot at a high angle to shoot over the front of the shield wall, there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon's fighting. The "Carmen" claims that Duke William had two horses killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers's account states that it was three.

Harold appears to have died late in the battle, although accounts in the various sources are contradictory. William of Poitiers only mentions his death, without giving any details on how it occurred. The Tapestry is not helpful, as it shows a figure holding an arrow sticking out of his eye next to a falling fighter being hit with a sword. Over both figures is a statement "Here King Harold has been killed". It is not clear which figure is meant to be Harold, or if both are meant. The earliest written mention of the traditional account of Harold dying from an arrow to the eye dates to the 1080s from a history of the Normans written by an Italian monk, <a href="Amatus%20of%20Montecassino">Amatus of Montecassino</a>. William of Malmesbury stated that Harold died from an arrow to the eye that went into the brain, and that a knight wounded Harold at the same time. Wace repeats the arrow-to-the-eye account. The "Carmen" states that Duke William killed Harold, but this is unlikely, as such a feat would have been recorded elsewhere. The account of William of Jumièges is even more unlikely, as it has Harold dying in the morning, during the first fighting. The "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Battle%20Abbey">Chronicle of Battle Abbey</a>" states that no one knew who killed Harold, as it happened in the press of battle. A modern biographer of Harold, Ian Walker, states that Harold probably died from an arrow in the eye, although he also says it is possible that Harold was struck down by a Norman knight while mortally wounded in the eye. Another biographer of Harold, Peter Rex, after discussing the various accounts, concludes that it is not possible to declare how Harold died.

Harold's death left the English forces leaderless, and they began to collapse. Many of them fled, but the soldiers of the royal household gathered around Harold's body and fought to the end. The Normans began to pursue the fleeing troops, and except for a rearguard action at a site known as the "Malfosse", the battle was over. Exactly what happened at the Malfosse, or "Evil Ditch", and where it took place, is unclear. It occurred at a small fortification or set of trenches where some Englishmen rallied and seriously wounded Eustace of Boulogne before being defeated by the Normans.

Harold's defeat was probably due to several circumstances. One was the need to defend against two almost simultaneous invasions. The fact that Harold had dismissed his forces in southern England on 8 September also contributed to the defeat. Many historians fault Harold for hurrying south and not gathering more forces before confronting William at Hastings, although it is not clear that the English forces were insufficient to deal with William's forces. Against these arguments for an exhausted English army, the length of the battle, which lasted an entire day, shows that the English forces were not tired by their long march. Tied in with the speed of Harold's advance to Hastings is the possibility Harold may not have trusted Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria once their enemy Tostig had been defeated, and declined to bring them and their forces south. Modern historians have pointed out that one reason for Harold's rush to battle was to contain William's depredations and keep him from breaking free of his beachhead.

Most of the blame for the defeat probably lies in the events of the battle. William was the more experienced military leader, and in addition the lack of cavalry on the English side allowed Harold fewer tactical options. Some writers have criticised Harold for not exploiting the opportunity offered by the rumoured death of William early in the battle. The English appear to have erred in not staying strictly on the defensive, for when they pursued the retreating Normans they exposed their flanks to attack. Whether this was due to the inexperience of the English commanders or the indiscipline of the English soldiers is unclear. In the end, Harold's death appears to have been decisive, as it signalled the break-up of the English forces in disarray. The historian <a href="David%20Nicolle">David Nicolle</a> said of the battle that William's army "demonstrated – not without difficulty – the superiority of Norman-French mixed cavalry and infantry tactics over the Germanic-Scandinavian infantry traditions of the Anglo-Saxons."

The day after the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or marks on his body. His personal standard was presented to William, and later sent to the papacy. The bodies of the English dead, including some of Harold's brothers and housecarls, were left on the battlefield, although some were removed by relatives later. The Norman dead were buried in a large communal grave, which has not been found. Exact casualty figures are unknown. Of the Englishmen known to be at the battle, the number of dead implies that the death rate was about 50 per cent of those engaged, although this may be too high. Of the named Normans who fought at Hastings, one in seven is stated to have died, but these were all noblemen, and it is probable that the death rate among the common soldiers was higher. Although Orderic Vitalis's figures are highly exaggerated, his ratio of one in four casualties may be accurate. Marren speculates that perhaps 2,000 Normans and 4,000 Englishmen were killed at Hastings. Reports stated that some of the English dead were still being found on the hillside years later. Although scholars thought for a long time that remains would not be recoverable, due to the acidic soil, recent finds have changed this view. One skeleton that was found in a medieval cemetery, and originally was thought to be associated with the 13th century <a href="Battle%20of%20Lewes">Battle of Lewes</a> now is thought to be associated with Hastings instead.

One story relates that <a href="Gytha%20Thorkelsd%C3%B3ttir">Gytha</a>, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but was refused. William ordered that Harold's body be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Another story relates that Harold was buried at the top of a cliff. <a href="Waltham%20Abbey%20%28abbey%29">Waltham Abbey</a>, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there. Other legends claimed that Harold did not die at Hastings, but escaped and became a hermit at Chester.

William expected to receive the submission of the surviving English leaders after his victory, but instead <a href="Edgar%20the%20%C3%86theling">Edgar the Ætheling</a> was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, with the support of Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and <a href="Ealdred%20%28bishop%29">Ealdred</a>, the Archbishop of York. William therefore advanced on London, marching around the coast of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. He defeated an English force that attacked him at <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a> but was unable to storm <a href="London%20Bridge">London Bridge</a>, forcing him to reach the capital by a more circuitous route.

William moved up the <a href="Thames">Thames</a> valley to cross the river at <a href="Wallingford%2C%20Oxfordshire">Wallingford</a>, where he received the submission of Stigand. He then travelled north-east along the <a href="Chilterns">Chilterns</a>, before advancing towards London from the north-west, fighting further engagements against forces from the city. The English leaders surrendered to William at <a href="Berkhamsted">Berkhamsted</a>, Hertfordshire. William was acclaimed King of England and crowned by Ealdred on 25 December 1066, in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

Despite the submission of the English nobles, resistance continued for several years. There were rebellions in Exeter in late 1067, an invasion by Harold's sons in mid-1068, and an uprising in Northumbria in 1068. In 1069 William faced more troubles from Northumbrian rebels, an invading Danish fleet, and rebellions in the south and west of England. He ruthlessly put down the various risings, culminating in the <a href="Harrying%20of%20the%20North">Harrying of the North</a> in late 1069 and early 1070 that devastated parts of northern England. A further rebellion in 1070 by <a href="Hereward%20the%20Wake">Hereward the Wake</a> was also defeated by the king, at Ely.

<a href="Battle%20Abbey">Battle Abbey</a> was founded by William at the site of the battle. According to 12th-century sources, William made a vow to found the abbey, and the high altar of the church was placed at the site where Harold had died. More likely, the foundation was imposed on William by <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>s in 1070. The topography of the battlefield has been altered by subsequent construction work for the abbey, and the slope defended by the English is now much less steep than it was at the time of the battle; the top of the ridge has also been built up and levelled. After the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a>, the abbey's lands passed to secular landowners, who used it as a residence or country house. In 1976 the estate was put up for sale and purchased by the government with the aid of some American donors who wished to honour the 200th anniversary of American independence. The battlefield and abbey grounds are currently owned and administered by <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> and are open to the public. The <a href="Bayeux%20Tapestry">Bayeux Tapestry</a> is an embroidered narrative of the events leading up to Hastings probably commissioned by Odo of Bayeux soon after the battle, perhaps to hang at the bishop's palace at Bayeux. In modern times annual <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings%20reenactment">reenactments</a> of the Battle of Hastings have drawn thousands of participants and spectators to the site of the original battle.

William of Tyre

William of Tyre (; 1130 – 29 September 1186) was a <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> <a href="prelate">prelate</a> and <a href="chronicler">chronicler</a>. As <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Tyre">archbishop of Tyre</a>, he is sometimes known as William II to distinguish him from his predecessor, William I, the Englishman and former Prior of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, who was Archbishop of Tyre from 1127 to 1135. He grew up in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> at the height of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>, which had been established in 1099 after the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>, and he spent twenty years studying the <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> and <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> in the <a href="Medieval%20university">universities of Europe</a>.

Following William's return to Jerusalem in 1165, King <a href="Amalric%20of%20Jerusalem">Amalric</a> made him an ambassador to the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. William became tutor to the king's son, the future King <a href="Baldwin%20IV%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin IV</a>, whom William discovered to be a <a href="leprosy">leper</a>. After Amalric's death, William became <a href="Officers%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">chancellor</a> and archbishop of Tyre, two of the highest offices in the kingdom, and in 1179 William led the eastern delegation to the <a href="Third%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Third Council of the Lateran</a>. As he was involved in the dynastic struggle that developed during Baldwin IV's reign, his importance waned when a rival faction gained control of royal affairs. He was passed over for the prestigious <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Patriarchate of Jerusalem</a>, and died in obscurity, probably in 1186.

William wrote an account of the Lateran Council and a history of the Islamic states from the time of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>. Neither work survives. He is famous today as the author of a history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. William composed his <a href="chronicle">chronicle</a> in excellent Latin for his time, with numerous quotations from <a href="classical%20literature">classical literature</a>. The chronicle is sometimes given the title "Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum" ("History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea") or "Historia Ierosolimitana" ("History of Jerusalem"), or the "Historia" for short. It was translated into French soon after his death, and thereafter into numerous other languages. Because it is the only source for the history of twelfth-century Jerusalem written by a native, historians have often assumed that William's statements could be taken at face value. However, more recent historians have shown that William's involvement in the kingdom's political disputes resulted in detectable biases in his account. Despite this, he is considered the greatest chronicler of the crusades, and one of the best authors of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>.

The Kingdom of Jerusalem was founded in 1099 at the end of the First Crusade. It was the third of four <a href="Crusader%20states">Christian territories</a> to be established by the crusaders, following the <a href="County%20of%20Edessa">County of Edessa</a> and the <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">Principality of Antioch</a>, and followed by the <a href="County%20of%20Tripoli">County of Tripoli</a>. Jerusalem's first three rulers, <a href="Godfrey%20of%20Bouillon">Godfrey of Bouillon</a> (1099–1100), his brother <a href="Baldwin%20I%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin I</a> (1100–1118), and their cousin <a href="Baldwin%20II%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin II</a> (1118–1131), expanded and secured the kingdom's borders, which encompassed roughly the same territory as modern-day <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="Palestinian%20territories">Palestine</a>, and <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. During the kingdom's early decades, the population was swelled by pilgrims visiting the holiest sites of Christendom. Merchants from the Mediterranean city-states of <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="France">France</a> were eager to exploit the rich trade markets of the east.

William's family probably originated in either France or Italy, since he was very familiar with both countries. His parents were likely merchants who had settled in the kingdom and were "apparently well-to-do", although it is unknown whether they participated in the First Crusade or arrived later. William was born in Jerusalem around 1130. He had at least one brother, Ralph, who was one of the city's <a href="burgess%20%28title%29">burgesses</a>, a non-noble leader of the merchant community. Nothing more is known about his family, except that his mother died before 1165.

As a child William was educated in Jerusalem, at the <a href="cathedral%20school">cathedral school</a> in the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</a>. The "scholaster", or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first introduced him to <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. From the "Historia" it is clear that he also knew <a href="French%20language">French</a> and possibly <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, but there is not enough evidence to determine whether he learned <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>, and <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>, as is sometimes claimed.

Around 1145 William went to Europe to continue his education in the schools of France and Italy, especially in those of <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, "the two most important intellectual centers of twelfth-century Christendom." These schools were not yet the official <a href="medieval%20university">universities</a> that they would become in the 13th century, but by the end of the 11th century both had numerous schools for the arts and sciences. They were separate from the cathedral schools, and were established by independent professors who were masters of their field of study. Students from all over Europe gathered there to hear lectures from these masters. William studied <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> and <a href="theology">theology</a> in <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Orl%C3%A9ans">Orléans</a> for about ten years, with professors who had been students of <a href="Thierry%20of%20Chartres">Thierry of Chartres</a> and <a href="Gilbert%20de%20la%20Porr%C3%A9e">Gilbert de la Porrée</a>. He also spent time studying under <a href="Robert%20of%20Melun">Robert of Melun</a> and <a href="Adam%20de%20Parvo%20Ponte">Adam de Parvo Ponte</a>, among others. In Orléans, one of the pre-eminent centres of classical studies, he read ancient Roman literature (known simply as "the Authors") with <a href="Hilarius%20%28poet%29">Hilary of Orléans</a>, and learned <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> ("especially <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a>") with <a href="William%20of%20Soissons">William of Soissons</a>. For six years, he studied theology with <a href="Peter%20Lombard">Peter Lombard</a> and <a href="Maurice%20de%20Sully">Maurice de Sully</a>. Afterwards, he studied <a href="Civil%20law%20%28common%20law%29">civil law</a> and <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> in <a href="University%20of%20Bologna">Bologna</a>, with the "<a href="Four%20Doctors%20of%20Bologna">Four Doctors</a>", <a href="Hugo%20de%20Porta%20Ravennate">Hugo de Porta Ravennate</a>, <a href="Bulgarus">Bulgarus</a>, <a href="Martinus%20Gosia">Martinus Gosia</a>, and <a href="Jacobus%20de%20Boragine">Jacobus de Boragine</a>. William's list of professors "gives us almost a who's who of the grammarians, philosophers, theologians, and law teachers of the so-called <a href="Twelfth-Century%20Renaissance">Twelfth-Century Renaissance</a>", and shows that he was as well-educated as any European cleric. His contemporary <a href="John%20of%20Salisbury">John of Salisbury</a> had many of the same teachers.

The highest religious and political offices in Jerusalem were usually held by Europeans who had arrived on pilgrimage or crusade. William was one of the few natives with a European education, and he quickly rose through the ranks. After his return to the Holy Land in 1165, he became <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of the cathedral at <a href="Acre%20%28city%29">Acre</a>. In 1167 he was appointed <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> of the cathedral of <a href="Tyre%20%28Lebanon%29">Tyre</a> by <a href="Frederick%20de%20la%20Roche">Frederick de la Roche</a>, archbishop of Tyre, with the support of King <a href="Amalric%20of%20Jerusalem">Amalric</a>.

Amalric had come to power in 1164 and had made it his goal to <a href="Crusader%20invasions%20of%20Egypt">conquer Egypt</a>. <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> had been invaded by King Baldwin I fifty years earlier, and the weak <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimid Caliphate</a> was forced to pay yearly tribute to Jerusalem. Amalric turned towards Egypt because Muslim territory to the east of Jerusalem had fallen under the control of the powerful <a href="Zengid%20dynasty">Zengid</a> sultan <a href="Nur%20ad-Din%20Zangi">Nur ad-Din</a>. Nur ad-Din had taken control of <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> in 1154, six years after the disastrous <a href="Siege%20of%20Damascus%20%281148%29">siege of Damascus</a> by the <a href="Second%20Crusade">Second Crusade</a> in 1148. Jerusalem could now expand only to the southwest, towards Egypt, and in 1153 <a href="Ashkelon">Ascalon</a>, the last Fatimid outpost in Palestine, <a href="Siege%20of%20Ascalon">fell to the crusaders</a>. Nur ad-Din, however, also wished to acquire Egypt, and sent his army to hinder Amalric's plans. This was the situation in the east when William returned from Europe. In 1167 Amalric married <a href="Maria%20Comnena%2C%20queen%20consort%20of%20Jerusalem">Maria Comnena</a>, grand-niece of <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Manuel%20I%20Comnenus">Manuel I Comnenus</a>, and in 1168 the king sent William to finalize a treaty for a joint Byzantine-crusader campaign against Egypt. The expedition, Amalric's fourth, was the first with support from the <a href="Byzantine%20navy">Byzantine navy</a>. Amalric, however, did not wait for the fleet to arrive. He managed to capture <a href="Damietta">Damietta</a>, but within a few years he was expelled from Egypt by one of Nur ad-Din's generals, <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>, who would later become Jerusalem's greatest threat.

Meanwhile, William continued his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, the charge is unknown. It is also possible that while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop's assistance.

On his return from Rome in 1170 he may have been commissioned by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom. He also became the tutor of Amalric's son and heir, <a href="Baldwin%20IV%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin IV</a>. When Baldwin was thirteen years old, he was playing with some children, who were trying to cause each other pain by scratching each other's arms. "The other boys gave evidence of pain by their outcries," wrote William, "but Baldwin, although his comrades did not spare him, endured it altogether too patiently, as if he felt nothing  ...  It is impossible to refrain from tears while speaking of this great misfortune." William inspected Baldwin's arms and recognized the possible symptoms of <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a>, which was confirmed as Baldwin grew older.

Amalric died in 1174, and Baldwin IV succeeded him as king. Nur ad-Din also died in 1174, and his general Saladin spent the rest of the decade consolidating his hold on both Egypt and Nur ad-Din's possessions in Syria, which allowed him to completely encircle Jerusalem. The subsequent events have often been interpreted as a struggle between two opposing factions, a "court party" and a "noble party." The "court party" was led by Baldwin's mother, Amalric's first wife <a href="Agnes%20of%20Courtenay">Agnes of Courtenay</a>, and her <a href="House%20of%20Courtenay">immediate family</a>, as well as recent arrivals from Europe who were inexperienced in the affairs of the kingdom and were in favour of war with Saladin. The "noble party" was led by <a href="Raymond%20III%20of%20Tripoli">Raymond III of Tripoli</a> and the native nobility of the kingdom, who favoured peaceful co-existence with the Muslims. This is the interpretation offered by William himself in the "Historia", and it was taken as fact by later historians. Peter W. Edbury, however, has more recently argued that William must be considered extremely partisan as he was naturally allied with Raymond, who was responsible for his later advancement in political and religious offices. The accounts of the 13th-century authors who continued the "Historia" in French must also be considered suspect, as they were allied to Raymond's supporters in the <a href="Ibelin%20family">Ibelin family</a>. The general consensus among recent historians is that although there was a dynastic struggle, "the division was not between native barons and newcomers from the West, but between the king's maternal and paternal kin."

<a href="Miles%20of%20Plancy">Miles of Plancy</a> briefly held the regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles was assassinated in October 1174, and Raymond III was soon appointed to replace him. Raymond named William <a href="Officers%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">chancellor of Jerusalem</a>, as well as archdeacon of <a href="Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, who had died in October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the <a href="chancery%20%28medieval%20office%29">chancery</a> drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for <a href="William%20of%20Montferrat%2C%20Count%20of%20Jaffa%20and%20Ascalon">William of Montferrat</a>, husband of Baldwin IV's sister <a href="Sibylla%20of%20Jerusalem">Sibylla</a>, when the <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">patriarch of Jerusalem</a>, <a href="Amalric%20of%20Nesle">Amalric of Nesle</a>, was too sick to attend.

In 1179, William was one of the delegates from Jerusalem and the other crusader states at the <a href="Third%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Third Lateran Council</a>; among the others were <a href="Patriarch%20Heraclius%20of%20Jerusalem">Heraclius</a>, <a href="archbishop%20of%20Caesarea">archbishop of Caesarea</a>, <a href="Joscius%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Tyre">Joscius</a>, <a href="Latin%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Acre">bishop of Acre</a> and William's future successor in Tyre, the bishops of <a href="Sebastia%2C%20Nablus">Sebastea</a>, <a href="Titular%20see%20of%20Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a>, <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripoli</a>, and <a href="Jabala">Jabala</a>, and the abbot of <a href="Mount%20Zion">Mount Sion</a>. Patriarch Amalric and <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Antioch">Patriarch of Antioch</a> <a href="Aimery%20of%20Limoges">Aimery of Limoges</a> were unable to attend, and William and the other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Pope Alexander III</a> of the need for a new crusade. William was, however, sent by Alexander as an ambassador to Emperor Manuel, and Manuel then sent him on a mission to the <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">Principality of Antioch</a>. William does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies, but he probably discussed the Byzantine alliance with Jerusalem, and Manuel's protectorate over Antioch, where, due to pressure from Rome and Jerusalem, the emperor was forced to give up his attempts to restore a <a href="Greek%20Patriarch%20of%20Antioch">Greek patriarch</a>. William was absent from Jerusalem for two years, returning home in 1180.

During William's absence a crisis had developed in Jerusalem. King Baldwin had reached the <a href="age%20of%20majority">age of majority</a> in 1176 and Raymond III had been removed from the regency, but as a leper Baldwin could have no children and could not be expected to rule much longer. After the death of William of Montferrat in 1177, King Baldwin's widowed sister Sibylla required a new husband. At Easter in 1180, the two factions were divided even further when Raymond and his cousin <a href="Bohemond%20III%20of%20Antioch">Bohemond III of Antioch</a> attempted to force Sibylla to marry <a href="Baldwin%20of%20Ibelin">Baldwin of Ibelin</a>. Raymond and Bohemond were King Baldwin's nearest male relatives in the paternal line, and could have claimed the throne if the king died without an heir or a suitable replacement. Before Raymond and Bohemond arrived, however, Agnes and King Baldwin arranged for Sibylla to be married to a <a href="Poitou">Poitevin</a> newcomer, <a href="Guy%20of%20Lusignan">Guy of Lusignan</a>, whose older brother <a href="Aimery%20of%20Jerusalem">Aimery of Lusignan</a> was already an established figure at court.

The dispute affected William, since he had been appointed chancellor by Raymond and may have fallen out of favour after Raymond was removed from the regency. When Patriarch Amalric died on 6 October 1180, the two most obvious choices for his successor were William and Heraclius of Caesarea. They were fairly evenly matched in background and education, but politically they were allied with opposite parties, as Heraclius was one of Agnes of Courtenay's supporters. It seems that the canons of the Holy Sepulchre were unable to decide, and asked the king for advice; due to Agnes' influence, Heraclius was elected. There were rumours that Agnes and Heraclius were lovers, but this information comes from the partisan 13th-century continuations of the "Historia", and there is no other evidence to substantiate such a claim. William himself says almost nothing about the election and Heraclius' character or his subsequent patriarchate, probably reflecting his disappointment at the outcome.

William remained archbishop of Tyre and chancellor of the kingdom, but the details of his life at this time are obscure. The 13th-century <a href="continuator">continuator</a>s claim that Heraclius excommunicated William in 1183, but it is unknown why Heraclius would have done this. They also claim that William went to Rome to appeal to the Pope, where Heraclius had him poisoned. According to Peter Edbury and John Rowe, the obscurity of William's life during these years shows that he did not play a large political role, but concentrated on ecclesiastical affairs and the writing of his history. The story of his excommunication, and the unlikely detail that he was poisoned, were probably an invention of the Old French continuators. William remained in the kingdom and continued to write up until 1184, but by then Jerusalem was internally divided by political factions and externally surrounded by the forces of Saladin, and "the only subjects that present themselves are the disasters of a sorrowing country and its manifold misfortunes, themes which can serve only to draw forth lamentations and tears."

His importance had dwindled with the victory of Agnes and her supporters, and with the accession of <a href="Baldwin%20V%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin V</a>, infant son of Sibylla and William of Montferrat. Baldwin was a sickly child and he died the next year. In 1186 he was succeeded by his mother Sibylla and her second husband Guy of Lusignan, ruling jointly. William was probably in failing health by this point. Rudolf Hiestand discovered that the date of William's death was 29 September, but the year was not recorded; whatever the year, there was a new chancellor in May 1185 and a new archbishop of Tyre by 21 October 1186. <a href="Hans%20E.%20Mayer">Hans E. Mayer</a> concluded that William died in 1186, and this is the year generally accepted by scholars.

William's foresight about the misfortunes of his country was proven correct less than a year later. Saladin defeated King Guy at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hattin">Battle of Hattin</a> in 1187, and went on to <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%281187%29">capture Jerusalem</a> and almost every other city of the kingdom, except the seat of William's archdiocese, Tyre. News of the fall of Jerusalem shocked Europe and plans were made to send assistance. According to <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a>, William was present at <a href="Gisors">Gisors</a> in France in 1188 when <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> and <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II of France</a> agreed to <a href="Third%20Crusade">go on crusade</a>: "Thereupon the king of the English first took the sign of the cross at the hands of the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Rheims">Archbishop of Rheims</a> and William of Tyre, the latter of whom had been entrusted by our lord the pope with the office of legate in the affairs of the crusade in the western part of Europe." Roger was however mistaken; he knew that an unnamed archbishop of Tyre was present and assumed it must have been the William whose chronicle he possessed, although the archbishop in question was actually William's successor <a href="Joscius%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Tyre">Joscius</a>.

William reports that he wrote an account of the Third Council of the Lateran, which does not survive. He also wrote a history of the Holy Land from the time of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> up to 1184, for which he used <a href="Eutychius%20of%20Alexandria">Eutychius of Alexandria</a> as his main source. This work seems to have been known in Europe in the 13th century but it also does not survive. <a href="August%20C.%20Krey">August C. Krey</a> thought William's Arabic sources may have come from the library of the Damascene diplomat <a href="Usama%20ibn%20Munqidh">Usama ibn Munqidh</a>, whose library was looted by Baldwin III from a shipwreck in 1154. Alan V. Murray, however, has argued that, at least for the accounts of Persia and the Turks in his chronicle, William relied on Biblical and earlier medieval legends rather than actual history, and his knowledge "may be less indicative of eastern ethnography than of western mythography."

William's great work is a Latin chronicle, written between 1170 and 1184. It contains twenty-three books; the final book, which deals with the events of 1183 and the beginning of 1184, has only a prologue and one chapter, so it is either unfinished or the rest of the pages were lost before the whole chronicle began to be copied. The first book begins with the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Syria">conquest of Syria</a> by <a href="Umar">Umar</a> in the seventh century, but otherwise the work deals with the advent of the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a> and the subsequent political history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is arranged, but was not written, chronologically; the first sections to be written were probably the chapters about the invasion of Egypt in 1167, which are extremely detailed and were likely composed before the Fatimid dynasty was overthrown in 1171. Much of the "Historia" was finished before William left to attend the Lateran Council, but new additions and corrections were made after his return in 1180, perhaps because he now realized that European readers would also be interested in the history of the kingdom. In 1184 he wrote the Prologue and the beginning of the twenty-third book.

William had access to the chronicles of the First Crusade, including <a href="Fulcher%20of%20Chartres">Fulcher of Chartres</a>, <a href="Albert%20of%20Aix">Albert of Aix</a>, <a href="Raymond%20of%20Aguilers">Raymond of Aguilers</a>, <a href="Baldric%20of%20Dol">Baldric of Dol</a>, and the "<a href="Gesta%20Francorum">Gesta Francorum</a>", as well as other documents located in the kingdom's archives. He used <a href="Walter%20the%20Chancellor">Walter the Chancellor</a> and other now-lost works for the history of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">Principality of Antioch</a>. From the end of Fulcher's chronicle in 1127, William is the only source of information from an author living in Jerusalem. For events that happened in William's own lifetime, he interviewed older people who had witnessed the events about which he was writing, and drew on his own memory.

William's classical education allowed him to compose Latin superior to that of many medieval writers. He used numerous ancient Roman and early Christian authors, either for quotations or as inspiration for the framework and organization of the "Historia". His vocabulary is almost entirely classical, with only a few medieval constructions such as "loricator" (someone who makes armour, a <a href="calque">calque</a> of the Arabic "zarra") and "assellare" (to empty one's bowels). He was capable of clever word-play and advanced <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>al devices, but he was prone to repetition of a number of words and phrases. His writing also shows phrasing and spelling which is unusual or unknown in purely classical Latin but not uncommon in <a href="medieval%20Latin">medieval Latin</a>, such as:

Despite his quotations from Christian authors and from the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, William did not place much emphasis on the intervention of God in human affairs, resulting in a somewhat "secular" history. Nevertheless, he included much information that is clearly legendary, especially when referring to the First Crusade, which even in his own day was already considered an age of great Christian heroes. Expanding on the accounts of Albert of Aix, <a href="Peter%20the%20Hermit">Peter the Hermit</a> is given prominence in the preaching of the First Crusade, to the point that it was he, not <a href="Pope%20Urban%20II">Pope Urban II</a>, who originally conceived the crusade. Godfrey of Bouillon, the first ruler of crusader Jerusalem, was also depicted as the leader of the crusade from the beginning, and William attributed to him legendary strength and virtue. This reflected the almost mythological status that Godfrey and the other first crusaders held for the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the late twelfth century.

William gave a more nuanced picture of the kings of his own day. He claimed to have been commissioned to write by King Amalric himself, but William did not allow himself to praise the king excessively; for example, Amalric did not respect the rights of the church, and although he was a good military commander, he could not stop the increasing threat from the neighbouring Muslim states. On a personal level, William admired the king's education and his interest in history and law, but also noted that Amalric had "breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist" and was shocked when the king questioned the <a href="resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">resurrection of the dead</a>.

About Amalric's son Baldwin IV, however, "there was no ambiguity". Baldwin was nothing but heroic in the face of his debilitating leprosy, and he led military campaigns against Saladin even while still underaged; William tends to gloss over campaigns where Baldwin was not actually in charge, preferring to direct his praise towards the afflicted king rather than subordinate commanders. William's history can be seen as an "<a href="apologia">apologia</a>", a literary defense, for the kingdom, and more specifically for Baldwin's rule. By the 1170s and 1180s, western Europeans were reluctant to support the kingdom, partly because it was far away and there were more pressing concerns in Europe, but also because leprosy was usually considered divine punishment.

William was famously biased against the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>, whom he believed to be arrogant and disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies, as they were not required to pay tithes and were legally accountable only to the Pope. Although he was writing decades later, he is the earliest author to describe the actual foundation of the Templar order. He was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days, but resented the power and influence they held in his own time. William accused them of hindering the <a href="Siege%20of%20Ascalon">Siege of Ascalon</a> in 1153; of poorly defending a cave-fortress in 1165, for which twelve Templars were hanged by King Amalric; of sabotaging the <a href="Crusader%20invasions%20of%20Egypt">invasion of Egypt</a> in 1168; and of murdering <a href="Assassins%20%28sect%29">Assassin</a> ambassadors in 1173.

Compared to other Latin authors of the twelfth century, William is surprisingly favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of <a href="Alexius%20I%20Comnenus">Alexius I Comnenus</a> that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical of some of the crusaders' dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius' son <a href="John%20II%20Comnenus">John II Comnenus</a>; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the "Historia" coincides with the <a href="massacre%20of%20the%20Latins">massacre of the Latins</a> in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of <a href="Andronicus%20I%20Comnenus">Andronicus I Comnenus</a>, and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.

As a medieval Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, but as an educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or completely dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as <a href="Mu%27in%20ad-Din%20Unur">Mu'in ad-Din Unur</a>, Nur ad-Din, <a href="Shirkuh">Shirkuh</a>, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.

After William's death the "Historia" was copied and circulated in the <a href="crusader%20state">crusader state</a>s and was eventually brought to Europe. In the 13th century, <a href="James%20of%20Vitry">James of Vitry</a> had access to a copy while he was bishop of Acre, and it was used by <a href="Guy%20of%20Bazoches">Guy of Bazoches</a>, <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a>, and <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a> in their own chronicles. However, there are only ten known manuscripts that contain the Latin chronicle, all of which come from France and England, so William's work may not have been very widely read in its original form. In England, however, the "Historia" was expanded in Latin, with additional information from the "<a href="Itinerarium%20Regis%20Ricardi">Itinerarium Regis Ricardi</a>", and the chronicle of <a href="Roger%20Hoveden">Roger Hoveden</a>; this version was written around 1220.

It is unknown what title William himself gave his chronicle, although one group of manuscripts uses "Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum" and another uses "Historia Ierosolimitana". The Latin text was printed for the first time in Basel in 1549 by <a href="Nicholas%20Brylinger">Nicholas Brylinger</a>; it was also published in the "Gesta Dei per Francos" by <a href="Jacques%20Bongars">Jacques Bongars</a> in 1611 and the "<a href="Recueil%20des%20historiens%20des%20croisades">Recueil des historiens des croisades</a>" (RHC) by <a href="Auguste-Arthur%20Beugnot">Auguste-Arthur Beugnot</a> and <a href="Auguste%20Le%20Pr%C3%A9vost">Auguste Le Prévost</a> in 1844, and Bongars' text was reprinted in the "<a href="Patrologia%20Latina">Patrologia Latina</a>" by <a href="Jacques%20Paul%20Migne">Jacques Paul Migne</a> in 1855. The now-standard Latin critical edition, based on six of the surviving manuscripts, was published as "Willelmi Tyrensis Archiepiscopi Chronicon" in the "<a href="Corpus%20Christianorum">Corpus Christianorum</a>" in 1986, by R. B. C. Huygens, with notes by <a href="Hans%20E.%20Mayer">Hans E. Mayer</a> and <a href="Gerhard%20R%C3%B6sch">Gerhard Rösch</a>. The RHC edition was translated into English by Emily A. Babcock and August C. Krey in 1943 as "A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea," although the translation is sometimes incomplete or inexact.

A translation of the "Historia" into <a href="Old%20French%20language">Old French</a>, made around 1223, was particularly well-circulated and had many anonymous additions made to it in the 13th century. In contrast to the surviving Latin manuscripts, there are "at least fifty-nine manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts" containing the Old French translation. There are also independent French continuations attributed to <a href="Ernoul">Ernoul</a> and Bernard le Trésorier. The translation was sometimes called the "Livre dou conqueste"; it was known by this name throughout Europe as well as in the crusader <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Cyprus">Kingdom of Cyprus</a> and in <a href="Cilician%20Armenia">Cilician Armenia</a>, and 14th-century Venetian geographer <a href="Marino%20Sanuto%20the%20Elder">Marino Sanuto the Elder</a> had a copy of it. The French was further translated into Spanish, as the "Gran Conquista de Ultramar", during the reign of <a href="Alfonso%20X%20of%20Castile">Alfonso the Wise of Castile</a> in the late 13th century. The French version was so widespread that the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> author <a href="Francesco%20Pipino">Francesco Pipino</a> translated it back into Latin, unaware that a Latin original already existed. A <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> translation of the French was made by <a href="William%20Caxton">William Caxton</a> in the 15th century.

William's neutrality as an historian was often taken for granted until the late twentieth century. August C. Krey, for example, believed that "his impartiality  ...  is scarcely less impressive than his critical skill." Despite this excellent reputation, D. W. T. C. Vessey has shown that William was certainly not an impartial observer, especially when dealing with the events of the 1170s and 1180s. Vessey believes that William's claim to have been commissioned by Amalric is a typical ancient and medieval "<a href="topos">topos</a>", or literary theme, in which a wise ruler, a lover of history and literature, wishes to preserve for posterity the grand deeds of his reign. William's claims of impartiality are also a typical "topos" in ancient and medieval historical writing.

His depiction of Baldwin IV as a hero is an attempt "to vindicate the politics of his own party and to blacken those of its opponents." As mentioned above, William was opposed to Baldwin's mother Agnes of Courtenay, Patriarch Heraclius, and their supporters; his interpretation of events during Baldwin's reign was previously taken as fact almost without question. In the mid twentieth century, Marshall W. Baldwin, <a href="Steven%20Runciman">Steven Runciman</a>, and <a href="Hans%20Eberhard%20Mayer">Hans Eberhard Mayer</a> were influential in perpetuating this point of view, although the more recent re-evaluations of this period by Vessey, <a href="Peter%20Edbury">Peter Edbury</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Hamilton">Bernard Hamilton</a> have undone much of William's influence.

An often-noted flaw in the "Historia" is William's poor memory for dates. "Chronology is sometimes confused, and dates are given wrongly", even for basic information such as the regnal dates of the kings of Jerusalem. For example, William gives the date of Amalric's death as 11 July 1173, when it actually occurred in 1174.

Despite his biases and errors, William "has always been considered one of the greatest medieval writers." Runciman wrote that "he had a broad vision; he understood the significance of the great events of his time and the sequence of cause and effect in history." Christopher Tyerman calls him "the historian's historian", and "the greatest crusade historian of all," and Bernard Hamilton says he "is justly considered one of the finest historians of the Middle Ages". As the "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Dictionary of the Middle Ages</a>" says, "William's achievements in assembling and evaluating sources, and in writing in excellent and original Latin a critical and judicious (if chronologically faulty) narrative, make him an outstanding historian, superior by medieval, and not inferior by modern, standards of scholarship."
