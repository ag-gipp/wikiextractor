Ontario Highway 402

King's Highway 402, commonly referred to as Highway 402 and historically as the Blue Water Bridge Approach, is a <a href="freeway">freeway</a> in the Canadian province of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> that connects the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">international crossing</a> near <a href="Sarnia">Sarnia</a> to <a href="Highway%20401">Highway 401</a> in <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London</a>. It is one of multiple trade links between Ontario and the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a>. Its <a href="400-series%20highways">400-series number</a> denotes a <a href="King%27s%20Highway%20%28Ontario%29">King's Highway</a> with <a href="controlled-access%20highway">controlled access</a>. It is four lanes for much of its length, though the approach to the Blue Water Bridge is six lanes.

Although Highway 402 was one of the original 400-series highways when it was designated in 1953, the freeway originally merged into <a href="Ontario%20Highway%207">Highway 7</a> near the present <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2040">Highway 40</a> interchange in what was, at the time, Sarnia Township. In 1972, construction began to extend Highway 402 from Sarnia to Highway 401 near London thus creating a bypass to Highway 7; construction took over a decade. The final section of the extension, between <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2081">Highway 81</a> and <a href="Ontario%20Highway%202">Highway 2</a>, opened to traffic in 1982. The removal of an intersection at Front Street in Sarnia made the entire route a controlled-access highway.

Motorists crossing into <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> at the western end have direct access to <a href="Interstate%2069%20in%20Michigan">Interstate 69</a> (I-69) and <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">Interstate 94</a> (I-94) into <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a>; motorists crossing onto the Canadian side from the east end of I-69 and I-94 have access to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> via Highway 401, and onwards to <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> via <a href="Quebec%20Autoroute%2020">A-20</a> in <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>. The only town along Highway 402 between Sarnia and London is <a href="Strathroy%2C%20Ontario">Strathroy</a>.

Highway 402 begins on the Canadian side of the Blue Water Bridge, descending over the village of <a href="Point%20Edward%2C%20Ontario">Point Edward</a>. Across the <a href="St.%20Clair%20River">St. Clair River</a>, Highway 402 continues in Michigan as I-69 and I-94. The twin bridge crossing has six lanes of traffic and non-stop freeway access.
This provides a quicker route than the busier <a href="Ambassador%20Bridge">Ambassador Bridge</a> crossing in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Ontario">Windsor</a>, which features over ten traffic lights leading to the four-lane bridge, although that situation is expected to be rectified after the planned <a href="Gordie%20Howe%20International%20Bridge">Gordie Howe International Bridge</a> is constructed. After passing through a <a href="Canada%20Border%20Services%20Agency">customs</a> plaza, it enters Sarnia and travels parallel to and north of Exmouth Street through the city. Although Highway 402 passes through Sarnia, it is not intended to operate as a commuter highway; at Highway 40 and westward all ramps leading to the westbound lanes of the freeway were originally signed as "Bridge To U.S.A." without reference to Highway 402, though these have been replaced in the early 2000s with signs saying "402 West Bridge To U.S.A.".

East of the Murphy Road underpass, the freeway curves to the northeast to bypass its original alignment. It crosses the <a href="Howard%20Watson%20Nature%20Trail">Howard Watson Nature Trail</a>, a mixed-use <a href="rail%20trail">recreational trail</a> that was converted from a <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> (CNR) line in 1988.
The highway curves back to its east–west orientation at an interchange with Highway 40 (Modeland Road). It passes south of <a href="Sarnia%20Chris%20Hadfield%20Airport">Sarnia Chris Hadfield Airport</a> before exiting the city limits at Mandaumin Road (Lambton Road 26).

Now parallel and north of London Line, the former route of Highway 7 (the predecessor route between Sarnia and London),
the freeway jogs north to travel along the back lot line of farmland fronting London Line and the <a href="concession%20road">concession road</a> north of Highway 402.
In this manner, the freeway did not divide any farms when it was constructed, instead running between them. It meets <a href="Lambton%20County%20Road%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B21">Lambton County Road 21</a> (Oil Heritage Road), the northern terminus of the <a href="Oil%20Heritage%20Route">Oil Heritage Route</a>, north of the town of <a href="Wyoming%2C%20Ontario">Wyoming</a>. The <a href="County%20highway%23Canada">county road</a> is also a former southern extension of <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2021">Highway 21</a>, which itself begins as Forest Road to the east. Highway 21 is also known as the <a href="Bluewater%20Route">Bluewater Route</a>, as most of its length is parallel to the shore of <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a>.
After passing an interchange with Forest Road, the freeway is crossed by London Line and momentarily diverges from its straight alignment to dip south of <a href="Warwick%2C%20Ontario">Warwick</a>. It continues east through large patches of farmland, then meets with <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Road%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B81">Middlesex County Road 81</a> (Victoria Street) at an interchange as it passes north of Strathroy.
Shortly thereafter it curves to the southeast and zig-zags towards London, bisecting farms and dividing woodlands. The freeway passes to the west of the town of <a href="Delaware%2C%20Ontario">Delaware</a> and curves east. It enters London and meets interchanges with Colonel Talbot Road south of <a href="Lambeth%2C%20London%2C%20Ontario">Lambeth</a>, as well as with <a href="Wonderland%20Road">Wonderland Road</a> before merging into Highway 401. Access to westbound and from eastbound Highway 401 is provided via Colonel Talbot Road or Highway 4 (Wonderland Road).

The freeway generally uses <a href="Partial_cloverleaf_interchange%23A2_and_B2">Parclo A2 and Parclo B2</a> designs for interchanges. Exceptions include the Front Street interchange in Sarnia, which is a hybrid of a <a href="diamond%20interchange">diamond</a> and <a href="Partial%20cloverleaf%20interchange%23A2%20and%20B2">Parclo B2</a> interchange (previously a Parclo AB2 until the mid-2000s), and the <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2040">Highway 40</a> interchange which is a <a href="Partial%20cloverleaf%20interchange">Parclo B-4</a>. There is presently no interchange using the full six ramp Parclo A4 layout (a common design on other Ontario freeways) on the entirety of Highway 402; although several interchanges do have five ramps, while the junction with Indian Road was previously a Parclo A4 until the directional ramp in the NW quadrant was removed and replaced with a signalized left turn in the late 1990s.

Planning for the route that would become Highway 402 began following the completion of the Blue Water Bridge in 1938. A divided highway was constructed through Sarnia following <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Canada%20during%20World%20War%20II">World War II</a>; it was completed and designated in 1953. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Transportation%20of%20Ontario">Department of Highways</a> announced its intent to extend the route to Highway 401 in 1957. However, while some preliminary work began in the early 1960s, it would take until 1968 for a preferred route to be announced, and until 1972 for construction to begin. Work was carried out through the remainder of the 1970s, and the freeway was completed and ceremonially opened in late 1982. Since completion as a four-lane route, expansion work has been concentrated on the portion of the freeway in Sarnia approaching the border crossing.

Highway 402 is one of the original 400-series highways. It was numbered in 1953, a year after <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20400">Highway 400</a> and Highway 401.
The short <a href="dual%20highway">dual highway</a> was built as an approach to the Blue Water Bridge, which itself opened to traffic October 10, 1938.
As such, the highway was named the Blue Water Bridge Approach. Construction began in 1939. However, like many other road projects, World War II halted construction. In 1947 a new survey was undertaken; construction resumed by 1952. The approach road was opened in 1953, at which point the route was designated Highway 402. It featured an interchange with Christina Street and <a href="at-grade">at-grade</a> intersections with Front Street, Indian Road and Modeland Road (the <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2040">Highway 40</a> Sarnia bypass); after Modeland Road the route continued to London as Highway 7.

Ultimately, Highway 402 was designated with the intent of extending it to Highway 401. This was formally announced by the Department of Highways in late 1957.
Construction on a new <a href="grade-separated">grade-separated</a> intersection with Modeland Road began in 1963 and opened in 1964, although as before Highway 402 still continued eastward as Highway 7.

On February 28, 1968, a extension towards London was officially announced by Minister of Highways <a href="George%20Gomme">George Gomme</a>.
It was decided to construct the extension on a new <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a>, as had been done with most freeways constructed after Highway 400. East of the Murphy Road overpass, Highway 402 was re-aligned to bypass the interchange with Highway 40 constructed in 1964; Exmouth Street was redirected to connect with Highway 7 (London Line) at that junction, and Quinn Street now follows the former route of the highway.
For the new Highway 402, an overpass crossing was required with the then-<a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">CNR</a> line (now the Howard Watson Nature Trail) and a Parclo B4 interchange with the newly <a href="twinning%20%28roads%29">twinned</a> Highway 40 just north of the 1964 interchange. Construction east of Highway 40 began in 1972.

Under two construction contracts, construction of of Highway 402 began near Highway 7 in 1974.
A third contract to bridge the gap between that project and Sarnia was awarded in 1975.
On October 13, 1978, Highway 402 was opened to traffic between Highway 40 and Highway 21.
By the end of that year, construction was progressing on the section between Highway 21 and Highway 81 near Strathroy, as well as on the section connecting Highway 2 with Highway 401.
The section between Highway 21 and Highway 81 north of Strathroy was the next to be completed; it was opened to traffic on November 26, 1979.
On November 17, 1981, the section between London and Delaware was completed, including the interchange at Highway 401. It forced westbound drivers to exit at Longwoods Road (Highway 2). Construction was already underway on the final section between Strathroy and Delaware at this point.

The opening of the section between Highways 2 and 81 completed Highway 402 from London to the Blue Water Bridge. In addition, the removal of the Front Street intersection in Sarnia made the entire route a controlled-access highway. Both were completed in time for the official opening in Sarnia on November 10, 1982.

On Monday, December 13, 2010, a <a href="whiteout%20%28weather%29">whiteout</a> caused by lake-effect snow squalls left an stretch of Highway 402 closed for several days.
<a href="Lambton%20County%2C%20Ontario">Lambton County</a> officials declared a state of emergency. Although the entire distance between Sarnia and London is subject to occasional snow squalls and whiteout conditions, they usually dissipate or move in less than a day. The exceptional conditions at that time were caused by a snow squall which remained stationary over several days, dropping up to two metres (6 ft) of snow in some parts of the area. Defence Minister <a href="Peter%20MacKay">Peter MacKay</a> sent two Canadian Forces Griffon helicopters and a <a href="C-130%20Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a> to Sarnia to aid in the search-and-rescue efforts.
The hospitality of locals in providing shelter for stranded motorists was the primary focus of local media coverage.
The highway was reopened to traffic on the morning of December 16.
A single death was reported; a man succumbed to <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a> on a nearby county road.

Highway 402 was widened in the Sarnia area from four to six lanes due to extensive traffic backups from the bridge crossing towards the USA; the westbound lanes were widened by two lanes, while eastbound capacity remains unchanged. The new four-lane roadway is divided into specific lanes for cars, trucks, local traffic, and <a href="NEXUS%20%28frequent%20traveler%20program%29">NEXUS</a> card holders.
The new lanes begin just before the Murphy Road overpass with a local lane breaking away for interchange access; all travellers wishing to exit the highway from this point must be travelling in this lane.
Construction began August 4, 2009,
between the Blue Water Bridge and Lambton County Road 26 (Mandaumin Road) and included the reconstruction of several bridges, as well as completely rebuilding the Christina Street exit to accommodate southbound access. Work was completed by the end of 2012. Between 2004 and 2013, the speed limit along the westbound lanes from Airport Road westward was reduced from the standard . However, following the reconstruction, the speed limit was raised between Indian Road and Airport Road on June 20, 2013.

On January 5, 2013, a temporary vehicular <a href="roadblock">roadblock</a> was created at the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> as part of the "Idle No More" protests by <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> groups. The blockade was known in advance and was planned to occur during the noon hour. Lambton <a href="Ontario%20Provincial%20Police">OPP</a> monitored the protest by walking alongside the protesters. Traffic resumed flowing normally by 1:30 p.m. While Highway 402 itself was not closed, the protest did back up traffic onto the highway causing congestion in the areas of Front Street and Christina Street.
Later that year, another protest was held west of Strathroy on October 19, advocating against wind turbine construction due to the health effects experienced by those living near them. The rolling protest of about 150 vehicles, including farm equipment, was monitored by the OPP and required intermittent ramp closures to the westbound lanes.

On November 23, 2015, the Indian Road overpass was damaged by an flatbed trailer carrying an over-height load. The eastbound lanes of the highway were closed for 60 hours, while the girders damaged in the impact had to be removed. The overpass was repaired by May 2016 at a cost of $554,000 (overall damage of $3 million). The trucking company, under the Highway Traffic Act, was held liable and had to compensate the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario for the repair costs.

Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution

Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution is a book written by <a href="Stephen%20Knight%20%28author%29">Stephen Knight</a> first published in 1976. It proposed a solution to five murders in Victorian <a href="London">London</a> that were blamed on an unidentified <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> known as "<a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>".

Knight presented an elaborate <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theory</a> involving the <a href="British%20royal%20family">British royal family</a>, <a href="freemasonry">freemasonry</a> and the painter <a href="Walter%20Sickert">Walter Sickert</a>. He concluded that the victims were murdered to cover up a secret marriage between the second-in-line to the throne, <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale</a>, and Annie Elizabeth Crook, a working class girl. There are many facts that contradict Knight's theory, and his main source, Joseph Gorman (also known as Joseph Sickert), later retracted the story and admitted to the press that it was a hoax. 

Most scholars dismiss the theory and the book's conclusion is now widely discredited. Nevertheless, the book was popular and commercially successful, going through 20 editions. It was the basis for the graphic novel and <a href="From%20Hell%20%28film%29">film</a> "<a href="From%20Hell">From Hell</a>", as well as other dramatisations, and has influenced crime fiction writers, such as <a href="Patricia%20Cornwell">Patricia Cornwell</a> and <a href="Anne%20Perry">Anne Perry</a>.

Between August and November 1888, at least five brutal murders were committed in the <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> district of London. Although Whitechapel was an impoverished area and violence there was common, these murders can be linked to the same killer through a distinctive "<a href="modus%20operandi">modus operandi</a>". All the murders took place within the distance of a few streets, late at night or in the early morning, and the victims were all women whose throats were cut. In four of the cases, their bodies were mutilated, or even <a href="Disembowelment">eviscerated</a>. The removal of internal organs from three of the victims led to contemporary proposals that "considerable anatomical knowledge was displayed by the murderer, which would seem to indicate that his occupation was that of a butcher or a surgeon." Media organisations and the police received many letters and postcards purportedly written by the killer, who was dubbed "Jack the Ripper" after one of the signatories. Most of the anonymous confessional letters were dismissed by the police as hoaxes but one, known as the <a href="From%20Hell%20letter">"From Hell" letter</a> after a phrase used by the writer, was treated more seriously; it was sent with a small box containing half of a preserved human kidney. It is not clear, however, whether the kidney truly came from one of the victims or was a medical specimen sent as part of a macabre joke.

Despite an extensive police investigation, the killer was never found and his identity is still a mystery. Both at the time and subsequently, many amateur and professional investigators have proposed solutions but no single theory is widely accepted.

In 1970, British surgeon <a href="Thomas%20E.%20A.%20Stowell">Thomas E. A. Stowell</a> published an article entitled "Jack the Ripper – A Solution?" in the November issue of "<a href="The%20Criminologist%20%28crime%20journal%29">The Criminologist</a>". In the article, Stowell proposed that the Ripper was an aristocrat who had contracted <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> during a visit to the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, that it had driven him insane, and that in this state of mind he had perpetrated the five canonical Jack the Ripper murders. Although Stowell did not directly name his suspect in the article, he described in detail the suspect's family and his physical appearance and nicknames, all of which pointed to <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria's</a> grandson, <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale</a>. Stowell wrote that following a double murder on 30 September 1888, his suspect was restrained by his own family in an institution in the south of England, but later escaped to commit a final murder on 9 November before ultimately dying of syphilis. To back up his theory, Stowell drew comparisons between the evisceration of the women and the disembowelment of deer shot by the aristocracy on their estates. Stowell said his information came from the private notes of <a href="Sir%20William%20Gull%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir William Gull</a>, a reputable physician who had treated members of the royal family. Stowell knew Gull's son-in-law, <a href="Theodore%20Dyke%20Acland">Theodore Dyke Acland</a>, and was an executor of Acland's estate.

Stowell's article attracted intense attention, and placed Albert Victor among the most notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so could not have known about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he would probably have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.

On 5 November 1970, Stowell wrote to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" denying that it was his intention to imply Prince Albert Victor was Jack the Ripper. The letter was published on 9 November, the day after the elderly Stowell's own death from natural causes. The same week, Stowell's son reported that he had burned his father's papers, saying "I read just sufficient to make certain that there was nothing of importance."

Though Stowell's hypothesis was incorrect, his article rekindled interest in the Jack the Ripper case, and in 1973 the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> launched a television series, "<a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20%281973%20TV%20series%29">Jack the Ripper</a>", which investigated the <a href="Whitechapel%20murders">Whitechapel murders</a>. The series mixed documentary and drama; it featured real evidence but was hosted by <a href="Z-Cars">fictional detectives Barlow and Watt</a>, played by <a href="Stratford%20Johns">Stratford Johns</a> and <a href="Frank%20Windsor">Frank Windsor</a>, respectively. The series was made into a book, "The Ripper File", by <a href="Elwyn%20Jones%20%28writer%29">Elwyn Jones</a> and <a href="John%20Lloyd%20%28writer%29">John Lloyd</a> in 1975. The sixth and final programme included a testimony by Joseph Gorman, who called himself Joseph Sickert and claimed to be the illegitimate son of noted painter <a href="Walter%20Sickert">Walter Sickert</a>. Gorman claimed that Sickert had told him a story that implicated not only the royal family but also a host of other famous people in the murders. According to Gorman, Gull committed the murders with the help of accomplices. Stowell had mentioned rumours implicating Gull in his article, but had dismissed them as unfair and false.

Gorman said that his <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> grandmother had secretly married Albert Victor, and that his mother, as the legitimate daughter of Albert Victor, was the rightful heir to the throne. He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged as part of a conspiracy to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth. In the original television series, the story is depicted as the belief of Gorman but not of the detectives. Captivated by Gorman's story, journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further, and eventually published his research as the book "Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution" in 1976.

The book begins with Knight explaining how he came to meet Joseph Gorman, and then he tells Gorman's story which "did not come in clear, precise, chronological order but I had to glean it from rambling and sometimes vague discussion". Gorman says that Albert Victor's mother, Princess <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra</a>, introduced Walter Sickert to her son in the hope that Sickert would teach Albert Victor about art. Gorman claims that Albert Victor met one of Sickert's models, Annie Elizabeth Crook, a Catholic shop girl, at Sickert's studio at 15 <a href="Cleveland%20Street%2C%20London">Cleveland Street, London</a>. They had an affair, he says, and married in a secret ceremony with Sickert and Annie's friend, <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Kelly">Mary Jane Kelly</a>, acting as witnesses. Gorman alleges that Albert Victor and Annie's daughter, Alice Margaret Crook, was born on 18 April 1885, and that Albert Victor settled Annie and Alice into an apartment in Cleveland Street. In April 1888, Gorman continues, Queen Victoria and the British Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a> discovered Albert Victor's secret. Gorman accuses Salisbury of ordering a raid on the apartment because he was afraid that public knowledge of a potential Catholic heir to the throne would result in a revolution. Gorman claims that Albert Victor was placed in the custody of his family, while Annie was placed in the custody of Sir William Gull, who certified her insane; she spent the next 30 years drifting in and out of institutions before dying in 1920.

Meanwhile, Gorman alleges, Kelly was looking after the daughter, Alice, both during and after the raid. Gorman asserts that at first Kelly was content to hide the child, but then she, along with her friends <a href="Mary%20Ann%20Nichols">Mary Ann Nichols</a>, <a href="Annie%20Chapman">Annie Chapman</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20Stride">Elizabeth Stride</a>, decided to <a href="blackmail">blackmail</a> the government. Gorman accuses Salisbury of conspiring with his fellow freemasons, including senior policemen in the <a href="London%20Metropolitan%20Police">London Metropolitan Police</a>, to stop the scandal by staging the murders of the women. Gorman says Salisbury assigned the task to Gull, who lured the four women into a carriage individually where Gull murdered them with the assistance of coachman <a href="John%20Netley">John Netley</a> and <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Anderson">Sir Robert Anderson</a>, Assistant Commissioner of <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a>. Gorman claims a fifth victim, <a href="Catherine%20Eddowes">Catherine Eddowes</a>, was killed accidentally in a case of mistaken identity because she used the alias Mary Ann Kelly and was confused with Mary Jane Kelly. Gorman alleges that Netley tried to kill the young Alice twice but after the second unsuccessful attempt several witnesses chased Netley, who threw himself into the <a href="Thames">Thames</a> and drowned. Gorman completes the story by saying that Alice lived well into old age, later becoming Walter Sickert's mistress, and that Alice and Walter Sickert are his parents.

Knight explains that at first he did not believe Gorman's sensational story, which seemed "arrant, if entertaining, nonsense", but was so entranced by it that he had to investigate further. In describing the progress of his investigation, Knight reveals a series of coincidences: both Albert Victor's mother and Alice Crook were deaf; both Albert Victor's mother and Walter Sickert were Danish; Sickert is obsessed by the Ripper; the murders ended with the death of Mary Kelly; there was growing republican sentiment at the time of the murders, as well as anti-Catholic prejudice; a woman named "Elizabeth Cook", who Knight claims could be Annie Elizabeth Crook misspelt, did live at 6 Cleveland Street; Annie Crook was institutionalised; rumours of the time link Prince Albert Victor to a <a href="Cleveland%20Street%20scandal">scandal in Cleveland Street</a>; Gull was fond of grapes, and one of the victims may have been eating some at the time of her death; Gull matches the description of an unnamed physician accused by clairvoyant <a href="Robert%20James%20Lees">Robert James Lees</a>, who claimed to have identified the Ripper by using psychic powers.

Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes convinced that Gorman's story is true. The lack of tangible evidence, he claims, is due to a government cover-up and deliberate misdirection of the police investigation. To back up the claims of a <a href="Masonic%20conspiracy%20theories">masonic conspiracy</a>, he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged <a href="Masonic%20ritual%20and%20symbolism">masonic ritual</a> murders, and accuses Sir <a href="Charles%20Warren">Charles Warren</a>, <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Commissioner of Police</a>, of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies. Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.

Reviewers at the time of first publication met the book with undisguised scepticism and satire, but felt that Knight presented his unlikely case with ingenuity. <a href="Quentin%20Bell">Quentin Bell</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>": "[The book] begins bravely and fairly by presenting the greater part of the author's case and admitting at once that 'it all sounds terribly unlikely'. It does." "Medical History" stated: "Despite the author's ingenuity the case does not stand up to careful and critical analysis and is no more 'final' than its many predecessors." Since then, scholars from multiple disciplines have rejected Gorman's story as a ridiculous fantasy, and highlight many facts which contradict the version of events presented by Knight.

Annie Crook was a real person and did have a daughter, Alice, born on 18 April 1885 at St Marylebone Workhouse, and Joseph Gorman was Alice's son. However, there is no evidence in support of Gorman's claim that his father was Walter Sickert. Gorman was one of five children born within the marriage of Alice Margaret Crook and William Gorman. Furthermore, according to Trevor Marriott, an expert on the Jack the Ripper case, Alice "must have been conceived between 18 July and 11 August 1884". Albert Victor was in <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> from June to August 1884; hence, he was not in London at the time of Alice's conception and could not have been her father. The name of Alice's father was left blank on her birth certificate, but in adulthood, Alice claimed her father was William Crook. William Crook was also the name of her grandfather. Ripper expert <a href="Don%20Rumbelow">Don Rumbelow</a> has suggested that the name of Alice's father was omitted from her birth certificate either because she was illegitimate or to conceal an incestuous relationship between her mother, Annie, and grandfather, William. There is no record of any marriage between Albert Victor and Annie Crook; even if such a marriage had taken place, it would have been invalid under British law due to the <a href="Royal%20Marriages%20Act%201772">Royal Marriages Act 1772</a>, which voids any marriage contracted by a member of the royal family without the consent of the Sovereign. Any child of an invalid marriage is deemed illegitimate and excluded from the <a href="line%20of%20succession">line of succession</a>. Gorman claimed that his grandmother was Catholic, although records prove this to be untrue. If she had been and if she had married Albert Victor, he and their child would be excluded from inheriting the throne under the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which excludes Catholics from the line of succession.

There are further multiple problems with Gorman's version of events. An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street could not have been raided in April 1888, since by that time Nos. 4–14 Cleveland Street had been demolished, and the house no longer existed. Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron, such as Albert Victor, but were paupers who occasionally lived in <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>s. Annie was not institutionalised for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy. The Ripper victims were not known to be acquainted with each other or Annie Crook, who lived on the other side of Central London. Even if they had known her or her child, it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed, so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed. Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke, which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak. Gull did recover, but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890. Furthermore, neither Lord Salisbury, nor Sir James Anderson, nor Sir William Gull were freemasons, and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects, nor did he drown in the Thames. He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van. The <a href="forensic%20evidence">forensic evidence</a> indicates that the bodies of the victims were not moved, and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered. Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage. Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street, and there is no proof that he knew the Princess of Wales. Anderson was in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> at the time of the double murder, and so was not one of the perpetrators.

Knight appreciated that there were problems with Gorman's claims, but he "either misinterpreted, or deliberately ignored" them. Knight admitted that parts of Gorman's story were wrong but claimed that such mistakes were "stronger support of the fact that he was telling the truth". Realising that Anderson's absence in Switzerland meant that Anderson could not have been an accomplice, Knight considered Walter Sickert a much more likely culprit than Anderson, and suggested that he was the "third man" to participate in the crimes. This was not the first accusation made against Sickert. He had been previously mentioned as a potential suspect in <a href="Donald%20McCormick">Donald McCormick</a>'s 1959 book "The Identity of Jack the Ripper". However, Sickert was in France with his mother and brother in the late summer of 1888, and is unlikely even to have been in London at the time of at least four of the murders. After Knight implicated Sickert, Joseph Gorman withdrew his testimony, admitting to "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" newspaper that "it was a hoax ... a whopping fib".

Knight's friend and fellow Ripper aficionado <a href="Colin%20Wilson">Colin Wilson</a> thought the story was "obvious nonsense" but shortly after Knight's tragically early death from a brain tumour he wrote in his defence: "he wrote the book with his tongue in his cheek, then found himself caught up in a success that prevented him from retracting or quietly disowning it."

Despite its many inconsistencies, Knight's and Gorman's conspiracy theory has captured the imagination of other authors, who have made further modifications to the story. For example, Melvyn Fairclough's "The Ripper and the Royals" (London: Duckworth, 1991) asserted that <a href="Lord%20Randolph%20Churchill">Lord Randolph Churchill</a> was the "third man", although Fairclough later disowned his own book and told reporters that "he no longer believes the theory". Andy Parlour, Sue Parlour and Kevin O'Donnell, authors of "The Jack the Ripper Whitechapel Murders" (St. Osyth, Essex: Ten Bells Publishing, 1997), supposed that <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Kelly">Mary Jane Kelly</a> was pregnant with Albert Victor's child instead of Annie Crook. These, and other books which promote Sickert from a knowing accomplice to being Jack the Ripper himself, such as <a href="Jean%20Overton-Fuller">Jean Overton-Fuller</a>'s "Sickert and the Ripper Crimes" (Oxford: Mandrake, 1990) and <a href="Patricia%20Cornwell">Patricia Cornwell</a>'s "<a href="Portrait%20of%20a%20Killer">Portrait of a Killer</a>" (2002), are marketed as non-fiction books, but they are dismissed almost universally as derivative fantasies based on Knight's initial flawed analysis.

The conspiracy theory outlined in "Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution" is fictionalised in the play "Force and Hypocrisy" by Doug Lucie. Four films have used elements of the theory: "<a href="Murder%20by%20Decree">Murder by Decree</a>", "<a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20%281988%20TV%20series%29">Jack the Ripper</a>", "<a href="The%20Ripper%20%28film%29">The Ripper</a>", and the <a href="Hughes%20Brothers">Hughes Brothers</a>' "<a href="From%20Hell%20%28film%29">From Hell</a>", which was based on a <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> of <a href="From%20Hell">the same name</a> by <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a> and artist <a href="Eddie%20Campbell">Eddie Campbell</a>.

Knight's theory features in the final book of <a href="Philip%20Jos%C3%A9%20Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a>'s <a href="Riverworld">Riverworld</a> series, "<a href="Gods%20of%20Riverworld">Gods of Riverworld</a>", and novels utilising Knight's book as a base include <a href="Robin%20Paige">Robin Paige</a>'s "Death at Whitechapel" (New York: Berkley Publishing Group, 2000) and <a href="Anne%20Perry">Anne Perry</a>'s "The Whitechapel Conspiracy" (London: Headline, 2001).

Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss

Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss is a <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> (RPG) developed by <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Blue Sky Productions</a> (later Looking Glass Studios) and published by <a href="Origin%20Systems">Origin Systems</a>. Released in March 1992, the game is set in the fantasy world of the <a href="Ultima%20%28series%29">"Ultima" series</a>. It takes place inside the Great Stygian Abyss: a large cave system that contains the remnants of a failed <a href="utopia">utopia</a>n civilization. The player assumes the role of the <a href="Avatar%20%28Ultima%29">Avatar</a>—the "Ultima" series' <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>—and attempts to find and rescue a baron's kidnapped daughter.

"Ultima Underworld" has been cited as the first role-playing game to feature first-person action in a 3D environment, and it introduced technological innovations such as allowing the player to look up and down. Its design combines <a href="Simulation%20game">simulation</a> elements with concepts from earlier CRPGs, including "<a href="Wizardry">Wizardry</a>" and "<a href="Dungeon%20Master%20%28video%20game%29">Dungeon Master</a>", which led the game's designers to call it a "<a href="Dungeon%20crawl">dungeon simulation</a>". As such, the game is <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay">non-linear</a> and allows for <a href="emergent%20gameplay">emergent gameplay</a>.

"Ultima Underworld" received widespread critical acclaim and sold nearly 500,000 units. The game was later placed on numerous hall of fame lists. It influenced game developers such as <a href="Bethesda%20Softworks">Bethesda Softworks</a> and <a href="Valve%20Corporation">Valve Corporation</a>, and it was an inspiration behind the games "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>" and "<a href="BioShock">BioShock</a>". The game had a sequel, "" (1993), and a new game in the series, "<a href="Underworld%20Ascendant">Underworld Ascendant</a>", was released in late 2018.

"Ultima Underworld" is a <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> (RPG) that takes place from a <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> perspective in a <a href="2.5D">three-dimensional</a> environment. The player's goal is to adventure through a large, multi-level <a href="dungeon">dungeon</a>, in which the entire game is set. The player uses a <a href="point-and-click">freely movable mouse cursor</a> to interact with the game's world, and with the icon-based interface on the <a href="HUD%20%28computer%20gaming%29">heads-up display</a> (HUD). Each icon has a specific effect; for example, the Look icon allows the player to examine objects closely, while the Fight icon causes the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> to ready his or her weapon. The player's progression through the game is non-linear: areas may be explored, and puzzles and quests finished, in any order. An <a href="automap">automatically filling map</a>, to which the player may add notes, records what the player has seen above a minimum level of brightness. The player character may carry light sources to extend the <a href="line%20of%20sight%20%28gaming%29">line of sight</a> in varying amounts. Exploratory actions include looking up and down, jumping, and swimming.

The player begins the game by creating a character, for whom traits such as gender, <a href="character%20class">class</a> and skills may be selected. Skills range from fighting with an axe, to bartering, to picking locks. By participating in <a href="combat">combat</a>, <a href="quest">quest</a>s and exploration, the character gains <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s. When certain amounts of experience points are accumulated, the character <a href="Experience%20level">levels up</a>, gaining additional <a href="hit%20points">hit points</a> and <a href="Magic%20point">mana</a>. Experience also allows the player to recite <a href="mantra">mantra</a>s at <a href="shrine">shrine</a>s in the game. Each mantra is a statement—such as "<a href="Om">Om Cah</a>"—that increases proficiency in a specific skill when typed. Simple mantras are provided in the game's manual, while more complex ones are hidden throughout the game. An inventory on the HUD lists the items and weapons currently carried by the player character; capacity is limited by weight. Players equip items via a <a href="paper%20doll%20%28gaming%29">paper doll</a> system, wherein items are clicked-and-dragged onto a representation of the player character.

Combat occurs in real-time, and the player character may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for different types of attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking near the bottom of the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated <a href="Dice%23Application%20in%20role-playing%20games">dice rolls</a> occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of <a href="runestone">runestone</a>s. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.

The developers intended "Ultima Underworld" to be a realistic and interactive "dungeon simulation", rather than a straightforward <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a>. For example, many objects in the game have no actual use, while a lit torch may be used on corn to create <a href="popcorn">popcorn</a>. Weapons deteriorate with use, and the player character must eat and rest; light sources burn out unless extinguished before sleeping. A physics system allows, among other things, for items to bounce when thrown against surfaces. The game contains <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s (NPCs) with whom the player may interact by selecting dialogue choices from a menu. Most NPCs have possessions, and are willing to trade them. The game was designed to give players "a palette of strategies" with which to approach situations, and its simulation systems allow for <a href="emergent%20gameplay">emergent gameplay</a>.

"Ultima Underworld" is set in Britannia, the fantasy world of the "Ultima" series. Specifically, the game takes place inside a large, underground <a href="dungeon%20crawl">dungeon</a> called the Great Stygian Abyss. The dungeon's entrance lies on the Isle of the Avatar, an island ruled by Baron Almric. The Abyss first appeared in "", in which it contains the player's final goal, the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.

"Ultima Underworld" is set after the events of ""; in the time between the two games, a man named Cabirus attempted to create a <a href="utopia">utopia</a>n colony inside the Abyss. The eight settlements of the "Ultima" series each embody one of eight virtues, and Cabirus wished to create a ninth that embodied all virtues. To achieve this, he united diverse cultures and races in peaceful co-existence and planned to promote harmony by giving each group one of eight virtue-imbued magical artifacts. However, he died before distributing the artifacts, and left no instructions for doing so. As a result, the colony collapsed into anarchy and war, and the artifacts were lost. At the time of "Ultima Underworld", the Abyss contains the remnants of Cabirus's colony, inhabited by fractious groups of humans, goblins, trolls and others.

Before the beginning of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon, the Slasher of Veils, while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at the doorway to gain entrance.

In the game's introduction, the ghost of Garamon haunts the Avatar's dreams with warnings of a great danger in Britannia. The Avatar allows Garamon to take him there, where he watches Tyball kidnap Arial. Tyball escapes, leaving the Avatar to be caught by the Baron's guards. The guards take him to the Baron, who banishes him to the Great Stygian Abyss to rescue Arial. After the introduction, the Avatar explores the dungeon and finds remnants of Cabirus's colony. A few possible scenarios include deciding the fate of two warring goblin tribes, learning a language, and playing an instrument to complete a quest. The Avatar eventually defeats Tyball and frees Arial.

However, as he dies, Tyball reveals that he had decided to contain the Slasher of Veils, whose prison he had been weakening, within Arial as a way to prevent it from destroying the world. Arial asks the Avatar to prevent the Slasher of Veils from being unleashed, and magically teleports back to the surface to evacuate its inhabitants. With help from Garamon's ghost, the Avatar gathers the eight talismans of Cabirus and throws them in the volcano at the base of the Abyss; the energy they release allows Garamon to open a portal that will send the Slasher of Veils into another dimension. The Avatar is sucked through the portal into a chaotic alternate dimension, but escapes back to the Isle of the Avatar and makes it on board the Baron's ship as the volcano erupts. As the game ends, Garamon's spirit reveals that he teleported the inhabitants of the Abyss to another cave.

"Ultima Underworld" was conceived in 1989 by <a href="Origin%20Systems">Origin Systems</a> employee <a href="Paul%20Neurath">Paul Neurath</a>. He had just completed work on "<a href="Space%20Rogue">Space Rogue</a>", a hybrid title that features sequences both of <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D</a> <a href="Tile-based%20video%20game">tile-based</a> role-playing and of <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> <a href="space%20flight%20simulator%20game">space flight simulation</a>. According to Neurath, "Space Rogue" "took the first, tentative steps in exploring a blend of RPG and simulation elements, and this seemed to me a promising direction." He felt that the way it combined the elements was jarring, however, and believed that he could create a more immersive experience.

Neurath had enjoyed <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>s like "<a href="Wizardry">Wizardry</a>", but found that their simple, abstract visuals were an obstacle to the <a href="suspension%20of%20disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a>. He believed that "<a href="Dungeon%20Master%20%28video%20game%29">Dungeon Master</a>"'s detailed first-person presentation was a "glimpse into the future", and he sought to create a fantasy role-playing game that built on its example. In early 1990, Neurath wrote a design document for a game titled "Underworld", which described such elements as "goblins on the prows of rowboats tossed in the waves, shooting arrows at the player above on a rope bridge swinging in the wind." He contracted former Origin employee Doug Wike to create <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a>. Wike created a brief, hand-drawn animation with <a href="Deluxe%20Paint%20Animation">Deluxe Paint Animation</a>, which depicted the game's interface and a creature moving toward the player. The animation defined the game's direction, and it was used as a reference point for the game's tone and features throughout development. That spring, Neurath founded the company Blue Sky Productions in <a href="Salem%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Salem, New Hampshire</a>, with the intention to create "Underworld". Among the company's first employees was <a href="Doug%20Church">Doug Church</a>, who was studying at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT). The team was thus composed of Doug Church as programmer, Doug Wike as lead artist and Paul Neurath as lead designer. Development began in May 1990.

An early difficulty was the implementation of <a href="texture%20mapping">texture mapping</a>. Neurath had experimented unsuccessfully with the concept on an <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a> computer in the late 1980s, but he believed that the more powerful <a href="IBM">IBM</a> PCs of the time might be able to process it. He contacted <a href="Lerner%20Research">Lerner Research</a> programmer Chris Green—an acquaintance from his past work with <a href="Edward%20%28Ned%29%20Lerner">Ned Lerner</a>—who created a working <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>. Using the "Space Rogue" engine, Green's algorithm, assembly code from Lerner Research's "<a href="Car%20and%20Driver%20%28video%20game%29">Car and Driver</a>" and original programming, the Blue Sky team completed a prototype of "Underworld" after roughly a month of work. Neurath described the prototype as "fast, smooth, and [featuring] true texture mapped walls, though the ceiling and floor were flat shaded and the corridors and rooms were all 10' [3.0 m] high—it looked a lot like "<a href="Wolfenstein%203D">Wolfenstein-3D</a>" in fact." The team demonstrated it at the June 1990 <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES) and impressed <a href="Origin%20Systems">Origin Systems</a>. Origin producer <a href="Warren%20Spector">Warren Spector</a> later said, "I remember Paul showing me that demo ... at CES and being totally floored by it. None of us had ever seen anything like it." The two companies reached a publishing agreement that summer, and Origin suggested that the game be reworked to fit into the "Ultima" universe. The team agreed, and the game was renamed "Ultima Underworld". While Spector had hoped to produce the game, he was not assigned to the role; and he later said that he "sort of watched [the other producer] jealously from the sidelines."

After the game was renamed, Doug Church recruited Dan Schmidt, a college friend who had just graduated from MIT, as a programmer. The team abandoned the "Space Rogue" engine and created a new one that could display a believable 3D world—one with varying heights and texture-mapped floors and ceilings. Church estimated that the first year of production was dedicated to creating the game's technological base. However, Neurath stated that the team spent "comparatively little" time on the game's technology, and that "most was spent working on game features, mechanics, and world building". Their ultimate goal was to create the "finest dungeon game, a game that was tangibly better than any of the long line of dungeon games that came before it." Each member of the small team assumed multiple roles; for example, the game's first two levels were designed by Paul Neurath, while the rest were built by artists, designers and programmers. According to Schmidt, Neurath contracted a writer to create the game's story and dialogue, but the relationship was a "mismatch"; and so the team decided to write the plot themselves. Alongside his programming work, Church co-wrote the game's story with Dan Schmidt, and he gradually took on project leader responsibilities. Writing duties for each level were given to the person who created that level; Schmidt's role was to edit the dialogue of each level to fit with that of the others. Schmidt also created the game's sound effects, which were synthesized—no recorded sounds were used—in a graphical sound editor. Neurath, who Church said was "very day to day at the beginning of the project", became more involved with the company's business and finances.

Church explained that the core of the project was its "dynamic creation". He noted that the team had "no set of rules ... or pre-written plan", but rather worked organically toward the general idea of creating a "dungeon simulation". Church believed that the game's "Ultima" series heritage was extremely helpful, as it gave the team an anchor for their experiments. According to Church, because the team was young and inexperienced, they were "improvising almost the whole time". He said that they would "just write something" that seemed interesting, but would then "get it half done, and we'd say, 'Eh? That's not working.'" He believed that this iterative method was useful overall, but that it entailed an abnormally large workload: it resulted in the creation of "four movement systems before we were done, several combat systems, and so forth". Certain failed experiments meant that the team created "[AI] code for many ideas which turned out to be largely irrelevant to the actual gameplay".

During the first year of the game's development, Church believed that Origin had little faith in the team's ability to complete the game. He later said, "They didn't pay any attention at all, frankly." While Origin CEO <a href="Richard%20Garriott">Richard Garriott</a> helped the team in fitting the game into the "Ultima" franchise, Warren Spector later said that the company seemed "blasé" about "Ultima Underworld" "for the first several months after ORIGIN and Blue Sky signed the deal", despite his own belief that it was a "change-the-world project". Neurath opined that this was due to the team's status as outsiders, whose company was "some 1,500 miles distant" from their publisher. The team was advanced $30,000 to create the game, but its final cost was $400,000. The game was funded partly by Ned Lerner, and by Neurath's royalties from "Space Rogue". Throughout the game's production, the studio was run on a tight budget.

Roughly a year into development, the team discovered that their second producer—the first having quit Origin near the beginning of development—had left the project. Neurath later said that "neither [producer] had much involvement" in the game, and that, following the second's departure, the team spent time without any producer at all. Rumors circulated that Origin planned to cancel the project. Following a proposal by the team around this time, Spector, who had previously worked with Neurath on "Space Rogue", assumed the role of producer. Church later described this event as "a big win for everyone". Spector began to interact regularly with the team by phone and to visit the studio in person. Neurath later said, "Warren understood immediately what we were trying to accomplish with the game, and became our biggest champion within Origin. Had not Warren stepped in this role at that stage, I'm not sure "Ultima Underworld" would have ever seen the light of day." Church said that Spector helped the team polish the game and "make it real", and that Spector's past experience in the industry enabled him to keep the team focused on completing the game. He explained that Spector "had that ability to help me and the rest of the guys reset, from the big-picture view of someone who has done it before."

The final four months of the game's development constituted "crunch time". During this period, Neurath rented an extremely small basement office space in a <a href="Somerville%2C%20Massachusetts">Somerville, Massachusetts</a> social services building: he sought to circumvent the long commute that several team members had been making from Massachusetts. Furniture consisted of inexpensive folding tables and "uncomfortable red deck chairs". Development took place during the winter, but the room was drafty and poorly heated. The team hired college friends such as <a href="Marc%20LeBlanc">Marc LeBlanc</a> to bug test the game, and Spector stayed at the studio for roughly a month and a half, according to Church. Spector later said that "in that little office, that team created some serious magic. I mean, the sense of doing something incredible was palpable". Neurath summarized, "Despite the austere working environment, the game came together amazingly well in the final stretch, and we delivered the <a href="Golden%20master">Gold Master</a> just about two years after we had started." The game was released in March 1992.

"Ultima Underworld"'s <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> was written by a small team. Chris Green provided the game's texture mapping algorithm, which was applied to walls, floors and ceilings. The engine allowed for transparencies, walls at 45 degree angles, multiple tile heights and inclined surfaces, and other aspects. "Ultima Underworld" was the first video game to implement many of these effects. The game was also the first indoor, real-time, 3D first-person game to allow the player to look up and down, and to jump.

"Ultima Underworld" uses two-dimensional <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprite</a>s for characters, but also features 3D objects, as the team believed that it "had to do 3D objects in order to have reasonable visuals". The game uses physics to calculate the motion of thrown objects. During the game's <a href="software%20testing%23The%20testing%20process">alpha testing phase</a>, part of the programming team worked to create a smooth lighting model. The game's advanced technology caused the engine to run slowly, and its <a href="system%20requirements">system requirements</a> were extremely high. Doug Church later downplayed the importance of the game's technology, stating that technological advancement "is somewhat inevitable in our field ... [and] sadly, as an industry we seem to know much less about design, and how to continue to extend and grow design capabilities". Instead, he claimed that "Ultima Underworld"s most important achievement was its incorporation of simulation elements into a role-playing game.

"Ultima Underworld" was not an immediate commercial success, which caused Origin to decrease its marketing support. However, its popularity increased via <a href="word%20of%20mouth">word of mouth</a> during the years after its release, and sales eventually reached nearly 500,000 copies. The game received critical acclaim, with praise directed toward its 3D presentation and automapping feature. In 1993 the game won the <a href="Origins%20Award">Origins Award</a> for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1992, and was nominated for an award at the <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>.

"<a href="ACE%20%28games%20magazine%29">ACE</a>" called "Ultima Underworld" "the next true evolutionary step in the RPG genre", and noted that its simulation-style dungeon was "frighteningly realistic". The magazine thought that the game's <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprite</a> character models "detract from the dense atmosphere a bit", but ended the review by stating, "If you've got a PC, then you've got to have "Ultima Underworld"." "<a href="Dragon%20%28magazine%29">Dragon Magazine</a>" opined that "to say this is the best dungeon game we've ever played is quite an understatement," and it "will leave you wondering how other game entertainments can ever stack up against the new standards "Abyss" sets."

"<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>"s Allen Greenberg in 1992 described it as "an ambitious project" but "not without its share of problems." He praised the game's "enjoyable story and well-crafted puzzles", but disliked its "robotic" controls and "confusing" perspectives, and stated that "far more impressive sounds and pictures have been produced for other dungeon games". He summarized the game as "an enjoyable challenge with a unique game-playing engine to back it up." <a href="Scorpia%20%28journalist%29">Scorpia</a> was also positive, stating that despite flaws ""Ultima Underworld" is an impressive first product. The meticulous construction of a real-world dungeon environment is outstanding. [It] may be a <a href="dungeon%20crawl">dungeon trek</a>, but it is certainly the dungeon trek of the future". In 1993 she praised the "superb graphics" of "a definite must for game players". The magazine later awarded the game "Role-Playing Game of the Year". "<a href="Computer%20Shopper%20%28US%20magazine%29">Computer Shopper</a>" enjoyed its storyline and characters, and believed that the game "makes you feel as if you've entered a virtual reality". Despite describing its interface as "not truly intuitive", the reviewer finished by calling the game "addictive" and "a fine value". The "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" awarded it Best Game of the Year, and called it "an amazing triumph of the imagination" and "the creme de la creme of dungeon epics".

The game was also well received by non-English publications. The Swedish "Datormagazin" considered the game to be "in a class by itself". In Germany, "Power Play" praised its "technical perfection" and "excellent" story, while "Play Time" lauded its graphical and aural presentation, and awarded it Game of the Month. Finland's "<a href="Pelit">Pelit</a>" stated, ""Ultima Underworld" is something totally new in the CRPG field. The Virtual Fantasy of the Abyss left reviewers speechless."

"Ultima Underworld" was inducted into many hall of fame lists, including those compiled by <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and "Computer Gaming World". "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer US</a>" ranked the game and its sequel 20th on their 1997 The 50 Best Games Ever list, citing "strong character interaction, thoughtful puzzles, unprecedented control, and genuine roleplaying in ways that have yet to be duplicated". In 2004, readers of "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" voted "Ultima Underworld" as the 62nd top retro game: the staff called it "easily one of the best entries in the long-running "Ultima" series." 

In 1998, "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" declared it the 18th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it "Light-years ahead of their time, and still regarded as some of the best roleplaying games ever created".

"Ultima Underworld" has been cited as the first RPG to feature first-person action in a 3D environment, and even as the first true first-person 3D game in any genre. Rival 3D games appeared; "<a href="Legends%20of%20Valour">Legends of Valour</a>" advertised ""Ultima Underworld", move over!" <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> posited that "all 3D RPG titles from "<a href="Morrowind">Morrowind</a>" to "<a href="World%20of%20Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>" share "Ultima Underworld" as a common ancestor, both graphically and spiritually ... [and] for better or for worse, "Underworld" moved the text-based RPG out of the realm of imagination and into the third dimension". Its soundtrack, composed by <a href="George%20Sanger%20%28musician%29">George "The Fat Man" Sanger</a> and Dave Govett, was the first in a major first-person game to use a <a href="dynamic%20music">dynamic music</a> system; the player's actions alter the game's music.

"Ultima Underworld" is considered the first example of an <a href="immersive%20sim">immersive sim</a>, a genre that combines elements from other genres to create a game with strong player agency and emergent gameplay, and has influence many games since its release. The game's influence has been found in "<a href="BioShock">BioShock</a>" (2007), and that game's designer, <a href="Ken%20Levine%20%28game%20developer%29">Ken Levine</a>, has stated that "all the things that I wanted to do and all the games that I ended up working on came out of the inspiration I took from ["Ultima Underworld"]." "<a href="Gears%20of%20War">Gears of War</a>" designer <a href="Cliff%20Bleszinski">Cliff Bleszinski</a> also cited it as an early influence, stating that it had "far more impact on me than "Doom"". Other games influenced by "Ultima Underworld" include "", "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>", "", "", and "<a href="Half-Life%202">Half-Life 2</a>". <a href="Toby%20Gard">Toby Gard</a> stated that, when designing "<a href="Tomb%20Raider">Tomb Raider</a>", he "was a big fan of ... "Ultima Underworld" and I wanted to mix that type of game with the sort of polygon characters that were just being showcased in "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%20%28arcade%20game%29">Virtua Fighter</a>"." "Ultima Underworld" was also the basis for Looking Glass Technologies' later "<a href="System%20Shock">System Shock</a>".

<a href="Id%20Software">Id Software</a>'s use of <a href="texture%20mapping">texture mapping</a> in "<a href="Catacomb%203-D">Catacomb 3-D</a>", a precursor to "<a href="Wolfenstein%203D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>", was influenced by "Ultima Underworld". Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence, however. In the book "<a href="Masters%20of%20Doom">Masters of Doom</a>", author David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between Paul Neurath and <a href="John%20Romero">John Romero</a>. However, <a href="Doug%20Church">Doug Church</a> has said that <a href="John%20Carmack">John Carmack</a> saw the game's summer 1990 software convention demo, and recalled a comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper. Paul Neurath has recounted the incident similarly, with both Carmack and Romero present.

Despite the technology developed for "Ultima Underworld", Origin opted to continue using traditional top-down, 2D graphics for future mainline "Ultima" games. The engine was re-used and enhanced for "Ultima Underworld"s 1993 sequel, "". Looking Glass Studios planned to create a third "Ultima Underworld", but Origin rejected their pitches. After <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> (EA) rejected <a href="Arkane%20Studios">Arkane Studios</a>' pitch for "Ultima Underworld III", the studio instead created a <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a>: "<a href="Arx%20Fatalis">Arx Fatalis</a>".

In the early 2000s, Paul Neurath approached EA to discuss a port of "Ultima Underworld" to the <a href="Pocket%20PC">Pocket PC</a>. EA rejected the suggestion, but allowed him to look for possible developers; Neurath found that ZIO Interactive enthusiastically supported the idea, and EA eventually licensed the rights to the company. Doug Church and <a href="Floodgate%20Entertainment">Floodgate Entertainment</a> assisted with portions of its Pocket PC development, and the port was released in 2002.

In 2015, <a href="Otherside%20Entertainment">Otherside Entertainment</a>, a new developer founded by Paul Neurath and other Looking Glass and Irrational veterans, announced a new entry in the series, entitled "<a href="Underworld%20Ascendant">Underworld Ascendant</a>". The new title is an officially licensed part of the series set in the Stygian Abyss, but this licensing agreement does not extend to the "<a href="Ultima%20%28series%29">Ultima</a>" name or greater IP, effectively orphaning "Underworld" from the "Ultima" series.

Lesley J. McNair

Lesley James McNair (May 25, 1883 – July 25, 1944) was a senior <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> officer who served during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He attained the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a> during his life; he was killed in action during World War II, and received a posthumous promotion to <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">general</a>.

A <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> native and 1904 graduate of the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a>, McNair was a <a href="Field%20Artillery%20Branch%20%28United%20States%29">Field Artillery</a> officer with a background in the <a href="Ordnance%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Ordnance Department</a>. A veteran of the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Veracruz">Veracruz occupation</a> and <a href="Pancho%20Villa%20Expedition">Pancho Villa Expedition</a>, during World War I he served as assistant chief of staff for training with the <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Division</a>, and then chief of artillery training on the staff at the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Forces">American Expeditionary Forces</a> headquarters. His outstanding performance resulted in his promotion to temporary <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>; at age 35, he was the Army's youngest general officer.

McNair's experience of more than 30 years with equipment and weapons design and testing, his administrative skills, and his success in the areas of military education and training led to his World War II assignment as commander of <a href="Army%20Ground%20Forces">Army Ground Forces</a>. In this position, McNair became the "unsung architect of the U.S. Army", and played a leading role in the organizational design, equipping, and training of Army units in the United States before they departed for overseas combat. While historians continue to debate some of McNair's decisions and actions, including the individual replacement system for killed and wounded soldiers, and a controversy over the use of tanks or tank destroyers for anti-armor combat, his concentration on advanced officer education, innovative weapons systems, improved doctrine, realistic combat training, and development of combined arms tactics enabled the Army to modernize and perform successfully on the World War II battlefield, where the mobility of mechanized forces replaced the static defenses of World War I as the primary tactical consideration.

He was killed by <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> while in France to act as commander of the fictional <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army%20Group">First United States Army Group</a>, part of the <a href="Operation%20Quicksilver%20%28deception%20plan%29">Operation Quicksilver</a> deception that masked the actual landing sites for the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Normandy">Invasion of Normandy</a>. During <a href="Operation%20Cobra">Operation Cobra</a>, an <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a> bomb landed in his foxhole during combat near <a href="Saint-L%C3%B4">Saint-Lô</a> when the Army attempted to use heavy bombers for close air support of infantry operations as part of the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Battle of Normandy</a>.

McNair was born in <a href="Verndale%2C%20Minnesota">Verndale, Minnesota</a> on May 25, 1883, the son of James (1846–1932) and Clara (Manz) McNair (1853–1925). He was the second-born of their six children, and the first son. His siblings who lived to adulthood were: sister Nora (1881–1971), the wife of Harry Jessup; brother Murray Manz McNair (1888–1976); and sister Irene (1890–1979), the wife of Harry R. Naftalin.

McNair attended school in Verndale through the ninth grade, the highest available locally; his parents then relocated to <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> so McNair and his siblings could complete high school. After graduating from <a href="South%20High%20School%20%28Minneapolis%29">South High School</a> in 1897, he competed successfully for an appointment to the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>. While he was on the Naval Academy waiting list as an alternate, he began studies at the <a href="Minnesota%20School%20of%20Business">Minnesota School of Business</a> in Minneapolis, where he concentrated primarily on mechanical engineering and statistics courses.

Frustrated with the wait to start at the Naval Academy, in 1900 McNair applied for admission to the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a>. Initially selected as an alternate in July 1900, he was quickly accepted as a member of the class that began that August. While at West Point, his fellow students nicknamed him "Whitey" for his ash blond hair; they continued to use it with him for the rest of his life. The description of McNair which accompanied the photo of him in West Point's yearbook for his senior year refers to him as "Pedestrian Whitey" and details an incident when he had to walk from <a href="Newburgh%2C%20New%20York">Newburgh</a> to West Point, a distance of , after having missed the last train while returning from visiting his fiancée in New York City; the yearbook also contains an anonymously authored poem, "'Whitey's' Record Walk", about the same incident.

Several of McNair's classmates also went on to prominent careers in the Army, including <a href="George%20R.%20Allin">George R. Allin</a>, <a href="Charles%20School%20Blakely">Charles School Blakely</a>, <a href="Robert%20M.%20Danford">Robert M. Danford</a>, <a href="Pelham%20D.%20Glassford">Pelham D. Glassford</a>, <a href="Edmund%20L.%20Gruber">Edmund L. Gruber</a>, <a href="Henry%20Conger%20Pratt">Henry Conger Pratt</a>, <a href="Henry%20J.%20Reilly">Henry J. Reilly</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Stilwell">Joseph Stilwell</a>, and <a href="Innis%20P.%20Swift">Innis P. Swift</a>. McNair graduated in 1904, and was commissioned as a <a href="Second%20lieutenant%23United%20States">second lieutenant</a>. The top five or six graduates usually chose the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">engineer branch</a>; McNair's high class standing (11th of 124) earned him a place in the second choice of most high-ranking graduates, the <a href="Field%20Artillery%20Branch%20%28United%20States%29">artillery branch</a>.

McNair was first assigned as a platoon leader with the 12th <a href="Artillery%20battery">Battery</a> of Mountain Artillery at <a href="Fort%20Douglas%2C%20Utah">Fort Douglas, Utah</a>. While there, he requested duty with the <a href="Ordnance%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Ordnance Department</a>, and passed a qualifying examination. After approval of his transfer request, he was first assigned to <a href="Sandy%20Hook%20Proving%20Ground">Sandy Hook Proving Ground</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, where he began a lifelong interest in testing and experimenting with new equipment and weapons. Initially, McNair's Ordnance testing centered on improving the <a href="mountain%20guns">mountain guns</a> used by units including his 12th Battery for artillery support of troops in rugged terrain where <a href="limbers%20and%20caissons">limbers and caissons</a> could not travel.

After assignment to the staff of the Army's <a href="Ordnance%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29%23Chiefs%20of%20Ordnance">Chief of Ordnance</a> from 1905 to 1906, McNair was assigned to the <a href="Watertown%20Arsenal">Watertown Arsenal</a>, where he completed self-directed academic studies in metallurgy and other scientific topics. In this posting, he gained experience with both laboratory and practical methods of experimentation, including analyzing bronze, steel, and cast iron to determine the best materials to use in manufacturing <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s and other weapons. In addition, he gained firsthand experience with the uses and applications of several foundry machines, including <a href="forge">forge</a>s, <a href="steam%20hammer">steam hammer</a>s, <a href="lathe">lathe</a>s, <a href="Planer%20%28metalworking%29">planing machines</a>, and <a href="Boring%20%28manufacturing%29">boring machines</a>. His business college background in statistical analysis and engineering (including technical drawing) helped make him successful at testing and experimentation; as a result of his experience at Watertown, for the rest of his career the Army frequently relied on him to oversee boards that developed and tested weapons and other equipment, and made recommendations on which items were most suitable for procurement and fielding. He was promoted to temporary <a href="First%20lieutenant%23U.S.%20Army.2C%20U.S.%20Marine%20Corps%20and%20U.S.%20Air%20Force">first lieutenant</a> in July 1905, and permanent first lieutenant in January 1907. In May 1907, McNair was promoted to temporary <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">captain</a>. (His higher temporary ranks applied in the Ordnance branch, but not in the Artillery.)

In 1909, McNair returned to the Artillery branch and was assigned to the <a href="4th%20Field%20Artillery%20Regiment">4th Field Artillery Regiment</a> at <a href="Fort%20D.A.%20Russell%20%28Wyoming%29">Fort Russell</a>, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. Assigned to command of Battery C, he earned accolades for his leadership skills and technical expertise. <a href="Jacob%20L.%20Devers">Jacob L. Devers</a>, who was assigned to Battery C after his 1909 West Point graduation, recalled McNair as an outstanding commander who set a superior personal example, and knew how to motivate his subordinates to perform to a high standard. During his battery command, McNair also worked with mixed success on recommendations to modernize pack howitzers, <a href="pack%20saddle">pack saddle</a>s, ammunition carriers, and other equipment (much of it of his own design) for the Army's mule-transported mountain artillery. In 1909, McNair commanded the 4th Artillery's Battery D at <a href="Fort%20Riley">Fort Riley</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, during tests designed to determine the battle-worthiness of different types of defensive works if they were attacked by various types of <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s and <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s.
McNair's skills in technical drawing, engineering, prototype building, and statistical analysis began to be known Army-wide; in 1912 the commandant of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Field%20Artillery%20School">Field Artillery School</a> requested him by name for assignment to his staff. Instructors at the school had spent more than a year gathering information on 7,000 rounds fired during tests and field exercises; because the school was short-staffed, the commandant called on McNair to compile the data into <a href="Table%20%28information%29">firing tables</a> that would make it easier for Artillery crews Army-wide to plan and control <a href="indirect%20fire">indirect fire</a>. While carrying out this assignment in 1913, he also spent seven months in France to observe and gather information on the French Army's artillery training, education, and employment.

In April 1914, McNair was promoted to permanent captain, and from April to November 1914, McNair took part in the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Veracruz">Veracruz Expedition</a> as the 4th Field Artillery Regiment's <a href="Commissary%20%28store%29">commissary officer</a>. Assigned following another by name request, this time from regimental commander <a href="Lucien%20Grant%20Berry">Lucien Grant Berry</a>, McNair was responsible for procuring, storing, maintaining, accounting for, and distributing the regiment's materiel, including equipment and weapons. During 1915 and 1916, he was again assigned to the Field Artillery School, where he continued to work on procedures for the implementation of the firing table data he had published. He also continued to experiment with different types of artillery pieces so he could make manufacturing and procurement recommendations as the Army began to prepare for possible involvement in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. He returned to the 4th Field Artillery Regiment for the <a href="Pancho%20Villa%20Expedition">Pancho Villa Expedition</a> on the Texas-Mexico border; initially an unassigned staff officer available for additional duties, he later commanded a battery. In May 1917, he was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> and assigned to temporary duty as an instructor for the <a href="Officer%20Candidate%20School">officer training camp</a> at <a href="Camp%20Bullis">Leon Springs, Texas</a>.

In April 1917, the United States entered World War I. After his Leon Springs assignment, McNair was assigned to the <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Division</a>, then located at Camp Stewart, in <a href="El%20Paso%20County%2C%20Texas">El Paso County, Texas</a>. Assigned to the division headquarters as assistant chief of staff for training, McNair was given responsibility for the organization's pre-deployment mobilization, individual soldier training, and collective unit training. When the division departed for France, McNair shared quarters aboard ship with the division's assistant chief of staff for operations, <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a>. During their long ocean voyage, they forged a personal and professional bond that they maintained for the rest of their careers.

McNair was promoted to temporary <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a> in August 1917, soon after his arrival in France, and was assigned to the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Forces">American Expeditionary Forces</a> (AEF) headquarters as chief of artillery training and tactics in the AEF staff's training division (G-5). He was promoted to temporary <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> in June 1918, and temporary <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in October; at age 35, he was the youngest general officer in the Army. He continued to impress his superiors with his technical and tactical expertise, and at the end of the war he received the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">Distinguished Service Medal</a> from <a href="John%20J.%20Pershing">John J. Pershing</a> and the French <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honor</a> (Officer) from <a href="Philippe%20P%C3%A9tain">Philippe Pétain</a>.

In June 1919, McNair was named to the AEF board that was charged with studying the problem of how to provide adequate mobile indirect fire support to infantry during combat. This panel, called the Lassiter Board after its chairman, <a href="major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> William Lassiter, was one of several formed by the AEF to review wartime plans and activities, and make recommendations for the Army's future equipment, doctrine, and training.

McNair remained with the Lassiter Board only briefly because he received orders assigning him as one of the faculty members of the Army's <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College">School of the Line</a>. The school had ceased operations during the war and was being re-formed at <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a> to offer professional education to <a href="Field%20officer%23United%20States">field grade</a> officers on planning and overseeing the execution of operations at division level and above. McNair reverted to his permanent rank of major, and remained on the faculty until 1921.

In addition to receiving accolades for his work to help design and field the course curriculum, McNair also played a key role in another task traditionally assigned to the School of the Line: developing and promulgating the "<a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Army%20Field%20Manuals%23ADP.C2.A03.E2.80.930%20.28FM.C2.A03.E2.80.930.2C%20FM.C2.A0100.E2.80.935.2C%20Field%20Service%20Regulations.29">Field Service Regulations</a>", the Army's main document for codifying training and readiness doctrine. While on the School of the Line's faculty, he was one of the main authors of the 1923 revision of "Field Service Regulations". The officers who were assigned to the faculty and were responsible for restarting the School of the Line after World War I all received credit for having attended the course, including McNair.

In 1921, McNair was posted to <a href="Fort%20Shafter">Fort Shafter</a> and assigned as assistant chief of staff for operations (G-3) at the headquarters of the Army's <a href="Hawaiian%20Department">Hawaiian Department</a>. While in Hawaii, he became a participant in the Army’s ongoing debate over the best methods for providing coastal defense, which engaged proponents of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Coast%20Artillery%20Corps">Coast Artillery</a> branch and <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Service">Army Air Service</a>. Assigned to the project by Hawaiian Department commander Major General <a href="Charles%20Pelot%20Summerall">Charles Pelot Summerall</a> because of his reputation for objectivity in carrying out analysis and experimentation with military weapons and equipment, McNair created a committee made up of himself, two coast artillery officers, and an aviation officer to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the two branches, especially with regard to defending Army and Navy bases on <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>, and make recommendations on the best way to employ coast artillery and military aircraft.
The McNair board carried out numerous tests of coast artillery and bomber aircraft in a variety of conditions, and compiled tables and charts to depict the results. The panel concluded that coastal artillery was sufficient for shore defense, provided that adequate listening and lighting equipment for detecting and illuminating enemy ships and planes was available, and that bombers were less accurate, but more effective at destroying enemy ships at longer distances from shore, provided they could overcome obstacles including inclement weather.

In addition to his work on the coastal defense problem, McNair was also responsible for directing a review of <a href="War%20Plan%20Orange">War Plan Orange</a>, the Army and Navy joint defense plan for countering an attack on Hawaii by Japan. This possibility was a major concern of U.S. military leaders during the years between World War I and World War II. Among McNair's contributions to updating this plan was the creation of several contingency plans ("branches and sequels" in Army parlance) to augment the main war plan. These contingency plans included: using chemical weapons to defend against a Japanese attack, declaring martial law in Hawaii, and determining how to maintain a defense against Japanese invaders while waiting for reinforcements from the U.S. mainland.

In 1924 and 1925, McNair and Summerall defended McNair's work when it was criticized during the continuing debate about the future of the Army Air Service. The head of the Air Service, Major General <a href="Mason%20Patrick">Mason Patrick</a>, argued that the McNair board's findings underestimated the capabilities of <a href="bomber">bomber</a> aircraft, and that the data the board had compiled was inaccurate. In response, Major General <a href="Frank%20W.%20Coe">Frank W. Coe</a>, the chief of the Coast Artillery Corps, pointed out that McNair's panel included both Coast Artillery and Air Service officers, and that experiments with aircraft had included coast artillery officers as observers. In addition, the aircrews that participated in the McNair board experiments had the opportunity to provide input and voice concern over the board's methods and conclusions. Coe concluded his argument by recommending that the McNair board's findings be approved by the Army as its official position on the issue of coastal artillery versus bombers for shore defense. Coe's recommendation was not followed; subsequent panels and committees continued to investigate and debate the issue. In addition, the debate continued on the larger question of whether the Air Service should remain a component of the Army or become a separate branch of the military.

McNair's involvement in the issue continued during the 1925 court-martial of Brigadier General <a href="Billy%20Mitchell">Billy Mitchell</a>, whose zealous advocacy of creating a separate Air Force resulted in accusations of insubordination. Mitchell based his public assertions about non-aviation officers being ignorant of aviation matters on events he falsely claimed to have witnessed in Hawaii during the McNair board's experiments. Summerall was so incensed at the questioning of his and McNair's integrity that he attempted to be appointed as president of the court-martial. During Mitchell's trial, Major General <a href="Robert%20Courtney%20Davis">Robert Courtney Davis</a>, the Army's <a href="Adjutant%20General%23United%20States">adjutant general</a>, ordered Summerall and McNair to provide testimony. They refuted Mitchell's claims that during his time in Hawaii in 1923 the Hawaiian Department had no plan to defend Oahu from Japanese attack. They also demonstrated that Mitchell was incorrect in stating that the Air Service was not treated fairly in the distribution of resources in Hawaii; in fact, Summerall had reallocated funding, equipment and other items from other branches to the Air Service. Mitchell was convicted, and sentenced to a five-year suspension from active duty. He resigned from the Army so he could continue to advocate for the creation of a separate Air Force. Despite the controversy, McNair's work enhanced his reputation as an objective and innovative thinker, planner, and leader, and he remained under consideration for positions of increasing rank and responsibility.

In 1924, McNair was appointed professor of military science and tactics for the <a href="Reserve%20Officers%27%20Training%20Corps">Reserve Officers' Training Corps</a> (ROTC) program at <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a>. In accordance with the <a href="National%20Defense%20Act%20of%201920">National Defense Act of 1920</a>, ROTC offered a two-year course of instruction for <a href="freshmen">freshmen</a> and <a href="sophomore">sophomore</a>s, which was compulsory at many universities, including Purdue. The program also offered advanced instruction for <a href="Junior%20%28education%29">juniors</a> and <a href="senior%20%28education%29">seniors</a> who desired to continue military training and possibly earn a commission in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Reserve">Army Reserve</a>, <a href="Army%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a>, or <a href="Regular%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">Regular Army</a>. In addition to following this academic model, since 1919 Purdue had organized its ROTC cadets as a motorized field artillery unit, a circumstance which played to McNair's strengths.

Purdue's president, <a href="Edward%20C.%20Elliott">Edward C. Elliott</a>, was a strong advocate at the national level for ROTC, and a leading voice in opposition to the <a href="Pacifism%23Between%20the%20two%20World%20Wars">pacifist movement</a> which gained strength and influence following World War I. McNair became an advocate for military preparedness generally and ROTC specifically, and also argued in opposition to the pacifists. Already a prolific author of professional journal articles on technical military subjects, he penned numerous articles and letters in favor of military training and readiness, and in opposition to the pacifist movement. He also continued to write on Army-specific subjects, including articles that argued for reforming the Army's officer promotion system to replace seniority with merit as the primary consideration.

McNair also effected several positive changes to Purdue's ROTC program. As outlined by Elliott, Purdue ROTC had been the subject of several rapid leadership changes which had resulted in disorganization and low morale. McNair's leadership, technical expertise, and administrative abilities resulted in enhanced student participation and improved morale, and developed the program into the Army's largest light artillery unit. When the Chief of Field Artillery attempted to reassign McNair to <a href="Fort%20Bragg">Fort Bragg</a>, North Carolina, to lead revisions to the Army's field artillery regulations, Elliott protested; his request to keep McNair until the end of the usual four-year assignment for ROTC professors was granted, and McNair remained at Purdue until 1928.

In 1928, McNair was promoted to lieutenant colonel and entered the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20War%20College">United States Army War College</a>, the highest-level formal education program for Army officers. In the 1920s the curriculum had been revised so that the program of instruction concentrated on economic, industrial, and logistics issues related to large-scale wartime mobilizations, as well as the doctrine, strategy, and tactics requirements associated with organizing, training, deploying, and employing large scale units for combat (typically division and above). In addition to completing seminars on staff functions (G-1 for personnel, G-2 for intelligence, G-3 for operations and training, and G-4 for logistics), McNair and his War College classmates served on committees that studied war plans and suggested improvements, reviewed regulations and proposed updates, and studied and discussed strategic-level foreign and defense policy issues to improve their understanding. Among his classmates were several officers who became prominent during World War II, including: <a href="Simon%20Bolivar%20Buckner%20Jr.">Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr.</a>, <a href="Roy%20Geiger">Roy Geiger</a>, <a href="Oscar%20Griswold">Oscar Griswold</a>, <a href="Clarence%20R.%20Huebner">Clarence R. Huebner</a>, <a href="Troy%20H.%20Middleton">Troy H. Middleton</a>, and <a href="Franklin%20C.%20Sibert">Franklin C. Sibert</a>.

Upon graduating, McNair received an evaluation of "superior", with a recommendation from the commandant that he be considered for high command or a senior staff position on the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> General Staff. In addition, the commandant forwarded to the War Department McNair's final research project on ways for the department to maximize efficiency when allocating funding for unit training, calling it "a study of exceptional merit made at the War College".

After his War College graduation, McNair was assigned as assistant commandant of the Field Artillery Center and School. In this position, he worked with the school's Gunnery Department to address field artillery doctrine issues that had lingered since World War I, including limited mobility, inadequate communications, and overly detailed fire direction techniques. Successive Gunnery Department directors Jacob Devers, <a href="Carlos%20Brewer">Carlos Brewer</a>, and <a href="Orlando%20Ward">Orlando Ward</a> recognized that continuing improvement to innovations including machine guns and tanks made the static trench warfare of World War I unlikely to be repeated. As a result, they experimented with new techniques, including increasing the speed of artillery support to mobile armor and infantry by empowering Artillery-qualified fire support officers attached to those formations to direct artillery fire. In addition, they pioneered techniques to enhance accuracy, including forward observers who could direct rounds onto targets based on seeing their impact, rather than the unobserved timed fire and rolling barrages that had prevailed in World War I. McNair supported these innovations, and prevented interference from senior officers who tried to block them.
Devers, Brewer, and Ward also argued for directing artillery from the battalion level rather than the battery level. In their view, massing artillery and centrally controlling it from a brigade fire direction center enabled senior commanders to rapidly provide direct support to the areas on the battlefield where it was most needed. McNair had advocated this tactic since World War I; he again agreed with the Gunnery Department, and worked to help implement this doctrinal change while also protecting the Gunnery Department from outside interference. Over time, improvements to communications equipment and procedures and changes to doctrine enabled implementation of many of these changes, and they largely became the standard by which field artillery units conducted operations in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

At the completion of McNair's assignment as deputy commandant in 1933, he received the highest marks on his efficiency report, along with recommendations for promotion to colonel, and assignment to regimental or brigade command.

McNair commanded 2nd Battalion, <a href="16th%20Field%20Artillery%20Regiment">16th Field Artillery Regiment</a> at Fort Bragg from July 1 through October 1, 1933, when organizational changes re-designated the unit as 2nd Battalion, <a href="83rd%20Field%20Artillery%20Regiment">83rd Field Artillery Regiment</a>. McNair commanded the renamed unit until August 1934, and led it through its renaming and reorganization.

In August 1934, McNair was assigned to command of <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC) District E, part of the VII <a href="Corps%20Area">Corps Area</a>. Headquartered at <a href="Camp%20Beauregard">Camp Beauregard</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, District E was composed of thousands of CCC members based at 33 camps throughout Louisiana and Mississippi. As with other Regular Army officers who took part in organizing and operating the CCC, McNair's work to plan, direct, and supervise the activities over a wide area gave him practical experience at mobilizing, housing, feeding, providing medical care for, supervising, and improving the physical and mental resilience of thousands of young members. This experience working with large bodies of men was an asset as McNair ascended into the Army's senior ranks. In addition, McNair benefited from the experience of working with civilian government leaders to plan and direct CCC activities, which was also put to good use in his later assignments as one of the Army's highest-level commanders. He was promoted to colonel in May 1935.

With his promotion to colonel, McNair was assigned as executive officer for the Army's Chief of Field Artillery. In addition to carrying out the usual administrative duties of the position, such as managing the chief's appointment calendar and handling his correspondence, McNair was able to continue experimenting with and testing field artillery equipment and weapons, including trips to <a href="Aberdeen%20Proving%20Ground">Aberdeen Proving Ground</a> in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> to test the <a href="25%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20anti-tank%20gun">Hotchkiss Anti-Tank Gun</a> and <a href="25%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20anti-aircraft%20gun">Hotchkiss Anti-Aircraft Gun</a>. He also studied and authored articles on the use of <a href="autogyro">autogyro</a>s for field artillery targeting and indirect fire observation, which anticipated the use of <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s in modern warfare. In January 1937, McNair was promoted to brigadier general.

In March 1937, McNair was assigned to command of the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade, a unit of the <a href="2nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Infantry Division</a>, then based at <a href="Fort%20Sam%20Houston">Fort Sam Houston</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. The Army continued to experiment with equipment, weapons, and organizational design as it moved towards mechanization and modernization; the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Army Chief of Staff</a> directed tests of the <a href="triangular%20division">triangular division</a> concept (as opposed to the <a href="square%20division">square division</a> of World War I) through creation of a Proposed Infantry Division (PID). The 2nd Infantry Division was selected to conduct the tests, and McNair performed additional duty as the PID's chief of staff. In this position, he managed and supervised the PID's design, field tests, after-action reviews, and reports and recommendations to the War Department.

The triangular division model was adopted, and became the Army's standard design for infantry divisions in World War II. In his annual performance appraisal, his division commander, Major General <a href="James%20K.%20Parsons">James K. Parsons</a>, rated McNair as superior, and recommended him for assignment as a corps or army chief of staff. On the question of how McNair compared to his peers (unique to the appraisals of general officers), Parsons rated McNair second of the 40 generals personally known to him. McNair remained in command of the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade until March 1939, when he was appointed to serve as commandant of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College">Command and General Staff College</a>.

The Chief of Staff of the Army, General <a href="Malin%20Craig">Malin Craig</a>, selected McNair to command the Command and General Staff College because he believed its teaching methods needed to be updated, and that the combat unit planning and reporting processes it taught needed to be streamlined. Craig felt that McNair's background made him ideally suited to lead this effort; in addition, Craig's deputy, Brigadier General <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a>, believed that the Command and General Staff College program of instruction was too rigid and too focused on a staff process geared towards leadership of Regular Army units. In Marshall's view, the curriculum needed to be overhauled to reflect the likely needs of the World War II army, including faster, more flexible methods for planning and execution of large scale mobilizations, and incorporation of processes for training draftees and members of the National Guard, who would report for duty with less training and experience than members of the Regular Army. In addition, Marshall wanted to ensure that graduates were prepared to plan and execute the offensive maneuver-based operations Army leaders anticipated would characterize World War II, as opposed to the defensive trench warfare of World War I.

In addition to modernizing the curriculum, McNair reduced the course length to accommodate the civilian schedules of National Guard and Reserve officers, many of whom would otherwise be unable to attend. While working to update and streamline the curriculum, McNair updated the Army's core doctrine, the "Field Service Manual". He began his service as commandant in time to finalize publication of the 1939 edition, which was divided into three Field Manuals (FMs): FM 100-5, "Operations"; FM 100-10,
"Administration"; and FM 100-15, "Large Units". Because of criticism of the 1939 edition, McNair almost immediately began work on an update, with Marshall, now the Army's Chief of Staff, directing that it be published no later than January 1, 1941. The work on the 1941 edition was still in progress when McNair was again reassigned; when it was published it became the primary doctrinal document for the Army's World War II activities. His efficiency reports continued to reflect his superior performance; for the first appraisal he received while commandant, Craig rated McNair second of the 41 brigadier generals he knew. In an evaluation of his performance in his additional duty as commander of the Fort Leavenworth post, Major General <a href="Percy%20Poe%20Bishop">Percy Poe Bishop</a>, commander of the VII Corps Area, ranked McNair fifth of the 31 brigadier generals he knew. By the time of his second appraisal as commandant, the War Department had waived the requirement for written evaluations of officers supervised directly by the Army Chief of Staff, but in his second role as commander of Fort Leavenworth, Bishop rated McNair as superior in all areas, recommended him for a high level command in combat, and ranked him first of the more than 30 brigadier generals Bishop knew.

In July 1940, McNair began his new assignment as chief of staff for <a href="Army%20Ground%20Forces%23Origins">General Headquarters, United States Army</a> (GHQ), the organization the Army created to oversee World War II mobilization, organization, equipping, and training. Marshall was appointed to command GHQ in addition to his duties as Chief of Staff of the Army; in order to concentrate on his primary role, he largely delegated responsibility for running GHQ to McNair. As part of this working relationship, Marshall provided McNair broad advice and guidance, and McNair obtained approval from Marshall for the most important decisions. As GHQ's responsibilities increased following U.S. entry into the war, McNair's responsibilities were encroached upon by members of the War Department staff; for instance, the logistics staff section (G-4) retained authority over <a href="corps%20area">corps area</a> commands in matters involving billeting, equipping, and supplying soldiers undergoing mobilization training, which limited GHQ's ability to plan them and oversee their execution.

In response, McNair proposed establishing GHQ's unity of command over the Army's four <a href="Field%20army">field armies</a> and eight corps areas; under his concept, each corps area headquarters would have responsibility for all administrative functions within their areas of responsibility, enabling GHQ and the field armies, corps, and divisions to focus on organizing, training, and administering the mobilized troop units that were preparing to go overseas. Though Marshall was initially receptive, members of the War Department General Staff disagreed with McNair's proposal, and Marshall concurred with them.

The small GHQ staff Marshall assembled included representatives from each of the Army's major field branches – <a href="Infantry%20Branch%20%28United%20States%29">Infantry</a>, Field Artillery, <a href="United%20States%20Cavalry">Cavalry</a>, Coast Artillery, <a href="Armor%20Branch%20%28United%20States%29">Armor</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Engineer%20School">Engineers</a>, and <a href="Signal%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Signal</a>, along with liaison officers representing the National Guard and Army Reserve. As operations tempo increased, the staff expanded to include functional area representatives (G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4). Among the individuals who served on the GHQ staff were <a href="Lloyd%20D.%20Brown">Lloyd D. Brown</a>, who later succeeded <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a> as commander of the <a href="28th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">28th Infantry Division</a>, and <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark W. Clark</a>, who went on to command the <a href="15th%20Army%20Group">15th Army Group</a>. McNair's National Guard liaison was Kenneth Buchanan, who later served as assistant division commander of both the 28th and <a href="9th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">9th</a> Infantry Divisions, and commanded the <a href="Illinois%20National%20Guard">Illinois National Guard</a> as a major general after the war.
As GHQ chief of staff, McNair played a leading role in planning and conducting the 1940 and 1941 <a href="Louisiana%20Maneuvers">Louisiana Maneuvers</a> and <a href="Carolina%20Maneuvers">Carolina Maneuvers</a>, large scale war games that enabled the Army to observe and draw conclusions with respect to training, doctrine, leadership, and other items of interest, which in turn led to changes in doctrine, equipment, and weapons. In addition, these maneuvers were used to identify which senior officers were most capable, enabling the Army to assign the best performers to command and top level staff positions, and relieve or reassign those perceived as less capable. McNair was promoted to temporary major general in September 1940, and temporary <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a> in June 1941.

The War Department also assigned GHQ operational responsibilities, including planning for the defenses of facilities in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, and <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. McNair generally delegated the responsibility for this aspect of GHQ activities to his deputy, Brigadier General <a href="Harry%20J.%20Malony">Harry J. Malony</a>, so that he could concentrate on GHQ's organizational and training responsibilities, but maintained overall control of each role. McNair established the GHQ on the site of the Army War College (now the location of the <a href="National%20War%20College">National War College</a>) at Washington Barracks (now <a href="Fort%20Lesley%20J.%20McNair">Fort Lesley J. McNair</a>), as the college had been closed for the duration of the war. McNair continued to command Army Ground Forces from this location rather than moving into <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> when its construction was completed in 1943.

In March 1942, the Army eliminated the General Headquarters in favor of three new functional commands: Army Ground Forces (AGF), commanded by McNair; the <a href="Army%20Air%20Forces">Army Air Forces</a> (AAF), commanded by Lieutenant General <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Henry H. Arnold</a>; and the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Services%20of%20Supply">Services of Supply</a> (later the <a href="Army%20Service%20Forces">Army Service Forces</a> or ASF), commanded by Lieutenant General <a href="Brehon%20B.%20Somervell">Brehon B. Somervell</a>. McNair's task at AGF was to expand the Army's ground forces from their March 1942 strength of 780,000 officers and men to more than 2.2 million by July 1943, and more than 8 million by 1945. His duties grew significantly, and included all Army boards, formal schools, training centers, and mobilization camps, as well as special activities having to do with the four combat arms (<a href="Infantry%20Branch%20%28United%20States%29">Infantry</a>, <a href="Field%20Artillery%20Branch%20%28United%20States%29">Field Artillery</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Cavalry">Cavalry</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Coast%20Artillery%20Corps">Coast Artillery</a>). As part of this reorganization, the Army eliminated the branch chief positions which had been responsible for these arms, transferring their authority to McNair. In addition, he had authority over four new "quasi-arms" which did not fall under the traditional combat arms – <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Airborne%20School">Airborne</a>, <a href="Armor%20Branch%20%28United%20States%29">Armor</a>, <a href="Tank%20destroyer%20battalion%20%28United%20States%29">Tank Destroyer</a>, and <a href="Air%20Defense%20Artillery%20Branch%20%28United%20States%29%23History">Antiaircraft Artillery</a>.

The Army intended for this reorganization to end inter-branch rivalries and competition for pre-eminence and resources; in fact it met with mixed success as advocates for each branch continued to argue among themselves. Additionally, competition for authority and resources also emerged between the War Department General Staff and the three functional commands, and between the functional commands themselves. Used to working with minimal delegation, and functioning with a small staff, McNair largely concentrated on the task at hand, and avoided the rivalries as much as possible. Despite this approach, he was still involved in controversies with the other functional commands, including an ongoing rivalry over allocation of the best qualified recruits and draftees.

McNair organized and supervised instruction in basic soldiering skills, to help individuals become proficient generalists prepared for more complex unit training. Once individuals were qualified, units carried out collective training, beginning with the lowest level, and continuing to build through successive echelons until divisions, corps, and armies were capable of carrying out large scale simulated force-against-force exercises. He insisted that training be conducted in realistic conditions, including the use of live ammunition, or simulators that replicated live ammunition, so that soldiers and commanders would be prepared to fight once they deployed overseas.

McNair had difficulty implementing a training program for National Guard units, chiefly because of their lack of prior military experience other than monthly drills and short annual training periods. He recommended a wholesale demobilization of the National Guard; Marshall and the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> disagreed, partly because they anticipated political backlash, and partly because the manpower they provided was in demand. McNair also found National Guard senior commanders wanting; in his view, National Guard officers should not progress beyond the grade of colonel, and professional full-time officers should command at the division level and above. In this, he was mostly successful; all but two National Guard division commanders were replaced by regular Army officers, and most National Guard generals carried out stateside assignments, or non-combat overseas assignments. Some served in roles below division commander (such as assistant division commander), or carried out administrative and training roles, such as provost marshal or school commandant. In addition, some accepted reductions in rank so they could serve in overseas assignments.

Original War Department estimates called for the Army to raise, equip, train, and deploy as many as 350 <a href="Division%20%28military%29%23U.S.%20Army">divisions</a>. Later estimates revised this number downward to between 200 and 220. One factor that enabled this downward revision was that U.S. divisions were better equipped in some areas of their organizations than those of their adversaries, particularly later in the war; for example, every U.S. division was completely mechanized, while German divisions relied on as many as 4,000 horses for transporting soldiers, supplies, and artillery. A variety of other factors, including the entry of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> into the war on the side of the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> after <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> broke his non-aggression pact with <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> by launching <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>, the need to ensure that enough farmers and agricultural workers were available for food production, and the need to maintain a U.S. workforce large enough to handle the production of weapons, vehicles, ammunition, and other equipment caused Army Chief of Staff Marshall to decide that maintaining the Army's ground combat strength at 90 divisions would strike the balance between too few soldiers to defeat the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>, and so many that there were not enough civilians in the U.S. workforce.

To accomplish this goal, McNair and the AGF staff created new division manning and equipping tables, which reduced the number of soldiers required to man a division. By 1945, this initiative had accomplished Marshall's goal by enabling the Army to field 89 divisions with the same number of soldiers required to man 73 divisions in 1943.

The Army's effort to create and field a number of divisions sufficient to achieve victory also included the creation of <a href="Airborne%20force">airborne units</a>. The Army had begun testing and experimenting with airborne formations in 1940; by 1943, <a href="William%20C.%20Lee">William C. Lee</a>, an early proponent of airborne forces, had convinced McNair of the need for division-sized airborne organizations. Though McNair and a few other Army leaders sometimes advocated for creation of all-purpose light divisions that could be adapted for unique missions, the Army did create some specialized divisions, including airborne. This initiative included activating the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Airborne%20School">Airborne Command</a> to oversee the organization and training of airborne units, conversion of the <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division">82nd</a> and <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division">101st</a> Infantry Divisions to airborne, and preparation of these divisions for paratrooper and glider missions in Europe.

Another initiative McNair incorporated into the effort to field the Army's World War II division was the creation of light divisions. Recognizing that the rugged terrain of the Italian mountains and <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">Pacific jungles</a> required specialized units, the AGF reorganized three existing divisions as the <a href="89th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">89th Light Division (Truck)</a>, <a href="10th%20Mountain%20Division">10th Light Division (Pack, Alpine)</a>, and <a href="71st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">71st Light Division (Pack, Jungle)</a>. The results of pre-deployment training demonstrated that the 71st and 89th Divisions were too small to sustain themselves in combat, so they were converted back to regular infantry divisions. The 10th Division's early training results were also less than encouraging, but its identity as a mountain division was retained, and after completing training it served in <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">combat in the Italian mountains</a>.

Overall, the Army's wartime division organization and reorganizations have been judged a success by historians, in that they provided an adequate number of units to win the war, while ensuring that agricultural and industrial production could continue.

As AGF commander, McNair worked to solve the problem of how to integrate replacement soldiers into units that had sustained casualties. Rather than adopt the model of replacing units that had sustained high casualties with new, full strength units, Marshall and McNair cited the need to allocate space on transport ships to equipment and supplies as the reason to provide individual replacement soldiers to units while the units remained in combat. In practice, the individual replacement system caused difficulties for both the replacement soldiers and the units they joined, especially during later stages of the war. New soldiers could have difficulty being accepted by the veterans of their units, since they were replacing buddies who had been killed or wounded, and had not shared the veterans' combat experiences. In addition, because new soldiers joined units that were already in the fight, there was often no time to teach them the tactics and techniques that increased their chances of surviving on the battlefield.

Though soldiers were supposed to be allocated to requesting units from replacement depots based on their qualifications and the priority of the unit, McNair found that in practice many commanders in the combat theaters used replacement soldiers to form new units, or personally selected individual replacements from personnel centers without regard to their qualifications. Assigning soldiers to units for which they were not qualified, such as armor crewmen to infantry units, negated the training they had received before going overseas. To address these concerns, McNair advocated faster qualification of replacement soldiers by reducing their training from 24 weeks to 13. The War Department reduced the training requirement to 17 weeks, but mandated continued use of the individual replacement system.
Because the AGF had responsibility for implementing the individual replacement system, McNair attempted improvements, including directing the establishment of the Classification and Replacement Division within his command, and streamlining the physical, psychological, and mental criteria used to determine fitness for service. Issues with the ASF's management of replacement centers within the United States led AGF to establish two new ones at <a href="Fort%20Meade%2C%20Maryland">Fort Meade, Maryland</a>, and <a href="Fort%20Ord">Fort Ord</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. Because infantry soldiers suffered disproportionately high casualties in combat, McNair argued for, but only partially succeeded in procuring recruits and draftees deemed high quality (typically those with the most education and highest aptitude test scores) for the AGF. In addition, he undertook several initiatives to improve the morale and "esprit de corps" of infantry soldiers, and enhance the goodwill of the civilian population towards the infantry, including creation of the <a href="Expert%20Infantryman%20Badge">Expert Infantryman Badge</a>, and implementation of the "Soldier for a Day Initiative", which gave civilian government and business leaders the opportunity to interact with mobilized soldiers before they left the United States for combat assignments.

These initiatives were not always successful; by late 1944 and early 1945, the number of units fighting continuously or nearly continuously caused the replacement system to break down. As a result, rear echelon soldiers were often pulled from their duties to fill vacancies in front line combat units, and training for some replacement soldiers and units was cut short so they could be rushed into combat. Some units were worn down to the point of combat ineffectiveness. In others, low morale, fatigue, and sickness became more prevalent.

Because of the difficulty in attracting to the AGF those trainees deemed to be "high-quality", McNair attempted to recruit through improved public relations. One part of this effort was the creation of an office attached to the AGF staff, the Special Information Section (SIS). Approximately 12 officers and enlisted soldiers with experience as writers and editors worked in the SIS to promote improved public appreciation for AGF soldiers, especially the infantry. In addition, the SIS worked with civilian writers and editors, musicians, cartoonists, film makers, and artists who worked in other mediums to enhance the prominence of infantrymen in their work. As part of this initiative, McNair wrote personally to several leading magazine and newspaper publishers to ask for their aid.

In another effort to inform the public of the Army's personnel needs and improve the way the AGF was perceived, on <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a> in November 1942, McNair delivered a radio address over the <a href="Blue%20Network">Blue Network</a>. In his remarks, titled "The Struggle is for Survival", McNair described the fighting capability and ruthless attitude of soldiers in the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%23World%20War%20II">Japanese</a> and <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German</a> armies, and stated that only similar qualities in American ground troops – by implication, meaning not "the more genteel forms of warfare" practiced by the AAF and ASF – would see the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> through to victory. The public response to McNair's remarks was largely favorable, though he did receive some criticism for extreme language that seemed to suggest an unfeeling attitude towards death and destruction. More importantly, McNair's radio address did little to improve recruiting into the Army Ground Forces; the public may have developed a better appreciation for infantry, armor, and artillery, but volunteers and draftees continued to be attracted to the AAF and ASF, and the AAF and ASF continued to lobby for the bulk of new service members in the high quality category to be assigned to them.

During World War II, War Department regulations for <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> required that they be admitted into the Army in numbers proportionate to their share of the population. In addition, the Army was required to establish segregated African American units in each major branch of the service, and give qualified African Americans the opportunity to earn officer commissions. The AGF worked to reconcile these requirements with its mission of producing trained soldiers and units that were capable of meeting and defeating the enemy in battle. To that end, the AGF activated and trained African American units in all major branches of the ground forces, and black soldiers who graduated from <a href="Officer%20Candidate%20School%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">officer candidate school</a>s (OCS) were assigned to African American units as they received their commissions. At the peak of the Army’s expansion in June 1943, there were nearly 170,000 African Americans training at AGF facilities, or about 10.5 percent of its personnel strength. These figures were in line with the War Department requirements; at the time, African Americans accounted for between 10 and 11 percent of the U.S. population.
Beginning with a small number of African American units in the Regular Army and National Guard, the AGF organized and trained many more, including the African-American <a href="92nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">92nd</a> and <a href="93rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">93rd</a> Infantry Divisions, and the <a href="2nd%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Cavalry Division</a>. By 1943, the AGF had created nearly 300 African American units, including the <a href="452nd%20Anti-Aircraft%20Artillery%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion</a>, the <a href="555th%20Parachute%20Infantry%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">555th Parachute Infantry Battalion</a>, and the <a href="761st%20Tank%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">761st Tank Battalion</a>.

The War Department General Staff initially suggested incorporating African Americans into units with white soldiers at a ratio of 1 black to 10.6 whites. Based on difficulties with completing training, in large part because the abilities of the recruits were lagging as a result of having grown up in the segregated education system and culture then prevalent in the United States, McNair advocated for separate battalions of African American soldiers, arguing that they could be more effectively employed in this manner. In McNair’s construct, such units could be deployed for functions including guarding lines of communication in rear areas and near front lines, or maintained as a reserve by division and corps commanders and committed where they were most needed during combat. The proposal that was adopted was closer to what McNair had advocated, and the AGF lengthened the initial training period. African American officers generally filled company grade positions as they completed OCS, with white officers holding the field grade and senior command positions. In cases where there were not enough African Americans, white officers filled the company grade positions as well.

Developing and employing anti-tank weapons and creating suitable doctrine proved to be an ongoing challenge, for which some historians have faulted McNair. Marshall favored creation of self-propelled anti-tank weapons; McNair had long favored towed weapons, including the <a href="37%20mm%20Gun%20M3">M3</a> gun. McNair recognized the limitations of the anti-tank weapons then available, and favored a defensive approach for their use, advocating that units emplace and camouflage them, but official doctrine called for a more offensive mindset. It also called for anti-tank units to conduct independent operations; McNair favored a combined arms approach. He believed the use of anti-tank weapons was an economical and efficient means to defeat enemy tanks, and would free up U.S. tanks for wider offensive operations.

When the M3 anti-tank gun proved to be a less than optimum anti-tank weapon, the Army began development of <a href="tank%20destroyer">tank destroyer</a>s – self-propelled tracked vehicles with a gun capable of engaging a tank, but which were faster and more maneuverable because they had thinner armor than a tank. When it appeared that the Infantry and Cavalry branch chiefs might subsume proposed tank destroyer units into their own task organizations, Marshall attempted to continue progress on tank destroyer development without generating active dissent by approving creation of the Tank Destroyer Center at <a href="Fort%20Hood">Camp Hood</a>. In practice, the separate Tank Destroyer Center meant that commanders of armor and infantry units had little or no experience with anti-tank weapons, or the most effective way to employ them.
After having initially fielded the anti-tank weapon it had available – the M3 towed gun – the Army began to field self-propelled anti-tank weapons, first the <a href="M3%20Gun%20Motor%20Carriage">M3 Gun Motor Carriage</a>, and then the <a href="M10%20tank%20destroyer">M10 tank destroyer</a>. As a result of the Army's inability to resolve the questions of equipment and doctrine, it continued to struggle with efforts to develop viable anti-tank doctrine, and efforts to employ anti-tank guns or tank destroyers as part of combined arms team often proved ineffective.

The ongoing debate within the Army about which type of anti-tank or tank destroyer weapon to use, and what design specifications ought to be included, also hampered the AGF's abilities to field the weapons and provide adequate training. As a result, during their initial employment and use, AGF observers in combat theaters identified several issues, including some as basic as training ammunition for the M3 Gun Motor Carriage being used unknowingly during combat, which obviously limited its effectiveness. Over time, commanders in combat resorted to field expedient measures to solve the problems, including learning to employ anti-tank guns and later tank destroyers in mutually supporting positions, and integrating them with infantry and armor units to maximize their effectiveness as part of a combined arms effort. The AGF in turn incorporated these lessons learned into mobilization training, so that over time soldiers and units deploying for combat were making use of the most up to date doctrine and tactics.

At the start of World War II, the United States fielded the <a href="M3%20Lee">M3 Lee</a> and <a href="M4%20Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> as its primary medium tanks. After action reports from the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a> and other engagements convinced commanders including <a href="Jacob%20L.%20Devers">Jacob L. Devers</a> that the U.S needed to deploy a heavier tank with more firepower in order to counter German <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger I</a> and <a href="Panther%20tank">Panther</a> tanks. During his assignment as Chief of Armor earlier in the war, Devers had rejected the <a href="M6%20heavy%20tank">M6 heavy tank</a> for being under-powered and under-gunned for its weight and size. As a result, the Army's Ordnance Department had overseen the creation of the <a href="T20%20Medium%20Tank">T20 Medium Tank</a>. In 1942, Devers advocated the immediate shipment of 250 T20s to the European Theater. McNair opposed this request, still convinced that smaller but heavily armed self-propelled tank destroyers could be employed faster and more effectively, especially when considering factors such as available space on cargo ships transporting weapons and equipment to Europe. The Army attempted development of an improved version of the T20, the <a href="T20%20Medium%20Tank%23T23%20series">T23</a>, but design flaws kept it from being moved into production.

In December 1943, Devers and other commanders with tank experience succeeded in convincing George Marshall of the need for a tank with more armor and firepower than the M3 and M4. An improved prototype, the T26, was produced as the <a href="M26%20Pershing">M26 Pershing</a>, and the Army ordered 250 Pershings. McNair was opposed, stating that the M4 was adequate, and arguing that tank-on-tank battles requiring the U.S. to employ heavier tanks with bigger guns were unlikely to occur. The Pershings were fielded, but arrived in Europe too late to have an effect on the conduct of the war.

McNair's views on the employment of tanks also factored into reorganizations of the Army's armored divisions. The <a href="Armor%20Branch%20%28United%20States%29">Armored Force</a> had been created in 1940, and grew to include <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20divisions%20during%20World%20War%20II%23Armored%20Divisions">16 divisions</a>, though McNair unsuccessfully recommended reducing the number to six. The Armored Force created an armored corps headquarters in 1942, but it was deactivated at McNair's instigation after only a few months. In addition to arguing against the need for an armored corps, McNair believed the task organization for an armored division to be too large and unwieldy, again presuming that tanks would primarily serve as an exploitation force for rapid advances and as infantry support, but were not likely to engage in tank-on-tank battles. As a result, he played a key role in downsizing the armored divisions in 1942 and 1943, with the 1943 reorganization reducing the divisions by 4,000 soldiers and between 130 and 140 tanks. The downsizing enabled the creation of <a href="separate%20tank%20battalion">separate tank battalion</a>s, which could be deployed to support infantry divisions on an as-needed basis. (The downsizing did not affect the 2nd or 3rd Armored Divisions, which maintained their "heavy" task organization.)

In 1943, McNair traveled to North Africa on an inspection tour of AGF troops to acquire firsthand information about the effectiveness of training and doctrine, with the goal of making improvements in AGF's mobilization and training process. On April 23, he was observing front line troops in action in Tunisia when he sustained shrapnel wounds to his arm and head; a company <a href="first%20sergeant">first sergeant</a> standing nearby was killed.

McNair deployed to the European Theater in 1944; his assignment was initially undetermined, and Marshall and <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, the supreme commander in Europe, considered him for command of the <a href="Fifteenth%20United%20States%20Army">Fifteenth United States Army</a> or the fictional <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army%20Group">First United States Army Group</a> (FUSAG). With Lieutenant General George S. Patton, the FUSAG commander, slated to take command of the actual <a href="Third%20United%20States%20Army">Third United States Army</a> after the invasion, the Army required another commander with a recognizable name and sufficient prestige to continue the <a href="Operation%20Quicksilver%20%28deception%20plan%29">Operation Quicksilver</a> deception that masked the actual landing sites for <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>, the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Normandy">Invasion of Normandy</a>. Eisenhower requested McNair as Patton's FUSAG successor, and Marshall approved.
In July 1944, McNair was in France to observe troops in action during <a href="Operation%20Cobra">Operation Cobra</a>, and add to the FUSAG deception by making the Germans believe he was in France to exercise command. He was killed near <a href="Saint-L%C3%B4">Saint-Lô</a> on July 25, when errant bombs of the <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a> fell on the positions of 2nd Battalion, <a href="120th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">120th Infantry</a>, where McNair was observing the fighting. In one of the first Allied efforts to use heavy bombers in support of ground combat troops, several planes dropped their bombs short of their targets. Over 100 U.S. soldiers were killed, and nearly 500 wounded.
McNair was buried at the <a href="Normandy%20American%20Cemetery%20and%20Memorial">Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial</a> in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, <a href="France">France</a>; his funeral was kept secret to maintain the FUSAG deception, and was attended only by his aide and Generals Omar Bradley, George S. Patton, <a href="Courtney%20Hodges">Courtney Hodges</a>, and <a href="Elwood%20Quesada">Elwood Quesada</a>. When his death was reported by the press, initial accounts indicated he had been killed by enemy fire; not until August were the actual circumstances reported in the news media. McNair is the highest-ranking military officer buried at the Normandy cemetery. Along with <a href="Frank%20Maxwell%20Andrews">Frank Maxwell Andrews</a>, <a href="Simon%20Bolivar%20Buckner%2C%20Jr.">Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.</a>, and <a href="Millard%20Harmon">Millard Harmon</a>, he was one of four American lieutenant generals who died in World War II. McNair's tombstone originally indicated his rank of lieutenant general. In 1954, Buckner and he were posthumously promoted to general by an act of Congress. The <a href="American%20Battle%20Monuments%20Commission">American Battle Monuments Commission</a> (ABMC) did not upgrade McNair's gravestone; upon being informed in 2010 that the original marker was still in place, the ABMC replaced McNair's headstone with one that indicates the higher rank.

While generally in excellent physical condition even as he aged, McNair began to experience hearing loss early in his career. The condition progressed, and included <a href="tinnitus">tinnitus</a>, but did not interfere with his work; physical examinations indicated he had no trouble with tasks including speaking on the telephone. By the time he reached the ranks of the Army's senior commanders, his hearing loss was severe enough that he compensated by <a href="Lip%20reading">reading lips</a>, and by forgoing participation in events where his difficulty in hearing would pose an obstacle, such as large conferences. By the late 1930s, he worried that his hearing condition might result in his mandatory retirement for medical reasons. Instead, Marshall issued a waiver which allowed him to continue to serve. His hearing loss may have prevented him from obtaining a field command during World War II, but Marshall was unwilling to do without his abilities as an organizer and trainer.

McNair was held in high regard by his contemporaries, as evidenced by performance appraisals that routinely gave him the highest possible ratings. Marshall also held McNair in high esteem, as demonstrated by the fact that McNair was a top stateside commander during World War II, was considered for a top command in Europe, and was ultimately selected to command the First United States Army Group as part of a deception plan that required a general with a good reputation and high name recognition for successful execution. In addition, soon after McNair was assigned to serve as commandant of the Command and General Staff School, Marshall learned that he would become the Chief of Staff of the Army. In a letter to McNair, Marshall wrote: "You at the head of Leavenworth are one of the great satisfactions I have at the moment in visualizing the responsibilities of the next couple of years." <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark W. Clark</a> served under McNair as operations officer (G-3) at AGF Headquarters before ascending to the general officer ranks. In his autobiography, Clark referred to McNair as "one of the most brilliant, selfless and devoted soldiers" he had ever encountered.

McNair's primary legacy was his role as "the brains of the Army", in that his involvement in unit design (the triangular division), education (the Command and General Staff Officer Course), doctrine (updating the "Field Service Manual" and revising field artillery methods and procedures), weapons design and procurement (experimentation with field artillery, anti-tank weapons, and anti-aircraft weapons), and training of soldiers and units (as commander of Army Ground Forces), especially in the era between World Wars I and II, made him one of the primary architects of the Army as the United States employed it for World War II.

Another enduring McNair legacy was his training method of beginning with basic soldier skills and then building through successive echelons until large units became proficient during exercises and war games that closely simulated combat. These concepts remain the Army's core principles for planning, executing, and overseeing individual and collective training.

McNair's decisions and actions during World War II continue to be debated by historians, particularly the individual replacement system and the difficulties with resolving the issue of tanks versus anti-tank guns and tank destroyers.

With respect to the individual replacement program, historian <a href="Stephen%20Ambrose">Stephen Ambrose</a> described it as inefficient, wasteful, and a contributor to unnecessary casualties. However, some recent assessments have viewed it more favorably. As one example, a 2013 essay by Robert S. Rush concluded "Success results NOT from rotating organizations in and out of combat but from sustaining those organizations while in combat."

On the questions of fielding anti-tank guns and tank destroyers as the primary anti-armor weapons, and fielding light and medium tanks instead of a heavy tank capable of matching those in German armor units, historians including Mark Calhoun argue that McNair recognized the limitations of the anti-tank weapons then available, and the difficulties with providing better ones given time and production constraints, and so worked to develop a doctrine that made the best possible use of the weapons that were available. Other historians, including Steve Zaloga, argue that McNair's opposition to development and fielding of heavy tanks represented a "World War I mindset" that hindered the overall performance of the US Army during World War II.

McNair received the <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a> of <a href="LL.D.">LL.D.</a> from <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a> in 1941 and the <a href="University%20of%20Maine">University of Maine</a> in 1943. The Lesley J. McNair Bridge was a temporary structure over the <a href="Rhine%20River">Rhine River</a> in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>; it stood from 1945 until it was dismantled after the erection of a permanent bridge in 1946. <a href="Washington%20Barracks">Washington Barracks</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> was renamed <a href="Fort%20Lesley%20J.%20McNair">Fort Lesley J.

Roads and buildings on several U.S. Army posts carry the name "McNair", including McNair Avenue and McNair Hall (<a href="Fort%20Sill">Fort Sill</a>), McNair Road (<a href="Joint%20Base%20Myer%E2%80%93Henderson%20Hall">Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall</a>), McNair Drive (<a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe</a>), and McNair Hall (<a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a>). <a href="McNair%20Barracks">McNair Barracks</a> in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> was named for Lesley J. McNair. The facility was closed as a U.S. military installation in 1994, and has since been redeveloped, but retains a museum which details its use as a U.S. base. McNair <a href="Kaserne">Kaserne</a> in <a href="H%C3%B6chst%20%28Frankfurt%20am%20Main%29">Höchst</a>, Germany was also named in his honor. Home to several Army <a href="Signal%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Signal Corps</a> units, it was closed and turned over to the German government in 1992, and has since been redeveloped as residential and commercial space. <a href="Veterans%20of%20Foreign%20Wars">Veterans of Foreign Wars</a> Post 5263 in <a href="Lawton%2C%20Oklahoma">Lawton, Oklahoma</a> (near the Fort Sill Artillery Center and School) is named for him.

McNair was inducted into the <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a> Hall of Fame, which was created in 1969 and is managed by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Combined%20Arms%20Center">United States Army Combined Arms Center</a>. The Fort Leavenworth Hall of Fame honors soldiers who were stationed at Fort Leavenworth, and significantly contributed to the Army's history, heritage, and traditions. In 2005, McNair was inducted into the U.S. Army's <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Army%20careers%23Force%20Management%20Functional%20Area%20.28FA%2050.29">Force Development</a> Hall of Fame.

There is a collection of McNair papers at the <a href="National%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Administration">National Archives and Records Administration</a>. <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a> maintains another folder of papers related to McNair's service there.

McNair married Clare Huster (1882–1973) of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on June 15, 1905. They were the parents of a son, Douglas (1907–1944).
After McNair's death, Clare McNair was employed by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a> to investigate working conditions for female members of the <a href="United%20States%20Foreign%20Service">United States Foreign Service</a> Auxiliary, the organization created to augment the Foreign Service during World War II. She traveled to several foreign locations, including North Africa, Europe, and Latin America to interview employees and observe working conditions in order to make recommendations for improvements.
Douglas Crevier McNair was born in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> on April 17, 1907, while his father was stationed at the <a href="Watertown%20Arsenal">Watertown Arsenal</a>. He was a 1928 graduate of West Point, and became an artillery officer after initially qualifying in the infantry branch. The younger McNair advanced through command and staff positions to become chief of staff of the <a href="77th%20Sustainment%20Brigade%23World%20War%20II">77th Infantry Division</a> with the rank of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>. He was killed in action on the island of <a href="Guam">Guam</a> on August 6, 1944, only 12 days after the death of his father. He died when two other 77th Division soldiers and he became involved in a skirmish with Japanese soldiers while scouting locations for a new division command post. Douglas McNair posthumously received the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>, <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>, and <a href="Purple%20Heart">Purple Heart</a>. First interred on Guam, in 1949 he was buried at the <a href="National%20Memorial%20Cemetery%20of%20the%20Pacific">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> in Hawaii. The 77th Division named its temporary encampment near <a href="Agat%2C%20Guam">Agat, Guam</a> "Camp McNair" in his honor. Another Camp McNair, this one near <a href="Fujiyoshida%2C%20Yamanashi">Fujiyoshida, Japan</a>, served as a U.S. military training facility from the late 1940s until the 1970s, and was used extensively during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>.

Carnotaurus

Carnotaurus is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of large <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived in <a href="South%20America">South America</a> during the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> period, from about 72 to 69.9 million years ago. The only known <a href="species">species</a> is Carnotaurus sastrei. Derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "<a href="wiktionary%3Acarnis">carnis</a>" meaning "flesh" and "<a href="wiktionary%3Ataurus">taurus</a>" meaning "bull", the name "Carnotaurus" means "meat-eating bull", an allusion to the animal's carnivorous diet and bull-like horns.

"Carnotaurus" is a derived member of <a href="Abelisauridae">Abelisauridae</a>, a <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of large theropods that occupied the large <a href="predation">predatorial</a> <a href="ecological%20niche">niche</a> in the southern <a href="continent">continent</a>s, which once formed the <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>, during the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. The <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> relations of "Carnotaurus" within Abelisauridae are uncertain; but it is thought to have been most closely related to either "<a href="Majungasaurus">Majungasaurus</a>" or "<a href="Aucasaurus">Aucasaurus</a>". It is known from a single well-preserved skeleton and is one of the best-understood theropods from the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered from the <a href="La%20Colonia%20Formation">La Colonia Formation</a> in the <a href="Chubut%20Province">Chubut Province</a> of <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>.

"Carnotaurus" was a lightly built, <a href="biped">biped</a>al predator, measuring in length and weighing at least . As a theropod, "Carnotaurus" was highly specialized and distinctive. It had thick <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horns</a> above the eyes, a feature unseen in all other <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> dinosaurs, and a very deep skull sitting on a muscular neck. "Carnotaurus" was further characterized by small, <a href="vestigiality">vestigial</a> forelimbs and long, slender hindlimbs. The skeleton is preserved with extensive skin impressions, showing a mosaic of small, non-overlapping <a href="scale%20%28anatomy%29">scales</a> approximately 5 mm in diameter. The mosaic was interrupted by large bumps that lined the sides of the animal, and there are no hints of feathers.

The distinctive horns and the muscular neck may have been used in fighting <a href="conspecificity">conspecifics</a>. According to separate studies, rivaling individuals may have combated each other with quick head blows, by slow pushes with the upper sides of their skulls, or by ramming each other head-on, using their horns as shock absorbers. The feeding habits of "Carnotaurus" remain unclear: some studies suggest the animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a>s, while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals. "Carnotaurus" was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods.

"Carnotaurus" was a large but lightly built predator. The only known individual was about in length, making "Carnotaurus" one of the largest <a href="abelisaurid">abelisaurid</a>s. While "<a href="Ekrixinatosaurus">Ekrixinatosaurus</a>" and possibly "<a href="Abelisaurus">Abelisaurus</a>", highly incomplete, would have been similar or larger in size, a 2016 study found that only "<a href="Pycnonemosaurus">Pycnonemosaurus</a>", at , was longer than "Carnotaurus", which was estimated at . Its mass is estimated to have been and in separate studies that used different estimation methods. "Carnotaurus" was a highly specialized <a href="theropod">theropod</a>, as seen especially in characteristics of the <a href="skull">skull</a>, the <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e and the forelimbs. The <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> and hindlimbs, on the other hand, remained relatively conservative, resembling those of the more <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>". Both the pelvis and hindlimb bones were long and slender. The left thigh bone of the individual measures 103 cm in length, but shows an average diameter of only 11 cm.

The skull, measuring in length, was proportionally shorter and deeper than in any other large carnivorous dinosaur. The <a href="snout">snout</a> was moderately broad, not as tapering as seen in more basal theropods like "Ceratosaurus", and the jaws were curved upwards. As in other abelisaurids, the <a href="facial%20skeleton">facial bones</a>, especially the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s, were sculptured with numerous small holes and spikes. In life, a wrinkled and possibly <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ous <a href="integumentary%20system">skin</a> would have covered these bones. A prominent pair of horns protruded obliquely above the eyes. These horns, formed by the <a href="frontal%20bone%23In%20dinosaurs">frontal</a> bones, were thick, cone-shaped but in cross-section somewhat vertically flattened, and measured in length. In life, they would probably have formed the bony cores of much longer keratinous horns. The proportionally small eyes were situated in the upper part of the keyhole shaped <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbita</a> (eye sockets). The upper part was slightly rotated forward, probably permitting some degree of <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular vision</a>.

The teeth were long and slender, as opposed to the usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>ry and twelve <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>ry teeth, while the <a href="lower%20jaw">lower jaw</a>s were equipped with fifteen <a href="dentary">dentary</a> teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points. The lower jaw was found with <a href="hyoid%20bone">hyoid bone</a>s, in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily.

The vertebral column consisted of ten <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical</a> (neck), twelve <a href="thoracic%20vertebrae">dorsal</a>, six fused <a href="Sacrum%23Other%20animals">sacral</a> and an unknown number of <a href="coccyx">caudal</a> (tail) vertebrae. The neck was nearly straight, rather than having the S-curve seen in other theropods, and also unusually wide, especially towards its base. The top of the neck's spinal column featured a double row of enlarged, upwardly directed bony processes called <a href="epipophyses">epipophyses</a>, creating a smooth trough on the top of the neck vertebrae. These processes were the highest points of the spine, towering above the unusually low <a href="spinous%20process">spinous process</a>es. The epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature. A similar double row was also present in the tail, formed there by highly modified <a href="transverse%20processes">caudal ribs</a>, in front view protruding upwards in a V-shape, their inner sides creating a smooth, flat, top surface of the front tail vertebrae. The end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook-shaped expansion that connected to the caudal rib of the preceding vertebra.

The forelimbs were proportionally shorter than in any other large carnivorous dinosaurs, including "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>". The forearm was only a quarter the size of the upper arm. There were no <a href="carpus">carpalia</a> in the hand, so that the <a href="metacarpus">metacarpals</a> articulated directly with the forearm. The hand showed four basic digits, though apparently only the middle two of these ended in finger bones, while the fourth consisted of a single splint-like metacarpal that may have represented an external 'spur'. The fingers themselves were fused and immobile, and may have lacked claws. "Carnotaurus" differed from all other abelisaurids in having proportionally shorter and more robust forelimbs, and in having the fourth, splint-like metacarpal as the longest bone in the hand. A 2009 study suggests that the arms were <a href="vestigiality">vestigial</a> in abelisaurids, because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today's <a href="emu">emu</a>s and <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>s, which also have vestigial forelimbs.

"Carnotaurus" was the first theropod dinosaur discovered with a significant number of <a href="fossil">fossil</a> skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the <a href="shoulder%20girdle">shoulder girdle</a>, and the <a href="rib%20cage">rib cage</a>. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, the right side of the skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the <a href="surface%20texture">surface texture</a> of much of the right side of the skull is very different from that of the left side, and probably shows some features of the <a href="scale%20%28anatomy%29">scalation</a> pattern of the head.

The skin was built up of a mosaic of polygonal, non-overlapping scales measuring approximately in diameter. This mosaic was divided by thin, parallel grooves. Scalation was similar across different body parts with the exception of the head, which apparently showed a different, irregular pattern of scales. There is no evidence of feathers. Uniquely for theropods, there were large knob-like bumps running along the sides of the neck, back and tail in irregular rows. Each bump showed a low ridge and measured in diameter. They were set apart from each other and became larger towards the animal's top. The bumps probably represent clusters of condensed <a href="scute">scute</a>s, similar to those seen on the soft frill running along the body midline in <a href="hadrosaurid">hadrosaurid</a> ("duck-billed") dinosaurs. Stephen Czerkas (1997) suggested that these structures may have protected the animal's sides while fighting members of the same species (<a href="Conspecificity">conspecifics</a>) and other theropods, arguing that similar structures can be found on the neck of the modern <a href="iguana">iguana</a> where they provide limited protection in combat.

"Carnotaurus" is one of the best-understood <a href="genus">genera</a> of <a href="Abelisauridae">Abelisauridae</a>, a family of large theropods restricted to the ancient southern <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the <a href="Carcharodontosauridae">carcharodontosaurids</a> and occupying the ecological niche filled by the <a href="Tyrannosauridae">tyrannosaurids</a> in the northern continents. Several notable traits that evolved within this family, including shortening of the skull and arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae, were more pronounced in "Carnotaurus" than in any other abelisaurid.

Though relationships within Abelisauridae are debated, "Carnotaurus" is consistently shown to be one of the most <a href="derived%20trait">derived</a> members of the family by cladistical analyses. Its nearest relative might have been either "<a href="Aucasaurus">Aucasaurus</a>" or "<a href="Majungasaurus">Majungasaurus</a>"; this ambiguity is largely due to the incompleteness of the "Aucasaurus" skull material. A recent review suggests that "Carnotaurus" was not closely related to either "Aucasaurus" or "Majungasaurus", and instead proposed "<a href="Ilokelesia">Ilokelesia</a>" as its <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a>.

"Carnotaurus" is eponymous for two subgroups of Abelisauridae: the <a href="Carnotaurinae">Carnotaurinae</a> and the <a href="Carnotaurini">Carnotaurini</a>. Paleontologists do not universally accept these groups. The Carnotaurinae was defined to include all derived abelisaurids with the exclusion of "Abelisaurus", which is considered a basal member in most studies. However, a 2008 review suggested that "Abelisaurus" was a derived abelisaurid instead. Carnotaurini was proposed to name the <a href="clade">clade</a> formed by "Carnotaurus" and "Aucasaurus"; only those paleontologists who consider "Aucasaurus" as the nearest relative of "Carnotaurus" use this group.

Below is a cladogram published by Canale and colleagues in 2009.

The only skeleton (<a href="holotype">holotype</a> MACN-CH 894) was unearthed in 1984 by an expedition led by Argentinian paleontologist <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bonaparte">José Bonaparte</a>. This expedition also recovered the peculiar spiny <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> "<a href="Amargasaurus">Amargasaurus</a>". It was the eighth expedition within the project named "Jurassic and Cretaceous Terrestrial Vertebrates of South America", which started in 1976 and was sponsored by the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a>. The skeleton is well-preserved and articulated (still connected together), with only the posterior two thirds of the tail, much of the lower leg, and the hind feet being destroyed by <a href="weathering">weathering</a>. During fossilization, the skull and especially the muzzle were crushed laterally, while the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> were pushed upwards onto the nasal bones. As a result, the upward curvature of the upper jaw is artificially exaggerated in the holotype. The skeleton belonged to an adult individual, as indicated by the fused <a href="suture%20%28anatomy%29">sutures</a> in the <a href="braincase">braincase</a>. It was found lying on its right side, showing a typical <a href="death%20pose">death pose</a> with the neck bent back over the torso. Unusually, it is preserved with extensive skin impressions. In view of the significance of these impressions, a second expedition was started to reinvestigate the original excavation site, leading to the recovery of several additional skin patches.

The skeleton was collected on a farm named "Pocho Sastre" near Bajada Moreno in the <a href="Telsen%20Department">Telsen Department</a> of <a href="Chubut%20Province">Chubut Province</a>, Argentina. Because it was embedded in a large <a href="hematite">hematite</a> <a href="concretion">concretion</a>, a very hard kind of rock, preparation was complicated and progressed slowly. In 1985, Bonaparte published a note presenting "Carnotaurus sastrei" as a new genus and species and briefly describing the skull and lower jaw. The generic name (<a href="Latin">Latin</a> "carno" [carnis] – "flesh" and "taurus" – "bull") refers to the bull-like horns, while the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "sastrei" honors Angel Sastre, the owner of the ranch where the skeleton was found. A comprehensive description of the whole skeleton followed in 1990. After "Abelisaurus", "Carnotaurus" was the second member of the family Abelisauridae that was discovered. For years, it was by far the best-understood member of its family, and also the best-understood theropod from the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>. It was not until the 21st century that similar well-preserved abelisaurids were described, including "Aucasaurus", "Majungasaurus" and "<a href="Skorpiovenator">Skorpiovenator</a>", allowing scientists to re-evaluate certain aspects of the anatomy of "Carnotaurus". The holotype skeleton is displayed in the <a href="Argentine%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences</a>, <a href="Bernardino%20Rivadavia">Bernardino Rivadavia</a>; replicas can be seen in this and other museums around the world. Sculptors Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas manufactured a life-sized sculpture of "Carnotaurus" that was previously on display at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20of%20Los%20Angeles%20County">Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County</a>. This sculpture, ordered by the museum during the mid-1980s, is probably the first life restoration of a theropod showing accurate skin.

Originally, the rocks in which "Carnotaurus" was found were assigned to the upper part of the <a href="Cerro%20Barcino%20Formation">Gorro Frigio Formation</a>, which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old (<a href="Albian">Albian</a> or <a href="Cenomanian">Cenomanian</a> stage). Later, they were realized to pertain to the much younger <a href="La%20Colonia%20Formation">La Colonia Formation</a>, dating 72 to 69.9 million years ago (<a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a>, Lower <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> stage). Thus, "Carnotaurus" was the latest South American abelisaurid known. By the Late Cretaceous, South America was already isolated from both Africa and North America.

The La Colonia Formation is exposed over the southern slope of the <a href="North%20Patagonian%20Massif">North Patagonian Massif</a>. Most vertebrate fossils, including "Carnotaurus", come from the formation's middle section (called the "middle facies association"). This part likely represents the deposits of an environment of <a href="estuary">estuaries</a>, <a href="tidal%20flat">tidal flat</a>s or <a href="coastal%20plain">coastal plain</a>s. The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods. The most common vertebrates collected include <a href="Ceratodontidae">ceratodontid</a> <a href="lungfish">lungfish</a>, turtles, crocodiles, <a href="plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a>s, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and mammals. Some of the snakes that have been found belong to the families <a href="Boidae">Boidae</a> and Madtsoidae, such as "<a href="Alamitophis">Alamitophis argentinus</a>". Turtles are represented by at least five <a href="taxon">taxa</a>, four from <a href="Chelidae">Chelidae</a> (<a href="Pleurodira">Pleurodira</a>) and one from <a href="Meiolaniidae">Meiolaniidae</a> (<a href="Cryptodira">Cryptodira</a>). Among the marine reptiles is the plesiosaur "<a href="Sulcusuchus">Sulcusuchus erraini</a>" of the family <a href="Polycotylidae">Polycotylidae</a>. Mammals are represented by "<a href="Reigitherium">Reigitherium bunodontum</a>", which was considered the first record of a South American <a href="Docodonta">docodont</a>, and "<a href="Argentodites%20coloniensis">Argentodites coloniensis</a>", possibly of <a href="Multituberculata">Multituberculata</a>. In 2011, the discovery of a new <a href="enantiornithine">enantiornithine</a> bird from the La Colonia Formation was announced.

"Carnotaurus" is the only known carnivorous bipedal animal with a pair of horns on the frontal bone. The use of these horns is not entirely clear; several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics, in display, or in killing prey.

Greg Paul (1988) proposed that the horns were butting weapons and that the small orbita would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting. Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) suggested that "Carnotaurus" used its horns in a way similar to rams. They calculated that the neck musculature was strong enough to absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5.7 m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a>s for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a>, while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck.

Other studies suggest that rivaling "Carnotaurus" did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, the horns may have been a device for the distribution of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows.

Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) propose that the horns might also have been used to injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern <a href="bovid">bovid</a> horns if there was a <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ous covering. However, this would be the only reported example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.

Analysis of the jaw structure of "Carnotaurus" by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) suggests that the animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites are more important than strong bites when <a href="Dinosaur%20diet%20and%20feeding">capturing small prey</a>, as shown by studies of modern-day <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s. These researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility (<a href="cranial%20kinesis">kinesis</a>) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern <a href="snake">snake</a>s. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed "Carnotaurus" to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to move up and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing "Carnotaurus" to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. "Carnotaurus" may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs.

This interpretation was questioned by François Therrien and colleagues (2005), who found that the biting force of "Carnotaurus" was twice that of the <a href="American%20alligator">American alligator</a>, which may have the strongest bite of any living <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>. These researchers also noted analogies with modern <a href="Komodo%20dragon">Komodo dragon</a>s: the <a href="flexural%20strength">flexural strength</a> of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, "Carnotaurus" must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush.

<a href="Robert%20Bakker">Robert Bakker</a> (1998) found that "Carnotaurus" mainly fed upon very large prey, especially <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a>s. As he noted, several adaptations of the skull—the short snout, the relatively small teeth and the strong back of the skull (<a href="occiput">occiput</a>)—had independently evolved in "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>". These features suggest that the upper jaw was used like a serrated club to inflict wounds; big sauropods would have been weakened by repeated attacks.

Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 1999) presumed that "Carnotaurus" was a swift runner, arguing that the <a href="femur">thigh bone</a> was adapted to withstand high <a href="bending%20moment">bending moment</a>s while running. The ability of an animal's leg to withstand those forces limits its top speed. The running adaptations of "Carnotaurus" would have been better than those of a human, although not nearly as good as those of an <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>. Scientists calculate that Carnotaurus had a top speed of up to per hour.

In dinosaurs, the most important locomotor muscle was located in the tail. This muscle, called the <a href="caudofemoralis">caudofemoralis</a>, attaches to the <a href="fourth%20trochanter">fourth trochanter</a>, a prominent ridge on the thigh bone, and pulls the thigh bone backwards when contracted. Scott Persons and <a href="Phil%20Currie">Phil Currie</a> (2011) note that in the tail vertebrae of "Carnotaurus", the caudal ribs did not protrude horizontally ("T-shaped"), but were angled against the vertical axis of the vertebrae, forming a "V". This would have provided additional space for a caudofemoralis muscle larger than in any other theropod—the muscle mass was calculated at per leg. Therefore, "Carnotaurus" could have been one of the fastest large theropods. While the caudofemoralis muscle was enlarged, the <a href="epaxial%20and%20hypaxial%20muscles">epaxial muscles</a> situated above the caudal ribs would have been proportionally smaller. These muscles, called the <a href="longissimus">longissimus</a> and <a href="spinalis">spinalis</a> muscle, were responsible for tail movement and stability. To maintain tail stability in spite of reduction of these muscles, the caudal ribs bear forward projecting processes interlocking the vertebrae with each other and with the pelvis, stiffening the tail. As a consequence, the ability to make tight turns would have been diminished, because the hip and tail had to be turned simultaneously, unlike in other theropods.

Red-tailed tropicbird

The red-tailed tropicbird "(Phaethon rubricauda)" is a <a href="seabird">seabird</a> native to tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. One of three closely related species of <a href="tropicbird">tropicbird</a>, it was described by <a href="Pieter%20Boddaert">Pieter Boddaert</a> in 1783. Superficially resembling a <a href="tern">tern</a> in appearance, it has almost all-white plumage with a black mask and a red bill. The sexes have similar plumage. Adults have red that are about twice their body length, which gives rise to its common name. There are four subspecies recognised, though there is evidence there is a <a href="Cline%20%28biology%29">clinal</a> change with smaller birds in the north and larger in the south (and hence no grounds for any subspecies).

Nesting takes place in loose <a href="bird%20colony">colonies</a> on oceanic islands, the nest itself a <a href="Bird%20nest%23Scrape">scrape</a> found on a cliff face, in a crevice, or a sandy beach. A single egg is laid, being incubated by both sexes for about six weeks. The red-tailed tropicbird eats fish, mainly <a href="flying%20fish">flying fish</a>, and squid, catching them by plunge-diving into the ocean. This bird is considered to be a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> according to the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), though it is adversely affected by human contact. Rats and feral cats prey on eggs and young at nesting sites.

British naturalist <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a> encountered the red-tailed tropicbird on the Pacific Ocean in March 1769 on <a href="First%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">James Cook's first voyage</a>, noting that it was a different species to the familiar <a href="red-billed%20tropicbird">red-billed tropicbird</a>. He gave it the name "Phaeton erubescens". It was French polymath <a href="Georges-Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Comte%20de%20Buffon">Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon</a> who formally <a href="species%20description">described</a> the species in his "Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux" in 1781, noting it was a native of <a href="Isle%20de%20France%20%28Mauritius%29">Isle de France</a> (Mauritius). The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Nicolas%20Martinet">François-Nicolas Martinet</a> in the "Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle" which was produced under the supervision of <a href="Edme-Louis%20Daubenton">Edme-Louis Daubenton</a> to accompany Buffon's text. Buffon did not include a scientific name with his description but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist <a href="Pieter%20Boddaert">Pieter Boddaert</a> coined the <a href="binomial%20name">binomial name</a> "Phaethon rubricauda" in his catalogue of the "Planche Enluminées". The genus name is derived from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "phaethon", "sun" while the species epithet comes from the Latin words "ruber" "red" and "cauda" "tail". English ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> wrote about the red-tailed tropicbird in 1785 in his "General Synopsis of Birds", recording it as common in Mauritius and the South Pacific. He also reported a black-billed tropicbird collected from <a href="Palmerston%20Island">Palmerston Island</a> that ended up in Banks' collection. Latham did not give them binomial names, however. It was left to German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> to describe the species, which he did as "Phaeton phoenicuros" and "P. melanorhynchos" respectively in the 13th edition of "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1788. Latham later described this black-billed specimen as the New Holland tropicbird, giving it the name "Phaethon novae-hollandiae".

British naturalist <a href="Walter%20Rothschild%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a> reviewed the described names and specimens in 1900 and concluded that the original use of "P. erubescens" was a "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>". He concluded populations of <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe</a>, <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk</a> and <a href="Kermadec%20Islands">Kermadec Islands</a> belonged to a distinct subspecies that he named "P. rubicauda erubescens", due to their larger overall size, more robust bill and prominent reddish tinge to plumage. He also classified "P. melanorhynchus" and "P. novae-hollandiae" as juveniles. Australian amateur ornithologist <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> then applied the name "P. rubicauda roseotinctus" to Rothschild's "P. rubicauda erubescens".

"Red-tailed tropicbird" has been designated the official name by the <a href="International%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">International Ornithologists' Union</a> (IOC). Other common names include red-tailed bos'nbird or silver bos'nbird, the name derived from the semblance of the tail feathers to a boatswain's marlin spikes, and strawtail. The <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> call it "amokura", "tawake", "ko’ae" or " ’ula", while the <a href="Native%20Hawaiians">Native Hawaiians</a> call it "koa'e’ula".

Its closest relative is the <a href="white-tailed%20tropicbird">white-tailed tropicbird</a> ("P. lepturus"), the split between their ancestors taking place about four million years ago.

Four subspecies are recognised by the IOC:


Ornithologist Mike Tarburton reviewed the known subspecies in 1989 and concluded that none were valid, noting that there was a <a href="Cline%20%28biology%29">clinal</a> change in size in the species, those from <a href="Kure%20Atoll">Kure Atoll</a> in the North Pacific being the smallest ranging to those from the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific being the largest. He also noted that the pink colouration was more intense in new plumage and faded after a few years in museum specimens.

The red-tailed tropicbird measures on average, which includes the -long , and weighs around . It has a wingspan of . It has a streamlined but solid build with almost all-white <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, often with a pink tinge. The sexes are similar in plumage. A dark brown comma-shaped stripe extends back from the <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a>, through and over the eyes and reaching the ear <a href="Covert%20feather">coverts</a>. The iris is dark brown. The bill is bright red, slightly paler at the base and black around the nostrils. The legs and base of the toes are pale blue-mauve, while the webbing and rest of the toes are black. The white feathers of the head and rump have concealed dark brown bases, while those of the mantle, back, tail <a href="Flight%20feather%23Rectrices">rectrices</a> and tail coverts have dark brown shaft bases. The two long tail feathers are orange or red with white bases for around a tenth of their length, and can be hard to see when the bird is flying. The white wings are marked by dark <a href="Chevron%20%28insignia%29">chevron</a>-shaped patches on the <a href="Flight%20feather%23Tertial">tertials</a>, and the dark shafts of the <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primary</a> flight feathers are visible. The pink tinge is often more pronounced in the <a href="Flight%20feather%23Remiges">remiges</a> of the upper wing. Moulting takes place outside the breeding season, the streamers being replaced before the rest of the feathers. Streamers are replaced at any time, one growing while the other is shed, and old streamers may litter the area around a breeding colony.

Newly-hatched chicks are covered in thin long grey-white <a href="Down%20feather">down</a>, which is paler on the head. The lores are bare. The down is greyer in older chicks. The primaries, rectrices and scapulars are evident in the third week, and chicks are mostly feathered with residual down on underparts and under the wings after six weeks, and fully feathered by 11 weeks. Juvenile birds have a glossy white forehead, chin, throat and underparts, and prominent black barring and scaling on their crown, nape, mantle, back, rump and upper wing coverts. Their bills are blackish grey with a light blue-grey base, and grey legs and feet.

In Australian waters it could be confused with the <a href="silver%20gull">silver gull</a> ("Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae") or various tern species, though it is larger and heavier-set, with a wedge-shaped tail. Its red bill and more wholly white wings distinguish it from the adult white-tailed tropicbird. Immature red-tailed tropicbirds likewise can be distinguished from immature white-tailed tropicbirds by their partly red rather than yellow bills.

The red-tailed tropicbird is generally silent while flying. Aside from during courtship displays, birds may give a short greeting squawk to their mate when arriving or leaving the nest. Birds give a low growling call as a defence call, and young chatter repetitively as a begging call—made whenever the parents are nearby.

The red-tailed tropicbird ranges across the southern Indian, and western and central Pacific Oceans, from the African coast to Indonesia, the waters around the southern reaches of Japan, across to Chile, and the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>, where they are more common on the northwestern islands. There are large breeding colonies on <a href="Europa%20Island">Europa</a>, <a href="Aldabra">Aldabra</a> and Christmas Islands in the Indian Ocean, with smaller colonies in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, where it nests on the tiny island of Nosy Ve, the Seychelles, and Mauritius. In Australia, it nests on <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>'s coral islands (including Raine Island and <a href="Lady%20Elliot%20Island">Lady Elliot Island</a>), and Ashmore Reef and Rottnest Island off <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, as well as Sugarloaf Rock at Cape Naturaliste and Busselton on the Western Australian coastline itself, and the offshore territories of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk and Lord Howe islands. In New Zealand territory it breeds on the Kermadec Islands. Elsewhere in the Pacific it breeds in Fiji, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Hawaii, with a large colony on Kure Atoll, the Cook Islands, Pitcairn Island, and islands off Japan and Chile.

It frequents areas of ocean with water temperatures from and salinity under 35% in the southern hemisphere and 33.5% in the northern hemisphere. In the Pacific Ocean, the southern boundary of its range runs along the summer surface isotherm. The warm waters of the <a href="Leeuwin%20Current">Leeuwin Current</a> facilitate the species nesting at <a href="Cape%20Leeuwin">Cape Leeuwin</a> in southwestern Australia, yet is only a rare visitor to New South Wales at corresponding latitudes on the Australian east coast.

It is an occasional visitor to <a href="Palau">Palau</a>, breeding being recorded from the <a href="Southwest%20Islands%20%28Palau%29">Southwest Islands</a>, and was first recorded from Guam in 1992. It is an uncommon vagrant to New Zealand proper, where it has been recorded from the northern reaches of North Island, especially <a href="Three%20Kings%20Islands">Three Kings Islands</a>. It is a very rare vagrant to North America, with records from California and <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a>.

The birds disperse widely after breeding. Evidence suggests birds in the Indian Ocean follow prevailing winds westwards, young individuals banded in Sumatra and Sugarloaf Reserve, Western Australia, being recovered at Mauritius and Reunion respectively. Banding on Kure Atoll suggests birds in the North Pacific disperse in an easterly direction, following prevailing winds there. Strong winds can blow them inland on occasions, which explains some sighting records away from the coast and their preferred habitats.

The red-tailed tropicbird is a strong flyer, and walks on land with difficulty using a shuffling gait.

The red-tailed tropicbird is thought to be monogamous, pairs remaining bonded over successive breeding seasons, although information such as age at first breeding and pair-formation is not known. It nests in loose colonies, on offshore islands and stacks, rocky cliffs, coral atolls and cays. It rarely nests on large bodies of land, though has done so in southern Western Australia. The nest itself is a shallow <a href="Bird%20nest%23Scrape">scrape</a>, in either shaded sand or a rocky crevice, or under a shrub. Because the red-tailed tropicbird does not walk well, it lands by flying into the wind, stalling and dropping to the ground. The nest is often located within of the edge of the shrub (or other shaded area) to minimise walking distance. The tropicbird often chooses shrubs with fewer stems for accessibility.

The species is territorial to a degree, aggressively defending the nest site and pecking radius around it, commencing around three months before breeding. Birds are more aggressive at crowded colonies, where numbers are large or suitable nest sites less common. They adopt a defence posture, which consists of raising the <a href="humerus">humeri</a> up and bringing the wrists together, drawing the neck into the body and shaking the head sideways, fluffing up the head feathers and squawking. Bill-jabbing and fights can break out, the two combatants locking bills and wrestling for up to 90 minutes.

<a href="Sexual%20selection">Mate choice</a> is likely to be partially based on the length of the tail streamers, a bird having longer tail streamers being more attractive as a mate. This tropicbird also probably mates <a href="Assortative%20mating">assortatively</a> for tail streamer length, meaning mates likely have streamers of about equal length.

In the leadup to breeding, males initiate an aerial courtship display of flying in large circles, alternating between gliding, short periods of rapid wing-beating, and low flight within a few metres of the water, while making sharp cackling calls. Initially flying in small groups, birds then pair off to repeat the display in pairs before bonding. Once pairs have established a nest, they do not perform the display.

The timing of breeding depends on location; in some places, birds breed in a defined breeding season, whereas in others, there is none. South of the equator, the latter is likely to be true. On islands near the equator, laying usually occurs from June to November, the majority of chicks fledging around January to February. On Christmas Island, breeding takes place at different times on different parts of the island due to prevailing weather conditions. Some birds may remain at the breeding site year-round.

The female red-tailed tropicbird lays one egg, which both parents incubate for 42 to 46 days. The male generally takes the first turn on the egg after it is laid. Ranging from long (averaging between , depending on location) and wide, the oval eggs are pale tan with brown and red-black markings that are more prominent on the larger end.
Born helpless and unable to move around (<a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a> and semi-<a href="altricial">altricial</a>), the chicks are initially blind, opening their eyes after 2–3 days. Until they are a week old, they only open their beak upon touch, so the parents have to stroke the base of the bill to initiate feeding. Feeding takes place once or twice a day, generally around midday. They are constantly brooded by the parents until they are a week old, after which time they are sheltered under the parent's wings. They also rise up and gape at any nearby bird for food. Both parents feed the young, by shoving its beak into the chick's gullet and then regurgitating food. Initially covered with grey or white down, they grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 16–20 days. Their feet and beaks grow rapidly, outpacing the rest of their bodies. Chicks remain in the nest for 67 to 91 days until they fledge.

The red-tailed tropicbird is mostly a , diving anywhere from an above-water height , to a depth of about , although this may change seasonally. When diving, it remains briefly submerged—one study on Christmas Island came up with an average time of 26.6 seconds—generally swallowing its prey before surfacing. The red-tailed tropicbird sometimes catches flying fish in the air.

During incubation, foraging trips are relatively long, with an average excursion taking about 153 hours. These trips are to very productive areas. After the chicks hatch, on the other hand, the parents adopt a strategy where one takes long trips (these averaging about 57 hours) for self feeding, and the other takes short trips (about three hours long) to feed the chicks. The <a href="Multimodal%20distribution">bimodality</a> of the length of foraging trips is likely to be because of the fact that it is the optimal balance of self-feeding and provisioning for chicks. On Christmas Island, birds generally forage far out to sea in the early morning and closer to shore in the afternoon.

Squid and flying fish make up a large portion of this bird's diet, along with some crustaceans, depending on location. Fieldwork in the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a> revealed the diet of birds there to be mostly fish by mass but equal numbers of fish and squid caught. Fish recorded include the <a href="mirrorwing%20flyingfish">mirrorwing flyingfish</a> ("Hirundichthys speculiger") and <a href="spotfin%20flyingfish">spotfin flyingfish</a> ("Cheilopogon furcatus") and several other unidentified species of the <a href="flying%20fish">flying fish</a> family Exocoetidae, the <a href="pompano%20dolphinfish">pompano dolphinfish</a> ("Coryphaena equiselis") and <a href="Mahi-mahi">common dolphinfish</a> ("C. hippurus"), needleflish including the <a href="houndfish">houndfish</a> ("Tylosurus crocodilus"), and unidentified members of <a href="Hemiramphidae">Hemiramphidae</a>, <a href="Scombridae">Scombridae</a>, and <a href="Carangidae">Carangidae</a>. The <a href="Sthenoteuthis%20oualaniensis">purpleback flying squid</a> ("Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis") was by far the most common cephalopod eaten, followed by the <a href="common%20blanket%20octopus">common blanket octopus</a> ("Tremoctopus violaceus"). A field study in Hawaii found flying fish dominated the prey species, the tropical two-wing flyingfish ("<a href="Exocoetus%20volitans">Exocoetus volitans</a>") and members of the genus "<a href="Cypselurus">Cypselurus</a>" prominent, followed by squid of the family <a href="Ommastrephidae">Ommastrephidae</a> including the purpleback flying squid and the glass squid ("<a href="Hyaloteuthis%20pelagica">Hyaloteuthis pelagica</a>"), and carangid fish including the <a href="shortfin%20scad">shortfin scad</a> ("Decapterus macrosoma"). The red-tailed tropicbird has also been recorded eating <a href="porcupinefish">porcupinefish</a> (Diodontidae), although adults have been troubled when the victim fish inflates resulting in it being urgently regurgitated.

A strong flyer with large mouth and bill, the red-tailed tropicbird can carry relatively large prey for its size, parent birds commonly bearing dolphin fish that weighed 120 g—16% of their own weight—to their chicks.

When incubating during the day in a shaded nest, this bird has an average temperature of , compared to its average temperature when incubating at night of . The difference is likely due to activity levels, as the air temperature during these times does not differ significantly with a bird in the nest. After flying, the average body temperature is . The temperature of the feet is always lower than that of the body temperature during flight, but always higher than the air temperature. Thus, the feet are likely used to dissipate heat during flight.

The red-tailed tropicbird's tail streamers were highly prized by the Maori. The <a href="Ng%C4%81puhi">Ngāpuhi</a> tribe of the <a href="Northland%20Region">Northland Region</a> would look for and collect them off dead or stray birds blown ashore after easterly gales, trading them for greenstone with tribes from the south. English naturalist <a href="Andrew%20Bloxam">Andrew Bloxam</a> reported that the feathers were valued in Hawaii, where the locals would pull them off the birds as they nested.

The red-tailed tropicbird is classified as a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> according to the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> on account of its large range of up to . The population in the eastern Pacific has been estimated to be as high as 80,000 birds with a minimum of 41,000 birds. Around 9,000 birds breed on Europa Island, and 9,000–12,000 breed on the Hawaiian Islands. Human presence generally affects the species adversely, by the destruction of habitat or introduction of pests. Within Australia, it is classified as "near threatened", due to unexpected declines in some populations, the impact of humans, and the <a href="yellow%20crazy%20ant">yellow crazy ant</a> overrunning Christmas Island. It is listed as vulnerable in New South Wales.

Predators recorded in Western Australia include large raptors such as the <a href="white-bellied%20sea%20eagle">white-bellied sea eagle</a> ("Haliaeetus leucogaster") and <a href="eastern%20osprey">eastern osprey</a> ("Pandion cristatus"), while silver gulls, and crows and ravens ("<a href="Corvus">Corvus</a>" spp.) raid nests for eggs and young. Vagrant <a href="red-billed%20tropicbird">red-billed tropicbird</a>s ("P. aethereus") have been implicated in egg loss of nests in Hawaii. Feral dogs and <a href="feral%20cat">cats</a> prey on nesting birds on Christmas Island, while feral cats are a severe problem on Norfolk Island. Rats have been a serious problem on Kure Atoll, causing heavy losses. Yellow crazy ants were discovered on <a href="Johnston%20Atoll">Johnston Atoll</a> in the north Pacific Ocean in 2010, hordes of which overrun nesting areas and can blind victims with their spray.

Also on Johnston Atoll, the <a href="Johnston%20Atoll%20Chemical%20Agent%20Disposal%20System">Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System</a> (JACADS) was burning stockpiled chemical weapons until 2000. It was studied over eight years to see if there were effects from potential contaminants. There appeared to be no impact on survival during the study period, although young birds from downwind of the plant were less likely to return there than those upwind of the plant—possibly due to the more intact vegetation at the latter site.

Yukon Quest

The Yukon Quest 1,000-mile International Sled Dog Race, or simply Yukon Quest, is a <a href="sled%20dog">sled dog</a> race run every February between <a href="Fairbanks%2C%20Alaska">Fairbanks</a>, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, and <a href="Whitehorse%2C%20Yukon">Whitehorse</a>, <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a>. Because of the harsh winter conditions, difficult trail, and the limited support that competitors are allowed, it is considered the "most difficult sled dog race in the world", or even the "toughest race in the world"—"even tougher, more selective and less attention-seeking than the <a href="Iditarod%20Trail%20Sled%20Dog%20Race">Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</a>." The originator envisioned it as "a race so rugged that only purists would participate."

In the competition, first run in 1984, a dog team leader (called a <a href="mushing">musher</a>) and a team of 6 to 14 dogs race for 10 to 20 days. The course follows the route of the historic 1890s <a href="Klondike%20Gold%20Rush">Klondike Gold Rush</a>, mail delivery, and transportation routes between Fairbanks, <a href="Dawson%20City">Dawson City</a>, and Whitehorse. Mushers pack up to of equipment and provisions for themselves and their dogs to survive between checkpoints. Each musher must rely on a single sled for the entire run, versus three in the Iditarod.

Ten checkpoints and four dog drops, some more than apart, lie along the trail. <a href="Veterinarian">Veterinarian</a>s are present at each to ensure the health and welfare of the dogs, give advice, and provide veterinary care for dropped dogs; together with the race marshal or a race judge, they may remove a dog or team from the race for medical or other reasons. There are only nine checkpoints for rest, versus 22 in the Iditarod. Mushers are permitted to leave dogs at checkpoints and dog drops, but not to replace them. <a href="dog%20sled">Sleds</a> may not be replaced (without penalty) and mushers cannot accept help from non-racers except at Dawson City, the halfway mark.

The route runs on frozen rivers, over four mountain ranges, and through isolated northern villages. Racers cover or more. Temperatures commonly drop as low as , and winds can reach at higher elevations. Because it begins a month earlier than the Iditarod, the Quest is a colder race, and is run on shorter solar days and through longer, darker nights. <a href="Sonny%20Lindner">Sonny Lindner</a> won the inaugural race in 1984 from a field of 26 teams. The fastest run took place in 2010, when <a href="Hans%20Gatt">Hans Gatt</a> finished after 9 days and 26 minutes. The 2012 competition had the closest one-two finish, as Hugh Neff beat Allen Moore by twenty-six seconds.

In 2005, <a href="Lance%20Mackey">Lance Mackey</a> became the first Yukon Quest rookie to win the race, a feat that was repeated by 2011's champion, Dallas Seavey. In 2007, Mackey became the first to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod, a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when <a href="Ty%20Halvorson">Ty Halvorson</a> took 20 days, 8 hours, and 29 minutes to finish. In 2000, <a href="Aliy%20Zirkle">Aliy Zirkle</a> became the first woman to win the race, in 10 days, 22 hours, and 57 minutes. Yukon Quest International, which runs the Yukon Quest sled dog race, also runs two shorter races: the Junior Quest and the Yukon Quest 300 (previously the Yukon Quest 250).

The idea for the Yukon Quest originated in April 1983 during a bar-room discussion among four Alaskans: LeRoy Shank, Roger Williams, Ron Rosser, and William "Willy" Lipps. The four proposed a thousand-mile sled dog race from Fairbanks, Alaska to Whitehorse, Yukon, to celebrate the <a href="Klondike%20Gold%20Rush">Klondike Gold Rush</a>-era mail and transportation routes between the two. They disdained the many checkpoints and <a href="Race%20stage">stages</a> of the <a href="Iditarod%20Sled%20Dog%20Race">Iditarod Sled Dog Race</a> and envisioned an endurance race in which racers would rely on themselves and survival would be as important as speed. "We wanted more of a <a href="The%20Bush%20%28Alaska%29">Bush</a> experience, a race that would put a little woodsmanship into it", Shank said at the race's 25th anniversary.

This remained a vague plan until August 1983, when the first public organizational meetings took place. Fundraising began, and the start date for the race was optimistically moved forward from February 1985 to February 25, 1984. The entry fee for the first race was $500, and Murray Clayton of <a href="Haines%2C%20Alaska">Haines, Alaska</a> became the first person to enter when he paid his fee in October 1983. In December 1983, the race was officially named the Yukon Quest. Two more months of planning followed, and a crew of volunteers was organized to staff the checkpoints and place trail markers. On February 25, 1984, 26 racers left Fairbanks for Whitehorse. Each team was limited to a maximum of 12 dogs, and racers had to finish with no fewer than nine. They also had to haul of food per dog ( total) to cover the long distances between checkpoints.

Numerous problems occurred in the first race. The leading mushers had to break trail because the <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a> intended for the task broke down. Trail markers often were absent or misplaced, and no preparations had been made for racers in <a href="Dawson%20City">Dawson City</a> until organizer Roger Williams flew there shortly after the race began. After Dawson City, mushers had their dogs and sleds trucked to avoid a section of snowless trail, then had to deal with open sections of the Yukon River near Whitehorse due to above-average temperatures. The eventual winner of the inaugural race, Sonny Lindner, was greeted with little fanfare on his arrival. On the race's 25th anniversary, he recalled, "I think it was 90 percent (camping) trip and maybe a little bit of racing."

After the inaugural race, organizers improved the marking of the trail for the first contest held in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks direction. Musher Bill Cotter said, "The trail was so nice that it was difficult to keep from going too fast." The race grew in popularity over the next few years. In 1988 and again in 1989, 47 mushers entered. In 1989, 31 completed the race—the most that have ever finished it. In 1990, Connie and Terri Frerichs became the first (and so far only) mother and daughter to compete in the same Yukon Quest: Terri finished 21st, beating her mother (22nd) by 26 minutes. The 1991 race saw eight teams withdraw in the first quarter because of an outbreak of a canine disease called the "<a href="Healy%2C%20Alaska">Healy</a> Virus". Thirty-five more dogs were sickened before the spread of the virus was halted by colder weather halfway through the race. In 1992, unseasonable warmth caused problems in the first half of the race, and the second was affected by bitter cold. The head veterinarian of that race, Jeannie Olson, was replaced after she offered canine <a href="acupuncture">acupuncture</a> to several mushers. Though not then forbidden by any rule, this violated equal-treatment guidelines because she did not offer the treatment to every musher. At the end of that race, George Cook became the first musher since 1984 to finish short of Whitehorse when open water on the Yukon River prevented him from continuing. Because he did not quit, race officials gave him the Red Lantern Award.

Following the 1992 race, controversy erupted when the Alaska board of directors of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed it would be easier to manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90 minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for <a href="ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>.

In the 1994 race, Alaskan Bruce Cosgrove was denied entry by Canadian customs officials in the pre-race verification process, the only time a musher has been denied entry into either Canada or Alaska. Cosgrove started the race, but quit before the border. Following the race, controversy again erupted when Alaska Yukon Quest officials announced they would unilaterally eliminate Whitehorse from the Yukon Quest and run a cheaper Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race. Members of the Yukon Quest organization revolted against this and voted to evict the board members who had proposed it.

The 1995 race featured 22 mushers, of whom 13 finished. Budget problems caused the first prize to drop by 25% to $15,000, contributing to the low participation. This problem was fixed for the 1996 race, with a first-place prize of $25,000. The 1997 race was won by Rick Mackey, brother of later Quest winner Lance Mackey; the two are the only brother-brother winning tandem in Quest history. Following the 1997 race, financial troubles again arose, this time on the Alaska side. Canadian organizers secured international sponsorship for the 1998 race, and when they refused to let this sponsorship money be used to pay debts accumulated in Alaska, members of the Alaska board threatened to host a separate competition. In the end, the Alaska board members were forced to resign, and a deal was worked out between the two sides.
The 1998 race was run on schedule and had 38 entrants. The 1999 race was won by <a href="Alaska%20Native">Alaska Native</a> Ramy Brooks, who defeated veterinarian Mark May by 10 minutes. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle became the first woman to win the Yukon Quest after taking 10 days, 22 hours, and 57 minutes to trek the . Also in 2000, Yukon Quest International added two races: the Quest 250 (today the Quest 300) and the Junior Quest (both described <a href="%23Junior%20Yukon%20Quest%20and%20Yukon%20Quest%20300">below</a>). Competitors in each have gone on to participate in the Yukon Quest. The first of these graduated mushers competed in the 2001 race, won by Tim Osmar.

In 2002, the Yukon Quest was won by Hans Gatt, an Austrian-born resident of British Columbia and the first European to win. This was the first of three consecutive wins, making him the first three-time winner. In 2003, Gatt's second win was truncated by a lack of snow near Whitehorse. Unseasonable warmth forced organizers to truck mushers and their dog teams to Braeburn before continuing what became a competition. The 2004 race saw 31 mushers start the race and 20 finish, a drop-out rate of 35%. During the first 24 years of the competition, there were 776 starters and 513 finishers. Though 90 more mushers attempted the race in the first 12 years than in the next dozen runnings, there is little difference in the percentage that did not finish (35% in 1984–1995; 33% in 1996–2007).

In 2005, first-time participant Lance Mackey broke Hans Gatt's three-win streak. Mackey finished in 11 days, 32 seconds. The victory was the first of four straight wins by Mackey, who holds the record for most consecutive wins and is also the only four-time winner. During Mackey's second win, a fierce storm atop Eagle Summit caused a whiteout that forced seven mushers and dog teams to be evacuated by helicopter. Partly because of the storm, only 11 finished the 2006 race—the fewest ever. The finishers also endured an unusual course: because snow was scarce near Whitehorse, they doubled back and finished in Dawson City after racing the . In 2007, three dogs were killed in unrelated incidents, but Mackey tied Gatt's record of three consecutive wins. One month later, Mackey became the first person to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod in the same year. Mackey's fourth win came during the 2008 race, the first Yukon Quest to end in Whitehorse since 2003.

Because of the <a href="Great%20Recession">late 2000s recession</a>, the 2009 Yukon Quest <a href="Prize%20money">purse</a> was reduced to $151,000 from a planned total of $200,000. As a result, the first prize was reduced to $30,000 from the planned $35,000. Partly because of this, Mackey withdrew before the race, making it easier for a newcomer to win. In the closest one–two finish, German Sebastian Schnuelle completed the race faster than anyone before, finishing that year's trip in 9 days, 23 hours, and 20 minutes. He was just four minutes ahead of Hugh Neff.

Following the 2009 race, officials decided to advance the competition's start date by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race started in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the early start date was kept for the 2011 competition. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in Yukon Quest history: 9 days and 26 minutes. That race was marked by good weather, and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to normal, as violent storms blasted the trail and mushers during the second half of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of the course to be rerouted over the Yukon River.

The course of the race varies slightly from year to year because of ice conditions on the <a href="Yukon%20River">Yukon River</a>, snowfall, and other factors. The length of the route has also fluctuated, ranging from in the weather-shortened 2003 race to in 1998. In even-numbered years, the race starts in Fairbanks and ends in Whitehorse. In odd-numbered years, the start and finish lines switch.

The route follows the Yukon River for much of its course and travels over four mountains: <a href="King%20Solomon%27s%20Dome">King Solomon's Dome</a>, <a href="Eagle%20Summit%20%28Alaska%29">Eagle Summit</a>, <a href="American%20Summit">American Summit</a>, and <a href="Rosebud%20Summit">Rosebud Summit</a>. Its length is equivalent to the distance between England and Africa, and the distance between some checkpoints is the breadth of Ireland. Racers endure ice, snow, and extreme cold. Wildlife is common on the trail, and participants sometimes face challenges from <a href="moose">moose</a> and <a href="wolf">wolves</a>. Because of the harsh conditions, the Yukon Quest has been called the "most difficult sled dog race in the world" and the "toughest race in the world".

Because of the extreme difficulty of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points along the trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000 miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is two days before the race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.

The traditional starting line is in Whitehorse on First Avenue, near the former <a href="White%20Pass%20and%20Yukon%20Route">White Pass and Yukon Route</a> train station, which today houses the Canadian offices of <a href="Yukon%20Quest%20International">Yukon Quest International</a>. Shortly after leaving the starting line, racers follow the frozen Yukon River north out of town. Crossing onto the <a href="Takhini%20River">Takhini River</a>, mushers follow it north to the <a href="Klondike%20Gold%20Rush">Klondike-era</a> <a href="Overland%20Trail%20%28Yukon%29">Overland Trail</a>. Racers take the trail to <a href="Braeburn%20Lodge">Braeburn Lodge</a>, the first checkpoint.

This trail segment is about long. The terrain consists of small hills and frequent frozen streams and lakes. When the race runs from Fairbanks to Whitehorse, the Braeburn checkpoint is the site of a mandatory eight-hour stop to ensure the health of mushers' dogs before the final stage. In odd years, mushers must take a four-hour rest here or at Carmacks. The three minute start time difference is adjusted here. In even years, mushers must take an eight (8) hour rest here before continuing on for the last of the race.

In the first leg of this, mushers must travel from Bareburn to Carmacks which is . In odd years, mushers have the option of taking their four-hour rest here or at Bareburn. The three minute difference start time is also adjusted if the musher chooses to take their four-hour rest here.
Coming out of Braeburn, competitors cross the <a href="Klondike%20Highway">Klondike Highway</a> and proceed east for about to <a href="Coghlan%20Lake">Coghlan Lake</a>. From there they turn north, then northwest, and travel along a chain of lakes that stretches for about . They then enter a notorious stretch of heavily forested hills nicknamed "Pinball Alley" for the way the rough terrain bounces sleds into trees, rocks, and other obstacles. Trees are so scarred from repeated sled impacts that they have lost their bark on one side. In 1998, racer Brenda Mackey was jolted around so much by the rough trail that her sled became wedged between two trees, forcing her to cut one down to continue.

After Pinball Alley, racers briefly mush along the Yukon River before climbing the riverbank to the Carmacks checkpoint. They then follow a road for about and turn onto a <a href="firebreak">firebreak</a> trail. After departing the trail, they travel alongside and across the Yukon River to McCabe Creek, the first dog drop on the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Leaving McCabe Creek, the race trail parallels a <a href="driveway">driveway</a> and the Klondike Highway for several miles before turning north to cross the Pelly Burn, an area scorched by a wildfire in 1995. Because the fire destroyed much of the forest in the area, this portion of the trail has few obstacles and is considered fast. From the McCabe Creek site it is about to Pelly Crossing.

The stretch between Pelly Crossing and Dawson City is the greatest distance between checkpoints of any sled dog competition in the world. Between the two sites are of open trail, marked only by a dog drop at <a href="Scroggie%20Creek">Scroggie Creek</a>, an abandoned gold-mining site activated only during the Yukon Quest.

From Pelly Crossing, mushers travel west on the frozen <a href="Pelly%20River">Pelly River</a>, or on a road that parallels the river if ice conditions are poor. At <a href="Stepping%20Stone%2C%20Yukon">Stepping Stone</a>, shortly before the Pelly and Yukon rivers meet, they can rest at a hospitality stop before turning north. From Stepping Stone to Scroggie Creek the trail consists of a mining road or "cat" road, named for the <a href="Caterpillar%20Inc.">Caterpillar</a> tracked mining vehicles that use it. Before organizers coordinated schedules with the mining equipment operators, racers often had to contend with heavy machinery blocking the trail or turning it into a muddy path. The Scroggie Creek dog drop is at the confluence of the <a href="Stewart%20River%20%28Yukon%29">Stewart River</a> and Scroggie Creek.

After Scroggie Creek, the trail switches from a westerly direction to almost directly north. At this point, mushers enter the gold-mining district surrounding Dawson City. From the Stewart River adjacent to Scroggie, the trail climbs, crossing the Yukon Territory's Black Hills. from Dawson City and from Scroggie Creek, it crosses the <a href="Indian%20River%20%28Yukon%29">Indian River</a>, and mushers begin the climb to King Solomon's Dome, the highest point () on the trail. The trail ascends more gradually in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route than in the opposite direction, where mushers have to endure several <a href="Hairpin%20turn">switchbacks</a>. When mushers start in Whitehorse, they already have gained several thousand feet from the ascent into the Black Hills, including a climb over <a href="Eureka%20Dome">Eureka Dome</a>. The main difficulties come during the descent from King Solomon's Dome to <a href="Bonanza%20Creek">Bonanza Creek</a>, the epicenter of the Klondike Gold Rush. After reaching the creek, mushers thread through an area of mining waste and follow the <a href="Klondike%20River">Klondike River</a> to Dawson City, the halfway point of the race. They are required to rest for 36 hours in Dawson City as a halfway-rest.

The distance from Dawson City to <a href="Eagle%2C%20Alaska">Eagle</a>, the first checkpoint in Alaska for the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route, is . Mushers must rest for four hours in <a href="Eagle%2C%20Alaska">Eagle</a>.

Racers exit Dawson City on the Yukon River and follow it for about to the <a href="Fortymile%20River">Fortymile River</a> hospitality stop. The river's name comes from its distance from <a href="Fort%20Reliance">Fort Reliance</a>, an abandoned trading post established in 1874. From the hospitality stop, mushers travel southwest on the Fortymile River in what is one of the coldest portions of the race, because of cold air sinking to the bottom of the river valley. The trail on the river crosses the Alaska–Canada border, noticeable only because of the <a href="border%20vista">border vista</a>, a strip of land cleared of all foliage. Shortly past the border, the river turns northwest, and mushers leave its frozen surface when it meets the <a href="Taylor%20Highway">Taylor Highway</a>, a road closed to automobile traffic during the winter. As the trail follows the highway for conditions are often hazardous, with high winds and drifting snow that can obscure trail markers. After climbing the American Summit, the trail gradually descends to Eagle, on the banks of the Yukon River.

The route from Eagle to <a href="Central%2C%20Alaska">Central</a> covers a distance of . In winter, Eagle is buffeted by high winds and drifting snow funneled through the town by nearby Eagle Bluff, which stands above the Yukon River. Because it is the first stop in the United States, competitors are greeted at Eagle by a <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">United States Department of Homeland Security</a> official who checks passports and entry documents.

After leaving Eagle, mushers travel northwest for on the Yukon River, except for a few short <a href="portage">portage</a>s. During this stretch, two hospitality stops are available. The first is from Eagle at <a href="Trout%20Creek%2C%20Alaska">Trout Creek</a>. The next is <a href="Biederman%27s%20Cabin">Biederman's Cabin</a>, the former home of <a href="Charlie%20Biederman">Charlie Biederman</a>, one of the last people to deliver mail by sled dog. (The final sled dog mail route was canceled in 1963, and Biederman's sled hangs in the <a href="National%20Postal%20Museum">National Postal Museum</a>.) A dog drop site is located from Biederman's Cabin at <a href="Slaven%27s%20Cabin">Slaven's Cabin</a>, a historic site operated by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>. Some past Slaven's Cabin mushers arrive in <a href="Circle%2C%20Alaska">Circle</a>, so named because its founders believed it was on the <a href="Arctic%20Circle">Arctic Circle</a>. (Circle is actually about south of that line.)

From Circle, it is to the checkpoint in <a href="Central%2C%20Alaska">Central</a>. Mushers follow <a href="Birch%20Creek%20%28Yukon%20River%20tributary%29">Birch Creek</a> south until just before <a href="Circle%20Hot%20Springs%2C%20Alaska">Circle Hot Springs</a>. This area, along with the Fortymile stretch, is considered among the coldest on the trail, and mushers are advised to prepare for temperatures. Turning west, they travel through frozen swamps before reaching the Steese Roadhouse checkpoint in <a href="Central%2C%20Alaska">Central</a>. In <a href="Central%2C%20Alaska">Central</a> during even years, mushers have the option of taking their four-hour rest here or at Mile 101. If they choose to, the three minute start difference will be subtracted from their rest time.

From Central to the final (or first, in the Fairbanks–Whitehorse direction) checkpoint in <a href="Two%20Rivers%2C%20Alaska">Two Rivers</a> is . Despite the comparative closeness of the checkpoints and the location of a dog drop between them, this is considered the most difficult stretch of dog sled trail in the world. At this point, mushers must climb the two steepest and most difficult mountains on the trail: Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit.

After leaving Central, mushers head west, paralleling the <a href="Steese%20Highway">Steese Highway</a>, which connects Central and Circle with Fairbanks. The trail travels through frozen swamps, mining areas, and firebreaks for about . Mushers then encounter the Steese Highway for a second time before crossing several creeks to begin the ascent of Eagle Summit. They eventually climb above the <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a> and are exposed to the wind as they continue upward. The weather atop Eagle Summit is harsh as this is a <a href="convergence%20zone">convergence zone</a> between the <a href="Yukon%20Flats">Yukon Flats</a> to the north and the low ground of the <a href="Tanana%20Valley">Tanana Valley</a> to the south. A differential in the weather within the two valleys causes high winds and precipitation when there is moisture in the atmosphere. The final few hundred yards of the climb consists of a 30-degree slope often scoured to bare rock and <a href="tundra">tundra</a> by the fierce wind. The crossing point itself is a symmetrical <a href="Mountain%20pass">saddle</a>, with two peaks of similar height separated by . The south side of Eagle Summit is not as steep, and mushers generally have an easier time reaching the checkpoint at Mile 101. When descending the steep northern slope of Eagle Summit on the Fairbanks–Whitehorse route, many mushers wrap their sled runners in <a href="chain">chain</a>s to increase <a href="friction">friction</a> and slow the plunge.

The Mile 101 checkpoint is a cabin at mile marker 101 (the distance from Fairbanks) on the Steese Highway. At Mile 101, mushers have the option of taking their four-hour rest during even years. They can also take the rest at <a href="Central%2C%20Alaska">Central</a> during even years. Again, the three minute start difference will be subtracted from the race if the musher desires to take their rest here. The cabin gives mushers the opportunity for a short rest between Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit. The ascent of Rosebud Summit begins about south of the dog drop. It consists of a gradual climb of followed by a steep descent into the valley that contains the north fork of the Chena River. The descent also brings mushers back into forested terrain. The trail then parallels a road for about before entering the final checkpoint at Twin Bears Campground near Two Rivers.

Two Rivers is the final checkpoint in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Mushers are required to rest at least eight hours in Two Rivers in odd years to ensure the health of their dogs during the final leg of the race. The terrain in this stretch is among the easiest on the trail, with gently rolling hills and forest which gradually change into an urban landscape as racers approach Fairbanks. The greatest challenge for racers in the Two Rivers area is distinguishing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled dog trails, many of which have similar markings. Mushers have occasionally been deceived by these markings and taken wrong turns.

Beyond Two Rivers, the trail reaches the <a href="Chena%20River">Chena River</a> northwest of Fairbanks. This is the final stretch, and mushers use the river to enter Fairbanks and reach the finish line, which is on the river itself in the middle of downtown Fairbanks. Regardless of the timing of the finish, several thousand spectators typically gather to watch the first musher cross the finish line.

The 1984 route was slightly different from today's. It had just one non-checkpoint dog drop, at the Mile 101 location, and bypassed American Summit, Pelly Junction, and Braeburn. Instead of running through Braeburn, mushers traveled across <a href="Lake%20Laberge">Lake Laberge</a> for between Whitehorse and Minto. The inaugural race also included a checkpoint at <a href="Chena%20Hot%20Springs%2C%20Alaska">Chena Hot Springs Resort</a> near Fairbanks. This site was moved to nearby Angel Creek after mushers complained that the hot springs melted nearby snow, causing their dogs to become wet—an extreme hazard in sub-freezing temperatures. Two additional dog drops were added for the 1994 race: Biederman's Cabin (since replaced by Slaven's Cabin) and McCabe Creek. In 1995, the Whitehorse end of the trail was moved away from Lake Laberge to near the Takhini River. Additional changes that year included the rerouting of the trail around the southern and eastern sides of King Solomon's Dome south of Dawson City and the introduction of the Scroggie Creek dog drop site on the shore of the Stewart River.

In 1996, the trail was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a checkpoint was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch was replaced by a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the <a href="Chena%20River%20Lakes%20Flood%20Control%20Project">Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project</a> and to the Alaska town of <a href="North%20Pole%2C%20Alaska">North Pole</a> before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. In the past several races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a gravel pit in 2011.

The Yukon Quest trail is in the <a href="subarctic%20climate">subarctic climate</a> range. In Fairbanks, the average February temperature is , but is not uncommon, and temperatures have dropped to . An average of of snow falls in February, with average <a href="Snow%23Snow%20on%20the%20ground">snowpack</a> depth of .

Outside the sheltered urban areas of Fairbanks, Whitehorse, and Dawson City, temperatures and snowfall are often more extreme. During the 2008 race, competitors started in temperatures in Fairbanks and then faced winds of on the trail, resulting in severe <a href="wind%20chill">wind chill</a>s. At higher elevations, such as the crossings of Rosebud and Eagle summits, <a href="Whiteout%20%28weather%29">whiteout</a> <a href="blizzard">blizzard</a>s are common. In the 2006 race, 12 teams were struck by a massive storm that eventually caused the evacuation of seven teams by helicopter. In 2009, mushers endured winds up to , blowing snow, and subzero temperatures atop Eagle Summit, where conditions had been even worse in a storm during the 1988 race, when wind chill temperatures dropped below .

The extreme temperatures pose a serious health hazard. <a href="Frostbite">Frostbite</a> is common, as is <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>. In the 1988 Yukon Quest, Jeff King suffered an entirely frozen hand because of nerve damage from an earlier injury which left him unable to feel the cold. King said his hand became "like something from a frozen corpse". In 1989, King and his team drove through a break in the Yukon River in temperatures. Frozen by the extreme cold, King managed to reach a cabin and thaw out. Other racers have suffered permanent damage from the cold: Lance Mackey suffered frostbitten feet during the 2008 Yukon Quest, and Hugh Neff lost the tips of several toes in the 2004 race.

Since the race's inception in 1984, 353 people from 11 countries have competed in the Yukon Quest, some many times. The race attracts from 21 (in 1996) to 47 (in 1988 and 1989) mushers each year. Of the 776 entries from 1984 to 2007, 263 (34%) did not finish. The racers have come from various professions: taxicab drivers, swimming instructors, coal miners, tax assessors, lawyers, fur trappers, journalists, and a car salesman have all entered.

At the end of the competition, racers are given awards for feats performed on the trail. The foremost is the championship award, given to the winner. Accompanying this is the Golden Harness Award, given to the winner's two lead <a href="sled%20dog">sled dog</a>s. The next award is the Veterinarians Choice Award, which is voted on by race <a href="veterinarian">veterinarian</a>s and given to the musher who took the best care of his or her dogs during the race. Other awards include the Challenge of the North Award—given to the musher who "exemplifies the spirit of the Yukon Quest"—and the Sportsmanship Award, given to the most sportsmanlike competitor, as chosen by a vote of the mushers.

The Rookie of the Year Award is given to the highest-finishing first-time competitor. The Dawson Award, consisting of four ounces of gold, is given to the first musher to reach Dawson City (the midpoint) who also finishes the competition. The final award is the Red Lantern, given to the last official finisher of the year's race. Two awards have been discontinued: the <a href="Kiwanis">Kiwanis</a> Award, given to the first musher to cross the Alaska–Yukon border, and the Mayor's Award, given to the Yukon Quest champion by the Mayor of Fairbanks.

The 2011 Yukon Quest champion is Alaskan <a href="Dallas%20Seavey">Dallas Seavey</a>, who finished the race in 10 days, 11 hours and 53 minutes. Seavey, who has run the <a href="Iditarod%20Trail%20Sled%20Dog%20Race">Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</a> several times, won the Yukon Quest in his rookie year and therefore also was named rookie of the year. <a href="Haliburton%2C%20Ontario">Haliburton, Ontario</a> musher Hank DeBruin won the 2011 Red Lantern Award by finishing the race in 13 days, 10 hours, and 54 minutes. For the first time in Yukon Quest history, more than one musher received the sportsmanship award. Following the 2011 race, Allen Moore, Brent Sass and Mike Ellis shared the honor. Ken Anderson, who reached Dawson City third, was the only one of the top three at that point to finish, and thus received the Dawson Award. Wasilla musher Kelley Griffin received the Spirit of the North award, and the Veterinarian's Choice award was given to Mike Ellis and his wife/handler Sue Ellis.

Dogs in the Yukon Quest come in a variety of sizes and breeds, though the most common are <a href="Alaskan%20Husky">Alaskan</a> and <a href="Siberian%20Husky">Siberian Huskies</a> weighing between . The Alaskan Husky is not a recognized breed, but an amalgam of several different types bred for speed, stamina, and strength. Siberian Huskies are a breed recognized by the <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">American Kennel Club</a> and are characterized by thick coats, stiff ears, a fox-like tail, and medium size. Siberian Huskies are typically larger and slower than their Alaskan counterparts, causing mushers to nickname the breed "Slowberians", but have more pulling power. The difference was seen during the 1998 Yukon Quest, when Bruce Lee's team of Alaskan Huskies competed against André Nadeau's team of Siberians. Lee's team was faster than Nadeau's over short stretches, but Lee had to rest more often. Nadeau had a head start out of the final checkpoint, but Lee was able to overtake him.

The Yukon Quest encourages participants' self-sufficiency, and one of its objectives is "[to] encourage and facilitate knowledge and application of the widest variety of bush skills and practices that form the foundation of Arctic survival." On the trail, racers may not accept outside assistance and are limited in the changes they may make to their teams and sled. There are 10 checkpoints and four additional locations where sick or injured dogs may be dropped from a team. Only four checkpoint stops are mandated: a 36-hour stop at Dawson City; a four-hour stop in Eagle, Alaska; a two-hour stop at the first checkpoint; and an eight-hour stop at the last.

As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers must carry an axe, a cold-weather <a href="sleeping%20bag">sleeping bag</a>, a pair of <a href="snowshoes">snowshoes</a>, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight <a href="Dog%20booties">booties</a> per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous <a href="event%20cover">event cover</a>s intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately <a href="butcher">butcher</a> any <a href="Game%20%28food%29">game animal</a> killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.

Competitors must meet a series of written and unwritten requirements before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants have been known to lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, <a href="Newton%20Marshall">Newton Marshall</a> from the <a href="Jamaica%20Dogsled%20Team">Jamaica Dogsled Team</a> borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of and one of . Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.

Those who have completed at least of Quest-sanctioned racing are eligible to send in an entry form. This requires entrants to certify that they are older than 18, have not been censured by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and have never been convicted of animal abuse or neglect. They must pay $1,500 or $2,000 for late entries.

Many of the Quest's rules are intended to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.

Mushers must start the race with at most fourteen dogs and finish with no fewer than six. Dogs are visually examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog whips and forced feeding are forbidden. Participating dogs may not receive injections during the race or be under the influence of performance-enhancing substances such as <a href="steroid">steroid</a>s. The race marshal may remove any team from the race for violations of these rules or substandard dog care.

The Yukon Quest's rules allow race officials latitude on whether to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations. The most serious penalties can be assessed for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed. More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records. These minor penalties can have an effect on the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Circle Hot Springs road. As a result, he finished four minutes behind <a href="Sebastian%20Schnuelle">Sebastian Schnuelle</a>, the winner.

In addition to the main 1,000-mile sled dog race, the Yukon Quest organization operates two shorter races: the Junior Yukon Quest and the Yukon Quest 300. The two began in 2000, though in its first three years the Quest 300 was only 250 miles and thus known as the Quest 250.

The Junior Yukon Quest, or Junior Quest, is a race for mushers older than 14 but under 18. Unlike the Yukon Quest, the Junior Quest does not change locations and always starts and ends in Fairbanks. It is billed as an opportunity for young racers to experience a mid-distance sled dog race. They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same equipment as mushers in the Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300.

The Yukon Quest 300 is a race along the regular Yukon Quest trail. It alternates starting locations along with the main race and is intended for less-experienced mushers training for longer races. The race is also a qualifier for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and the following year's Yukon Quest. Several mushers, including <a href="Fort%20Yukon%2C%20Alaska">Fort Yukon</a> <a href="Alaska%20Native">Native</a> Josh Cadzow, have used the race as a trial before entering the longer races.

In 2009, the race was capped at 25 entries. When the Quest 300 starts in Whitehorse, its course follows the main Yukon Quest trail until the Stepping Stone hospitality stop. From there, it turns southwest, ending in Minto Landing, Yukon. The Fairbanks route follows the main trail to Circle, then reverses course, ending in Central.

Battle of the Cedars

The Battle of the Cedars () was a series of military confrontations early in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> during the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army's</a> <a href="Invasion%20of%20Canada%20%281775%29">invasion of Canada</a> that had begun in September 1775. The skirmishes, which involved limited combat, occurred in May 1776 at and around <a href="Les%20C%C3%A8dres%2C%20Quebec">the Cedars</a>, west of <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a>. Continental Army units were opposed by a small force of British troops leading a larger force of <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indians</a> (primarily <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>) and militia.

Brigadier General <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>, commanding the American military garrison at Montreal, had placed a detachment of his troops at the Cedars in April 1776, after hearing of rumors of British and Indian military preparations to the west of Montreal. The garrison surrendered on May 19 after a confrontation with a combined force of British and Indian troops led by Captain George Forster. American reinforcements on their way to the Cedars were also captured after a brief skirmish on May 20. All of the captives were eventually released after negotiations between Forster and Arnold, who was bringing a sizable force into the area. The terms of the agreement required the Americans to release an equal number of British prisoners, but the deal was repudiated by <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Congress</a>, and no British prisoners were freed.

Colonel <a href="Timothy%20Bedel">Timothy Bedel</a> and Lieutenant Isaac Butterfield, leaders of the American force at the Cedars, were <a href="court%20martial">court-martialed</a> and <a href="cashiered">cashiered</a> from the Continental Army for their roles in the affair. After distinguishing himself as a volunteer, Bedel was given a new <a href="commissioned%20officer">commission</a> in 1777. News of the affair included greatly inflated reports of casualties, and often included graphic but false accounts of atrocities committed by the Iroquois, who made up the majority of the British forces.

<a href="Les%20C%C3%A8dres%2C%20Quebec">The Cedars</a> is on the north shore of the <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20River">Saint Lawrence River</a>, about from the center of modern <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, to the southwest of the western tip of the <a href="island%20of%20Montreal">island of Montreal</a>, from which it is separated by the <a href="Ottawa%20River">Ottawa River</a>. The nearby <a href="rapid">rapid</a>s in the Saint Lawrence required <a href="portage">portage</a>, making the Cedars a strategic landing point for anyone navigating the river to or from Montreal. Crossing of the Ottawa River was made between <a href="Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue%2C%20Quebec">Fort Anne</a> and Quinze-Chênes, now <a href="Vaudreuil-Dorion%2C%20Quebec">Vaudreuil</a>.

In September 1775, early in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, a <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> under the direction first of Major General <a href="Philip%20Schuyler">Philip Schuyler</a>, and later of Brigadier General <a href="Richard%20Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a>, <a href="Invasion%20of%20Canada%20%281775%29">invaded</a> the British <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763-1791%29">Province of Quebec</a>. Montreal was taken without a fight on November 13, following the <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20St.%20Jean">Siege of Fort St. Jean</a>. Montgomery left a garrison of troops under the command of Major General <a href="David%20Wooster">David Wooster</a> in control of Montreal before leading the rest of the army to <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a>. The occupation of Montreal was poorly managed, and relations between the Americans and the population, including those supportive of the Americans, deteriorated for a variety of reasons. One major factor that contributed to the poor relations was the American interdiction of trade with the Indian populations on the upper St. Lawrence and the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, since the trade goods might be used to support British garrisons in those areas. The fur trade was economically important to the city, and its interruption affected both supporters and opponents of the American cause.
Following the American losses at the <a href="battle%20of%20Quebec%20%281775%29">battle of Quebec</a> at the end of 1775, Wooster eventually led reinforcements to Quebec. He arrived early in April 1776, and the military administration of Montreal passed temporarily to Colonel <a href="Moses%20Hazen">Moses Hazen</a> before going to Brigadier General <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>, who had been in command at Quebec. The American forces occupying the city numbered about 500, with additional forces at posts outside the city. Wooster had reported to General Schuyler as early as March 5 of rumored scheming between British troops and Indians to the west of the city. In response to these alarming reports, as well as the unauthorized departures of two fur traders and <a href="Claude-Nicolas-Guillaume%20de%20Lorimier">Claude de Lorimier</a>, a British Indian agent from Montreal, Hazen had sent 400 troops commanded by Colonel <a href="Timothy%20Bedel">Timothy Bedel</a> of <a href="Bedel%27s%20Regiment">Bedel's Regiment</a> to occupy a strategic position at the Cedars in early April. Lieutenant Isaac Butterfield led an advance force that arrived at the Cedars on April 26 and began construction of a wooden stockade fort, fortifying it with two 4-pound cannons. Bedel and the rest of the detachment arrived on May 6.

The Indian agent Lorimier traveled west to <a href="Ogdensburg%2C%20New%20York">Oswegatchie</a>, where a company of the <a href="8th%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">8th Regiment of Foot</a> under the command of George Forster had occupied <a href="Fort%20de%20La%20Pr%C3%A9sentation">Fort de La Présentation</a>. Lorimier proposed recruiting a force of Indians to launch an attack on Continental forces at Montreal from the west. When Forster agreed, Lorimier went to <a href="Saint%20Regis%2C%20Quebec">Saint Regis</a>, where he recruited 100 Mohawk men from <a href="Akwesasne">Akwesasne</a>. Word of these activities led the American rebels to fortify the Cedars.

At <a href="Fort%20Niagara">Fort Niagara</a> in early May the <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a> captain, <a href="John%20Butler%20%28pioneer%29">John Butler</a>, held a conference with several hundred tribesmen, primarily from the Six Nations of the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>, in which his goal was to break pledges of neutrality some of them had made in 1775. Butler, an experienced Indian agent, plied the natives with liquor and tales of combat; he convinced more than 50 <a href="Seneca%20nation">Seneca</a>, <a href="Cayuga%20nation">Cayuga</a>, and <a href="Onondaga%20%28tribe%29">Onondaga</a> warriors to join the British cause, as well as some warriors from further west. Historians are uncertain whether any of these recruits participated in the action at the Cedars, but it appears unlikely. <a href="%23Stanley">Stanley (1973)</a> is of the opinion that Indian participation was limited to those recruited by Lorimier, who went as far as <a href="Gananoque%2C%20Ontario">Gananoque</a> to recruit. <a href="%23Lanctot">Lanctot (1967)</a> and <a href="%23SmithFourteenII">Smith</a> do not identify any specific tribes participating in the action.

James Stanley Goddard, one of the fur traders who left with Lorimier, traveled further west in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to raise an Indian force to oppose the Americans occupying Quebec. He reached <a href="Fort%20Michilimackinac">Fort Michilimackinac</a> in June, where the British commander, Captain <a href="Arent%20DePeyster">Arent DePeyster</a>, sent him recruiting among the <a href="Menominee">Menominee</a> and <a href="Ho-Chunk">Winnebago</a> tribes near <a href="Green%20Bay%2C%20Wisconsin">Green Bay</a>. DePeyster also sent out Joseph Ainsse, a local Indian interpreter, to recruit from tribes closer to the fort. None of the Indians recruited by these men reached Montreal until well after the Americans had left the city.

Once forces began assembling at Oswegatchie, Lorimier made arrangements with a sympathetic priest near the Cedars for the provisioning of supplies for the troops. With the assistance of some men of the 8th Foot, he strategically hid several shallow-draft boats, known as "<a href="bateaux">bateaux</a>", near a point where the <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20River">Saint Lawrence River</a> could be crossed.

Forster left Oswegatchie on May 12 with about 40 regular troops, 10 British and French-speaking <a href="Canadien">Canadien</a> militia, and 160 Iroquois. On May 14, they picked up 44 more Iroquois at Saint Francis, and camped at the western end of Saint Francis Lake on May 16. On May 17, Forster received scouting reports about the troop strength at the Cedars. The Indians were concerned about the number of troops, but news that the Americans were in retreat from Quebec emboldened them to act.

On May 15, Bedel left the Cedars, leaving Butterfield in charge of the fort. Bedel later claimed that the reason for his departure was to meet with the friendly <a href="Caughnawaga%20Indians">Caughnawaga Indians</a>. In his court martial, the judges concluded this claim was suspect. He returned to Montreal and reported that a force of 150 British troops of the 8th Foot and about 500 Iroquois commanded by Forster was approaching. On this news, Colonel <a href="John%20Paterson%20%28New%20York%20politician%29">John Paterson</a> sent Major <a href="Henry%20Sherburne%20%28colonel%29">Henry Sherburne</a> with 140 men from <a href="Paterson%27s%20Regiment">his regiment</a> toward the Cedars. Arnold, who was meeting with the retreating Continental Army command at <a href="Sorel%2C%20Quebec">Sorel</a>, returned to Montreal when the news reached him and set about organizing a larger relief force.

Forster's force landed near the American-occupied fort on May 18, and sent in a demand for surrender. Butterfield countered with a request to withdraw under arms, which Forster refused. The parties exchanged fire. During the course of the exchange, Forster received word that Sherburne had crossed the Ottawa River from the island of Montreal to Quinze-Chênes, but, believing the Cedars to have fallen already, had retreated back across the river. This news caused the besiegers to redouble their efforts the next day. Additional help arrived for the British in the form of about 40 "Canadiens" under Jean-Baptiste Testard de Montigny; Forster sent them to harass Sherburne. Word then came to Forster that Sherburne had resumed his advance; Butterfield, unaware of this, surrendered the fort. The terms of capitulation included a guarantee of the personal safety of the captured men. The Iroquois plundered the fort's stores, and denied some of the captives small pouches of sometimes valuable personal items.

Sherburne reached Fort Anne, across the Ottawa River from Quinze-Chênes, on May 17. A scout he sent across the river the next day was captured by Lorimier. The scout was allowed to notify Sherburne of his capture; in his message he included a claim that 500 Indians had surrounded the fort at the Cedars. Consequently, Sherburne decided to delay crossing the river, and sent word back to Montreal requesting further assistance.

Sherburne decided to advance on May 20. Some of his men were apparently suffering from the aftereffects of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, so these were left behind. Sherburne landed about 100 of his men at Quinze-Chênes, about from the Cedars. When word of this crossing reached Forster, he ordered Lorimier to take 100 Indians and stop Sherburne. Lorimier was at first only able to raise 40 warriors, but was joined on the way by another 40. Sherburne, not realizing that Butterfield had already surrendered, marched his troops right at Lorimier's advancing force. They fought for about 40 minutes before Sherburne, believing he was being attacked by a much larger force, surrendered. The Iroquois claimed these captives as war spoils, since they were not part of the fort's garrison, and prepared to kill some of them in retaliation for their own losses. Only the intervention of Forster, who paid a ransom, prevented this; it did not prevent the Iroquois from stripping the prisoners of all but their clothes.

Following his successes, Forster moved his forces, including all of the prisoners, down to Quinze-Chênes, where more <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a> militia had assembled. Leaving some of the prisoners there, he advanced on May 23 to <a href="Fort%20Senneville">Fort Senneville</a>, a fortified works on the southwest tip of Montreal island that was owned by Montigny. In the meantime, Arnold gathered most of the few remaining forces in Montreal, and sent requests to the outposts around the city for additional troops. By May 24, he was entrenched at <a href="Lachine%2C%20Quebec">Lachine</a>, south of the city, and his force had reached 450 men. Forster began to advance on Lachine, but decided to retreat back to Quinze-Chênes when his scouts notified him of Arnold's position. He also received intelligence from Montreal that Arnold's force was going to be massively reinforced—the reported number of reinforcements was 1,500 to 2,000 men, more than Arnold had available in the area.

Once his scouts reported Forster's retreat, Arnold gave chase. He reached Fort Senneville (which he burned) on May 26, just as Forster's men were landing on the far shore at Quinze-Chênes. Arnold decided to send a group of <a href="Mohawk%20nation">Caughnawagas</a>, who were friendly to the Americans, with a demand that Forster release his prisoners and a threat that he would destroy area Indian villages if any of the prisoners were harmed. Forster countered that he would permit his Indians to kill the prisoners if Arnold attacked. Arnold attempted to cross the Ottawa River with some of his men in bateaux, but Forster used the four-pounders captured at the Cedars to drive them back.
Arnold called a war council so the Americans could consider their options. He wanted to mount a surprise attack the next morning; Hazen, who had acquired significant experience fighting Indians in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>, argued against the idea. The disagreement between the two men was severe enough that it nearly provoked Arnold to file charges of insubordination against Hazen. The council decided not to act, voting Arnold's proposed attack down. Early in the morning of May 27, a boat crossed the river carrying Sherburne and Forster's deputy, Lieutenant Parke. Forster, whose forces were somewhat reduced as some of the Indians had returned to their homes, had negotiated a prisoner exchange with Sherburne and Butterfield. After further negotiations, both Arnold and Forster agreed to terms. The American prisoners were returned to Arnold at Fort Anne on May 30, after being delayed for two days by high winds on the river.

The Americans never held up their side of the prisoner exchange. Formally repudiating the agreement over the protests of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Congress</a> accused Forster of mistreating American prisoners by turning them over to the Indians. In a breach of etiquette, the letter containing the repudiation was delivered to Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a>, instead of the British commander-in-chief and governor of the province, <a href="Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester">Guy Carleton</a>. The Congressional action may have been tainted by overly lurid accounts of the action—<a href="Charles%20Carroll%20of%20Carrollton">Charles Carroll</a>, part of a Congressional delegation that was in Montreal at the time, reported that "a hundred or more [American troops] were barbarously murdered by savages." Arnold's report of the incident included otherwise unsubstantiated allegations that two prisoners were killed by Forster's Indians. Some histories of the action (for example, the 1882 history by <a href="%23Jones">Jones</a>) include accounts of significant atrocities committed by the Indians, but little supporting evidence has been found. The Congressional repudiation complicated an attempted prisoner exchange in 1781 involving Burgoyne and <a href="Henry%20Laurens">Henry Laurens</a>, a congressman from <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> whom the British were holding in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>; Laurens was eventually freed in exchange for a promise to help negotiate <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Lord Cornwallis</a>'s release.

Arnold initially blamed Bedel for the defeat. He removed both Bedel and Butterfield from command and sent them to Sorel for court-martial. Due to the army's retreat, the two men were not tried until August 1, 1776, at <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a>. Both were convicted and <a href="cashiered">cashiered</a> from the army. Bedel continued to volunteer his services, and following Burgoyne's <a href="Battle%20of%20Saratoga">surrender at Saratoga</a> in October 1777, he was given a new commission by Congress.

The site of some of the skirmishes was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada">National Historic Site of Canada</a> in 1928.

Central Coast Mariners FC

Central Coast Mariners Football Club is an Australian professional <a href="association%20football">soccer</a> club based in <a href="Gosford">Gosford</a>, on the <a href="Central%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Central Coast</a> of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. It competes in the <a href="A-League">A-League</a>, under <a href="Professional%20sports%20league%20organization%23Systems%20around%20the%20world">licence</a> from <a href="Football%20Federation%20Australia">Football Federation Australia</a> (FFA). The Mariners were founded in 2004 and are one of the eight original A-League teams. It is the first professional sports club from the <a href="Gosford">Gosford</a> region to compete in a national competition. Despite being considered one of the smallest-market clubs in the league, the Central Coast Mariners have claimed one A-League Championship from four Grand Final appearances and topped the table to win the <a href="Minor%20premiership">A-League Premiership</a> twice. The club has also appeared in the <a href="AFC%20Champions%20League">AFC Champions League</a> four times.

The club plays matches at <a href="Central%20Coast%20Stadium">Central Coast Stadium</a>, a 20,059-seat stadium in Gosford; its purpose-built training facility, <a href="Mariners%20Centre%20of%20Excellence">Mariners Centre of Excellence</a>, is located in the suburb of <a href="Tuggerah%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tuggerah</a>. The facility is also home to a youth team that competes in the <a href="National%20Youth%20League%20%28Australia%29">National Youth League</a>. The <a href="EFL%20Championship">English EFL Championship</a> team <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> has invested in the Central Coast-based club, and the Mariners has affiliation agreements with several international clubs.

The Mariners' main <a href="Supporters%27%20groups">supporters' group</a> is known as the Yellow Army, for the colour of the club's home kit. The club shares a rivalry with <a href="Newcastle%20Jets%20FC">Newcastle Jets</a>, known as the <a href="F3%20Derby">F3 Derby</a>, after the previous name of the motorway that connects the cities of the teams. <a href="Matt%20Simon">Matt Simon</a> is the Mariners' all-time leading goalscorer as of December 2014, with 49 goals in all competitions. The team record for matches played is held by <a href="John%20Hutchinson%20%28footballer%29">John Hutchinson</a>, who has appeared in 263 games for the Mariners.

Central Coast Mariners' bid for a franchise in the <a href="Football%20Federation%20Australia">Football Federation Australia</a>'s new <a href="A-League">A-League</a> competition was aimed at filling the one spot for a regional team that was designated by the FFA. Media speculation prior to the announcement of the franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners' bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former <a href="Australia%20national%20association%20football%20team">Australian</a> international player and club <a href="technical%20director">technical director</a> <a href="Alex%20Tobin">Alex Tobin</a>, as well as <a href="Clean%20Up%20Australia">Clean Up Australia</a> personality <a href="Ian%20Kiernan">Ian Kiernan</a>—who would act as inaugural club chairman—also strengthened its proposal. As the only regional bidder, Central Coast was expected to make it into the league by default. Following a reported signed deal with the FFA, the club signed former <a href="Northern%20Spirit%20FC">Northern Spirit</a> coach <a href="Lawrie%20McKinna">Lawrie McKinna</a> as manager and <a href="Ian%20Ferguson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201967%29">Ian Ferguson</a>, a former <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> and Northern Spirit player, as coach. To aid the FFA's goals of building the profile of the sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United. On 1 November 2004, after much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of FFA's domestic competition, the A-League. The decision made Central Coast Mariners the first Gosford-based professional sports team to play in a national competition.

At the time of the formation of the new league in 2004, the club was owned by Spirits Sports and Leisure Group. The club announced its search for a star player under the league's <a href="Salary%20cap%23A-League">allowance</a> for one star player outside of the $1.5 million salary cap, insisting that the player should not look at the position as a retirement fund. Coach Lawrie McKinna sought interest from Australia national football team players <a href="Ante%20Milicic">Ante Milicic</a> and <a href="Simon%20Colosimo">Simon Colosimo</a>, and announced that he may sign more than the three under-20 players required by league rules. Early concerns for the club focussed on concerns over financial stability, but after forming a partnership with technology company <a href="Toshiba">Toshiba</a> and a cash injection from local businessman <a href="John%20Singleton%20%28Australian%20entrepreneur%29">John Singleton</a>, the club's financial worries were eased. McKinna was keen to sign local player <a href="Damien%20Brown">Damien Brown</a> of <a href="Bateau%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bateau Bay</a>, formerly of the <a href="Newcastle%20Jets%20FC">Newcastle Jets</a>. In a decision which prompted the player to declare that he was "over the moon", Brown became the first player to sign with the club. Club chairman <a href="Lyall%20Gorman">Lyall Gorman</a> was pleased that a local had become a "foundation player" and part of Brown's role would be to assist with selection of younger players from the local area. By early December 2004, the club had created a steady foundation of player signings and began negotiations with former <a href="Perth%20Glory%20FC">Perth Glory</a> striker <a href="Nik%20Mrdja">Nik Mrdja</a>, signing him later in the month as its star attacker. Mrjda was one of the most prominent players in the last season of the <a href="National%20Soccer%20League">National Soccer League</a>, scoring the final goal to secure Perth Glory's finals win. The club's management was reluctant to sign a star player outside of the $1.5 million salary cap, stipulating that they "would have to contribute on the pitch and get people to come to the ground."

The Mariners' <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Central%20Coast%20Mariners%20FC%20season">inaugural season</a> was considered a resounding success by most; the team reached the <a href="2006%20A-League%20Grand%20Final">2006 A-League Grand Final</a> after finishing third during the regular season. Central Coast was defeated by <a href="Sydney%20FC">Sydney FC</a> 1–0 in front of a crowd of 41,689—a competition record at the time. The Mariners also won the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20A-League%23Pre-Season%20Challenge%20Cup">2005 Pre-Season Cup</a>, defeating Perth Glory in the final 1–0. Before the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20A-League">2006–07 A-League</a> season, the Mariners secured the services of then-Australian international <a href="Tony%20Vidmar">Tony Vidmar</a> from <a href="NAC%20Breda">NAC Breda</a> for two years. This was the club's first <a href="A-League%23Squad%20formation%20and%20salaries">marquee signing</a>, following the lead of Sydney FC (<a href="Dwight%20Yorke">Dwight Yorke</a>) and <a href="Adelaide%20United">Adelaide United</a> (<a href="Qu%20Shengqing">Qu Shengqing</a>). Central Coast again reached the grand final in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20A-League%23Pre-Season%20Challenge%20Cup">2006 Pre-Season Cup</a>, losing to Adelaide United 5–4 on <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a> after the score was tied 1–1 after extra time. The Mariners then participated in the 2006–07 A-League season, but was unable to gain a spot in the final series, finishing sixth after the regular season.

Club captain <a href="Noel%20Spencer">Noel Spencer</a> was released by the Mariners, then signed to participate in the Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006–07 season, and <a href="Alex%20Wilkinson">Alex Wilkinson</a> was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every possible competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment. In February 2008, Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Football League Championship</a> side <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>. The partnership was one of several connections the Mariners made with foreign clubs; other partner clubs included <a href="Ferencv%C3%A1rosi%20TC">Ferencváros</a> of Hungary, <a href="Chengdu%20Blades">Chengdu Blades</a> of China and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20FC">São Paulo</a> of Brazil. The agreement benefits the club by providing an opportunity for the youth programme and senior side to draw from the roster of Sheffield United through transfers. The teams also formed a property development joint venture, in the hopes that Central Coast could use its share of income to expand and bolster their Mariners Youth Academy.

The 2007–08 season saw Central Coast win its first premiership on goal difference ahead of Newcastle, following a final round that began with Central Coast and three other clubs level on 31 points. The final series began with a 2–0 loss to Newcastle in the first leg of its major semi-final, but the Mariners forced the tie to extra time by holding a 2–0 lead in the second leg after 90 minutes. A 94th-minute goal by <a href="Sasho%20Petrovski">Sasho Petrovski</a>, who had scored earlier to level the tie, gave Central Coast a 3–2 win on aggregate, putting the Mariners through to the <a href="2008%20A-League%20Grand%20Final">2008 A-League Grand Final</a>. In a rematch with Newcastle, the Jets defeated Central Coast 1–0 in the Grand Final, which ended in controversy due to an uncalled handball against Newcastle in Central Coast Mariners penalty box during the closing seconds of the match. If called, the foul would have given Central Coast a penalty kick and a chance to equalise. As Mariners players disputed referee <a href="Mark%20Shield">Mark Shield</a>'s decision, goalkeeper <a href="Danny%20Vukovi%C4%87">Danny Vuković</a> struck Shield on the arm, resulting in an immediate sending off and later suspension. Vuković was suspended from both domestic and international competition for nine months, with an additional six-months' suspended ban; the latter period was reduced to three months on appeal. Despite further appeals, the ban was eventually confirmed by <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> in June, to include banning the young keeper from competing at the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Olympic Games</a>. The ban lasted into October; in response, Central Coast signed former <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and Australian international keeper <a href="Mark%20Bosnich">Mark Bosnich</a> on a seven-week contract.

Before the 2008–09 season, Central Coast was predicted to be among the A-League leaders, but had a run of three losses in a row to end the regular season. Even with the losing streak, the club narrowly qualified for the finals, finishing in fourth, two points ahead of Sydney F.C. and Wellington Phoenix. Central Coast lost 4–1 on aggregate in their minor semi-final against Queensland Roar, ending the team's season.

In February 2010, following the club's <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Central%20Coast%20Mariners%20FC%20season">2009–10</a> season, McKinna chose to move into a new role, becoming Central Coast's Football and Commercial Operations Manager. Socceroos assistant manager <a href="Graham%20Arnold">Graham Arnold</a> was appointed as the club's new manager, becoming its second manager. In the lead-up to the 2010–11 season, numerous transfers resulted in changes to the club's squad. The Mariners announced the signing of <a href="2005%20FIFA%20World%20Youth%20Championship">2005 Under 20s World Cup</a> winner <a href="Patricio%20P%C3%A9rez">Patricio Pérez</a> of Argentina in June 2010, followed by Dutch defender <a href="Patrick%20Zwaanswijk">Patrick Zwaanswijk</a>. In July 2010, it was announced that the <a href="Central%20Coast%20Mariners%20FC%20W-League">Mariners' women's team</a> would not compete in the 2010–11 <a href="W-League%20%28Australia%29">W-League</a> competition. The club stated that financial reasons were behind the decision, after <a href="Football%20NSW">Football NSW</a> withdrew its funding.

In spite of relatively low expectations in the lead up to the season, the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Central%20Coast%20Mariners%20FC%20season">2010–11</a> season was more successful for the club than 2009–10; the A-League and youth league teams both finished second in their respective leagues in the regular season. The senior team was then defeated by the premiers, <a href="Brisbane%20Roar%20FC">Brisbane Roar</a>, 4–2 on aggregate over two legs in the major semi-final, before defeating <a href="Gold%20Coast%20United%20FC">Gold Coast United</a> 1–0 in the Preliminary Final to qualify for the <a href="2011%20A-League%20Grand%20Final">2011 A-League Grand Final</a> against Brisbane. By reaching the Grand Final, the club also qualified for the <a href="2012%20AFC%20Champions%20League">2012 AFC Champions League</a>. In a championship match that the A-League's website called "classic", Central Coast was defeated 4–2 in a penalty shootout after leading 2–0 with three minutes remaining in extra time to finish runners-up for the third time.

The <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Central%20Coast%20Mariners%20FC%20season">2011–12</a> season was similarly successful, as the club won the premiership for the second time in its history with 51 points, two more than second-place Brisbane. The club failed to qualify for a second successive Grand Final, though, losing 5–2 on aggregate to Brisbane in the major semi-final and 5–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw with Perth Glory in the Grand Final Qualifier.

On 21 April 2013, after three losses in Grand Finals, Central Coast won its first A-League title, defeating first-year side <a href="Western%20Sydney%20Wanderers%20FC">Western Sydney Wanderers</a> 2–0 in the <a href="2013%20A-League%20Grand%20Final">Grand Final</a> at <a href="Sydney%20Football%20Stadium">Allianz Stadium</a>. Arnold re-signed with the club for a further two seasons on 30 August 2013, but on 14 November it was confirmed that he had signed a two-year contract to become manager of <a href="J.%20League%20Division%201">J. League Division 1</a> side <a href="Vegalta%20Sendai">Vegalta Sendai</a>, starting in January 2014. Former assistant manager <a href="Phil%20Moss">Phil Moss</a> was named the new head coach. Mariners general manager Peter Turnbull left the club as well, and <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20football%20team">New Zealand</a> international <a href="Michael%20McGlinchey">Michael McGlinchey</a> moved to the J. League to play for Arnold's new side. Central Coast finished the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20A-League">2013–14 A-League</a> regular season in third place, behind runner-up Western Sydney on goal difference. In the semi-final, the Mariners' championship hopes ended with a 2–0 loss to Western Sydney; the game came three days after the team was eliminated from the <a href="2014%20AFC%20Champions%20League">2014 AFC Champions League</a> after losing to Japanese club <a href="Sanfrecce%20Hiroshima">Sanfrecce Hiroshima</a> 1–0 to finish last in their group.

In what was Moss's first pre-season as coach, he did little to change what Arnold had built at the club. The only major changes in the side were with the addition of Senegalese international <a href="Malick%20Man%C3%A9">Malick Mané</a> and Hungarian <a href="Rich%C3%A1rd%20Vernes">Richárd Vernes</a>, and <a href="Marcos%20Flores">Marcos Flores</a> leaving the club, with <a href="Mile%20Sterjovski">Mile Sterjovski</a> retiring. Mariners began the season on a high, progressing to the semi-finals of the <a href="2014%20FFA%20Cup">2014 FFA Cup</a> and defeating local rivals Newcastle Jets 1–0 at home in the opening round of the A-League. However the season soon turned with the team failing to secure a win for the remainder of the year. After their elimination from the <a href="2015%20AFC%20Champions%20League">2015 AFC Champions League</a> qualifying play-off by Chinese side <a href="Guangzhou%20R%26amp%3BF%20F.C.">Guangzhou R&F</a> and a continued poor league record after a short mid-season break, the club stood down Moss as head coach. The decision was made on 6 March 2015, with Mariners appointing technical director <a href="Tony%20Walmsley">Tony Walmsley</a> in an interim capacity and captain <a href="John%20Hutchinson%20%28footballer%29">John Hutchinson</a> in a dual player-coach role, until the end of the season. Portuguese player <a href="F%C3%A1bio%20Ferreira%20%28Portuguese%20footballer%29">Fábio Ferreira</a> also joined the team at the tail end of the season. On 15 April Walmsley was announced as Mariners' permanent technical director and head coach for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Central%20Coast%20Mariners%20FC%20season">2015–16</a> season. The announcement came despite an end to the season in which the club finished the league in eighth position.

The Mariners had their worst A-League performance to date in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Central%20Coast%20Mariners%20FC%20season">2015–16 season</a>. Their 13 points, the fewest in club history, resulted in a last-place finish, and they set a league record by losing 20 games while winning only 3, a record low for the Mariners. Central Coast allowed 70 goals, the most in league history, and had a goal difference of −37, the worst by an A-League team. The Mariners' totals of goals conceded at home and away (32 and 38 respectively) were also A-League records, and they went the entire season without a clean sheet.

In the <a href="2016%20FFA%20Cup">2016 FFA Cup</a>, the Mariners suffered a 2–1 loss to <a href="Green%20Gully%20SC">Green Gully SC</a> at <a href="Green%20Gully%20Reserve">Green Gully Reserve</a>, becoming just the second A-League team to be eliminated by a state league team in the FFA Cup. Following this loss the club sacked Walmsley on 8 August 2016, with coaching duties in the leadup to the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Central%20Coast%20Mariners%20FC%20season">2016–17 season</a> taken up by assistant coach John Hutchinson in a caretaker role.

On 29 August 2016, <a href="Paul%20Okon">Paul Okon</a> was hired as Central Coast's full-time coach, succeeding the sacked Tony Walmsley.

In Okon's debut as Central Coast manager, the Mariners drew 3–3 with <a href="Perth%20Glory%20FC">Perth Glory</a> at <a href="Perth%20Oval">Nib Stadium</a>, after coming back from 3–0 down at half time.
Okon achieved his first win as Central Coast manager in his fifth game in charge: a 2–1 win over defending champions <a href="Adelaide%20United%20FC">Adelaide United</a> at <a href="Hindmarsh%20Stadium">Hindmarsh Stadium</a> on 6 November 2016.

On 2 August 2017, for the second consecutive year, the Mariners were knocked out of the <a href="FFA%20Cup">FFA Cup</a> by a state league team in the first round, after losing 3–2 to Blacktown City. This gave the Mariners the dubious honour of being the first A-League team to have been knocked out twice in the FFA Cup by state league opposition.

The home jersey worn by the Mariners is mostly yellow with sleeves that are navy blue. The away uniform is a mostly plain navy blue jersey with yellow as a secondary colour. In the 2011–12 season, the club had its kits manufactured by <a href="Hummel%20International">Hummel</a>, as the A-League's <a href="Reebok">Reebok</a> deal had expired at the conclusion of the 2010–11 season. In September 2012, it was announced that the Mariners had signed a two-year deal with <a href="Kappa%20%28company%29">Kappa</a> for them to be the official apparel supplier. The team logo is a yellow football at the centre of a blue curling wave, which symbolises the beaches of the <a href="Central%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Central Coast</a>.

Since 2012, the Mariners have worn special pink kits for one match in October to raise money and awareness for <a href="Pink%20ribbon">Pink Ribbon Day</a>, part of <a href="National%20Breast%20Cancer%20Awareness%20Month">National Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a>. The Mariners club collected donations at the ground, as well as auctioning the match-worn kits on online auction site <a href="eBay">eBay</a> with proceeds going to the charity.

Central Coast Mariners plays home games at Central Coast Stadium, <a href="Gosford">Gosford</a>. It is located in <a href="Grahame%20Park">Grahame Park</a>, between the Gosford Central Business District and the <a href="Brisbane%20Water">Brisbane Water</a> foreshore. It is constructed to make the most of its location, being open at the southern end, giving filtered views of Brisbane Water through a row of large <a href="palm%20trees">palm trees</a>. It is within walking distance of <a href="Gosford%20railway%20station">Gosford railway station</a> and is adjacent to the Central Coast Leagues Club.

While the stadium has a capacity of 20,059, the highest attendance for a Mariners game is 19,238 against Newcastle Jets in round 19 of <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20A-League">the 2007–08 season</a>. Difficulties in drawing spectators led the Mariners to schedule matches in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons away from Central Coast Stadium, at <a href="North%20Sydney%20Oval">North Sydney Oval</a> and <a href="Brookvale%20Oval">Brookvale Oval</a>. The club's goal was to play closer to its fan base in north Sydney, which majority owner Michael Charlesworth estimated to be about 20% of its total supporters. Following attendances at North Sydney Oval that were similar to those at Central Coast Stadium, Football Federation Australia CEO <a href="David%20Gallop">David Gallop</a> suggested in December 2014 that it would be unlikely that the club would be permitted to continue playing in north Sydney.

The active <a href="Supporters%27%20groups">supporters' group</a> for the Mariners is called the Yellow Army, who sit in bay 16 of Central Coast Stadium during home games. In addition to the Yellow Army, there is a Central Coast Mariners Official Supporters Club, which was established during 2013. The Central Coast region has about 300,000 residents, which gives the Mariners the A-League's smallest local fan base. Accordingly, the Mariners acquired a small-market image among commentators.

The Mariners developed a strong rivalry with Newcastle Jets throughout their first season, often referred to as the <a href="F3%20Derby">F3 Derby</a>. The naming is a title previously used for the <a href="Sydney%E2%80%93Newcastle%20Freeway">Sydney–Newcastle Freeway</a>, the major motorway which joins the two clubs' cities. The rivalry's origins date back to before the teams played against each other in the A-League. A May 2005 <a href="OFC%20Champions%20League">Oceania Club Championship</a> qualification match, which went to a penalty shootout that the Mariners won, helped create hostility between the sides. In the game, a tackle by Central Coast's Mrdja broke one of Newcastle player <a href="Andrew%20Durante">Andrew Durante</a>'s legs, causing him to miss the following A-League season; Mrdja offered no apology for the tackle, upsetting Jets players. Fans of the clubs battled verbally before and after one 2011 derby match, leading the "<a href="Newcastle%20Herald">Newcastle Herald</a>"'s Josh Leeson to call their actions "immature and laughable." In more recent seasons, the F3 Derby has gained less attention in the press than the derbies in <a href="Melbourne%20Derby%20%28A-League%29">Melbourne</a> and <a href="Sydney%20Derby%20%28A-League%29">Sydney</a>, but Central Coast player <a href="Nick%20Fitzgerald%20%28footballer%29">Nicholas Fitzgerald</a> maintains that "the players and fans still take it very seriously."

Central Coast also have a rivalry with Sydney FC. Like Newcastle, Sydney FC is close in proximity to Central Coast. In 2006, the "Central Coast Express Advocate"'s Richard Noone called the Central Coast–Sydney rivalry "Arguably A-League's fiercest".

Through an investment in the Mariners by Sheffield United the club has the following international affiliations:

In addition, the club has a player development partnership with the following international clubs:

The club also has formal relationships with the following organisations in Australia:

<a href="John%20Hutchinson%20%28footballer%29">John Hutchinson</a> currently holds the team record for number of total games played with 268 matches in all competitions.

Agrippina (opera)

Agrippina (<a href="H%C3%A4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis">HWV</a> 6) is an "<a href="opera%20seria">opera seria</a>" in three acts by <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a> with a <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by Cardinal <a href="Vincenzo%20Grimani">Vincenzo Grimani</a>. Composed for the Venice <a href="Carnival">"Carnevale"</a> season, the <a href="opera">opera</a> tells the story of <a href="Agrippina%20the%20Younger">Agrippina</a>, the mother of <a href="Nero">Nero</a>, as she plots the downfall of the <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an "anti-heroic satirical comedy", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with <a href="Pope%20Clement%20XI">Pope Clement XI</a>.

Handel composed "Agrippina" at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the <a href="Teatro%20San%20Giovanni%20Grisostomo">Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo</a> on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including "Agrippina", fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century.

In the 20th century "Agrippina" was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Opera">New York City Opera</a> and the <a href="London%20Coliseum">London Coliseum</a> in 2007. Modern critical opinion is that "Agrippina" is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made it one of the most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival.

Handel's earliest opera compositions, in the <a href="Opera%20in%20German">German style</a>, date from his Hamburg years, 1704–06, under the influence of <a href="Johann%20Mattheson">Johann Mattheson</a>. In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> where he was introduced to <a href="Alessandro%20Scarlatti">Alessandro</a> and <a href="Domenico%20Scarlatti">Domenico Scarlatti</a>. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was "<a href="Rodrigo%20%28opera%29">Rodrigo</a>" (1707, original title "Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria"), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose <a href="Italian%20opera">opera in the Italian style</a> and to set <a href="Italian%20language">Italian words</a> to music.

Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of <a href="Recitative%23Secco">"secco" recitative</a> and "<a href="Da%20capo%20aria">aria da capo</a>." Works from this period include "<a href="Dixit%20Dominus%20%28Handel%29">Dixit Dominus</a>" and the dramatic cantata "<a href="Aci%2C%20Galatea%20e%20Polifemo">Aci, Galatea e Polifemo</a>", written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto, "Agrippina". Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the <a href="Teatro%20San%20Giovanni%20Grisostomo">Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo</a>, as part of the 1709–10 "Carnevale" season.

Grimani's libretto is based on much the same story used as the subject of <a href="Claudio%20Monteverdi">Monteverdi</a>'s 1642 opera "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>". Grimani's libretto centres on Agrippina, a character who does not appear in Monteverdi's darker version. Grimani avoids the "moralizing" tone of the later "opera seria" libretti written by such acknowledged masters as <a href="Metastasio">Metastasio</a> and <a href="Apostolo%20Zeno">Zeno</a>. According to the critic Donald Jay Grout, "irony, deception and intrigue pervade the humorous escapades of its well-defined characters." All the main characters, with the sole exception of Claudius's servant Lesbus, are historical, and the broad outline of the libretto draws heavily upon <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>'s "<a href="Annals%20%28Tacitus%29">Annals</a>" and <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a>' "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Caesars%23Life%20of%20Claudius">Life of Claudius</a>." It has been suggested that the comical, amatory character of the Emperor Claudius is a caricature of <a href="Pope%20Clement%20XI">Pope Clement XI</a>, to whom Grimani was politically opposed. Certain aspects of this conflict are also reflected in the plot: the rivalry between Nero and Otho mirror aspects of the debate over the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, in which Grimani supported the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburgs</a> and Pope Clement XI France and Spain.

According to <a href="John%20Mainwaring">John Mainwaring</a>, Handel's first biographer, "Agrippina" was composed in the three weeks following Handel's arrival in Venice in November 1709, a theory supported by the autograph manuscript's Venetian paper.
In composing the opera Handel borrowed extensively from his earlier oratorios and cantatas, and from other composers including <a href="Reinhard%20Keiser">Reinhard Keiser</a>, <a href="Arcangelo%20Corelli">Arcangelo Corelli</a> and <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Jean-Baptiste Lully</a>. This practice of adapting and borrowing was common at the time but is carried to greater lengths in "Agrippina" than in almost all of Handel's other major dramatic works. The <a href="overture">overture</a>, which is a French-style two-part work with a "thrilling" allegro, and all but five of the vocal numbers, are based on earlier works, though subject in many cases to significant adaptation and reworking.
Examples of recycled material include Pallas's "Col raggio placido", which is based on Lucifer's aria from "<a href="La%20resurrezione">La resurrezione</a>" (1708), "O voi dell'Erebo", which was itself adapted from Reinhard Keiser's 1705 opera "Octavia". Agrippina's aria "Non ho cor che per amarti" was taken, almost entirely unchanged, from "Se la morte non vorrà" in Handel's earlier dramatic cantata "<a href="Ero%20e%20Leandro">Qual ti reveggio, oh Dio</a>" (1707); Narcissus's "Spererò" is an adaptation of "Sai perchè" from another 1707 cantata, "<a href="Clori%2C%20Tirsi%20e%20Fileno">Clori, Tirsi e Fileno</a>"; and parts of Nero's aria in act 3, "Come nube che fugge dal vento", are borrowed Handel's oratorio "<a href="The%20Triumph%20of%20Time%20and%20Truth">Il trionfo del tempo</a>" (all from 1707). Later, some of "Agrippina's" music was used by Handel in his London operas "<a href="Rinaldo%20%28opera%29">Rinaldo</a>" (1711) and the 1732 version of "<a href="Acis%20and%20Galatea%20%28Handel%29">Acis and Galatea</a>", in each case with little or no change. The first music by Handel presented in London may have been Agrippina's "Non ho cor che", transposed into Alessandro Scarlatti's opera "Pirro è Dimitrio" which was performed in London on 6 December 1710. The "Agrippina" overture and other arias from the opera appeared in <a href="pasticcio">pasticcio</a>s performed in London between 1710 and 1714, with additional music provided by other composers. Echoes of "Ti vo' giusta" (one of the few arias composed specifically for "Agrippina") can be found in the air "He was despised", from Handel's "<a href="Messiah%20%28Handel%29">Messiah</a>" (1742).

Two of the main male roles, Nero and Narcissus, were written for <a href="Castrato">castrati</a>, the "superstars of their day" in Italian opera. The opera was revised significantly before and possibly during its run. One example is the duet for Otho and Poppaea in act 3, "No, no, ch'io non apprezzo", replaced with two solo arias before the first performance. Another is Poppaea's aria "Ingannata", replaced during the run with another of extreme <a href="virtuoso">virtuosity</a>, "Pur punir chi m'ha ingannata", either to emphasise Poppaea's new-found resolution at this juncture of the opera or, as is thought more likely, to flatter Scarabelli by giving her an additional opportunity to show off her vocal abilities.

The instrumentation for Handel's score follows closely that of all his early operas: two recorders, two oboes, two trumpets, three violins, two cellos, viola, timpani, contrabassoon and harpsichord. By the standards of Handel's later London operas this scoring is light, but there are nevertheless what Dean and Knapp describe as "moments of splendour when Handel applies the full "concerto grosso" treatment." "Agrippina", Handel's second Italian opera, was probably his last composition in Italy.

On hearing that her husband, the Emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a>, has died in a storm at sea, Agrippina plots to secure the throne for <a href="Nero">Nero</a>, her son by a previous marriage. Nero is unenthusiastic about this project, but consents to his mother's wishes ("Con saggio tuo consiglio"). Agrippina obtains the support of her two freedmen, <a href="Pallas%20%28freedman%29">Pallas</a> and <a href="Tiberius%20Claudius%20Narcissus">Narcissus</a>, who hail Nero as the new Emperor before the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Senate</a>.
With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero begin to ascend the throne, but the ceremony is interrupted by the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive ("Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!"), saved from death by <a href="Otho">Otho</a>, the commander of the army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful <a href="Poppaea%20Sabina">Poppaea</a> more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne.

Poppaea believes Agrippina. When Claudius arrives at Poppaea's house she denounces what she believes is Otho's treachery. Claudius departs in fury, while Agrippina cynically consoles Poppaea by declaring that their friendship will never be broken by deceit ("Non ho cor che per amarti").

Pallas and Narcissus realize that Agrippina has tricked them into supporting Nero and decide to have no more to do with her. Otho arrives, nervous about his forthcoming coronation ("Coronato il crin d'alloro"), followed by Agrippina, Nero and Poppaea, who have come to greet Claudius. All combine in a triumphal chorus ("Di timpani e trombe") as Claudius enters. Each in turns pays tribute to the Emperor, but Otho is coldly rebuffed as Claudius denounces him as a traitor. Otho is devastated and appeals to Agrippina, Poppaea, and Nero for support, but they all reject him, leaving him in bewilderment and despair ("Otton, qual portentoso fulmine" followed by "Voi che udite il mio lamento").

However, Poppaea is touched by her former beloved's grief, and wonders if he might not be innocent ("Bella pur nel mio diletto"). She devises a plan and when Otho approaches her, she pretends to talk in her sleep recounting what Agrippina has told her earlier. Otho, as she intended, overhears her and fiercely protests his innocence. He convinces Poppaea that Agrippina has deceived her. Poppaea swears revenge ("Ingannata una sol volta", alternate aria "Pur punir chi m'ha ingannata") but is distracted when Nero comes forward and declares his love for her. Meanwhile, Agrippina, having lost the support of Pallas and Narcissus, manages to convince Claudius that Otho is still plotting to take the throne. She advises Claudius that he should end Otho's ambitions once and for all by abdicating in favour of Nero. Claudius agrees, believing that this will enable him to win Poppaea.

Poppaea now plans some deceit of her own, in an effort to divert Claudius's wrath from Otho with whom she has now reconciled. She hides Otho in her bedroom with instructions to listen carefully. Soon Nero arrives to press his love on her ("Coll'ardor del tuo bel core"), but she tricks him into hiding as well. Then Claudius enters; Poppaea tells him that he had earlier misunderstood her: it was not Otho but Nero who had ordered her to reject Claudius. To prove her point she asks Claudius to pretend to leave, then she summons Nero who, thinking Claudius has gone, resumes his passionate wooing of Poppaea. Claudius suddenly reappears and angrily dismisses the crestfallen Nero. After Claudius departs, Poppaea brings Otho out of hiding and the two express their everlasting love in separate arias.

At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his troubles and decides to renounce love for political ambition ("Come nube che fugge dal vento"). But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina's original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that her efforts to secure the throne for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard the throne for Claudius ("Se vuoi pace"). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have the throne. No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all changed, so Claudius in a spirit of reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero. He then summons the goddess <a href="Juno%20%28mythology%29">Juno</a>, who descends to pronounce a general blessing ("V'accendano le tede i raggi delle stelle").

The date of "Agrippina"s first performance, about which there was at one time some uncertainty, has been confirmed by a manuscript newsletter as 26 December 1709. The cast consisted of some of Northern Italy's leading singers of the day, including <a href="Antonio%20Francesco%20Carli">Antonio Carli</a> in the lead bass role; <a href="Margherita%20Durastanti">Margherita Durastanti</a>, who had recently sung the role of Mary Magdalene in Handel's "<a href="La%20resurrezione">La resurrezione</a>"; and <a href="Diamante%20Maria%20Scarabelli">Diamante Scarabelli</a>, whose great success at <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> in the 1697 <a href="pasticcio">pasticcio</a> "Perseo" inspired the publication of a volume of eulogistic verse entitled "La miniera del Diamante".

"Agrippina" proved extremely popular and established Handel's international reputation. Its original run of 27 performances was extraordinary for that time. Handel's biographer John Mainwaring wrote of the first performance: "The theatre at almost every pause resounded with shouts of "Viva il caro Sassone!" ('Long live the beloved Saxon!') They were thunderstruck with the grandeur and sublimity of his style, for they had never known till then all the powers of harmony and modulation so closely arranged and forcibly combined." Many others recorded overwhelmingly positive responses to the work.

Between 1713 and 1724 there were productions of "Agrippina" in Naples, Hamburg, and Vienna, although Handel himself never revived the opera after its initial run. The Naples production included additional music by <a href="Francesco%20Mancini%20%28composer%29">Francesco Mancini</a>. In the later 18th, and throughout the 19th centuries, Handel's operas fell into obscurity, and none were staged between 1754 and 1920. However, when interest in Handel's operas awakened in the 20th century, "Agrippina" received several revivals, beginning with a 1943 production at Handel's birthplace, <a href="Halle%2C%20Saxony-Anhalt">Halle</a>, under conductor Richard Kraus at the <a href="Halle%20Opera%20House">Halle Opera House</a>. In this performance the alto role of Otho, composed for a woman, was changed into a bass accompanied by <a href="English%20horn">English horn</a>s, "with calamitous effects on the delicate balance and texture of the score", according to <a href="Winton%20Dean">Winton Dean</a>. The <a href="RAI">Radio Audizioni Italiane</a> produced a live radio broadcast of the opera on 25 October 1953, the opera's first presentation other than on stage. The cast included <a href="Magda%20L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3">Magda László</a> in the title role and <a href="Mario%20Petri">Mario Petri</a> as Claudius, and the performance was conducted by <a href="Antonio%20Pedrotti">Antonio Pedrotti</a>.

A 1958 performance in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, and several more stagings in Germany, preceded the British première of the opera at <a href="Abingdon%2C%20Oxfordshire">Abingdon, Oxfordshire</a>, in 1963. This was followed in 1982 by the first fully professional production in England. It was performed by Kent Opera with the conductor, Ivan Fischer, making his debut with the company and the orchestra playing on baroque instruments. Felicity Palmer took the title role. In 1983 the opera returned to Venice, for a performance under <a href="Christopher%20Hogwood">Christopher Hogwood</a> at the <a href="Teatro%20Malibran">Teatro Malibran</a>. In the United States a concert performance had been given on 16 February 1972 at the <a href="Academy%20of%20Music%20%28Philadelphia%29">Academy of Music</a> in Philadelphia, but the opera's first fully staged American performance was in <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a>, in 1985. That same year it reached New York, with a concert performance at <a href="Alice%20Tully%20Hall">Alice Tully Hall</a>, where the opera was described as a "genuine rarity". The Fort Worth performance was quickly followed by further American stagings in <a href="Iowa%20City%2C%20Iowa">Iowa City</a> and <a href="Boston">Boston</a>. The <a href="historically%20informed%20performance">historically informed performance</a> movement inspired two period instrument productions of "Agrippina" in 1985 and 1991 respectively. Both were in Germany, the first was in the <a href="Schlosstheater%20Schwetzingen">Schlosstheater Schwetzingen</a>, the other at the <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen%20International%20Handel%20Festival">Göttingen International Handel Festival</a>.

There have been numerous productions in the 21st century, including a 2002 ultramodern staging by director <a href="Lillian%20Groag">Lillian Groag</a> at the New York City Opera. This production, revived in 2007, was described by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" critic as "odd ... presented as broad satire, a "<a href="Springtime%20for%20Hitler">Springtime for Hitler</a>" version of "I, Claudius"", although the musical performances were generally praised. In Britain, the <a href="English%20National%20Opera">English National Opera</a> (ENO) staged an English-language version in February 2007, directed by <a href="David%20McVicar">David McVicar</a>, which received a broadly favourable critical response, although critic Fiona Maddocks identified features of the production that diminished the work: "Music so witty, inventive and humane requires no extra gilding". Some of the later revivals used <a href="countertenor">countertenor</a>s in the roles written for castrati.

"Agrippina" is considered Handel's first operatic masterpiece; according to Winton Dean it has few rivals for its "sheer freshness of musical invention". Grimani's libretto has also been praised: "The New Penguin Opera Guide" describes it as one of the best Handel ever set, and praises the "light touch" with which the characters are vividly portrayed. "Agrippina" as a whole is, in the view of the scholar John E. Sawyer, "among the most convincing of all the composer's dramatic works".

Stylistically, "Agrippina" follows the standard pattern of the era by alternating <a href="recitative">recitative</a> and "da capo" arias. In accordance with 18th-century opera convention the plot is mainly carried forward in the recitatives, while the musical interest and exploration of character takes place in the arias—although on occasion Handel breaks this mould by using arias to advance the action. With one exception the recitative sections are "secco" ("dry"), where a simple vocal line is accompanied by continuo only. The anomaly is Otho's "Otton, qual portentoso fulmine", where he finds himself robbed of the throne and deserted by his beloved Poppaea; here the recitative is accompanied by the orchestra, as a means of highlighting the drama. Dean and Knapp describe this, and Otho's aria which follows, as "the peak of the opera". The 19th-century musical theorist <a href="Ebenezer%20Prout">Ebenezer Prout</a> singles out Agrippina's "Non ho cor che per amarti" for special praise. He points out the range of instruments used for special effects, and writes that "an examination of the score of this air would probably astonish some who think Handel's orchestration is wanting in variety."

Handel made more use than was then usual of orchestral accompaniment in arias, but in other respects "Agrippina" is broadly typical of an older operatic tradition. For the most part the arias are brief, there are only two short ensembles, and in the <a href="quartet">quartet</a> and the <a href="trio%20%28music%29">trio</a> the voices are not heard together. However, Handel's style would change very little in the next 30 years, a point reflected in the reviews of the Tully Hall performance of "Agrippina" in 1985, which refer to a "string of melodious aria and ensembles, any of which could be mistaken for the work of his mature London years".
Of the main characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and something of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a liar and a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> in the <a href="Lorenzo%20Da%20Ponte">Da Ponte</a> operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.

In "Agrippina" the "da capo" aria is the musical form used to illustrate character in the context of the opera. The first four arias of the work exemplify this: Nero's "Con raggio", in a minor key and with a descending figure on the key phrase "il trono ascenderò" ("I will ascend the throne") characterises him as weak and irresolute. Pallas's first aria "La mia sorte fortunata", with its "wide-leaping melodic phrasing" introduces him as a bold, heroic figure, contrasting with his rival Narcissus whose introspective nature is displayed in his delicate aria "Volo pronto" which immediately follows. Agrippina's introductory aria "L'alma mia" has a mock-military form which reflects her outward power, while subtle <a href="musical%20phrasing">musical phrasing</a> establishes her real emotional state. Poppaea's arias are uniformly light and rhythmic, while Claudius's short love song "Vieni O cara" gives a glimpse of his inner feelings, and is considered one of the gems of the score.

Grimani's libretto is full of <a href="irony">irony</a>, which Handel reflects in the music. His settings sometimes illustrate both the surface meaning, as characters attempt to deceive each other, and the hidden truth. For instance, in her aria in act 1, "Non ho cor che per amarti", Agrippina promises Poppaea that deceit will never mar their new friendship, while tricking her into ruining Otho's chances for the throne. Handel's music illuminates her deceit in the melody and <a href="musical%20mode">minor modal key</a>, while a simple, emphasised rhythmic accompaniment hints at clarity and openness. In act 3, Nero's announcement that his passion is ended and that he will no longer bound by it (in "Come nube che fugge dal vento") is set to bitter-sweet music which suggests that he is deceiving himself. In Otho's "Coronato il crin" the agitated nature of the music is the opposite of what the "euphoric" tone of the libretto suggests. Contrasts between the force of the libretto and the emotional colour of the actual music would develop into a constant feature of Handel's later London operas.

The index of Chrysander's edition (see <a href="%23External%20links">below</a>) lists the following numbers, excluding the <a href="Recitative%23Secco">"secco" recitatives</a>. Variants from the libretto are also noted.
Act 1

Act 2

Act 3

Handel's autograph score survives, with the Sinfonia and first recitatives missing, but is shows significant differences from the libretto, due to changes made for the first performances. Handel's performing score is lost. Three early manuscript copies, probably dating from 1710, are held in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>; one of these may have been a gift from Grimani to the future <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Charles VI</a>. These copies, presumably based on the lost performing score, show further changes from the autograph. A manuscript from the 1740s known as the "Flower score" is described by Dean as "a miscellany in haphazard order".

In about 1795 the British composer <a href="Samuel%20Arnold%20%28composer%29">Samuel Arnold</a> produced an edition based on early copies; this edition, while it contains errors and inaccuracies, has been called "probably a reasonable reflection of early performances". The <a href="Friedrich%20Chrysander">Chrysander</a> edition of 1874 has a tendency to "sweep Arnold aside when he is right and follow him when he is wrong." Musicologist <a href="Anthony%20Hicks">Anthony Hicks</a> calls it "an unfortunate attempt to reconcile the autograph text with Arnold and the wordbook, the result being a composite version of no authority."

In 1950 Barenreiter published <a href="Hellmuth%20Christian%20Wolff">Hellmuth Christian Wolff</a>'s edition, prepared for the 1943 Halle revival and reflecting the casting of basses for Otto and Narcissus, even when they sing what would otherwise be the alto part in the last chorus. It presents a German adaptation of the recitatives and written out embellishments for the <a href="da%20capo%20aria">da capo aria</a>s as well as numerous cuts. The B flat fugue G 37 appears as an act II <a href="overture">overture</a> along with other instrumental music.

An edition by John E Sawyer appeared in 2013 as series II vol. 3 of the "Hallische Händelausgabe". It is based on the 1709 version, with ballet music borrowed from Rodrigo, and contains two appendices with added and reconstructed music as well as deleted versions from the autograph.

Ontario Highway 416

King's Highway 416, commonly referred to as Highway 416 and as the Veterans Memorial Highway, is a <a href="400-series%20highway">400-series highway</a> in the Canadian province of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> that connects the <a href="Trans-Canada%20Highway">Trans-Canada Highway</a> (<a href="Ontario%20Highway%20417">Highway 417</a>) in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> with <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20401">Highway 401</a> between <a href="Brockville">Brockville</a> and <a href="Cornwall%2C%20Ontario">Cornwall</a>. The <a href="freeway">freeway</a> acts as an important trade corridor from <a href="Interstate%2081">Interstate 81</a> between <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Ontario">Eastern Ontario</a> via Highway 401, as well as the fastest link between Ottawa and <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. Highway 416 passes through a largely rural area, except near its northern terminus where it enters the suburbs of Ottawa. The freeway also serves several communities along its length, notably <a href="Spencerville%2C%20Ontario">Spencerville</a> and <a href="Kemptville">Kemptville</a>.

Highway 416 had two distinct construction phases. Highway 416 "North" was the segment starting from an interchange at Highway 417 and bypassing the original route of <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2016">Highway 16</a> into Ottawa (now <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Drive">Prince of Wales Drive</a>) along a new <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a>. Highway 416 "South" was the <a href="twinning%20%28roads%29">twinning</a> of of Highway 16 New—a two-lane expressway constructed throughout the 1970s and finished in 1983 that <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypassed</a> the original highway—and the construction of a new interchange with Highway 401. Sections of both opened throughout the late 1990s. Highway 416 was commemorated as the Veterans Memorial Highway on the 54th anniversary of <a href="D-Day">D-Day</a> in 1998. The final link was officially opened by a World War I veteran and local officials on September 23, 1999.

Highway 416 begins at an interchange with Highway 401, branching to the north near the community of <a href="Johnstown%2C%20Ontario">Johnstown</a> in the <a href="United%20Counties%20of%20Leeds%20and%20Grenville">United Counties of Leeds and Grenville</a>. This <a href="Interchange%20%28road%29%23Two-way%20interchanges">interchange</a> only provides access to and from the west of Highway 401, but immediately north of it, a second interchange with the remaining section of Highway 16 provides access from Johnstown and to a <a href="parclo%20interchange">parclo interchange</a> with both directions of Highway 401, as well as to the <a href="Ogdensburg-Prescott%20International%20Bridge">Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge</a> crossing to <a href="Ogdensburg%2C%20New%20York">Ogdensburg, New York</a>.
Proceeding north, the two <a href="carriageways">carriageways</a> of the freeway are separated by a forested median.
The route is surrounded by thick forests for the next . As it passes beneath Leeds and Grenville County Road 44, the original routing of Highway 16 (the Prescott Highway) south of Spencerville, it exits the forest and enters farm fields. The route travels to the east of the community, access to which is provided by an interchange at County Road 21, and crosses a swamp and the <a href="South%20Nation%20River">South Nation River</a>.

Highway 416 crosses under the Prescott Highway a second time; to the north, the two remain roughly parallel but separated as they pass through a mix of farmland and forest. South of the community of <a href="Kemptville">Kemptville</a>, the Prescott Highway crosses the route a third time, with an interchange connecting the two highways.
The freeway curves to the northeast, bypassing Kemptville and featuring an interchange with County Road 43 (formerly <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2043">Highway 43</a>).
It crosses the line of the old <a href="Bytown%20and%20Prescott%20Railway">Bytown and Prescott Railway</a>,
then curves to the northwest, providing an interchange with River Road. At the southeast corner of the River Road interchange is the Veterans Commemorative Park, dedicated in 2000 by the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Legion">Royal Canadian Legion</a>.

It crosses the <a href="Rideau%20River">Rideau River</a> and enters the City of Ottawa. Aside from the first couple of kilometres north of the Rideau River, the majority of the freeway cuts through swaths of farmland which fill the <a href="Ottawa%20Valley">Ottawa Valley</a>. The median also becomes narrower. The freeway encounters an interchange with Dilworth Road and thereafter with <a href="Roger%20Stevens%20Drive">Roger Stevens Drive</a>, the latter providing access to <a href="North%20Gower">North Gower</a>.

Continuing north of <a href="Manotick">Manotick</a> through fields, Highway 416 is crossed by the Prescott Highway for the fourth and final time as that road turns northeast and travels into downtown Ottawa as Prince of Wales Drive. Shortly thereafter is an interchange with Brophy Drive / <a href="Bankfield%20Road">Bankfield Road</a>; the latter provides access to the Prescott Highway / Prince of Wales Drive. Approaching urban Ottawa, the route passes alongside a large <a href="quarry">quarry</a>, then jogs to the west along an S-curve, crossing the <a href="Jock%20River">Jock River</a> in the process. After this, an interchange with <a href="Fallowfield%20Road">Fallowfield Road</a> provides access to the suburb of <a href="Barrhaven%2C%20Ontario">Barrhaven</a> which occupies portions of the land immediately east of the freeway. The route jogs back to the east along a second S-curve and passes through an aesthetically designed bridge while traveling alongside the <a href="Stony%20Swamp">Stony Swamp</a>.

The final section of Highway 416 travels parallel to <a href="Cedarview%20Road">Cedarview Road</a>, which was relocated for the freeway. The Stony Swamp lies west of the route while farmland lies to the east. At the northern end of the swamp is an interchange with <a href="Hunt%20Club%20Road">West Hunt Club Road</a>. The freeway continues through a section of greenspace before descending gently into a trench. It passes beneath Bruin Road and the <a href="Ottawa%20Central%20Railway">Ottawa Central Railway</a> while traveling alongside Lynwood Village in <a href="Bells%20Corners">Bells Corners</a>. The highway is crossed by <a href="Baseline%20Road%20%28Ottawa%29">Baseline Road</a> and <a href="Richmond%20Road%20%28Ottawa%29">Richmond Road</a>; the former provides an onramp to southbound Highway 416. The freeway ends at a large interchange with the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway 417 (<a href="Exit%20number">Exit</a> 131), just south of the <a href="Lakeview%20%28Ottawa%29">Lakeview</a> and <a href="Bayshore%2C%20Ottawa">Bayshore</a> communities on the <a href="Ottawa%20River">Ottawa River</a>; downtown Ottawa is to the east and <a href="Kanata%2C%20Ontario">Kanata</a> is to the west.

The Stony Swamp overpass at the southern entrance to Ottawa is a <a href="Prestressed%20concrete">pre-tensioned concrete</a> arch; the design, which allows the structure to cross the entire right of way with a single span, won the 1996 Award of Excellence from the <a href="Portland%20Cement%20Association">Portland Cement Association</a>. The bridge acts as a gateway to the <a href="National%20Capital%20Region">National Capital Region</a> and is the longest rigid frame bridge in Ontario with a span.
In the same vicinity, the freeway sinks below ground level in a trench; groundwater-retaining walls were installed to prevent the lowering of the water table in adjacent wetlands, therefore mitigating damage to them.

At the Jock River, southwest of Barrhaven, deposits of sensitive <a href="leda%20clay">leda clay</a> presented a challenge in designing the crossing for the freeway as well as the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> overpass to the north. It was feared that the weight of these structures could destabilize the clay deposits beneath and lead to landslides. In place of the standard heavier <a href="Construction%20aggregate">aggregate</a>, lighter <a href="blast%20furnace">blast furnace</a> <a href="slag">slag</a>, at half the weight, was substituted.

Sloped rock cuts line the side of the freeway in numerous locations. With the intent of reducing the severity of collisions against those cuts, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Transportation%20of%20Ontario">Ministry of Transportation of Ontario</a> (MTO) tested out numerous alternatives to strike a <a href="cost%E2%80%93benefit%20analysis">cost-to-benefit</a> balance. The standard slope used by the MTO is vertical, offset from the edge of the pavement by . The study concluded that although an initially higher investment would be required, the <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">2:1 sloped</a> cut with grass overlaid produced the best results.

In 1966, the Department of Highways (DHO), predecessor to today's MTO, published the Eastern Ontario Highway Planning Study, identifying the need for a <a href="controlled-access%20highway">controlled-access highway</a> between Ottawa and Highway 401.
Highway 16, which passes over the geologically subdued St. Lawrence Lowlands, was selected over Highway 15, which crosses the undulating <a href="Canadian%20Shield">Canadian Shield</a> to the west, as the ideal route for the new link.
Highway 16 was one of the first roads taken over by the expanding Department of Public Highways in 1918. The important corridor between the Trans-provincial Highway (Highway 2) and Ottawa was known as the Prescott Highway. In 1925, the road was given a numerical designation to supplement the name.
This highway served the low traffic volumes of the day, but as the number of vehicles increased over the first half of the 20th century, issues arose with the numerous private driveways along the route. To overcome this issue of abutting properties long-established on the old Highway 16 corridor, the DHO began purchasing a new right-of-way between Highway 401 and Century Road by late 1967 for a two-lane bypass of the original alignment, avoiding all the built-up areas that the original Highway 16 encountered. This route was designed to easily accommodate the eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated.

Construction of the <a href="super%20two">super two</a>, dubbed "Highway 16 New", took place between 1969 and 1983. The Spencerville Bypass opened by 1971, connecting with the old highway in the south near Crowder Road and in the north near Ventnor Road.
By the end of 1973, the new highway was completed from immediately north of Highway 401 through Leeds and Grenville United Counties and into <a href="Regional%20Municipality%20of%20Ottawa%E2%80%93Carleton">Ottawa–Carleton</a>. This included a bypass around Kemptville and a new structure over the Rideau River. The new highway ended at Dilworth Road (Regional Road 13).

For nearly a decade, no new construction took place. Then, during the summer of 1982, the MTO awarded a contract to construct the route north from Dilworth Road towards Manotick, bypassing North Gower and extending the route as far north as Roger Stevens Drive (Regional Road 6), including a structure over Stevens Creek. Following completion of this first contract, a second contract was awarded for the remaining distance north to Century Road (Regional Road 8).
The project was completed in 1983, merging into the original route of Highway 16 northeast of the present Prince of Wales Drive overpass.
With the completion of Highway 16 New, the MTO needed only to construct interchanges and the southbound lanes in order to create a full freeway corridor. The upgrade to Highway 416 took place between 1989 and 1999 and was carried out through two separate projects: Highway 416 North was a freeway on a new alignment through Ottawa and an interchange at Highway 417, and Highway 416 South was the twinning of of Highway 16 New and an interchange at Highway 401.

The original plans for Highway 416, conceived during the late 1960s, had it enter Ottawa along the "Merivale Corridor" to merge with the Queensway approximately east of the present interchange. However, when it came time to construct this section, public attitudes had shifted and environmental concerns had come to the forefront of everyday life; new roads were now subject to intense public scrutiny. Suburbs grew along Merivale Road, prompting the Region of Ottawa–Carleton to request the MTO decommission the right-of-way along the road in 1977, which it did. The passing of the Environmental Assessment Act in 1975, however, meant that new projects were subject to a lengthy investigation of social and environmental concerns.

In 1981, the MTO began an environmental assessment into a new alignment for the northern connection with the Queensway. It was approved in mid-1987, with Cedarview Drive chosen as the ideal alignment for the new freeway. The MTO set out to design a four-lane route to connect the Queensway with Highway 16 New, including a three-level free-flow interchange. A contract for construction of this interchange was awarded in late 1989 and construction began in 1990. During the 1991 construction season, contracts were awarded to construct several overpasses along the new route.
This contract was completed in 1993, after which budgetary restraints prevented the awarding of further contracts. As a result, aside from the interchange at Highway 417 and some overpasses, construction activity on Highway 416 came to a standstill for two years.

It was during this period that the MTO undertook an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a <a href="recession">recession</a> in the mid-1990s. <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20407">Highway 407</a> became a tolled highway and for a time it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway 416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over <a href="C%24">C$</a>7 million and several of the unique design features located along the length of the freeway.

Work resumed on Highway 416 North following the review. It was opened from Century Road to Hunt Club Road on July 16, 1996, and completed on July 31, 1997, with the opening of the interchange with Highway 417. The cost of this section was C$196 million. On December 8, 1995, in North Gower, the provincial and federal governments announced a financing deal to ensure Highway 416 South was completed by 2000.
This section of the route was constructed through a process known as twinning in which a second <a href="dual%20carriageway">carriageway</a> is built parallel to an existing road. In addition, existing intersections were rebuilt as <a href="grade%20separation">grade-separated</a> interchanges.
With the right-of-way along Highway 16 New already purchased, construction was able to proceed without disruption to local properties or traffic.

The project was constructed through five contracts. The first was awarded to Tarmac Canada on June 10, 1996, calling for twinning of from Century Road south to Roger Stevens Drive. Another contract was awarded one month later to Bot Construction, on August 19. This contract involved the section from Roger Stevens Drive south to what was then Highway 43, a distance of . On June 12, 1997, the first section opened, connecting with the Ottawa Bypass at Century Road.
On July 10, the third contract was awarded to Armbro Construction to construct the section from Highway 43 south to Grenville County Road 20 (Oxford Station Road). Another contract followed on October 21 for the south to Grenville County Road 20 (Shanly Road) which was awarded to Bot Construction. The fifth and final contract was awarded to Armbro Construction on April 8, 1998, calling for the construction of the southern and the two flyover ramps at Highway 401. The section between Roger Stevens Drive and what had now become Leeds and Grenville County Road 43, including a second crossing of the Rideau River, opened to traffic on June 26, 1998.
This was followed two months later by the section between Highway 43 and Oxford Station Road, which opened on August 24.

On the fifty-fourth anniversary of D-Day, June 6, 1998, then Transportation Minister <a href="Tony%20Clement">Tony Clement</a> unveiled two signs in Ottawa and formally declared the entire length of Highway 416 as the Veterans Memorial Highway, despite earlier reluctance from previous minister <a href="Al%20Palladini">Al Palladini</a>.
Six additional signs were also installed along the length of the route.
At the time, the <a href="Veterans%20Memorial%20Parkway">Veterans Memorial Parkway</a> in <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London</a> already existed. Since then, two additional veterans highways have been named: on October 20, 2002, the Veterans Highway was designated in <a href="Halton%20Region">Halton Region</a> along Regional Road 25;
on September 23, 2010, the Niagara Veterans Memorial Highway was designated in <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Niagara Falls</a> along Regional Road 420.
A ceremony was held in Johnstown on September 23, 1999 to open the final section of Highway 416 that would complete the link from Highway 401 to Highway 417. Premier <a href="Mike%20Harris">Mike Harris</a>, Transportation Minister <a href="David%20Turnbull%20%28politician%29">David Turnbull</a> and World War I Veteran James W. Fraser officially opened the highway.

On December 14, 2009, there was a 60–70 vehicle <a href="Multiple-vehicle%20collision">pileup</a> due to fog and icy conditions, forcing the closure of the highway in both directions.

Cutthroat trout

The cutthroat trout is a fish species of the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Salmonidae">Salmonidae</a> native to cold-water <a href="tributary">tributaries</a> of the Pacific Ocean, <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, and <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a> in North America. As a member of the genus "<a href="Oncorhynchus">Oncorhynchus</a>", it is one of the Pacific <a href="trout">trout</a>, a group that includes the widely distributed <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a>. Cutthroat trout are popular <a href="gamefish">gamefish</a>, especially among <a href="Angling">angler</a>s who enjoy <a href="fly%20fishing">fly fishing</a>. The common name "cutthroat" refers to the distinctive red coloration on the underside of the <a href="Mandible">lower jaw</a>. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "clarkii" was given to honor explorer <a href="William%20Clark%20%28explorer%29">William Clark</a>, coleader of the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>.

Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawn</a> in small to moderately large, clear, well-<a href="Oxygenation%20%28environmental%29">oxygenated</a>, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They also reproduce in clear, cold, moderately deep lakes. They are native to the <a href="Alluvium">alluvial</a> or <a href="freestone%20stream">freestone stream</a>s that are typical tributaries of the rivers of the Pacific basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. Cutthroat trout spawn in the spring and may inadvertently but naturally <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridize</a> with rainbow trout, producing fertile <a href="cutbow">cutbow</a>s. Some <a href="population">population</a>s of the coastal cutthroat trout are <a href="anadromous">semi-anadromous</a>.

Several <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of cutthroat trout are currently listed as <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> in their native ranges due to <a href="habitat%20loss">habitat loss</a> and the <a href="introduced%20species">introduction</a> of non-native species. Two subspecies, and , are considered <a href="extinct">extinct</a>. Cutthroat trout are raised in <a href="fish%20hatchery">hatcheries</a> to restore populations in their native range, as well as stock non-native lake environments to support angling. The cutthroat trout type species and several subspecies are the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20fish">official state fish</a> of seven western U.S. states.

The scientific name of the cutthroat trout is . Cutthroat trout were the first <a href="New%20World">New World</a> trout encountered by Europeans when in 1541, Spanish explorer <a href="Francisco%20de%20Coronado">Francisco de Coronado</a> recorded seeing trout in the <a href="Pecos%20River">Pecos River</a> near <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>. These were most likely Rio Grande cutthroat trout The species was first described in the journals of explorer William Clark from specimens obtained during the Lewis and Clark Expedition from the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> near <a href="Great%20Falls%2C%20Montana">Great Falls, Montana</a>, and these were most likely the <a href="westslope%20cutthroat%20trout">westslope cutthroat trout</a> . As one of Lewis and Clark's many missions was to describe the flora and fauna encountered during their expedition, cutthroat trout were given the name in honor of William Clark. In 1836, the <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> of was described by naturalist <a href="John%20Richardson%20%28naturalist%29">John Richardson</a> from a tributary of the lower <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, identified as the "Katpootl", which was perhaps the <a href="Lewis%20River%20%28Washington%29">Lewis River</a> as there was a <a href="Multnomah%20%28tribe%29">Multnomah</a> village of similar name at the <a href="confluence">confluence</a>. This type specimen was most likely the coastal cutthroat trout subspecies . Until the 1960s, populations of westslope cutthroat trout and <a href="Yellowstone%20cutthroat%20trout">Yellowstone cutthroat trout</a> were lumped into one subspecies; "Salmo clarkii lewisii". Biologists later split the group into two subspecies, christening the name westslope cutthroat trout with the "lewisii" name which honors explorer <a href="Meriwether%20Lewis">Meriwether Lewis</a> and renaming the Yellowstone cutthroat trout "Salmo bouvierii", the first name given to the Yellowstone cutthroat trout by <a href="David%20Starr%20Jordan">David Starr Jordan</a> in 1883 honoring a U.S. Army Captain Bouvier.

In 1989, <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> and <a href="Genetics">genetic</a> studies indicated trout of the <a href="Pacific%20ocean">Pacific basin</a> were genetically closer to Pacific salmon ("Oncorhynchus" species) than to the "<a href="Salmo">Salmo</a>"s–<a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a> or <a href="Atlantic%20salmon">Atlantic salmon</a> of the <a href="Atlantic%20ocean">Atlantic basin</a>. Thus, in 1989, taxonomic authorities moved the rainbow, cutthroat and other Pacific basin trout into the genus "Oncorhynchus".

<a href="Robert%20J.%20Behnke">Behnke</a> in his salmon and trout handbook of 2002 recognized 14 <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of cutthroat trout that are each native to a separate geographic area. Not all of them were scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It has been suggested that the cutthroat trout evolved from a common "Oncorhynchus" ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and <a href="Snake%20River">Snake</a> river basins 3-5 million years ago, in the late <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> or early <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> epochs. These epochs had repeated <a href="glacial%20period">glacial</a> and <a href="interglacial">interglacial</a> periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, Yellowstone and Lahontan.

Throughout their native and introduced ranges, cutthroat trout vary widely in size, coloration and habitat selection. Their coloration can range from golden to gray to green on the back. Cutthroat trout can generally be distinguished from rainbow trout by the presence of <a href="Branchial%20arch">basibranchial teeth</a> at the base of tongue and a <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>ry that extends beyond the posterior edge of the eye. Depending on subspecies, <a href="Strain%20%28biology%29">strain</a> and habitat, most have distinctive red, pink, or orange linear marks along the underside of their <a href="mandible">mandible</a>s in the lower folds of the <a href="gill">gill</a> plates. These markings are responsible for the common name "cutthroat", first given to the trout by outdoor writer <a href="Charles%20Hallock">Charles Hallock</a> in an 1884 article in "The American Angler". These markings are not unique to the species, some coastal rainbow trout and <a href="Columbia%20River%20redband%20trout">Columbia River redband trout</a> populations also display reddish or pink throat markings.

At maturity, different populations and subspecies of cutthroat trout can range from in length, depending on habitat and food availability. Sea-run forms of coastal cutthroat trout average . The length and weights of mature inland forms vary widely depending on their particular environment and availability of food. Stream-resident fish are much smaller, , while <a href="lake">lacustrine</a> populations have attained weights ranging from in ideal conditions. The largest cutthroat trout subspecies is the Lahontan cutthroat trout . These fish average in small streams and in larger rivers and lakes. In ideal environments, the Lahontan cutthroat trout attains typical weights of . The world record cutthroat trout is a Lahontan at and .

Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with <a href="gravel">gravel</a> bottoms. They are native to the alluvial or <a href="freestone%20stream">freestone stream</a>s typical of tributaries of the Pacific Basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. They spawn in the spring, as early as February in coastal rivers and as late as July in high mountain lakes and streams. Spawning begins when water temperatures reach . Cutthroat trout construct a <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29%23Brood%20hiders">redd</a> in the stream gravel to lay eggs. The female selects the site for and excavates the redd. Females, depending on size, lay between 200 and 4,400 eggs. Eggs are fertilized with milt (sperm) by an attending male. Eggs hatch into <a href="Juvenile%20fish%23Juvenile%20salmon">alevins</a> or sac fry in about a month and spend two weeks in the gravel while they absorb their yolk sack before emerging. After emergence, <a href="Fry%20%28biology%29">fry</a> begin feeding on <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a>. Juvenile cutthroat trout typically mature in three to five years. Lake-resident cutthroat trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation for good food production. Lake populations generally require access to gravel-bottomed streams to be self-sustaining, but occasionally spawn on shallow gravel beds with good water circulation.

Cutthroat trout naturally interbreed with the closely related rainbow trout, producing fertile <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> commonly called "<a href="cutbow">cutbow</a>s". This hybrid generally bears similar coloration and overall appearance to the cutthroat trout, usually retaining the characteristic orange-red slash. Cutbow hybrids often pose a taxonomic difficulty when trying to distinguish any given specimen as a rainbow or cutthroat trout. In addition, cutthroat trout may hybridize with , the <a href="Gila%20trout">Gila trout</a> and , the <a href="Apache%20trout">Apache trout</a> in regions where their ranges overlap.

Cutthroat trout are native to western North America and have evolved through <a href="geographic%20isolation">geographic isolation</a> into 14 subspecies, each native to a different major <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a>. Native cutthroat trout species are found along the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> coast from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> through British Columbia into northern <a href="California">California</a>, in the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>, the <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a> and throughout the Rocky Mountains including southern <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>. Some coastal populations of the coastal cutthroat trout are semianadromous, spending a few months in marine environments to feed as adults and returning to fresh water from fall through early spring to feed on insects and spawn. Cutthroat trout have the second-largest historic native range of North American trout; the <a href="lake%20trout">lake trout</a> having the largest. Ranges of some subspecies, particularly the westslope cutthroat trout have been reduced to less than 10 percent of their historic range due to habitat loss and introduction of non-native species.

Although members of "Oncorhynchus", the Pacific trout/salmon species, three subspecies—the westslope , the greenback and Yellowstone cutthroat trout —evolved populations east of the <a href="Continental%20Divide%20of%20the%20Americas">Continental Divide</a> in the upper Missouri River basin, upper <a href="Arkansas%20River">Arkansas</a> and <a href="Platte%20River">Platte River</a> basins and upper Yellowstone River basin, each which drain into the Atlantic basin via the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> (in 2005, researchers published a report stating that a natural distribution of , the Conchos trout, is also located in an Atlantic basin drainage). Scientists believe that the climatic and geologic conditions 3 to 5 million years ago allowed cutthroat trout from the <a href="Snake%20River">Snake River</a> to migrate over the divide into the Yellowstone plateau via <a href="Two%20Ocean%20Pass">Two Ocean Pass</a>. There is also evidence that <a href="Yellowstone%20Lake">Yellowstone Lake</a> once drained south into the Snake River drainage. Evidence suggests that the westslope cutthroat trout was able to establish populations east of the divide via <a href="Summit%20Lake%20%28Montana%29">Summit Lake</a> at <a href="Marias%20Pass">Marias Pass</a> which at one time connected the <a href="Flathead%20River">Flathead River</a> drainage with the upper Missouri River drainage. Scientists speculate that there are several mountain passes associated with the headwaters of the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> drainage and Arkansas/Platte River drainages that would have allowed migration of cutthroat trout east of the divide.

Cutthroat trout have been introduced into non-native waters outside their historic native range, but not to the extent of the rainbow trout . Within the native range of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fisheries Bureau</a> and <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> authorities introduced Yellowstone cutthroat trout into many fishless lakes in <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>. Cutthroat trout were introduced into <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> tributaries in the 1890s and sporadically in the early 20th century, but never established wild populations. A population of Yellowstone cutthroat trout purportedly has been established in <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a>. Although cutthroat trout are not native to <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, they are routinely introduced by the <a href="Arizona%20Game%20and%20Fish%20Department">Arizona Game and Fish Department</a> into high mountain lakes in the <a href="White%20Mountains%20%28Arizona%29">White Mountains</a> in the northeastern region of that state.

Cutthroat trout require cold, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms or cold, moderately deep lakes. Healthy stream-side vegetation that reduces <a href="siltation">siltation</a> is typical of healthy cutthroat trout habitat and <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beaver</a> ponds may provide refuge during periods of drought and over winter. Most populations stay in fresh water throughout their lives and are known as nonmigratory, stream-resident or <a href="riverine">riverine</a> populations. The coastal cutthroat trout is the only cutthroat trout subspecies to <a href="Coevolution">coevolve</a> through its entire range with the coastal rainbow trout ("O. m. irideus"). Portions of the westslope cutthroat trout's range overlap with the Columbia River redband trout , but the majority of its native range is in headwater tributary streams above major waterfalls and other barriers to upstream migration. At least three subspecies are confined to <a href="endorheic%20basin">isolated basin</a>s in the Great Basin and can tolerate <a href="saline%20water">saline</a> or <a href="alkalinity">alkaline</a> water.

Cutthroat trout are <a href="List%20of%20feeding%20behaviours">opportunistic feeders</a>. Stream-resident cutthroat trout primarily feed on <a href="larva">larva</a>l, <a href="pupa">pupa</a>l and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically <a href="Caddisfly">caddisflies</a>, <a href="Plecoptera">stoneflies</a>, <a href="mayflies">mayflies</a> and aquatic <a href="fly">diptera</a>ns), and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically <a href="ant">ant</a>s, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s and <a href="Cricket%20%28insect%29">cricket</a>s) that fall into the water, fish eggs, small fish, along with crayfish, shrimp and other crustaceans. As they grow the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. In saltwater estuaries and along beaches, Coastal cutthroat trout feed on small fish such as <a href="sculpin">sculpin</a>s, <a href="sand%20lance">sand lance</a>, <a href="Salmon">salmon fry</a> and <a href="herring">herring</a>. They also consume <a href="shrimp">shrimp</a>, small <a href="squid">squid</a> and <a href="krill">krill</a>. In fresh water they consume the same diet as stream resident trout—aquatic insects and crustaceans, amphibians, earthworms, small fish and fish eggs. Within the range of the <a href="bull%20trout">bull trout</a> the cutthroat trout is a <a href="forage%20fish">forage fish</a> for the <a href="Piscivore">piscivorous</a> bull trout.

Various subspecies of cutthroat trout are raised in commercial, state and federal <a href="fish%20hatchery">hatcheries</a> for introduction into suitable native and non-native riverine and lacustrine environments. In the early 20th century, several hatcheries were established in Yellowstone National Park by the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Bureau of Fisheries</a>. These hatcheries not only produced stocks of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout for the park, but also took advantage of the great spawning stock of cutthroat trout to supply eggs to hatcheries around the U.S. Between the years 1901 and 1953 a total of 818 million trout eggs were exported from the park to hatcheries throughout the U.S. The Lahontan National Fish Hatchery operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service exists to restore populations of the Lahontan cutthroat trout in <a href="Pyramid%20Lake%20%28Nevada%29">Pyramid</a>, <a href="Walker%20Lake%20%28Nevada%29">Walker</a>, <a href="Fallen%20Leaf%20Lake%20%28California%29">Fallen Leaf</a>, <a href="June%20Lake%20%28California%29">June</a>, Marlette, and Gull Lakes and the <a href="Truckee%20River">Truckee River</a> in California and Nevada. The hatchery produces about 300,000–400,000 Lahontan cutthroat trout fry annually. The <a href="Jackson%20National%20Fish%20Hatchery">Jackson National Fish Hatchery</a> produces around 400,000 Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout annually to support fisheries in Idaho and Wyoming. The <a href="Leadville%20National%20Fish%20Hatchery">Leadville National Fish Hatchery</a> produces 125,000–200,000 Snake River fine-spotted, greenback cutthroat and rainbow trout annually to support fishing in the <a href="Fryingpan%20River">Fryingpan</a> and Arkansas River drainages and other Colorado waters. The <a href="Bozeman%20National%20Fish%20Hatchery">Bozeman Fish Technology Center</a>, formerly a cutthroat trout fish hatchery in <a href="Bozeman%2C%20Montana">Bozeman, Montana</a>, plays a major role in the restoration of the greenback and westslope cutthroat trout subspecies.

The historic native range of cutthroat trout has been reduced by <a href="overfishing">overfishing</a>, urbanization and habitat loss due to mining, livestock grazing and logging. Population densities have been reduced and in some cases populations have disappeared though competition with non-native <a href="brook%20trout">brook</a>, brown, lake and rainbow trout, <a href="kokanee%20salmon">kokanee salmon</a>, <a href="lake%20whitefish">lake whitefish</a> and <a href="Mysida">mysis shrimp</a> which were introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Scientists believe the westslope cutthroat trout will eventually be <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a> from the large lakes in Western Montana due to the <a href="trophic%20cascade">trophic cascade</a>s resulting from lake trout and mysis shrimp introductions. The most serious current threats to several subspecies are <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29%23Interspecific%20hybrids">interspecific breeding</a> with introduced rainbow trout creating hybrid cutbows and intraspecific breeding with other introduced cutthroat trout subspecies. In the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a>, the presence of lake trout in <a href="Yellowstone%20Lake">Yellowstone Lake</a> in Yellowstone National Park has caused a serious decline in . Outbreaks of <a href="Myxobolus%20cerebralis">whirling disease</a> in major spawning tributaries within the native ranges have also caused declines. Most subspecies of cutthroat trout are highly susceptible to whirling disease, although the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout appears to be resistant to the parasite.

The most serious impact on the genetic purity of most cutthroat trout subspecies results from interspecific and intraspecific breeding resulting in hybrids that carry the <a href="gene">gene</a>s of both parents. In inland populations, the introduction of rainbow trout from hatchery stocks have resulted in cutbow hybrids that continue to diminish the genetic purity of many cutthroat trout subspecies. The introduction of hatchery-raised Yellowstone cutthroat trout into native ranges of other cutthroat trout subspecies, particularly the westslope cutthroat trout, has resulted in intraspecific breeding and diminished genetic purity of the westslope subspecies. As such, populations of genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout are very rare and localized in streams above barriers to upstream migrations by introduced species. Fisheries biologist <a href="Robert%20J.%20Behnke">Robert J. Behnke</a> attributes the extinction of the yellowfin cutthroat trout and Alvord cutthroat trout subspecies to the introduction of non-native rainbow trout.

The population at the core of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout's native range, in Yellowstone Lake, declined significantly in the 1960s due to <a href="overexploitation">overharvest</a> of mature cutthroat trout by anglers, as well as overharvesting of eggs by hatcheries in the early 20th century. Managers implemented <a href="catch%20and%20release">catch and release</a>, which required anglers to return their catches to the lake, and they terminated hatchery operations in the park which allowed the cutthroat trout to recover. Then, in 1994, park officials discovered lake trout in Yellowstone Lake. Although lake trout were established in <a href="Shoshone%20Lake">Shoshone</a>, <a href="Lewis%20Lake%20%28Wyoming%29">Lewis</a> and <a href="Heart%20Lake%20%28Wyoming%29">Heart</a> lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. government stocking operations in 1890, they were never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage and their presence there is probably the result of accidental or illegal introductions. By 2000, the cutthroat trout population had declined to less than 10 percent of its early 20th century abundance. However, aggressive lake trout <a href="Culling%23Wildlife">eradication programs</a> have killed over one million lake trout since 1996, and the hope is that this will lead to a restoration of cutthroat numbers. Cutthroat trout co-exist with lake trout in <a href="Heart%20Lake%20%28Wyoming%29">Heart Lake</a>, an isolated back-country lake at the head of the <a href="Heart%20River%20%28Wyoming%29">Heart River</a> that gets little angling pressure.

Cutthroat trout are prized as a gamefish, particularly by fly anglers. They are regulated as a gamefish in every state and province they occur in. From the Yellowstone cutthroat trout fishery in Yellowstone National Park, the unique Lahontan cutthroat trout fishery in Pyramid Lake in Nevada, and the small stream fisheries of the westslope cutthroat trout to saltwater angling for sea-run cutthroat trout on the Pacific coast, cutthroat trout are a popular quarry for trout anglers throughout their ranges. The all-tackle world record is caught in Pyramid Lake in December 1925. Their propensity to feed on aquatic and terrestrial insects make them an ideal quarry for the fly angler.

From Alaska to Northern California, coastal cutthroat trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run cutthroat trout fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in <a href="drift%20boat">drift boat</a>s float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In addition to a cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout <a href="Artisan%20fishing">subsistence</a> fisheries in Southeast Alaska.
<a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> was established in 1872. By the 1890s, the Yellowstone cutthroat trout fishery in the <a href="Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone River</a> and Yellowstone Lake were well known and being promoted in national guidebooks.

In 1902, anticipating the completion of the east entrance road from Cody, Wyoming, Captain <a href="Hiram%20M.%20Chittenden">Hiram M. Chittenden</a> supervised the construction of the first "Fishing Bridge" across the outlet of Yellowstone Lake. Fishing Bridge was rebuilt in 1919, and reconstructed in
1937, primarily to accommodate vehicle traffic. Between 1916 and 1931, a large development of campgrounds, cabins, stores and service facilities were built just east of the bridge to support anglers. This area is now known as the Fishing Bridge Historic District. The 1937 bridge boasted pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway to give more room to anglers. Angling in the river, at Fishing Bridge and in the lake, boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and over harvest caused a significant decline in the fishery. Consequently, in 1973, fishing was no longer permitted from Fishing Bridge.

The Pyramid Lake strain of Lahontan cutthroat trout, source of the world record and native to Pyramid Lake, <a href="Lake%20Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a> and the Truckee River, was brought to near-extinction in the two decades between the 1920s-40s from overharvest, introduced species and loss of spawning habitat. In the 1970s, Pyramid Lake was stocked with Lahontan cutthroat trout strains still surviving in some nearby lakes, but they were not the large Pyramid Lake strain. Although the <a href="Pyramid%20Lake%20Indian%20Reservation">Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe</a> had been successful in reestablishing a cutthroat trout fishery on the reservation in Pyramid Lake, the cutthroat trout were not the large fish of the late 19th and early 20th century. In the late 1970, biologists discovered a surviving population of a pure Pyramid Lake strain in a small headwaters stream on the Nevada-Utah border that had at some point around 1900 been introduced into the stream. In 1995, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began rearing these fish in the Lahontan National Fish Hatcheryin <a href="Gardnerville%2C%20Nevada">Gardnerville, Nevada</a>. In 2006, the Pyramid Lake strain of Lahontan cutthroat trout were reintroduced into the lake. As Pyramid Lake has a very shallow shoreline, anglers use ladders to stand comfortably in of water and cast to trout cruising along shoreline breaks. Considered a "world-class" fishery, anglers routinely catch cutthroat trout exceeding .

The cutthroat trout is the <a href="state%20fish">state fish</a> of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, while particular subspecies of cutthroat are the state fish of Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.

Slow loris

Slow lorises are a group of several <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> <a href="Strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine</a> <a href="primate">primate</a>s that make up the <a href="genus">genus</a> Nycticebus. Found in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast</a> <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and bordering areas, they range from <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="Northeast%20India">Northeast India</a> in the west to the <a href="Sulu%20Archipelago">Sulu Archipelago</a> in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> in the east, and from <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> province in China in the north to the island of <a href="Java">Java</a> in the south. Although many previous classifications recognized as few as a single all-inclusive species, there are now at least eight that are considered valid: the <a href="Sunda%20slow%20loris">Sunda slow loris</a> ("N. coucang"), <a href="Bengal%20slow%20loris">Bengal slow loris</a> ("N. bengalensis"), <a href="pygmy%20slow%20loris">pygmy slow loris</a> ("N. pygmaeus"), <a href="Javan%20slow%20loris">Javan slow loris</a> ("N. javanicus"), <a href="Philippine%20slow%20loris">Philippine slow loris</a> ("N. menagensis"), <a href="Bangka%20slow%20loris">Bangka slow loris</a> ("N. bancanus"), <a href="Bornean%20slow%20loris">Bornean slow loris</a> ("N. borneanus"), and <a href="Kayan%20River%20slow%20loris">Kayan River slow loris</a> ("N. kayan"). The group's closest relatives are the <a href="slender%20loris">slender loris</a>es of southern India and Sri Lanka. Their next closest relatives are the African <a href="Lorisidae">lorisids</a>, the <a href="potto">potto</a>s, <a href="false%20potto">false potto</a>s, and <a href="angwantibo">angwantibo</a>s. They are less closely related to the remaining <a href="Lorisoidea">lorisoids</a> (the various types of <a href="galago">galago</a>), and more distantly to the <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Their evolutionary history is uncertain since their <a href="fossil">fossil</a> record is patchy and <a href="molecular%20clock">molecular clock</a> studies have given inconsistent results.

Slow lorises have a round head, a narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration patterns that are species-dependent. Their arms and legs are nearly equal in length, and their <a href="Trunk%20%28anatomy%29">trunk</a> is long and flexible, allowing them to twist and extend to nearby branches. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several adaptations that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time. Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a trait rare among mammals and unique to lorisid primates. The <a href="toxin">toxin</a> is obtained by licking a <a href="gland">gland</a> on their arm, and the <a href="secretion">secretion</a> is activated by mixing with <a href="saliva">saliva</a>. Their toxic bite is a deterrent to predators, and the toxin is also applied to the fur during grooming as a form of protection for their infants. The secretion from the arm contains a chemical related to <a href="Fel%20d%201">cat allergen</a>, but may be augmented by secondary toxins from the diet in wild individuals. Slow lorises move slowly and deliberately, making little or no noise, and when threatened, they stop moving and remain motionless. Their only documented predators—apart from humans—include snakes, <a href="changeable%20hawk-eagle">changeable hawk-eagle</a>s and <a href="orangutan">orangutan</a>s, although cats, <a href="civet">civet</a>s and <a href="sun%20bear">sun bear</a>s are suspected. Little is known about their social structure, but they are known to communicate by <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29%23Spraying">scent marking</a>. Males are highly territorial. Slow lorises reproduce slowly, and the infants are initially parked on branches or carried by either parent. They are <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>s, eating small animals, fruit, <a href="Gum%20%28botany%29">tree gum</a>, and other vegetation.

Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 is listed as either "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>" or "<a href="Endangered%20species">Endangered</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. The three newest species are yet to be evaluated, but they arise from (and further reduce the ranks of) what was thought to be a single "vulnerable" species. All four of these are expected to be listed with at least the same, if not a higher-risk, conservation status. All slow lorises are threatened by the <a href="wildlife%20trade">wildlife trade</a> and <a href="habitat%20loss">habitat loss</a>. Their habitat is rapidly disappearing and becoming <a href="Habitat%20fragmentation">fragmented</a>, making it nearly impossible for slow lorises to <a href="Biological%20dispersal">disperse</a> between forest fragments; unsustainable demand from the <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a> trade and from <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a> has been the greatest cause for their decline. Deep-rooted beliefs about the supernatural powers of slow lorises, such as their purported abilities to ward off evil spirits or to cure wounds, have popularized their use in traditional medicine. Despite local laws prohibiting trade in slow lorises and slow loris products, as well as protection from international commercial trade under <a href="CITES%20Appendix%20I">Appendix I</a>, slow lorises are openly sold in animal markets in Southeast Asia and smuggled to other countries, such as Japan. Due in part to the large eyes that are an adaptation to their nocturnal lifestyle, they have also been popularized as '<a href="Cuteness%23Juvenile%20traits%20and%20cuteness">cute</a>' pets in <a href="viral%20video">viral video</a>s on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>. Slow lorises have their teeth cut or pulled out for the pet trade. They make poor pets that are difficult to care for, and often die from infection, blood loss, improper caring and handling or inadequate nutrition.

Slow lorises (genus "Nycticebus") are <a href="Strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine</a> <a href="primate">primate</a>s and are related to other living <a href="Lorisoidea">lorisoids</a>, such as <a href="slender%20loris">slender loris</a>es ("Loris"), <a href="potto">potto</a>s ("Perodicticus"), <a href="false%20potto">false potto</a>s ("Pseudopotto"), <a href="angwantibo">angwantibo</a>s ("Arctocebus"), and <a href="galago">galago</a>s (family Galagidae), and to the <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. They are most closely related to the slender lorises of <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>, followed by the angwantibos, pottos and false pottos of <a href="Central%20Africa">Central</a> and <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. Lorisoids are thought to have evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into the slender and slow lorises of today.

Lorises first appear in the Asian fossil record in the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, with records in <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> around 18 million years ago (mya) and in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> 16 mya. The Thai record is based on a single tooth that most closely resembles living slow lorises and that is tentatively classified as a species of "Nycticebus". The species is named <a href="%3F%20Nycticebus%20linglom">? "Nycticebus linglom"</a>, using <a href="open%20nomenclature">open nomenclature</a> (the preceding "?" indicates the tentative nature of the assignment). Several lorises are found in the <a href="Sivalik%20Hills">Siwalik</a> deposits of Pakistan, dating to 16 to 8 mya, including "<a href="Nycticeboides">Nycticeboides</a>" and "<a href="Microloris">Microloris</a>". Most are small, but an unnamed form dating to 15–16 mya is comparable in size to the largest living slow lorises. Molecular clock analysis suggests that slow lorises may have started <a href="speciation">evolving into distinct species</a> about 10 mya. They are thought to have reached the islands of <a href="Sundaland">Sundaland</a> when the <a href="Sunda%20Shelf">Sunda Shelf</a> was exposed at times of low sea level, creating a <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a> between the mainland and islands off the coast of Southeast Asia.

The earliest known mention of a slow loris in scientific literature is from 1770, when Dutchman Arnout Vosmaer (1720–1799) described a specimen of what we know today as "N. bengalensis" that he had received two years earlier. The French naturalist <a href="Georges-Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Comte%20de%20Buffon">Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon</a>, later questioned Vosmaer's decision to affiliate the animal with sloths, arguing that it was more closely aligned with the lorises of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a> (now Sri Lanka) and Bengal. The word "loris" was first used in 1765 by Buffon as a close equivalent to a Dutch name, "loeris". This <a href="etymology">etymology</a> was later supported by the <a href="physician">physician</a> <a href="William%20Baird%20%28physician%29">William Baird</a> in the 1820s, who noted that the Dutch word "loeris" signified "a clown".

In 1785, the Dutch physician and naturalist <a href="Pieter%20Boddaert">Pieter Boddaert</a> was the first to officially <a href="species%20description">describe</a> a species of slow loris using the name "Tardigradus coucang". This species was based on the "tailless maucauco" described by <a href="Thomas%20Pennant">Thomas Pennant</a> in 1781, which is thought to have been based on a Sunda slow loris, and on Vosmaer's description of a Bengal slow loris. Consequently, there has been some disagreement over the identity of "Tardigradus coucang"; currently the name is given to the Sunda slow loris. The next slow loris species to be described was "Lori bengalensis" (currently "Nycticebus bengalensis"), named by <a href="Bernard%20Germain%20de%20Lac%C3%A9p%C3%A8de">Bernard Germain de Lacépède</a> in 1800. In 1812, <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Geoffroy%20Saint-Hilaire">Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</a> named the genus "Nycticebus", naming it for its <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> behavior. The name derives from the , <a href="genitive%20case">genitive</a> form of (, "night"), and (, "monkey"). Geoffroy also named "Nycticebus javanicus" in this work. Later 19th-century authors also called the slow lorises "Nycticebus", but most used the species name "tardigradus" (given by Linnaeus in 1758 in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition of "Systema Naturæ"</a>) for slow lorises, until <a href="mammalogy">mammalogists</a> <a href="Witmer%20Stone">Witmer Stone</a> and <a href="James%20A.%20G.%20Rehn">James A. G. Rehn</a> clarified in 1902 that Linnaeus's name actually referred to a slender loris.

Several more species were named around 1900, including "Nycticebus menagensis" (originally "Lemur menagensis") by <a href="Richard%20Lydekker">Richard Lydekker</a> in 1893 and "Nycticebus pygmaeus" by <a href="J.%20Lewis%20Bonhote">John James Lewis Bonhote</a> in 1907. However, in 1939 <a href="Reginald%20Innes%20Pocock">Reginald Innes Pocock</a> consolidated all slow lorises into a single <a href="species">species</a>, "N. coucang", and in his influential 1953 book "Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy", primatologist <a href="William%20Charles%20Osman%20Hill">William Charles Osman Hill</a> also followed this course. In 1971 <a href="Colin%20Groves">Colin Groves</a> recognized the <a href="pygmy%20slow%20loris">pygmy slow loris</a> ("N. pygmaeus") as a separate species, and divided "N. coucang" into four <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, while in 2001 Groves opined there were three species ("N. coucang", "N. pygmaeus", and "N. bengalensis"), and that "N. coucang" had three subspecies ("Nycticebus coucang coucang", "N. c. menagensis", and "N. c. javanicus").
In 2006, the Bornean slow loris was elevated to the species level (as "Nycticebus menagensis") based on <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular analysis</a> of <a href="Nucleic%20acid%20sequence">DNA sequences</a> of the <a href="D-loop">D-loop</a> and the <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> gene. In 2008, Groves and Ibnu Maryanto confirmed the promotion of the fifth species, the Javan slow loris, to species status, a move that had been suggested in previous studies from 2000. They based their decision on an analysis of cranial <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> and characteristics of <a href="fur">pelage</a>. Species differentiation was based largely on differences in morphology, such as size, fur color, and head markings.

To help clarify species and subspecies boundaries, and to establish whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> relationships within the genus "Nycticebus" were investigated by Chen and colleagues using DNA sequences derived from the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> markers D-loop and cytochrome "b". Previous molecular analyses using <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a>s, <a href="restriction%20enzyme">restriction enzyme</a>s, and DNA sequences were focused on understanding the relationships between a few species, not the phylogeny of the entire genus. The analyses published in 2006 by Chen and colleagues' proved inconclusive, although one test suggested that "N. coucang" and "N. bengalensis" apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with members of their own species, possibly due to <a href="Introgression">introgressive hybridization</a> since the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of <a href="sympatry">sympatry</a> in southern Thailand. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between "N. bengalensis" and "N. coucang", and suggested that there has been <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a> between the two species.

In 2012, two <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">taxonomic synonyms</a> (formerly recognized as subspecies) of "N. menagensis"—"<a href="Nycticebus%20bancanus">N. bancanus</a>" and "<a href="Nycticebus%20borneanus">N. borneanus</a>"—were elevated to species status, and a new species—"<a href="Nycticebus%20kayan">N. kayan</a>"—was also distinguished from the same. Rachel Munds, Anna Nekaris and Susan Ford based these taxonomic revisions on distinguishable facial markings. With that, the "N. menagensis" <a href="species%20complex">species complex</a> that had been collectively known as the Bornean slow loris became four species: the <a href="Philippine%20slow%20loris">Philippine slow loris</a> ("N. menagensis"), the <a href="Bornean%20slow%20loris">Bornean slow loris</a> ("N. borneanus"), the <a href="Bangka%20slow%20loris">Bangka slow loris</a> ("N. bancanus"), and the <a href="Kayan%20River%20slow%20loris">Kayan River slow loris</a> ("N. kayan").

Slow lorises have a round head because their <a href="skull">skull</a> is shorter than in other living strepsirrhine. Like other <a href="lorisidae">lorisids</a>, their snout does not taper towards the front of the face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared with the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital distance is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent <a href="Sagittal%20crest">crests</a> (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the <a href="occipital%20bone">occipital bone</a> is flattened and faces backward. The <a href="foramen%20magnum">foramen magnum</a> (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.
The ears are small, sparsely covered in hair, and hidden in the fur. Similar to the slender lorises, the fur around and directly above the eyes is dark. Unlike the slender lorises, however, the white stripe that separates the eye rings broadens both on the tip of the nose and on the forehead while also fading out on the forehead. Like other strepsirrhine primates, the nose and lip are covered by a moist skin called the <a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a> ("wet nose"), which is a sense organ.

The eyes of slow lorises are forward-facing, which gives <a href="stereopsis">stereo vision</a>. Their eyes are large and possess a reflective layer, called the <a href="tapetum%20lucidum">tapetum lucidum</a>, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the <a href="Ray%20%28optics%29">incoming light</a>. Slow lorises have <a href="Monochromacy">monochromatic vision</a>, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the <a href="opsin">opsin</a> gene that would allow them to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.

The <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a> of slow lorises is , meaning that on each side of the mouth there are two upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, one upper and lower <a href="canine%20tooth">canine tooth</a>, three upper and lower <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s, and three upper and lower <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>, giving a total of 36 permanent teeth. As in all other <a href="Crown%20group">crown</a> strepsirrhines, their lower incisors and canine are procumbent (lie down and face outwards), forming a <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a>, which is used for <a href="Personal%20grooming">personal</a> and <a href="social%20grooming">social grooming</a> and feeding. The toothcomb is kept clean by the <a href="sublingua">sublingua</a> or "under-tongue", a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua extends below the tip of the tongue and is tipped with <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth.

Slow lorises have relatively large maxillary canine teeth, their inner (mesial) maxillary incisors are larger than the outer (distal) maxillary incisors, and they have a <a href="Diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastema</a> (gap) between the canine and the first premolar. The first <a href="mandibular%20first%20premolar">mandibular premolar</a> is elongated, and the last molar has three <a href="Cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a> on the <a href="Crown%20%28tooth%29">crown</a>, the shortest of which is near the back. The bony <a href="palate">palate</a> (roof of the mouth) only goes as far back as the second molar.

Slow lorises range in weight from the Bornean slow loris at to as much as for the Bengal slow loris. Slow lorises have stout bodies, and their tails are only stubs and hidden beneath the dense fur. Their combined head and body lengths vary by species, but range from between all species. The <a href="Trunk%20%28anatomy%29">trunk</a> is longer than in other living strepsirrhines because they have 15–16 <a href="thoracic%20vertebrae">thoracic vertebrae</a>, compared to 12–14 in other living strepsirrhines. This gives them greater mobility when twisting and extending towards nearby branches. Their other <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a> include seven <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical vertebrae</a>, six or seven <a href="lumbar%20vertebrae">lumbar vertebrae</a>, six or seven <a href="sacral%20vertebrae">sacral vertebrae</a>, and seven to eleven <a href="caudal%20vertebrae">caudal vertebrae</a>.
Unlike galagos, which have longer legs than arms, slow lorises have arms and legs of nearly equal length. Their <a href="intermembral%20index">intermembral index</a> (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, indicating that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs. As with the slender lorises, their arms are slightly longer than their body, but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout.

Slow lorises have a powerful grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° from the rest of the fingers, while the <a href="hallux">hallux</a> (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large <a href="flexor%20digitorum%20longus%20muscle">flexor muscle</a> that originates on the lower end of the <a href="Femur">thigh bone</a>, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a <a href="rete%20mirabile">rete mirabile</a> (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a <a href="grooming%20claw">grooming claw</a> on the second toe of each foot.

Slow lorises have an unusually low <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a>, about 40% of the typical value for placental mammals of their size, comparable to that of <a href="sloth">sloth</a>s. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on "<a href="Gluta">Gluta</a>" bark, which may be fatal to humans.

Slow lorises are found in South and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Their collective range stretches from <a href="Northeast%20India">Northeast India</a> through <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>, east to the <a href="Sulu%20Archipelago">Sulu Archipelago</a> (the small, southern islands of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>), and south to the island of <a href="Java">Java</a> (including <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, and many small nearby islands). They are found in <a href="India">India</a> (Northeastern states), <a href="China">China</a> (<a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> province), <a href="Laos">Laos</a>, <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Burma">Burma</a>, Thailand, <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, the Philippines, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a>, and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>.

There are currently eight recognized species. The pygmy slow loris ("N. pygmaeus") occurs east of the <a href="Mekong">Mekong River</a> in Yunnan, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The <a href="Bornean%20slow%20loris">Bornean slow loris</a> ("N. menagensis"), found on Borneo and nearby islands, including the Sulu Archipelago, and in 2012 was split into four distinct species (adding "N. bancanus", "N. borneanus", and "N. kayan"). The <a href="Javan%20slow%20loris">Javan slow loris</a> ("N. javanicus") is only found on the island of Java in Indonesia. The <a href="Sunda%20slow%20loris">Sunda slow loris</a> ("N. coucang") occurs on Sumatra and the <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a>, including Singapore and southern Thailand (the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Kra">Isthmus of Kra</a>). The <a href="Bengal%20slow%20loris">Bengal slow loris</a> ("N. bengalensis") has the largest distribution of all the slow lorises and can be found in Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China, Northeast India, Laos, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Slow lorises range across <a href="Tropics">tropical</a> and <a href="Subtropics">subtropical</a> regions and are found in primary and secondary <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s, as well as <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> groves and <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> forests. They prefer forests with high, dense <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopies</a>, although some species have also been found in <a href="Disturbance%20%28ecology%29">disturbed habitats</a>, such as <a href="Theobroma%20cacao">cacao</a> plantations and mixed-crop home gardens. Due largely to their nocturnal behavior and the subsequent difficulties in accurately quantifying abundance, data about the population size or distribution patterns of slow lorises is limited. In general, encounter rates are low; a combined analysis of several field studies involving <a href="transect">transect</a> surveys conducted in South and Southeast Asia determined encounter rates ranging from as high as 0.74 lorises per kilometer for "N. coucang" to as low as 0.05 lorises per kilometer for "N. pygmaeus".

Little is known about the social structure of slow lorises, but they generally spend most of the night foraging alone. Individuals sleep during the day, usually alone but occasionally with other slow lorises. Home ranges of adults may significantly overlap, and those of males are generally larger than those of females. In the absence of direct studies of the genus, primatologist Simon Bearder speculated that slow loris social behavior is similar to that of the potto, another nocturnal primate. Such a social system is distinguished by a lack of <a href="matriarchy">matriarchy</a> and by factors that allow the slow loris to remain inconspicuous and minimize energy expenditure. Vocal exchanges and alarm calls are limited; <a href="urine%20marking">scent marking with urine</a> is the dominant form of communication. Adult males are highly territorial and are aggressive towards other males. <a href="Animal%20communication">Vocalizations</a> include an affiliative (friendly) call "krik", and a louder call resembling a crow's caw. When disturbed, slow lorises can also produce a low buzzing hiss or growl. To make contact with other individuals, they emit a single high-pitched rising tone, and females use a high whistle when in <a href="estrus">estrus</a>.

Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers, and often hold on to branches with three of their four limbs. To move between trees, they carefully grip the terminal branches of the neighboring tree and pull themselves across the small gap. They will also grip branches with only their hind feet, lift themselves upright, and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey. Due to their slow movement, all lorises, including the slow lorises, have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against <a href="predation">predation</a>. Their slow, deliberate movement hardly disturbs the vegetation and is almost completely silent. Once disturbed, they immediately stop moving and remain motionless. In Indonesia, slow lorises are called "malu malu" or "shy one" because they freeze and cover their face when spotted. If cornered, they may adopt a defensive posture by curling up and lunging at the predator. The <a href="Acehnese%20language">Acehnese</a> name, "buah angin" ("wind monkey"), refers to their ability to "fleetingly but silently escape". Little is known about the predation of slow lorises. Documented predators include snakes, the <a href="changeable%20hawk-eagle">changeable hawk-eagle</a> ("Nisaetus cirrhatus"), and <a href="Sumatran%20orangutan">Sumatran orangutan</a>s ("Pongo abelii"). Other potential predators include cats, <a href="sun%20bear">sun bear</a>s ("Helarctos malayanus"), <a href="binturong">binturong</a>s ("Arctictis binturong"), and <a href="civet">civet</a>s.

Slow lorises produce a <a href="secretion">secretion</a> from their brachial <a href="gland">gland</a> (a scent gland on the upper arm near the <a href="axilla">axilla</a>) that is licked and mixed with their saliva. In tests, three predators—binturongs, <a href="clouded%20leopard">clouded leopard</a>s ("Neofelis nebulosa"), and sun bears—retreated or showed other signs of displeasure when presented with cotton swabs anointed with a mixture of the toxic secretion and the saliva, whereas the toxic secretion alone generated mild interest. Before stashing their offspring in a secure location, female slow lorises will lick their brachial glands, and then groom their young with their toothcomb, depositing the toxin on their fur. When threatened, slow lorises may also lick their brachial glands and bite their aggressors, delivering the toxin into the wounds. Slow lorises can be reluctant to release their bite, which is likely to maximize the transfer of toxins. This toxic bite is a rare trait among mammals and unique to lorisid primates. It may also be used for defense against other slow lorises and <a href="Parasitism">parasites</a>. According to Nekaris, this adaptation—along with vocalizations, movement, and coloration patterns similar to those of <a href="Naja">true cobras</a>—may have evolved through <a href="M%C3%BCllerian%20mimicry">Müllerian mimicry</a> to protect slow lorises when they need to move across the ground due to breaks in the canopy.
Studies suggest that slow lorises are <a href="polygynandry">polygynandrous</a>. Infants are either parked on branches while their parents find food or else are carried by one of the parents. Due to their long <a href="gestation">gestation</a>s (about six months), small litter sizes, low birth weights, long <a href="weaning">weaning</a> times (three to six months), and long gaps between births, slow loris populations have one of the slowest growth rates among mammals of similar size. Pygmy slow lorises are likely to give birth to twins—from 50% to 100% of births, depending on the study; in contrast, this phenomenon is rare (3% occurrence) in Bengal slow lorises. A seven-year study of captive-bred pygmy slow lorises showed a skewed sex distribution, with 1.68 males born for every 1 female.

Breeding may be continuous throughout the year. Copulation often occurs while suspended with the hands and feet clinging to horizontal branches for support. In captive Sunda slow lorises, mating primarily occurs between June and mid-September, with the <a href="Estrous%20cycle">estrus cycle</a> lasting 29 to 45 days and estrus lasting one to five days. Likewise, gestation lasts 185 to 197 days, and the young weigh between at birth. Females reach <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> at 18 to 24 months, while males are capable of reproducing at 17 months. However, the fathers become hostile towards their male offspring after 12 to 14 months and will chase them away. In captivity, they can live 20 or more years.

Slow lorises are <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>s, eating insects and other <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, small birds and reptiles, eggs, fruits, <a href="gum%20%28botany%29">gums</a>, nectar and miscellaneous vegetation. A 1984 study of the Sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey. A more detailed study of another Sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% nectar, 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and other animal prey. The most common dietary item was nectar from flowers of the Bertram palm ("<a href="Eugeissona%20tristis">Eugeissona tristis</a>"). The Sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell.

Preliminary results of studies on the pygmy slow loris indicate that its diet consists primarily of gums and nectar (especially nectar from "<a href="Saraca%20dives">Saraca dives</a>" flowers), and that animal prey makes up 30–40% of its diet. However, one 2002 analysis of pygmy slow loris feces indicated that it contained 98% insect remains and just 2% plant remains. The pygmy slow loris often returns to the same gum feeding sites and leaves conspicuous gouges on tree trunks when inducing the flow of <a href="exudate">exudate</a>s. Slow lorises have been reported gouging for exudates at heights ranging from to as much as ; the gouging process, whereby the loris repetitively bangs its toothcomb into the hard bark, may be loud enough to be heard up to away. The marks remaining after gouging can be used by field workers to assess loris presence in an area. Captive pygmy slow lorises also make characteristic gouge marks in wooden substrates, such as branches. It is not known how the sympatric pygmy and Bengal slow lorises partition their feeding niches. The plant gums, obtained typically from species in the family <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a> (peas), are high in <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s and <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s, and can serve as a year-around source of food, or an emergency reserve when other preferred food items are scarce. Several anatomical adaptations present in slow lorises may enhance their ability to feed on exudates: a long narrow tongue to make it easier to reach gum stashed in cracks and crevices, a large <a href="cecum">cecum</a> to help the animal digest <a href="polysaccharide">complex carbohydrates</a>, and a short <a href="duodenum">duodenum</a> to help quickly pass potentially toxic exudates. Slow lorises can use both hands to eat while hanging upside down from a branch. They spend about 20% of their nightly activities feeding.

The secretion from the brachial gland of captive slow lorises is similar to the allergen in cat <a href="dander">dander</a>, hence the secretions may merely elicit an allergic reaction, not toxicosis. Loris bites cause a painful swelling, and the single case of human death reported in the scientific literature was believed to have resulted from anaphylactic shock. Slow lorises (of the genus "Nycticebus") are accepted as the only known venomous primate. Slow loris venom was known in folklore in their host countries throughout southeast Asia for centuries; but dismissed by western science until the 1990s. Animal dealers in Southeast Asia keep tanks of water nearby so that in case of a bite, they can submerge both their arm and the slow loris to make the animal let go. It is thought all nine recognised species of this small-bodied nocturnal primate are venomous. They possess a dual composite venom consisting of saliva and brachial gland exudate, a malodourous fluid forming from an <a href="apocrine%20sweat%20gland">apocrine sweat gland</a> on the animal's forearm. Both fluids have been demonstrated as being venomous individually and creating a more potent venom when mixed. Slow loris brachial gland exudate (BGE) has been shown to possess up to 142 volatile components, and possesses a variant of the cat allergen protein Fel-D1. The BGE has several ecological functions including anti-parasitic defence and communication. Slow loris saliva has been shown to be cytotoxic to human skin cells in laboratory experiments without the admix of BGE.

The venom is administered through morphologically distinct dentition in the form of an adapted toothcomb. In the wild, envenomation occurs from intraspecific competition; whereby two slow lorises fight for mates, food or territory. Slow loris inflicted wounds is a major cause of premature death in zoo and wildlife slow loris populations; often resulting in festering and necrotic wounds. Slow loris envenomation in humans is rare; but can result in near fatal anaphylactic shock. A suite of additional effects of the venom have been documented including ranging from mild to permanent disfigurement and mobility loss and near-death. Furthermore, secondary toxins may be introduced from the consumption of wild food, augmenting the toxicity. The combined brachial secretion and saliva of recently captured wild lorises was shown to contain <a href="batrachotoxin">batrachotoxin</a>s, which were not found in slow lorises held in captivity for more than a year. The study of slow loris venom was brought to the public attention in 2012 by the research of the world-renowned Professor K.A.I Nekaris and in her award-winning BBC documentary 'The jungle gremlins of Java'.

Beliefs about slow lorises and their use in traditional practices are deep-rooted and go back at least 300 years, if not earlier based on oral traditions. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was reported that the people from the interior of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil. The following passage from an early textbook about primates is indicative of the superstitions associated with slow lorises: Many strange powers are attributed to this animal by the natives of the countries it inhabits; there is hardly an event in life to man, woman or child, or even domestic animals, that may not be influenced for better or worse by the Slow Loris, alive or dead, or by any separate part of it, and apparently one cannot usually tell at the time, that one is under supernatural power. Thus a Malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate, and then find that an enemy had buried a particular part of a Loris under his threshold, which had, unknown to him, compelled him to act to his own disadvantage. ... [a slow loris's] life is not a happy one, for it is continually seeing ghosts; that is why it hides its face in its hands.

In the <a href="Mondulkiri%20Province">Mondulkiri Province</a> of Cambodia, hunters believe that lorises can heal their own broken bones immediately after falling from a branch so that they can climb back up the tree. They also believe that slow lorises have medicinal powers because they require more than one hit with a stick to die. In the province of <a href="North%20Sumatra">North Sumatra</a>, the slow loris is thought to bring good luck if it is buried under a house or a road. In the same province, slow loris body parts were used to place curses on enemies. In Java, it was thought that putting a piece of its skull in a water jug would make a husband more docile and submissive, just like a slow loris in the daytime. More recently, researchers have documented the belief that the consumption of loris meat was an <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a> that improves "male power". The gall bladder of the Bengal slow loris has historically been used to make ink for tattoos by the village elders in <a href="Pursat%20Province">Pursat</a> and <a href="Koh%20Kong%20Province">Koh Kong Province</a>s of Cambodia. Loris wine is a traditional Cambodian medicine supposed to alleviate the pain of childbirth, made from a mixture of loris bodies and rice wine.

The two greatest threats to slow lorises are <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> and the <a href="wildlife%20trade">wildlife trade</a>. Slow lorises have lost a significant amount of habitat, with <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">habitat fragmentation</a> isolating small populations and obstructing <a href="biological%20dispersal">biological dispersal</a>. However, despite the lost habitat, their decline is most closely associated with unsustainable trade, either as <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a>s or for <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a>.

Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 are currently listed as either "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>" or "<a href="Endangered%20species">Endangered</a>" by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) on their <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red List</a>. When they were all considered a single species, imprecise population data together with their regular occurrence in Southeast Asian animal markets combined to erroneously suggest that slow lorises were common. This manifested as incorrect Red List assessments of "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>" as recently as 2000. The three newest species are yet to be evaluated by the IUCN, although each were once thought to be subpopulations of the Bornean slow loris—which was evaluated as "Vulnerable" in 2008. With this division of its range and population, the Bornean slow loris and the three new species face a higher risk of extinction than before.

Since 2007, all slow loris species have been protected from commercial international trade under <a href="CITES%20Appendix%20I">Appendix I</a> of <a href="CITES">CITES</a>. Furthermore, local trade is illegal because every nation in which they occur naturally has laws protecting them. Despite their CITES Appendix I status and local legal protection, slow lorises are still threatened by both local and international trade due to problems with enforcement. Surveys are needed to determine existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris. Connectivity between protected areas is important for slow lorises because they are not adapted to dispersing across the ground over large distances.

Populations of Bengal and Sunda slow lorises are not faring well in zoos. Of the 29 captive specimens in North American zoos in 2008, several are hybrids that cannot breed, while most are past their reproductive years. The last captive birth for these species in North America was in 2001 in San Diego. Pygmy slow lorises are doing better in North American zoos; from the late 1980s (when they were imported) to 2008, the population grew to 74 animals, with most of them born at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Zoo">San Diego Zoo</a>.

Until the 1960s, the hunting of slow lorises was sustainable, but due to growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife, slow lorises have been <a href="Overexploitation">overexploited</a> and are in decline. With the use of modern technology, such as battery-powered search lights, slow lorises have become easier to hunt because of their eye shine. Traditional medicine made from loris parts is thought to cure many diseases, and the demand for this medicine from wealthy urban areas has replaced the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris and colleagues (2010) showed that these belief systems were so strong that the majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris-based medicines.

Slow lorises are sold locally at street markets, but are also sold internationally over the Internet and in pet stores. They are especially popular or trendy in Japan, particularly among women. The reasons for their popularity, according to the Japan Wildlife Conservation Society, are that "they're easy to keep, they don't cry, they're small, and just very cute."

Because of their "cuteness", videos of pet slow lorises are some of the most frequently watched animal-related <a href="viral%20video">viral video</a>s on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>. In March 2011, a newly posted video of a slow loris holding a <a href="cocktail%20umbrella">cocktail umbrella</a> had been viewed more than two million times, while an older video of a slow loris being tickled had been viewed more than six million times. According to Nekaris, these videos are misunderstood by most people who watch them, since most do not realize that it is illegal in most countries to own them as pets and that the slow lorises in the videos are only docile because that is their passive defensive reaction to threatening situations. Despite frequent advertisements by pet shops in Japan, the <a href="World%20Conservation%20Monitoring%20Centre">World Conservation Monitoring Centre</a> reported that only a few dozen slow lorises were imported in 2006, suggesting frequent <a href="wildlife%20smuggling">smuggling</a>. Slow lorises are also smuggled to China, Taiwan, Europe, Russia, the United States, and Saudi Arabia for use as pets.
Within their countries of origin, slow lorises are very popular pets, particularly in Indonesia. They are seen as a "living toy" for children by local people or are bought out of pity by Western tourists or expatriates. Neither local nor foreign buyers usually know anything about these primates, their endangered status, or that the trade is illegal. According to "National Geographic", slow lorises are protected by both local laws in southern Asia and by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Furthermore, few know about their strong odor or their painful bite, which may lead to anaphylaxis in some cases. According to data compiled from monthly surveys and interviews with local traders, nearly a thousand locally sourced slow lorises exchanged hands in the <a href="Medan">Medan</a> bird market in North Sumatra during the late first decade of the 21st century.

International trade usually causes a high mortality rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems due to both local and international trade. In order to give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes <a href="Shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a> or death. Dental infection is common and is fatal in 90% of cases. Without their teeth, the animals can no longer fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.

As part of the trade, infants are pulled prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin secretions from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake.

Capella

Capella, also designated α Aurigae (<a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinized</a> to Alpha Aurigae, abbreviated Alpha Aur, α Aur), is the brightest star in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Auriga%20%28constellation%29">Auriga</a>, the <a href="list%20of%20brightest%20stars">sixth-brightest</a> star in the <a href="night%20sky">night sky</a>, and the third-brightest in the <a href="northern%20celestial%20hemisphere">northern celestial hemisphere</a> after <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> and <a href="Vega">Vega</a>. A prominent object in the northern winter sky, it is <a href="Circumpolar%20star">circumpolar</a> to observers north of 44°N. Its name meaning "little goat" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, Capella depicted the goat <a href="Amalthea%20%28mythology%29">Amalthea</a> that suckled <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> in classical mythology. Capella is relatively close, at only from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>.

Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is actually a quadruple <a href="star%20system">star system</a> organized in two <a href="binary%20star">binary pairs</a>, made up of the stars Capella Aa, Capella Ab, Capella H, and Capella L. 

The primary pair, Capella Aa and Capella Ab, are two bright yellow <a href="giant%20star">giant star</a>s, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive <a href="Solar%20mass">as the Sun</a>. The secondary pair, Capella H and Capella L, are around 10,000 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">astronomical units</a> (AU) from the first and are two faint, small and relatively cool <a href="Red%20dwarf">red dwarfs</a>. 

Capella Aa and Capella Ab have exhausted their core <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, and cooled and expanded, moving off the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>. They are in a very tight circular orbit about 0.74 AU apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the <a href="Solar%20luminosity">Sun's luminosity</a> and 11.98 ± 0.57 times <a href="Solar%20radius">its radius</a>. An ageing <a href="red%20clump">red clump</a> star, Capella Aa is fusing <a href="helium">helium</a> to <a href="carbon">carbon</a> and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> in its core. Capella Ab is slightly smaller and hotter and of spectral class G1III; it is 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous as the Sun and 8.83 ± 0.33 times its radius. It is in the <a href="Hertzsprung%20gap">Hertzsprung gap</a>, corresponding to a brief <a href="subgiant">subgiant</a> evolutionary phase as it expands and cools to become a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>. 

Capella is one of the brightest <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> sources in the sky, thought to come primarily from the <a href="corona">corona</a> of Capella Aa. 

Several other stars in the same visual field have been catalogued as companions but are physically unrelated.

"α Aurigae" (<a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised</a> to "Alpha Aurigae") is the star system's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>. It also has the <a href="Flamsteed%20designation">Flamsteed designation</a> 13 Aurigae. It is listed in several multiple star catalogues as <a href="Aitken%20Double%20Star%20Catalogue">ADS</a> 3841, <a href="Catalogue%20of%20Components%20of%20Double%20and%20Multiple%20Stars">CCDM</a> J05168+4559, and <a href="Washington%20Double%20Star%20Catalog">WDS</a> J05167+4600. As a relatively nearby star system, Capella is listed in the <a href="Gliese-Jahreiss%20Catalogue">Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue</a> with designations GJ 194 for the bright pair of giants and GJ 195 for the faint pair of red dwarfs.

The traditional name "Capella" is <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> for "(small) female goat"; the alternative name "Capra" was more commonly used in classical times. In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included "Capella" for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The catalogue of star names lists "Capella" as applying to the star α Aurigae Aa.

Capella was the brightest star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>. At −1.1, <a href="Aldebaran">Aldebaran</a> was brightest before this period; it and Capella were situated rather close to each other in the sky and approximated boreal <a href="pole%20star">pole star</a>s at the time.

Capella is thought to be mentioned in an <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a> inscription dating to the 20th century BC. Its symbolism as a goat dates back to <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> as a constellation called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. It may have represented the star alone or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL. GAM in the 7th-century BC document <a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a>. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of the stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for <a href="Beta%20Tauri">Beta Tauri</a> (Elnath), traditionally assigned to both <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a> and Auriga. Later, <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. It is sometimes called the "Shepherd's Star" in English literature. Capella was seen as a portent of rain in classical times.
Building J of the <a href="pre-Columbian">pre-Columbian</a> site <a href="Monte%20Alb%C3%A1n">Monte Albán</a> in <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> state in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> was built around 275 BC, at a different orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its <a href="heliacal%20rising">heliacal rising</a> took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.

Professor <a href="William%20Wallace%20Campbell">William Wallace Campbell</a> of the <a href="Lick%20Observatory">Lick Observatory</a> announced that Capella was binary in 1899, based on <a href="spectroscopic">spectroscopic</a> observations—he noted on photographic plates taken from August 1896 to February 1897 that a second <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a> appeared superimposed over the first, and that there was a <a href="Doppler%20effect">doppler shift</a> to <a href="Blueshift">violet</a> in September and October and to <a href="Redshift">red</a> in November and February—showing that the components were moving toward and away from the Earth (and hence orbiting each other). Almost simultaneously, British astronomer <a href="Hugh%20Newall">Hugh Newall</a> had observed its composite spectrum with a four prism spectroscope attached to a telescope at Cambridge in July 1899, concluding that it was a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system.

Many observers tried to discern the component stars without success. Known as "The Interferometrist's Friend", it was first resolved <a href="Interferometry">interferometrically</a> in 1919 by John Anderson and Francis Pease at <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a>, who published an orbit in 1920 based on their observations. This was the first interferometric measurement of any object outside the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. A high-precision orbit was published in 1994 based on observations by the <a href="Mark%20III%20Stellar%20Interferometer">Mark III Stellar Interferometer</a>, again at Mount Wilson Observatory. Capella also became the first astronomical object to be imaged by a separate element optical interferometer when it was imaged by the <a href="Cambridge%20Optical%20Aperture%20Synthesis%20Telescope">Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope</a> in September 1995.

In 1914, Finnish astronomer <a href="Ragnar%20Furuhjelm">Ragnar Furuhjelm</a> observed that the spectroscopic binary had a faint companion star, which, as its <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> was similar to that of the spectroscopic binary, was probably physically bound to it. In February 1936, Carl L. Stearns observed that this companion appeared to be double itself; this was confirmed in September that year by <a href="Gerard%20Kuiper">Gerard Kuiper</a>. This pair are designated Capella H and L.

Two <a href="Aerobee">Aerobee-Hi</a> rocket flights on September 20, 1962, and March 15, 1963, detected and confirmed an <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> source in Auriga at <a href="Right%20ascension">RA</a> <a href="Declination">Dec</a> , identified as Capella. <a href="Stellar%20X-ray%20astronomy">Stellar X-ray astronomy</a> started on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from Capella. A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella. During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor. The X-ray luminosity ("L") of ~10 W (10 erg s) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity. Capella's X-rays are thought to be primarily from the <a href="corona">corona</a> of the more massive star. Capella is <a href="ROSAT">ROSAT</a> X-ray source 1RXS J051642.2+460001. The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using <a href="HEAO%201">HEAO 1</a> would require magnetic confinement, unless it is a free-flowing coronal wind.

With an average apparent magnitude of +0.08, Capella is the brightest object in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> <a href="Auriga%20%28constellation%29">Auriga</a>, the <a href="list%20of%20brightest%20stars">sixth-brightest</a> star in the night sky, the third-brightest in the northern <a href="Celestial%20sphere">celestial hemisphere</a> (after <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> and <a href="Vega">Vega</a>), and the fourth-brightest visible to the naked eye from the latitude <a href="40th%20parallel%20north">40°N</a>. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white colour, although the yellow colour is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky. 

Capella is closer to the north <a href="celestial%20pole">celestial pole</a> than any other <a href="first%20magnitude%20star">first magnitude star</a>. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude <a href="44th%20parallel%20south">44°S</a>—this includes southernmost <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a> as well as the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>. Conversely it is <a href="circumpolar%20star">circumpolar</a> north of <a href="44th%20parallel%20north">44°N</a>: for the whole of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and the northernmost <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are on opposite sides of the pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through <a href="Polaris">Polaris</a>. Visible halfway between <a href="Orion%27s%20Belt">Orion's Belt</a> and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the northern winter sky.

A few degrees to the southwest of Capella lie three stars, <a href="Epsilon%20Aurigae">Epsilon Aurigae</a>, <a href="Zeta%20Aurigae">Zeta Aurigae</a>, and <a href="Eta%20Aurigae">Eta Aurigae</a>, the latter two of which are known as "The Kids", or <a href="Auriga%20%28constellation%29%23Eclipsing%20binary%20stars">Haedi</a>. The four form a familiar pattern, or <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a>, in the sky.

Based on an annual <a href="parallax">parallax</a> shift of 76.20 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc">milliarcseconds</a> (with a margin of error of 0.46 milliarcseconds) as measured by the <a href="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> satellite, this system is estimated to be from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, with a margin of error of . An alternative method to determine the distance is via the <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder%23Parallax">orbital parallax</a>, which gives a distance of with a margin of error of only 0.1%. Capella is estimated to have been a little closer to the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> in the past, passing within 29 light-years distant around 237,000 years ago. At this range, it would have shone at apparent magnitude −0.82, comparable to <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a> today.

In a 1960 paper, American astronomer <a href="Olin%20J.%20Eggen">Olin J. Eggen</a> concluded that Capella was a member of the <a href="Hyades%20Stream">Hyades moving group</a>, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the <a href="Hyades%20cluster">Hyades cluster</a>, after analysing its <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> and <a href="parallax">parallax</a>. Members of the group are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>s.

There are several stars within a few <a href="arc%20minute">arc minute</a>s of Capella and some have been listed as companions in various multiple star catalogues. The <a href="Washington%20Double%20Star%20Catalog">Washington Double Star Catalog</a> lists components A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and R, with A being the <a href="naked-eye">naked-eye</a> star. Most are only <a href="optical%20double">line-of-sight</a> companions, but the close pair of <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>s H and L are at the same distance as the bright component A and moving through space along with it. Capella A is itself a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> with components Aa and Ab, both <a href="giant%20star">giant stars</a>. The pair of giants is separated from the pair of red dwarfs by 723<a href="arc%20second">"</a>. 

American astronomer <a href="Robert%20Burnham%20Jr.">Robert Burnham Jr.</a> described a scale model of the system where Capella A was represented by spheres 13 and 7 inches across, separated by ten feet. The red dwarfs were then each 0.7 inches across and they were separated by 420 feet. At this scale, the two pairs are 21 miles apart.

Capella A consists of two yellow <a href="stellar%20evolution">evolved</a> stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104.02128 ± 0.00016 days, with a <a href="semimajor%20axis">semimajor axis</a> of 111.11 ± 0.10 million km (0.74272 ± 0.00069 au), roughly the distance between <a href="Venus">Venus</a> and the Sun. The pair is not an eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes in front of the other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an <a href="Dynamical%20parallax">orbital parallax</a> with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the <a href="Roche%20lobe">Roche lobe</a> of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> stage of the primary star.

Modern convention designates the more luminous cooler star as component Aa and its spectral type has been usually measured between G2 and K0. The hotter secondary Ab has been given various spectral types of late (cooler) F or early (warmer) G. The <a href="MK%20spectral%20classification">MK spectral types</a> of the two stars have been measured a number of times, and they are both consistently assigned a luminosity class of III indicating a <a href="giant%20star">giant star</a>. The composite spectrum appears to be dominated by the primary star due to its sharper <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a>s; the lines from the secondary are broadened and blurred by its rapid rotation. The composite spectral class is given as approximately G3III, but with a specific mention of features due to a cooler component. The most recent specific published types are K0III and G1III, although older values are still widely quoted such as G5IIIe + G0III from the <a href="Bright%20Star%20Catalogue">Bright Star Catalogue</a> or G8III + G0III by Eggen. Where the context is clear, these two components have been referred to as A and B.

The individual <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>s of the two component stars cannot be directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths. They have very nearly equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being found to be a few tenths of a magnitude brighter. A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.

The physical properties of the two stars can be determined with high accuracy. The masses are derived directly from the orbital solution, with Aa being and Ab being . Their angular radii have been directly measured; in combination with the very accurate distance, this gives and for Aa and Ab respectively. Their <a href="effective%20temperature">surface temperatures</a> can be calculated by comparison of observed and synthetic spectra, direct measurement of their angular diameters and brightnesses, calibration against their observed <a href="colour%20index">colour indices</a>, and disentangling of high resolution spectra. Weighted averages of these four methods give 4,970 ± 50 <a href="kelvin">K</a> for Aa and 5,730 ± 60 for Ab. Their <a href="bolometric%20luminosity">bolometric luminosities</a> are most accurately derived from their apparent magnitudes and <a href="bolometric%20correction">bolometric correction</a>s, but are confirmed by calculation from the temperatures and radii of the stars. Aa is 78.7 ± 4.2 times as luminous as the Sun and Ab 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous, so the star defined as the primary component is the more luminous when all wavelengths are considered but very slightly less bright at visual wavelengths.

Estimated to be 590 to 650 million years old, the stars were probably at the hot end of <a href="spectral%20class%20A">spectral class A</a> during their <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> lifetime, similar to <a href="Vega">Vega</a>. They have now exhausted their core hydrogen and evolved off the main sequence, their outer layers expanding and cooling. Despite the giant luminosity class, the secondary component is very clearly within the <a href="Hertzsprung%20gap">Hertzsprung gap</a> on the <a href="Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell%20diagram">Hertzsprung–Russell diagram</a>, still expanding and cooling towards the <a href="red%20giant%20branch">red giant branch</a>, making it a <a href="subgiant">subgiant</a> in evolutionary terms. The more massive primary has already passed through this stage, when it reached a maximum radius of 36 to 38 times that of the Sun. It is now a <a href="red%20clump">red clump</a> star which is fusing <a href="helium">helium</a> to <a href="carbon">carbon</a> and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> in its core, a process that has not yet begun for the less massive star. Detailed analysis shows that it is nearing the end of this stage and starting to expand again which will lead it to the <a href="asymptotic%20giant%20branch">asymptotic giant branch</a>. <a href="Isotope%20abundance">Isotope abundance</a>s and spin rates confirm this evolutionary difference between the two stars. Heavy element abundances are broadly comparable to those of the Sun and the overall <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> is slightly less than the Sun's.

The rotational period of each star can be measured by observing periodic variations in the <a href="doppler%20shift">doppler shift</a>s of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the <a href="projected%20rotational%20velocity">projected equatorial rotational velocities</a> measured using <a href="doppler%20broadening">doppler broadening</a> of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1 ± 0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. <a href="Stellar%20rotation%23Rotation%20braking">Rotational braking</a> occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also <a href="Tidal%20braking">tidally braked</a>. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.

Capella has long been suspected to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than <a href="Rigel">Rigel</a>, <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a>, and <a href="Vega">Vega</a>, which are also variable. The system has been classified as an <a href="RS%20Canum%20Venaticorum%20variable">RS Canum Venaticorum variable</a>, a class of binary stars with active <a href="chromosphere">chromosphere</a>s that cause huge <a href="starspot">starspot</a>s, but it is still only listed as a suspected variable in the <a href="General%20Catalogue%20of%20Variable%20Stars">General Catalogue of Variable Stars</a>. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its <a href="convection%20zone">convection zone</a>.

The active atmospheres and closeness of these stars means that they are among the brightest <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> sources in the sky. However the X-ray emission is due to stable coronal structures and not eruptive flaring activity. Coronal loops larger than the Sun and with temperatures of several million K are likely to be responsible for the majority of the X-rays.

The seventh companion published for Capella, component H, is physically associated with the bright primary star. It is a <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> separated from the pair of G-type giants by a distance of around 10,000 <a href="astronomical%20unit">AU</a>. It has its own close companion, an even fainter red dwarf that was 1.8" away when it was discovered in 1935. Eighty years later the separation had increased to 3.5", sufficient to allow tentative orbital parameters to be derived. It is component L in double star catalogues. The Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue of nearby stars designates the binary system as GJ 195. The two components are then referred to individually as GJ 195 A and B.

The two stars are reported to have a 3.5 visual magnitude difference, 2.3 mag in the passband of the <a href="Gaia_%28spacecraft%29">Gaia spacecraft</a>, although the difference is much smaller at <a href="infrared">infrared</a> wavelengths. This is unexpected and may indicate further unseen companions. The mass of the stars can be determined from the orbital motion, but uncertainties in the orbit have led to widely varying results. In 1975, an eccentric 388 year orbit gave masses of and . A smaller near-circular orbit published in 2015 had a 300-year orbit, benefitting from mass constraints of and respectively for GJ 195 A and B based on their infrared magnitudes.

Six visual companions to Capella were discovered before Capella H and are generally known only as Capella B through G. None are thought to be physically associated with Capella although all appear closer in the sky than the HL pair.

Component F is also known as TYC 3358-3142-1. It is listed with a spectral type of K although it is included in a catalogue of OB stars as a distant luminous star.

Component G is BD+45 1076, with a spectral type of F0, at a distance of . It is identified as a variable member of the <a href="Guide%20Star%20Catalogue">Guide Star Catalogue</a> from <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra</a> observations although it is not known what type of variability. It is known to be an X-ray source with an active corona.

Several other stars have also been catalogued as companions to Capella. Components I, Q, and R are 13th magnitude stars at distances of 92", 133", and 134". <a href="V538%20Aurigae">V538 Aurigae</a> and its close companion HD 233153 are red dwarfs ten degrees away from Capella; they have very similar space motions but the small difference makes it possible that this is just a coincidence. Two faint stars have been discovered by <a href="speckle%20imaging">speckle imaging</a> in the Capella HL field, around 10" distant from that pair. These have been catalogued as Capella O and P. It is not known whether they are physically associated with the red dwarf binary.

Capella traditionally marks the left shoulder of the constellation's eponymous charioteer, or, according to the 2nd century astronomer <a href="Claudius%20Ptolemaeus">Ptolemy's</a> "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>", the goat that the charioteer is carrying. In Bayer's 1603 work "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>", Capella marks the charioteer's back. The three "<a href="Auriga%20%28constellation%29%23Eclipsing%20binary%20stars">Haedi</a>" had been identified as a separate constellation by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Manilius">Manilius</a>, and were called "Capra", "Caper", or "Hircus", all of which relate to its status as the "goat star". <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd century <a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>.

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the star represented the goat <a href="Amalthea%20%28mythology%29">Amalthea</a> that suckled <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>. It was this goat whose horn, after accidentally being broken off by Zeus, was transformed into the <a href="Cornucopia">Cornucopia</a>, or "horn of plenty", which would be filled with whatever its owner desired. Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a <a href="nymph">nymph</a>. The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>' defeat, after Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his <a href="aegis">aegis</a>.

In medieval accounts, it bore the uncommon name "Alhajoth" (also spelled "Alhaior", "Althaiot", "Alhaiset", "Alhatod", "Alhojet", "Alanac", "Alanat", "Alioc"), which (especially the last) may be a corruption of its Arabic name, , "al-ayyūq." "Ayyūq" has no clear significance in Arabic, but may be an Arabized form of the Greek αίξ "aiks" "goat"; cf. the modern Greek Αίγα "Aiga", the feminine of goat. To the <a href="Negev%20Bedouins">Bedouin</a> of the <a href="Negev">Negev</a> and <a href="Sinai">Sinai</a>, Capella "al-'Ayyūq ath-Thurayyā" "Capella of the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a>", from its role as pointing out the position of that asterism. Another name in Arabic was "Al-Rākib" "the driver", a translation of the Greek.

To the ancient <a href="Balts">Balts</a>, Capella was known as "Perkūno Ožka" "Thunder's Goat", or "Tikutis". Conversely in Slavic Macedonian folklore, Capella was "Jastreb" "the hawk", flying high above and ready to pounce on Mother Hen (the Pleiades) and the Rooster (Nath).

<a href="Astrology">Astrologically</a>, Capella portends civic and <a href="military">military</a> <a href="honor">honor</a>s and <a href="wealth">wealth</a>. In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, it was considered a <a href="Behenian%20fixed%20star">Behenian fixed star</a>, with the stone <a href="sapphire">sapphire</a> and the plants horehound, mint, mugwort, and mandrake as attributes. <a href="Cornelius%20Agrippa">Cornelius Agrippa</a> listed its <a href="kabbalistic">kabbalistic</a> sign with the name "Hircus" (Latin for "goat").

In <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythology</a>, Capella was seen as the heart of <a href="Brahma">Brahma</a>, "Brahma Hṛdaya". In traditional Chinese astronomy, Capella was part of the <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> (; English: "<a href="Five%20Chariots">Five Chariots</a>"), which consisted of Capella together with <a href="Beta%20Aurigae">Beta Aurigae</a>, <a href="Theta%20Aurigae">Theta Aurigae</a>, and <a href="Iota%20Aurigae">Iota Aurigae</a>, as well as <a href="Beta%20Tauri">Beta Tauri</a>. Since it was the second star in this asterism, it has the name (; English: "Second of the Five Chariots").

In <a href="Quechua%20language">Quechua</a> it was known as "Colça"; the Incas held the star in high regard. The Hawaiians saw Capella as part of an asterism "Ke ka o Makali'i" ("The canoe bailer of Makali'i") that helped them navigate at sea. Called "Hoku-lei" "star wreath", it formed this asterism with <a href="Procyon">Procyon</a>, <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, <a href="Castor%20%28star%29">Castor</a> and <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a>. In Tahitian folklore, Capella was "Tahi-ari'i", the wife of "Fa'a-nui" (Auriga) and mother of prince "Ta'urua" (<a href="Venus">Venus</a>) who sails his canoe across the sky. In <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> astronomy, Capella, along with Menkalinan (<a href="Beta%20Aurigae">Beta Aurigae</a>), <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a> (Beta Geminorum) and <a href="Castor%20%28star%29">Castor</a> (Alpha Geminorum), formed a constellation <a href="Quturjuuk">Quturjuuk</a>, "collar-bones", the two pairs of stars denoting a bone each. Used for navigation and time-keeping at night, the constellation was recognised from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> to western Greenland. The <a href="Gwich%27in">Gwich'in</a> saw Capella and Menkalinan has forming "shreets'ą įį vidzee", the right ear of the large circumpolar constellation "Yahdii", which covered much of the night sky, and whose orientation facilitated navigation and timekeeping.

In <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20astronomy">Australian Aboriginal mythology</a> for the <a href="Wergaia%23Mythological%20and%20empirical%20thinking">Boorong</a> people of Victoria, Capella was "Purra", the <a href="Kangaroo%23Interaction%20with%20humans">kangaroo</a>, pursued and killed by the nearby Gemini twins, "Yurree" (<a href="Castor%20%28star%29">Castor</a>) and "Wanjel" (<a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a>). The <a href="Wardaman%20people">Wardaman people</a> of northern Australia knew the star as "Yagalal", a ceremonial fish scale, related to Guwamba the <a href="barramundi">barramundi</a> (<a href="Aldebaran">Aldebaran</a>).

Elasmosaurus

Elasmosaurus (;) is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a> that lived in North America during the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> stage of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> period, about 80.5million years ago. The first specimen was discovered in 1867 near <a href="Fort%20Wallace">Fort Wallace</a>, Kansas, and was sent to the American paleontologist <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a>, who named it E.platyurus in 1868. The <a href="Generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic name</a> means "thin-plate reptile", and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> means "flat-tailed". Cope originally reconstructed the skeleton of "Elasmosaurus" with the skull at the end of the tail, an error which was made light of by the paleontologist <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, and became part of their "<a href="Bone%20Wars">Bone Wars</a>" rivalry. Only one incomplete "Elasmosaurus" skeleton is definitely known, consisting of a fragmentary skull, the spine, and the <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral</a> and <a href="pelvic%20girdle">pelvic girdle</a>s, and a single species is recognized today; other species are now considered invalid or have been moved to other genera.

Measuring long, "Elasmosaurus" would have had a streamlined body with paddle-like limbs, a short tail, a small head, and an extremely long neck. The neck alone was around long. Along with its relative "<a href="Albertonectes">Albertonectes</a>", it was one of the longest-necked animals to have lived, with the largest number of neck <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a> known, 72. The skull would have been slender and triangular, with large, fang-like teeth at the front, and smaller teeth towards the back. It had six teeth in each <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> of the upper jaw, and may have had 14 teeth in the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> and 19 in the <a href="dentary">dentary</a> of the lower jaw. Most of the neck vertebrae were compressed sideways, and bore a longitudinal crest or keel along the sides.

The family <a href="Elasmosauridae">Elasmosauridae</a> was based on the genus "Elasmosaurus", the first recognized member of this group of long-necked plesiosaurs. Elasmosaurids were well adapted for aquatic life, and used their flippers for swimming. Contrary to earlier depictions, their necks were not very flexible, and could not be held high above the water surface. It is unknown what their long necks were used for, but they may have had a function in feeding. Elasmosaurids probably ate small fish and marine <a href="invertebrates">invertebrates</a>, seizing them with their long teeth, and may have used <a href="gastroliths">gastroliths</a> (stomach stones) to help digest their food. "Elasmosaurus" is known from the <a href="Pierre%20Shale">Pierre Shale</a> formation, which represents marine deposits from the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a>.

Though the only known specimen of "Elasmosaurus" (specimen ANSP10081) is fragmentary and missing many elements, related <a href="elasmosaurids">elasmosaurids</a> show it would have had a compact, streamlined body, long, paddle-like limbs, a short tail, a proportionately small head, and an extremely long neck. The neck of "Elasmosaurus" is estimated at in length; thus, "Elasmosaurus" and its relative "<a href="Albertonectes">Albertonectes</a>" were some of the longest-necked animals ever to have lived, with the largest number of neck vertebrae of any known <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> animals. In spite of their many neck vertebrae, the necks of elasmosaurids were less than half as long as those of the longest-necked <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a>. In 1952 the American paleontologist <a href="Samuel%20Welles">Samuel Welles</a> estimated the body length to have been . In his 1869 description of "Elasmosaurus", the American paleontologist <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a> estimated the length of the animal by summing up vertebral lengths and estimations of missing parts, resulting in a total length of . The living animal would have been slightly larger due to <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> present between the vertebral bodies, and was estimated by Cope at roughly .

Like other elasmosaurids, "Elasmosaurus" would have had a slender, triangular skull. The snout was rounded and almost formed a semi-circle when viewed from above, and the <a href="premaxillae">premaxillae</a> (which form the front of the upper jaw) bore a low keel at the midline. It is uncertain how many teeth "Elasmosaurus" had, due to the fragmentary state of the fossils. It probably had six teeth in each premaxilla, and the teeth preserved there were formed like large fangs. The number of premaxillary teeth distinguished "Elasmosaurus" from primitive plesiosauroids and most other elasmosaurids, which usually had fewer. The two teeth at the front were smaller than the succeeding ones, and were located between the first two teeth in the <a href="dentaries">dentaries</a> of the lower jaws. The known teeth of the front part of the lower jaw were large fangs, and the teeth at the back of the jaws appear to have been smaller. The dentition of elasmosaurids was generally <a href="heterodont">heterodont</a> (irregular throughout the jaws), with the teeth becoming progressively smaller from front to back. The <a href="maxillae">maxillae</a> (largest tooth bearing bone of the upper jaw) of elasmosaurids usually contained 14teeth, whereas the dentaries (the main part of the lower jaws) usually contained 17 to 19. The teeth interlocked, and their <a href="tooth%20crowns">tooth crowns</a> were slender and rounded in cross-section. The <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a> (where the two halves of the lower jaw connected) was well <a href="ossified">ossified</a>, with no visible <a href="suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a>.

The pectoral and pelvic girdles of the <a href="holotype">holotype specimen</a> were noted as missing by 1906, but observations about these elements were since made based on the original descriptions and figures from the late 19thcentury. The <a href="shoulder%20blades">shoulder blades</a> (scapulae) were fused and met at the midline, bearing no trace of a median bar. The upper <a href="Process%20%28anatomy%29">processes</a> of the shoulder blades were very broad, and the <a href="Scapula%23Angles">"necks"</a> of the shoulder blades were long. The pectoral girdle had a long bar at the middle, a supposedly advanced feature thought to be absent from juvenile plesiosaurs. The <a href="ischium">ischia</a> (a pair of bones that formed part of the pelvis) were joined at the middle, so that a medial bar was present along the length of the pelvis, a feature usually not found in plesiosaurs. Like other elasmosaurids (and plesiosaurs in general), "Elasmosaurus" would have had large, paddle-like limbs with very long <a href="Digit%20%28anatomy%29">digits</a>. The paddles at the front (the pectoral paddles) were longer than those at the back (the pelvic paddles).

Unlike those of many other long-necked animals, the individual neck vertebrae were not particularly elongated; rather, the extreme neck length was achieved by a much increased number of vertebrae. "Elasmosaurus" differed from all other plesiosaurs by having 72 <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">neck</a> (or cervical) <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e; more may have been present but were later lost to erosion or after excavation. Only "Albertonectes" had more neck vertebrae, 75, and the two are the only plesiosaurs with a count higher than 70; more than 60 vertebrae is very <a href="derived%20feature">derived</a> (or "advanced") for plesiosaurs.

The <a href="atlas%20bone">atlas</a> and <a href="axis%20bone">axis bone</a> complex, consisting of the first two neck vertebrae and articulated with the back of the skull, was long, low, and horizontally rectangular in side-view. The centra, or "bodies", of these vertebrae were co-ossified in the holotype specimen, which indicates it was an adult. The neural arches of these vertebrae were very thin and rather high, which gave the neural canal (the opening through the middle of the vertebrae) a triangular outline when seen from the back. The lower part of the neural canal was narrow towards the back by the axis, where it was half the breadth of the centrum. It became broader towards the front, where it was almost the same breadth as the centrum of the atlas. The neural arches were also more robust there than in the axis, and the neural canal was higher. The neural spine was low and directed upwards and back. The centra of the atlas and axis were of equal length, and had a quadratic shape in side view. The surface (or facet) where the axis articulated with the next vertebra had an oval outline, and an excavation for the neural canal in the middle of its upper edge. A distinct keel ran along the lower middle of the atlas and axis vertebrae.

Most of the neck vertebrae were compressed sideways, especially at the middle of the neck. A crest (also termed ridge or keel) ran longitudinally along the side of the neck vertebrae (a feature typical of elasmosaurids), visible from the third to the fifty-fifth vertebrae, at the hind part of the neck. This crest was positioned at the middle of the centrum in the front vertebrae, and at the upper half of the centrum from the 19th vertebra and onwards. The crest would have served to anchor the musculature of the neck. The centra differed in shape depending on the position of the vertebrae in the neck; that of the third vertebra was about as long as it was broad, but the centra became longer than broad from the fourth vertebra and onwards. The centra became more elongated at the middle of the neck, but became shorter again at the back of the neck, with the length and breadth being about equal at the 61st vertebra, and those of the hindmost vertebrae being broader than long. The articular surfaces of the vertebrae in the front of the neck were broad oval, and moderately deepened, with rounded, thickened edges, with an excavation (or cavity) at the upper and lower sides. Further back in the front part of the neck, around the 25th vertebra, the lower edge of the articular facets became more concave, and the facet shaped like a quadrate with rounded edges. By the 63rd vertebra, the articular facet was also quadratic in shape with rounded edges, whereas the centra of the hindmost vertebrae had a broad oval outline.

The neural arches of the neck vertebrae were well fused to the centra, leaving no visible sutures, and the neural canal was narrow in the front vertebrae, becoming more prominently developed in the hind vertebrae, where it was as broad as high, and almost circular. The pre-and post-<a href="zygapophyses">zygapophyses</a> of the neck vertebrae, processes that articulated adjacent vertebrae so they fit together, were of equal length; the former reached entirely over the level of the centrum whereas the latter reached only with their back half. The neural spines of the neck vertebrae appear to have been low, and almost semi-circular by the 20th vertebra. The facets where the neck ribs articulated with the neck vertebrae were placed on the lower sides of the centra, but were only placed higher in the last three vertebrae, reaching around the middle of the sides. The neck ribs were semicircular to quadratic in side view, and were directed rather straight down. The bottom of each neck vertebrae had pairs of nutritive <a href="foramina">foramina</a> (openings) at the middle, separated by a ridge, which became progressively more prominent and thickened towards the back of the neck.

The vertebrae that transitioned between the neck and back (or dorsal) vertebrae in the <a href="pectoral%20region">pectoral region</a> of plesiosaurs, close to the front margin of the <a href="forelimb%20girdle">forelimb girdle</a>, are often termed pectoral vertebrae. "Elasmosaurus" had three pectoral vertebrae, which is a common number for elasmosaurids. The rib facets of the pectoral vertebrae were triangular in shape and situated on transverse processes, and the centra bore pairs of nutritive foramina in the middle of the lower sides. The back vertebrae had rib facets level with the neural canal, and the front and back part of the transverse processes here had distinct ridges on their margins. Here the rib facets where placed higher than the transverse processes, separating the two, and were oval to rectangular in outline. The pre-zygapophyses here were shorter than those in the neck and pectoral vertebrae, and only reached above the level of the centrum with the front third of their length. The post-zygapophyses reached over the level of the centrum with the back half of their length. Back vertebrae are not useful for distinguishing between elasmosaurids, since they are not diagnostic at the genus level.

"Elasmosaurus" had four <a href="sacral%20vertebrae">sacral vertebrae</a> (the fused vertebrae that form the sacrum connected to the pelvis), a number typical of elasmosaurids. The transverse processes here were very short, and the rib facets increased in size from the first to the fourth sacral vertebra. A ridge ran along the top of these vertebrae, and the lower sides of the centra were rounded, and bore pairs of nutritive foramina, separated by low ridges. The first tail (or caudal) vertebra could be distinguished by the preceding sacral vertebra by having smaller rib facets, and by being positioned in the lower half of the centrum. These vertebrae were almost circular in shape, and the first two bore a narrow keel in the middle of the upper side. The rib facets of the tail vertebrae were located on the lower side of the centra, and their oval shape became larger and broader from the third vertebra and onwards, but became smaller from the 14th vertebra. Here, the pre-zygapophyses also reached over the level of the centra for most of their length, while the post-zygapophyses reached over this level by half their length. The lower part of the centra were rounded from the first to the third tail vertebrae, but concave from the fourth to the 18th. The usual number of trail vertebrae in elasmosaurids is 30. Since the last tail-vertebrae of elasmosaurids were fused into a structure similar to the <a href="pygostyle">pygostyle</a> of birds, it is possible this supported a tail-fin, but the shape it would have had is unknown.

In the spring of 1867, the American army surgeon Theophilus Hunt Turner and the army scout William Comstock explored the rocks around <a href="Fort%20Wallace">Fort Wallace</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, where they were stationed during the construction of the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railway">Union Pacific Railway</a>. Approximately northeast of Fort Wallace, near <a href="McAllaster%2C%20Kansas">McAllaster</a>, Turner discovered the bones of a large fossil reptile in a ravine in the <a href="Pierre%20Shale">Pierre Shale</a> formation, and though he had no paleontological experience, he recognized the remains as belonging to an "extinct monster". In June, Turner gave three fossil vertebrae to the American scientist <a href="John%20LeConte">John LeConte</a>, a member of the railway survey, to take back east to be identified. In December, LeConte delivered some of the vertebrae to Cope at the <a href="Academy%20of%20Natural%20Sciences%20of%20Philadelphia">Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia</a> (ANSP, known since 2011 as the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University). Recognizing them as the remains of a plesiosaur, larger than any he had seen in Europe, Cope wrote to Turner asking him to deliver the rest of the specimen, at the ANSP's expense.

In December 1867 Turner and others from Fort Wallace returned to the site and recovered much of the vertebral column, as well as concretions that contained other bones; the material had a combined weight of . The fossils were dug or pried out of the relatively soft <a href="shale">shale</a> with picks and shovels, and loaded on a horse-drawn wagon and transported back to Fort Wallace. Cope sent instructions on how to pack the bones, which were thereafter sent in hay-padded crates on a military wagon east to the railroad, which had not yet reached the fort. The specimen arrived in Philadelphia by rail in March 1868, whereafter Cope examined it hurriedly; he reported on it at the March ANSP meeting, during which he named it "Elasmosaurus platyurus". The <a href="Generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic name</a> "Elasmosaurus" means "thin-plate reptile", in reference to the "plate" bones of the sternal and pelvic regions, and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "platyurus" means "flat-tailed", in reference to the compressed "tail" (actually the neck) and laminae of the vertebrae there.

Cope requested that Turner search for more parts of the "Elasmosaurus" specimen, and was sent more fossils during August or September 1868. The ANSP thanked Turner for his "very valuable gift" at their meeting in December 1868, and Turner visited the museum during spring, at a time when Cope was absent. Turner died unexpectedly at Fort Wallace on July27, 1869, without seeing the completion of the work he began, but Cope continued to write him, unaware of his death until 1870. The circumstances around Turner's discovery of the type specimen were not covered in Cope's report, and remained unknown until Turner's letters were published in 1987. "Elasmosaurus" was the first major fossil discovery in Kansas (and the largest from there at the time), and marked the beginning of a <a href="fossil%20collecting">fossil collecting</a> rush that sent thousands of fossils from Kansas to prominent museums on the American east coast. "Elasmosaurus" was one of few plesiosaurs known from the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> at the time, and the first recognized member of the long-necked family of plesiosaurs, the <a href="Elasmosauridae">Elasmosauridae</a>.

In 1869 Cope <a href="scientifically%20described">scientifically described</a> and figured "Elasmosaurus", and the <a href="Manuscript%20%28publishing%29%23Preprint">preprint</a> version of the manuscript contained a reconstruction of the skeleton which he had earlier presented during his report at an ANSP meeting in September 1868. The reconstruction showed "Elasmosaurus" with a short neck and a long tail, unlike other plesiosaurs, and Cope was also unsure whether it had hind limbs. At an ANSP meeting a year and a half later, in March 1870, the American paleontologist <a href="Joseph%20Leidy">Joseph Leidy</a> (Cope's mentor) noted that Cope's reconstruction of "Elasmosaurus" showed the skull at the wrong end of the vertebral column, at the end of the tail instead of the neck. Cope had apparently concluded that the tail vertebrae belonged to the neck, since the jaws had been found at that end of the skeleton, even though the opposite end terminated in the axis and atlas bones that are found in the neck. Leidy also concluded that "Elasmosaurus" was identical to "<a href="Discosaurus">Discosaurus</a>", a plesiosaur he had himself named in 1851.

To hide his mistake, Cope attempted to recall all copies of the preprint article, and printed a corrected version with a new skeletal reconstruction that placed the head on the neck (though it reversed the orientation of the individual vertebrae) and different wording in 1870. In a reply to Leidy, Cope claimed that he had been misled by the fact that Leidy had arranged the vertebrae of "<a href="Cimoliasaurus">Cimoliasaurus</a>" in the reverse order in his 1851 description of that genus, and pointed out that his reconstruction had been corrected. Cope also rejected the idea that "Elasmosaurus" and "Discosaurus" were identical, and noted that the latter and "Cimoliasaurus" did not have any distinguishing features. Though Cope had tried to destroy the preprints, one copy came to the attention of the American paleontologist <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, who made light of the mistake. This led to antagonism between Cope, who was embarrassed by the mistake, and Marsh, who brought up the mistake repeatedly for decades. Marsh returned to the issue during their controversy in the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>" in the 1890s (Marsh claimed he had pointed out the error to Cope immediately), when their dispute gained widespread public attention. The argument was part of the "<a href="Bone%20Wars">Bone Wars</a>" rivalry between the two, and is well known in the history of paleontology.

Because of Cope's reputation as a brilliant paleontologist, it has been questioned why he would make such an obvious anatomical error. It has been suggested that, as a unique specimen in 1868, the original "Elasmosaurus" may have been hard to interpret based on the knowledge available at the time. Also, Cope initially thought it consisted of two specimens of different animalsin an 1868 letter to LeConte, Cope had referred to the supposed "smaller specimen" as "Discosaurus carinatus". Cope was only in his late twenties and not formally trained in paleontology, and may have been influenced by Leidy's mistake of reversing the vertebral column of "Cimoliasaurus". In 2002 the American art historian Jane P. Davidson noted that the fact that other scientists early on had pointed out Leidy's error argues against this explanation, adding that Cope was not convinced he had made a mistake. Plesiosaur anatomy was sufficiently well known at the time that Cope should not have made the mistake, according to Davidson. Cope did little work on the specimen since his 1870 description, and it was kept in storage for nearly 30 years. It was only redescribed in detail in 2005 by the German paleontologist Sven Sachs.

Today, the incomplete holotype specimen, catalogued as ANSP 10081, is the only definite specimen of "Elasmosaurus". It was long exhibited, but is now stored in a cabinet with other assigned fragments. The specimen consists of the premaxillae, part of the hind-section of the right maxilla, two maxilla fragments with teeth, the front part of the dentaries, three more jaw fragments, two cranial fragments of indeterminable identity, 72 neck vertebrae, including the atlas and axis, 3pectoral vertebrae, 6back vertebrae, 4sacral vertebrae, 18 tail vertebrae, as well as rib fragments. In 2013 an incomplete neck vertebra centrum of the holotype that had been mentioned by Cope but thought to have been lost was rediscovered in storage by Sachs, and the neck vertebra count was revised from 71 to 72. In 1986 a three-dimensional reconstruction of the holotype skeleton was completed and is now displayed at the ANSP. This cast was later copied by the company <a href="Triebold%20Paleontology%20Incorporated">Triebold Paleontology Incorporated</a>, and replicas were provided to other museums. One of these measures about in length. 

Though Cope described and figured the pectoral and pelvic girdles of "Elasmosaurus" in 1869 and 1875, these elements were noted as missing from the collection by the American paleontologist <a href="Samuel%20Wendell%20Williston">Samuel Wendell Williston</a> in 1906. Cope had loaned these elements to the English sculptor <a href="Benjamin%20Waterhouse%20Hawkins">Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins</a> to help prepare them out of their surrounding concretions. At the time, Hawkins was working on a "<a href="Paleozoic%20Museum">Paleozoic Museum</a>" in New York's <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>, where a reconstruction of "Elasmosaurus" was to appear, an American equivalent to his life-sized <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20Dinosaurs">Crystal Palace Dinosaurs</a> in London. In May 1871 much of the exhibit material in Hawkins' workshop was destroyed by vandals (working for the New York politician <a href="William%20M.%20%26quot%3BBoss%26quot%3B%20Tweed">William M. "Boss" Tweed</a>) and their fragments buried; it is possible that the girdle elements of "Elasmosaurus" were at the workshop and were likewise destroyed. Nothing was subsequently mentioned about their loss by Hawkins or Cope. In 2018, Davidson and Everhart documented the events leading up to the disappearance of these fossils, and suggested that a photo and drawing of Waterhouse's workshop from 1869 appear to show concretions on the floor that may have been the unprepared girdles of "Elasmosaurus". They also noted that conceptual sketches of the Palaeozoic Museum show that the model "Elasmosaurus" was originally envisioned with a long "tail", though later updated with a long neck. Davidson and Everhart concluded that the girdle fossils were most likely destroyed in Hawkins' workshop. 
Fossils that may have belonged to the holotype were found by the American geologist <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Mudge">Benjamin Franklin Mudge</a> in 1871, but have probably been lost since. Additional plesiosaur fossils were recovered near the original locality in 1954, 1991, 1994, and 1998, including back vertebrae, ribs, <a href="gastralia">gastralia</a> (belly ribs), and <a href="gastroliths">gastroliths</a> (stomach stones). As none of these elements overlap with those of the holotype specimen, in 2005 the American paleontologist Michael J. Everhart concluded they belonged to the same individual, and that the parts had been separated before burial of the carcass. He also noted that a small stone wedged in the neural canal of one of the tail vertebrae of the holotype may be a gastrolith, based on its polished appearance. In 2007 Leslie Noè and Marcela Gómez-Pérez expressed doubt that the additional elements belonged to the type specimen, or even to "Elasmosaurus", due to lack of evidence. They explained that elements missing from the holotype may have been lost to weathering or simply not collected, and that parts may have been lost or damaged during transportation or preparation. Gastroliths may also not have been recognized as such during collection, since such stones were not reported from a plesiosaur until ten years after. 

In 2017 Sachs and Joachim Ladwig suggested that a fragmentary elasmosaurid skeleton from the upper Campanian of <a href="Kronsmoor">Kronsmoor</a> in <a href="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>, Germany, and housed in the <a href="Naturkunde-Museum%20Bielefeld">Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld</a>, may have belonged to "Elasmosaurus". Additional parts of the same skeleton are housed at the Institute for Geology of the <a href="University%20of%20Hamburg">University of Hamburg</a>, as well as in private collections. Combined, the specimen consists of neck, back and tail vertebrae, <a href="phalanges">phalanges</a>, a tooth, limb elements, 110 gastroliths, and unidentifiable fragments.

Over the subsequent years, a number of other "Elasmosaurus" species were described by Cope, Williston, and other authors. However, none of these species are still definitely referable to the genus "Elasmosaurus" today, and most of them either have been moved to genera of their own or are considered dubious names, "<a href="nomina%20dubia">nomina dubia</a>"that is, with no distinguishing features, and therefore of questionable validity.

Accompanying his 1869 description of "E. platyurus", Cope named another species of "Elasmosaurus", "E.orientalis", based on two dorsal vertebrae from New Jersey. He distinguished "E.orientalis" from "E.platyurus" by the more strongly developed processes known as parapophyses on the vertebrae, in which he considered it to approach closer to "Cimoliasaurus"; however, he still assigned it to "Elasmosaurus" on account of its large size and angled sides. The first of these vertebrae was used as a doorstop in a <a href="tailor">tailor</a>'s shop, whereas the other was found in a pit by Samuel Lockwood, a <a href="superintendent%20%28education%29">superintendent</a>. Cope gave the name "orientalis" to the new species, on account of it possibly having a more easterly distribution than "E.platyurus". Leidy subsequently moved "E.orientalis" to the now dubious genus "Discosaurus" in the following year. In 1952 Welles considered the species a "nomen dubium", given how fragmentary it was.

In 1869 Cope also published an article about the fossil reptiles of New Jersey, wherein he described "E.orientalis" as an animal with a "long neck". Yet, in an accompanying illustration Cope showed a short-necked "Elasmosaurus" confronting a "<a href="Dryptosaurus">Dryptosaurus</a>" (then "Laelaps"), with a plesiosaur-like "<a href="Mosasaurus">Mosasaurus</a>" and other animals in the background. According to Davidson, it is uncertain which species of "Elasmosaurus" is depicted, but if it is "E.orientalis", the short neck contradicts Cope's own text, and if "E.platyurus", he showed the animal with a short neck after acknowledging this was incorrect. Davidson has suggested that even though Leidy had pointed out Cope's error in 1868, Cope may not have accepted this. In an 1870 reply to Leidy, Cope himself stated that the generic placement of "E.orientalis" was in doubt, and that he had illustrated it with a short neck due to believing this was the condition of "Cimoliasaurus". If more remains showed "E.orientalis" to have had a long neck like "Elasmosaurus", he stated the image may instead represent "Cimoliasaurus" better.

In the same 1869 publication wherein he named "E. platyurus" and "E.orientalis", Cope assigned an additional species, "E.constrictus", based on a partial centrum from a neck vertebra found in the <a href="Turonian">Turonian</a>-aged <a href="clay">clay</a> deposits at <a href="Steyning">Steyning</a>, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, in the United Kingdom. It was described by the British paleontologist <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> as "<a href="Plesiosaurus">Plesiosaurus</a> constrictus" in 1850; Owen named the species after the extremely narrow breadth of the vertebra between the pleurapophyses, or the processes that articulate between the ribs. He considered this to be partially an artifact of preservation, but could not understand how the compression only affected the central portion and not the articular ends of the centrum. Cope recognized this as a natural condition, and considered "constrictus" to be "a species of "Elasmosaurus" or an ally". In 1962 Welles considered "P.constrictus" to be a "nomen dubium", given its fragmentary nature. Per Ove Persson retained it as valid in 1963, noting the longitudinal ridge on the sides of the centra as an elasmosaurid trait. In 1995 Nathalie Bardet and <a href="Pascal%20Godefroit">Pascal Godefroit</a> also recognized it as an elasmosaurid, albeit indeterminate.
Cope discovered another elasmosaurid skeleton in 1876. He named it as a new species, "E.serpentinus", in 1877, and differentiated it by the lack of compression in the rear neck vertebrae, the presence of few sessile ribs among the first few dorsals, and the presence of "weak angles" below the front tail vertebrae. Cope had also discovered another large skeleton that bore great resemblance to the known remains of "E.orientalis" from the black shale of the "Cretaceous bed No.4"; he excavated it with the help of George B. Cledenning and Capt. Nicholas Buesen. In 1943 Welles removed "E.serpentinus" from "Elasmosaurus", and placed it in a new genus, "Hydralmosaurus". Subsequently, all "Hydralmosaurus" specimens were moved to "<a href="Styxosaurus">Styxosaurus</a>" in 2016, rendering the former a "nomen dubium". Williston published a figure of another "E. serpentinus" specimen in 1914; <a href="Elmer%20S.%20Riggs">Elmer Riggs</a> formally described it in 1939. Welles moved this specimen to the new genus and species "Alzadasaurus riggsi" in 1943. <a href="Kenneth%20Carpenter">Kenneth Carpenter</a> reassigned it to "<a href="Thalassomedon%20haningtoni">Thalassomedon haningtoni</a>" in 1999; Sachs, Johan Lindgren, and Benjamin Kear noted that the remains represented a juvenile and were significantly distorted, and preferred to retain it as a "nomen dubium" in 2016.

Subsequently, a series of 19 neck and back vertebrae from the <a href="Big%20Bend%20Dam">Big Bend</a> region of the Missouripart of the Pierre Shale formationwere found by John H. Charles. Cope, upon receiving the bones at the Academy of Natural Sciences, considered them yet another species of "Elasmosaurus". The vertebrae were, according to Cope, the shortest among members of the genus (approaching "Cimoliasaurus" in this condition), but he still considered them as belonging to "Elasmosaurus" due to their compressed form. He named it "E.intermedius" in 1894. However, in his 1906 revision of North American plesiosaurs, Williston regarded the vertebrae as "all more or less mutilated", and found no distinct differences between the remains of "E.intermedius" and "E.platyurus". In 1952 Welles opined that, if "E.intermedius" was valid, "it must be referred to a pliosaurian genus"; however, he proceeded to label it a "nomen dubium" in 1962. Three shorter vertebrae found alongside "E.intermedius", assigned by Cope to the new genus and species "Embaphias circulosus", were also considered by Welles to be a "nomen dubium" in 1962.

Williston named a number of other new "Elasmosaurus" species in his 1906 revision. In 1874 he and Mudge discovered a specimen in Plum Creek, Kansas. While he initially assigned it in 1890 to a new species of "Cimoliasaurus", "C.snowii", he subsequently recognized the elasmosaurid nature of its <a href="humerus">humerus</a> and <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>s. Thus, he renamed the species "E.snowii". A second specimen, discovered by Elias West in 1890, was also assigned by him to "E.snowii". In 1943 Welles moved "E.snowii" to its own genus, "Styxosaurus", where the species has remained. However, the West specimen was assigned to "Thalassiosaurus ischiadicus" (see below) by Welles in 1952; Carpenter returned it to "S.snowii" in 1999. Williston also reassigned the species "E.ischiadicus" from the genus "<a href="Polycotylus">Polycotylus</a>", where he had initially placed it when he named it in 1903. The type remains were discovered by him in the same 1874 expedition with Mudge. Williston referred another specimen discovered by Mudge and H.A. Brous in 1876. In 1943 both specimens were referred to the new genus "Thalassiosaurus" by Welles, who then assigned the latter to the new genus and species "Alzadasaurus kansasensis" in 1952. Glenn Storrs considered both to be indeterminate elasmosaurids in 1999; in the same year, Carpenter assigned both to "Styxosaurus snowii".

An elasmosaurid specimen was found by Handel Martin in <a href="Logan%20County%2C%20Kansas">Logan County, Kansas</a> in 1889. Williston named this as a new species, "E.(?)marshii". He bore reservations about its referral to the genus, and he recognized that it possibly pertained to another genus. In 1943 Welles moved "E.(?)marshii" to a genus of its own, "Thalassonomosaurus"; however, Carpenter sunk "T.marshii" into "Styxosaurus snowii" in 1999. Another species, "E.nobilis", was named by Williston from very large remains discovered by Mudge in 1874 in <a href="Jewell%20County%2C%20Kansas">Jewell County, Kansas</a>. Welles named "E.nobilis" as a species of "Thalassonomosaurus", "T.nobilis", in 1943, but it too was considered to be part of "S.snowii" by Carpenter. Finally, two exceptionally large dorsal vertebrae collected by <a href="Charles%20Hazelius%20Sternberg">Charles Sternberg</a> in 1895 were named "E.sternbergii" by Williston, but were considered indeterminate by Storrs. Williston mentioned three additional "Elasmosaurus" species, which he would figure and describe at a later date. He again made reference to a new species of "Elasmosaurus", from Kansas, in 1908.

Several <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n species, based on poorly preserved vertebral remains, were referred to "Elasmosaurus" by N.N. Bogolubov in 1911. One was "E.helmerseni", which was first described by W.Kiprijanoff in 1882 from Maloje Serdoba, <a href="Saratov">Saratov</a>, as "Plesiosaurus helmerseni". Some material from <a href="Scania">Scania</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, was referred to "helmerseni" in 1885 by H.Schröder. Vertebral and limb remains from <a href="Kursk">Kursk</a> initially referred by Kiprijanoff to "P.helmerseni" were also moved by Bogolubov to the new species "E.kurskensis", which he considered to be "identical with "Elasmosaurus" or related to it". He also named "E.orskensis", based on "very large" neck and tail vertebra remains from Konopljanka, <a href="Orenburg">Orenburg</a>; and "E.serdobensis", based on a single neck vertebra from Maloje Serdoba. However, the validity of all of these species has been questioned. Welles considered "E.kurskensis" as an indeterminate plesiosaur in 1962. Persson noted in a 1959 review of the Swedish ""E."helmerseni" material that, while the species was probably closely related to "Elasmosaurus" proper, it was too fragmentary for this hypothesis to be assessed; he later remarked in 1963 that, regarding the latter three species, "their generic and specific definition is questionable", although he declined to specifically label them as invalid on account of not having seen the fossil material. Similarly, in 1999, Evgeniy Pervushov, Maxim Arkhangelsky, and A.V. Ivanov considered "E.helmerseni" to be an indeterminate elasmosaurid. In 2000 Storrs, Archangelsky, and Vladimir Efimov concurred with Welles on "E.kurskensis", and labelled "E.orskensis" and "E.serdobensis" as indeterminate elasmosaurids.

Two additional Russian species were described by subsequent authors. A.N. Riabinin described a single phalanx from a flipper in 1915 as "E.(?)sachalinensis"; the species was named after the island of <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a>, where N.N. Tikhonovich found it in 1909. However, this specimen cannot be identified more specifically than an indeterminate elasmosaurid, which was followed by Persson and Pervushov and colleagues. Storrs, Arkhangelsky, and Efimov were less specific, labelling it as an indeterminate plesiosaur; this classification was followed by Alexander Averianov and V.K. Popov in 2005. Then, in 1916, P.A. Pravoslavlev named "E.amalitskii" from the <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Don River</a> region, based on a specimen containing vertebrae, limb girdles, and limb bones. Persson considered it a valid species, and a relatively large member of the elasmosaurids; however, like "E.(?)sachalinensis", Pervushov and colleagues considered "E.amalitskii" an indeterminate elasmosaurid.

In a 1918 review of the geographic distribution and evolution of "Elasmosaurus", Pravoslavlev provisionally referred three other previously named species to "Elasmosaurus"; his taxonomic opinions have not been widely followed. One of these was "E.chilensis", based on the <a href="Chile">Chile</a>an "Plesiosaurus chilensis" named from a single tail vertebra by <a href="Claude%20Gay">Claude Gay</a> in 1848. Wilhelm Deecke moved "chilensis" to "<a href="Pliosaurus">Pliosaurus</a>" in 1895, a classification which was acknowledged by Pravoslavlev. <a href="Edwin%20H.%20Colbert">Edwin Colbert</a> later assigned the type vertebra in 1949 to a <a href="pliosauroidea">pliosauroid</a>, and also assigned other referred remains to indeterminate elasmosauroids; the type vertebra was recognized as potentially belonging to "<a href="Aristonectes">Aristonectes parvidens</a>" by José O'Gorman and colleagues in 2013. Another was "E.haasti", originally "<a href="Mauisaurus">Mauisaurus haasti</a>", named by James Hector in 1874 based on remains found in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Although its validity was supported for a considerable time, "M.haasti" is regarded as a "nomen dubium" as of 2017. Pravoslavlev recognized another species from New Zealand, "E.hoodii", named by Owen in 1870 as "Plesiosaurus hoodii" based on a neck vertebra. Welles recognized it as a "nomen dubium" in 1962; <a href="Joan%20Wiffen">Joan Wiffen</a> and William Moisley concurred in a 1986 review of New Zealand plesiosaurs.

In 1949 Welles named a new species of "Elasmosaurus", "E.morgani". It was named from a well-preserved skeleton found in <a href="Dallas%20County%2C%20Texas">Dallas County</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. However, part of the specimen was accidentally thrown out during the relocation of the <a href="Southern%20Methodist%20University">Southern Methodist University</a>'s paleontological collections. Welles recognized "E.morgani"s similarity to "E.platyurus" in its shoulder girdle, but maintained it as a separate species due to its shorter neck and more robust rear neck vertebrae. In 1997 Carpenter reconsidered the differences between the two species, and found them sufficient to place "E.morgani" in its own genus, which he named "<a href="Libonectes">Libonectes</a>". Despite its reassignment and the loss of its material, "L.morgani" is often considered an archetypal elasmosaurid. Data based on these lost elements were unquestionably accepted in subsequent <a href="phylogeny">phylogenetic analyses</a>, until a redescription of the surviving elements was published by Sachs and Benjamin Kear in 2015.

Persson referred another species to "Elasmosaurus" alongside his 1959 description of ""E."helmerseni" remains from Sweden, namely "E.(?)gigas". It was based on Schröder's "Pliosaurus(?) gigas", named in 1885 from two dorsals; one was found in <a href="Prussia%20%28region%29">Prussia</a>, the other in Scania. While they were incomplete, Persson recognized that their proportions and the shape of their articular ends differed greatly from pliosauroids, and instead agreed well with elasmosaurids. Given that, at the time of Persson's writing, "there [was] nothing to contradict that they are nearest akin to "Elasmosaurus"", he referred them to "Elasmosaurus" "with hesitation". Theodor Wagner had previously referred "gigas" to "Plesiosaurus" in 1914. As of 2013, this questionable attribution remains unchanged. Another species from Russia, "E.antiquus", was named by Dubeikovskii and Ochev in 1967 from the Kamsko-Vyatsky <a href="phosphorite">phosphorite</a> quarry, but Pervushov and colleagues in 1999, followed by Storrs and colleagues in 2000, reinterpreted it as an indeterminate elasmosaurid.

Though Cope had originally recognized "Elasmosaurus" as a plesiosaur, in an 1869 paper he placed it, with "Cimoliasaurus" and "<a href="Crymocetus">Crymocetus</a>", in a new order of <a href="sauropterygian">sauropterygian</a> reptiles. He named the group Streptosauria, or "reversed lizards", due to the orientation of their individual vertebrae supposedly being reversed compared to what is seen in other vertebrate animals. He subsequently abandoned this idea in his 1869 description of "Elasmosaurus", where he stated he had based it on Leidy's erroneous interpretation of "Cimoliasaurus". In this paper, he also named the new family Elasmosauridae, containing "Elasmosaurus" and "Cimoliasaurus", without comment. Within this family, he considered the former to be distinguished by a longer neck with compressed vertebrae, and the latter by a shorter neck with square, depressed vertebrae.

In subsequent years, Elasmosauridae came to be one of three groups in which plesiosaurs were classified, the others being the <a href="Pliosauridae">Pliosauridae</a> and <a href="Plesiosauridae">Plesiosauridae</a> (sometimes merged into one group). <a href="Charles%20William%20Andrews">Charles Andrews</a> elaborated on differences between elasmosaurids and pliosaurids in 1910 and 1913. He characterized elasmosaurids by their long necks and small heads, as well as by their rigid and well-developed scapulae (but atrophied or absent clavicles and interclavicles) for forelimb-driven locomotion. Meanwhile, pliosaurids had short necks but large heads, and used hindlimb-driven locomotion. Although the placement of "Elasmosaurus" in the Elasmosauridae remained uncontroversial, opinions on the relationships of the family became variable over subsequent decades. Williston created a revised taxonomy of plesiosaurs in 1925.

In 1940 Theodore White published a hypothesis on the interrelationships between different plesiosaurian families. He considered Elasmosauridae to be closest to the Pliosauridae, noting their relatively narrow coracoids as well as their lack of interclavicles or clavicles. His diagnosis of the Elasmosauridae also noted the moderate length of the skull (i.e., a mesocephalic skull); the neck ribs having one or two heads; the scapula and coracoid contacting at the midline; the blunted rear outer angle of the coracoid; and the pair of openings (fenestrae) in the scapula–coracoid complex being separated by a narrower bar of bone compared to pliosaurids. The cited variability in the number of heads on the neck ribs arises from his inclusion of "<a href="Simolestes">Simolestes</a>" to the Elasmosauridae, since the characteristics of "both the skull and shoulder girdle compare more favorably with "Elasmosaurus" than with "Pliosaurus" or "Peloneustes"." He considered "Simolestes" a possible ancestor of "Elasmosaurus". <a href="Oskar%20Kuhn">Oskar Kuhn</a> adopted a similar classification in 1961.

Welles took issue with White's classification in his 1943 revision of plesiosaurs, noting that White's characteristics are influenced by both preservation and <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a>. He divided plesiosaurs into two superfamilies, the <a href="Plesiosauroidea">Plesiosauroidea</a> and Pliosauroidea, based on neck length, head size, ischium length, and the slenderness of the humerus and femur (the propodialia). Each superfamily was further subdivided by the number of heads on the ribs, and the proportions of the epipodialia. Thus, elasmosaurids had long necks, small heads, short ischia, stocky propodialia, single-headed ribs, and short epipodialia. Pierre deSaint-Seine in 1955 and <a href="Alfred%20Romer">Alfred Romer</a> in 1956 both adopted Welles' classification. In 1962 Welles further subdivided elasmosaurids based on whether they possessed pelvic bars formed from the fusion of the ischia, with "Elasmosaurus" and "<a href="Brancasaurus">Brancasaurus</a>" being united in the subfamily Elasmosaurinae by their sharing of completely closed pelvic bars. 
Carpenter's 1997 phylogenetic analysis of plesiosaurs challenged the traditional subdivision of plesiosaurs based on neck length. While polycotylids had previously been part of the Pliosauroidea, Carpenter moved polycotylids to become the <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> of the elasmosaurids based on similarities, thus implying that polycotylids and pliosauroids evolved their short necks independently. The content of Elasmosauridae also received greater scrutiny. Since its initial assignment to the Elasmosauridae, the relationships of "Brancasaurus" had been considered well supported, and it was recovered by O'Keefe's 2004 analysis and Franziska Großmann's 2007 analysis. However, Ketchum and Benson's analysis instead included it in the Leptocleidia, and its inclusion in that group has remained consistent in subsequent analyses. Their analysis also moved "Muraenosaurus" to the Cryptoclididae, and "<a href="Microcleidus">Microcleidus</a>" and "Occitanosaurus" to the Plesiosauridae; Benson and Druckenmiller isolated the latter two in the group <a href="Microcleididae">Microcleididae</a> in 2014, and considered "Occitanosaurus" a species of "Microcleidus". These genera had all previously been considered to be elasmosaurids by Carpenter, Großmann, and other researchers.

Within the Elasmosauridae, "Elasmosaurus" itself has been considered a "wildcard taxon" with highly variable relationships. Carpenter's 1999 analysis suggested that "Elasmosaurus" was more <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (i.e. less specialized) than other elasmosaurids with the exception of "Libonectes". In 2005 Sachs suggested that "Elasmosaurus" was closely related to "Styxosaurus", and in 2008 Druckenmiller and Russell placed it as part of a <a href="polytomy">polytomy</a> with two groups, one containing "Libonectes" and "<a href="Terminonatator">Terminonatator</a>", the other containing "<a href="Callawayasaurus">Callawayasaurus</a>" and "<a href="Hydrotherosaurus">Hydrotherosaurus</a>". Ketchum and Benson's 2010 analysis included "Elasmosaurus" in the former group. Benson and Druckenmiller's 2013 analysis (below, left) further removed "Terminonatator" from this group and placed it as one step more derived. In Rodrigo Otero's 2016 analysis based on a modification of the same dataset (below, right), "Elamosaurus" was the closest relative of "Albertonectes", forming the <a href="Styxosaurinae">Styxosaurinae</a> with "Styxosaurus" and "Terminonatator". Danielle Serratos, Druckenmiller, and Benson could not resolve the position of "Elasmosaurus" in 2017, but they noted that Styxosaurinae would be a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of Elasmosaurinae if "Elasmosaurus" did fall within the group.

Topology A: Benson "et al." (2013)

Topology B: Otero (2016)

Elasmosaurids were fully adapted to life in the ocean, with streamlined bodies and long paddles that indicate they were active swimmers. The unusual body structure of elasmosaurids would have limited the speed in which they could swim, and their paddles may have moved in a manner similar to the movement of bird wings, but could not twist and were thus held rigidly. Plesiosaurs were likely able to maintain a constant and high body temperature (<a href="homeothermy">homeothermy</a>), allowing for sustained swimming. 

A 2015 study concluded that locomotion was mostly done by the fore-flippers while the hind-flippers functioned in maneuverability and stability, while a 2017 study concluded that the hind-flippers of plesiosaurs produced 60% more thrust and had 40% more efficiency when moving in harmony with the fore-flippers. The paddles of plesiosaurs were so rigid and specialized for swimming that they could not have come on land to lay eggs like <a href="sea%20turtle">sea turtle</a>s. Therefore, they probably gave live-birth (<a href="viviparity">viviparity</a>) to their young like <a href="sea%20snake">sea snake</a>s. Evidence for live-birth in plesiosaurs is provided by the fossil of an adult "Polycotylus" with a single fetus inside.

Cope, in 1869, compared the build and habits of "Elasmosaurus" with those of a snake. Although he suggested that the vertebral column of the trunk did not allow for much vertical movement due to the elongated neural spines which nearly form a continuous line with little space between adjacent vertebrae, he envisaged the neck and tail to have been much more flexible: "The snake-like head was raised high in the air, or depressed at the will of the animal, now arched swan-like preparatory to a plunge after a fish, now stretched in repose on the water or deflexed in exploring the depths below".

Although followed by many common media depictions, more recent research showed that "Elasmosaurus" was incapable of raising anything more than its head above the water. The weight of its long neck placed the center of gravity behind the front flippers. Thus, "Elasmosaurus" could only have raised its head and neck above the water when in shallow water, where it could rest its body on the bottom. Also, the weight of the neck, the limited musculature, and the limited movement between the vertebrae would have prevented "Elasmosaurus" from raising its head and neck very high. The head and shoulders of the "Elasmosaurus" probably acted as a rudder. If the animal moved the anterior part of the body in a certain direction, it would cause the rest of the body to move in that direction. Thus, "Elasmosaurus" would have been unable to swim in one direction while moving its head and neck either horizontally or vertically in a different direction.

One study found that the necks of elasmosaurids were capable of 75–177˚ of ventral movement, 87–155° of dorsal movement, and 94–176° of lateral movement, depending on the amount of tissue between the vertebrae, which probably increased in rigidness towards the back of the neck. The researchers concluded that lateral and vertical arches and shallow S-shaped curves were feasible in contrast to the "<a href="swan">swan</a>-like" S-shape neck postures that required more than 360° of vertical flexion.

The exact function of the neck of elasmosaurids is unknown, though it may have been important for hunting. It has also been suggested that the long necks of plesiosaurs served as a snorkel and allowed them to breathe air while the body remained underwater. This is disputed as there would be large <a href="hydrostatic">hydrostatic</a> pressure differences, particularly for the extremely long-necked elasmosaurids. The neck anatomy of elasmosaurids was capable of making a gentle slope to allow them to breathe at the surface but would have required them to engage in energy-expensive swimming at the sub-surface. In addition, the longer neck would also have increased <a href="dead%20space%20%28physiology%29">dead space</a>, and the animals may have required larger lungs. The neck could have had other vulnerabilities, for example being a target for predators.

In 1869 Cope noted that scales and teeth of six species of fish had been discovered directly beneath the vertebrae of the "Elasmosaurus" holotype, and theorized that these fish would have had formed the diet of the animal. From these remains, Cope named a new species of <a href="barracuda">barracuda</a>, "Sphyraena carinata".

The flexion ranges of "Elasmosaurus" necks would have allowed the animal to employ a number of hunting methods including "<a href="benthic">benthic</a> grazing", which would have involved swimming close to the bottom and using the head and neck to dig for prey on the sea floor. Elasmosaurids may also have been active hunters in the <a href="pelagic%20zone">pelagic zone</a>, retracting their necks to launch a strike or using side-swipe motions to stun or kill prey with their laterally projected teeth (like <a href="sawshark">sawshark</a>s).

It is possible that "Elasmosaurus" and its kin stalked schools of fish, concealing themselves below and moving the head slowly up as they approached. The eyes of the animal were located at the top of the head and allowed them to see directly upward. This <a href="stereoscopic%20vision">stereoscopic vision</a> would have helped it to find small prey. Hunting from below would also have been possible, with prey silhouetted in the sunlight while concealed in the dark waters below. Elasmosaurids probably ate small <a href="bony%20fish">bony fish</a> and <a href="marine%20invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a>, as their small, non-<a href="Cranial%20kinesis">kinetic</a> skulls would have limited the size of the prey they could eat. Also, with their long, slender teeth adapted for seizing prey and not tearing, elasmosaurids most certainly swallowed their prey whole.

Although elasmosaurids are commonly found with several gastroliths, "Elamosaurus" has only been found uncontroversially with a pebble lodged in the neural arch of one of its hindmost tail-vertebrae. A specimen of the closely related "Styxosaurus" contained fragmented fish bones and stones in the abdominal region behind the pectoral girdle. The fish remains were identified as "<a href="Enchodus">Enchodus</a>" and other <a href="clupeomorph">clupeomorph</a> fish. The stones match rock from away from where the specimen was found. Several different functions have been proposed for gastroliths, including aiding in digestion, mixing food content, mineral supplementation, and storage and buoyancy control. Elasmosaurids themselves also appear to have been fed upon. A humerus of an unidentified subadult elasmosaurid was found with bite marks matching the teeth of the shark "<a href="Cretoxyrhina">Cretoxyrhina</a>", while a crushed "<a href="Woolungasaurus">Woolungasaurus</a>" skull has tooth-marks matched to the pliosaur "<a href="Kronosaurus">Kronosaurus</a>".

"Elasmosaurus" is known from the Sharon Springs Member of the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a>-age <a href="Upper%20Cretaceous">Upper Cretaceous</a> Pierre Shale formation of western Kansas, which dates to about 80.5million years ago. The Pierre Shale represents a period of marine deposition from the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a>, a shallow continental sea that submerged much of central North America during the Cretaceous. At its largest, the Western Interior Seaway stretched from <a href="the%20Rockies">the Rockies</a> east to the <a href="Appalachians">Appalachians</a>, some wide. At its deepest, it may have been only deep, shallow in terms of seas. Two great continental watersheds drained into it from east and west, diluting its waters and bringing resources in eroded <a href="silt">silt</a> that formed shifting <a href="river%20delta">river delta</a> systems along its low-lying coasts. There was little <a href="sediment">sediment</a>ation on the eastern margin of the Seaway; the western margin accumulated a thick pile of sediments eroded from the western land mass. The western shore was thus highly variable, depending on variations in <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> and sediment supply.

While the soft, muddy sea floor probably received very little sunlight, it teemed with life due to steady rains of organic debris from plankton and other organisms farther up the water column. The bottom was dominated by large "<a href="Inoceramus">Inoceramus</a>" clams, which were covered with <a href="oyster">oyster</a>s; there was little biodiversity. Clam shells would have accumulated over the centuries in layers under the sea floor's surface, and would have provided shelter for small fish. Other invertebrates known to have lived in this sea include various species of <a href="rudist">rudist</a>s, <a href="crinoid">crinoid</a>s and <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s (including squids and <a href="ammonites">ammonites</a>).

Large fish known to have inhabited the sea include the bony fishes "<a href="Pachyrhizodus">Pachyrhizodus</a>", "Enchodus", "<a href="Cimolichthys">Cimolichthys</a>", "<a href="Saurocephalus">Saurocephalus</a>", "<a href="Saurodon">Saurodon</a>", "<a href="Gillicus">Gillicus</a>", "<a href="Ichthyodectes">Ichthyodectes</a>", "<a href="Xiphactinus">Xiphactinus</a>", "<a href="Protosphyraena">Protosphyraena</a>" and "<a href="Martinichthys">Martinichthys</a>"; and the sharks "Cretoxyrhina", "<a href="Cretolamna">Cretolamna</a>", "<a href="Scapanorhynchus">Scapanorhynchus</a>", "<a href="Pseudocorax">Pseudocorax</a>" and "<a href="Squalicorax">Squalicorax</a>". In addition to "Elasmosaurus", other marine reptiles present include fellow plesiosaurs "Libonectes", "Styxosaurus", "Thalassomedon", "Terminonatator", "Polycotylus", "<a href="Brachauchenius">Brachauchenius</a>", "<a href="Dolichorhynchops">Dolichorhynchops</a>" and "<a href="Trinacromerum">Trinacromerum</a>"; the <a href="mosasaur">mosasaur</a>s "Mosasaurus", "<a href="Halisaurus">Halisaurus</a>", "<a href="Prognathodon">Prognathodon</a>", "<a href="Tylosaurus">Tylosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ectenosaurus">Ectenosaurus</a>", "<a href="Globidens">Globidens</a>", "<a href="Clidastes">Clidastes</a>", "<a href="Platecarpus">Platecarpus</a>" and "<a href="Plioplatecarpus">Plioplatecarpus</a>"; and the sea turtles "<a href="Archelon">Archelon</a>", "<a href="Protostega">Protostega</a>", "<a href="Porthochelys">Porthochelys</a>" and "<a href="Toxochelys">Toxochelys</a>". The flightless aquatic bird "<a href="Hesperornis">Hesperornis</a>" also made its home there.

Nafaanra

Nafaanra (sometimes written Nafaara, pronounced ) is a <a href="Senufo%20languages">Senufo</a> language spoken in northwest <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, along the border with <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, east of <a href="Bondoukou">Bondoukou</a>. It is spoken by approximately 61,000 people. Its speakers call themselves <a href="Nafana%20people">Nafana</a>, but others call them Banda or Mfantera. Like other Senufo languages, Nafaanra is a <a href="tone%20language">tonal</a> language. It is somewhat of an outlier in the Senufo language group, with the geographically-closest relatives, the Southern Senufo <a href="Tagwana%E2%80%93Djimini%20languages">Tagwana–Djimini languages</a>, approximately to the west, on the other side of <a href="Como%C3%A9%20National%20Park">Comoé National Park</a>.

The basic <a href="word%20order">word order</a> is <a href="subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb">subject–object–verb</a>, like <a href="Latin%20grammar">Latin</a> and <a href="Japanese%20grammar">Japanese</a>. Like other <a href="Niger%E2%80%93Congo%20languages">Niger–Congo languages</a>, it has a <a href="noun%20class">noun class</a> system, with <a href="noun">noun</a>s classified according to five different classes, which also affects <a href="pronoun">pronoun</a>s, <a href="adjective">adjective</a>s and <a href="copula%20%28linguistics%29">copulas</a>. The <a href="phonology">phonology</a> features a distinction between the length of vowels and whether they are <a href="oral%20vowel">oral</a> or <a href="nasal%20vowel">nasal</a> (as in <a href="French%20phonology">French</a> or <a href="Portuguese%20phonology">Portuguese</a>). There are also three distinct <a href="tonal%20language">tones</a>, a feature shared with the other Senufo languages. Nafaanra grammar features both <a href="Grammatical%20tense">tense</a> and <a href="grammatical%20aspect">aspect</a> which are marked with <a href="grammatical%20particle">particles</a>. Numbers are mainly formed by adding cardinal numbers to the number 5 and by multiplying the numbers 10, 20 and 100.

Nafaanra is bordered by <a href="Kulango%20languages">Kulango languages</a> to the west, while <a href="Deg%20%28language%29">Deg</a> (a <a href="Gur%20languages">Gur language</a>) and <a href="Gonja%20language">Gonja</a> (<a href="Kwa%20languages">Kwa</a>) are found to the north and east. The closest eastern neighbour is the <a href="Mande%20languages">Mande language</a> <a href="Ligbi%20language">Ligbi</a>, whose speakers are also called "Banda") which, like Nafaanra, is an outlier to its own family. Southeast and south of Nafaanra and Ligbi, the <a href="Akan%20language">Akan language</a> <a href="Abron%20language">Abron</a> (also Bron or Brong) is spoken.

The <a href="Nafana%20people">Nafana people</a> live in the north-west corner of the <a href="Brong-Ahafo%20Region">Brong-Ahafo Region</a> of Ghana, concentrated mainly in <a href="Sampa%2C%20Ghana">Sampa</a> (capital of the Jaman North district) and <a href="Banda%2C%20Ghana">Banda</a>. There are two dialectal variants of Nafaanra: Pantera of Banda, and Fantera of Sampa. Bendor-Samuel gives a 79% <a href="cognate">cognate</a> relationship on the <a href="Swadesh%20list">Swadesh list</a> between the two dialects, meaning that they have many basic words in common. The Banda dialect is considered central. The terms "Fantera" and "Pantera" come from other peoples and are considered pejorative by the Nafana.

The Nafana people say that they come from a village called Kakala in Ivory Coast. Their oral history says that some of their people are still there, and if they go back they will not be allowed to leave again. They arrived in the Banda area after the Ligbi people, who came from <a href="Begho">Begho</a> (Bigu, Bighu) to the area in the early 17th century.

Many Nafana are bilingual in <a href="Twi%20language">Twi</a>, the regional <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>, to some extent. According to <a href="SIL%20International">SIL</a>, 50% of the people are able to "satisfy routine social demands and limited requirements in other domains", while 20% are able to speak Twi "with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and occupational topics". The remaining 30% are either able to maintain only very simple face-to-face conversations on familiar topics (15%) or unable to speak Twi at all (15%). 15–25% of the Nafana people are <a href="literate">literate</a> in Twi, whereas only 1–5% are literate in Nafaanra.

Nafaanra is the second language of the approximately 70 <a href="Dompo%20language">Dompo</a> people living in the close vicinity of Banda. Dompo is their first language, thought to be extinct until a field work trip of Blench in 1998 proved the contrary.

<a href="Maurice%20Delafosse">Maurice Delafosse</a> was the first linguist to mention Nafaanra, calling it "a much dispersed Senufo tribe" in 1904. <a href="Diedrich%20Hermann%20Westermann">Westermann</a> in his classification of West-African languages, also grouped Nafaanra with Senufo, apparently based on the word list found in Rapp. This classification is confirmed by Bendor-Samuel, who bases his internal Senufo classification on the comparative word lists in Swadesh et al.

It is less clear which particular Senufo branch Nafaanra is related to most closely. Bendor-Samuel gives a 60% cognate relationship on the <a href="Swadesh%20list">Swadesh list</a> with "Tenere" (a western Senari dialect), 59% with "Central Senari" (the Senari dialect spoken around Korhogo), and 43% with the non-Senufo languages Mo (or Deg), Kabre (or Kabiye), and <a href="Dogon%20languages">Dogon</a>. The relatively low scores of about 60% point to a rather distant relationship. Likewise, Mensah and Tchagbale establish an intercomprensibility factor of 38% with "Tyebaara" (Senari), concluding that Nafaanra is only distantly related to this dialect. Nafaanra has been tentatively linked to <a href="Palaka%20language">Palaka</a> (Kpalaga) by Manessy, whereas Mills suggests a relation with the southern <a href="Tagwana%E2%80%93Djimini%20languages">Tagwana–Djimini</a> branch.

Nafaanra has seven oral and five nasalized <a href="vowel">vowel</a>s. A difference in vowel length can make a difference in meaning, as in ', "to go", vs. ', "fetish" or "o", "we" vs. "oo", "we will". Similarly, the phonemic contrastiveness of nasalization can be seen in "sii", "to be giving birth," vs. "", "to build". The vowel system closely resembles that of other Senufo languages. It is like the two Northern Senufo languages <a href="Supyire%20language">Supyire</a> and <a href="Mamara%20language">Mamara</a> in having only five nasal against seven oral vowels. In the orthography, <a href="nasalization">nasalization</a> of vowels is marked by adding the letter "n" after the vowel.

In the table below, <a href="orthography">orthographic</a> symbols are included between brackets if they differ from the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">IPA</a> symbols. Note especially the use of "j" for IPA and the use of "y" for IPA , common in African orthographies.
The consonant system of Nafaanra is fairly similar to that of other Senufo languages. Nafaanra has only one attested palatal fricative, , occupying an intermediate position between the Northern Senufo languages (Mamara, Supyire) that have both and its voiced counterpart , and the Central and Southern Senufo languages (e.g. Karaboro, Senari, Djimini) that have no palatal fricatives at all.

Like the other Senufo languages, Nafaanra has three contrastive tones: High, Mid and Low. Tone is normally not marked in the Nafaanra orthography. Examples are:
The Mid tone sometimes has a rising feature, the High tone sometimes is subject to <a href="downstep">downstep</a> (a tonal process resulting in a High tone being realised lower than a preceding High tone), and an upstep is also found. The "rising feature" of Mid may be related to the fact that two different Mid tones are found in some other Senufo languages (e.g. Sucite and Supyire). The High tone downstep (signified by a raised exclamation mark) occurs in the following context:
It is likely that the tonal lowering seen in this particular example is related to the low tone nasal prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low tone nasal is found).
In general however, downstep is more widespread than in Supyire; a similar phenomenon is found in Palaka, Tagwana, and Djimini.

An upstep is found in the imperative tense of high tone verbs:

The Nafaanra syllable comprises a vowel and a maximum of three consonants. A nasal consonant may occur as a syllable on its own, in which case it is called a "syllabic nasal". The basic syllable structure can be rendered as (C)(C)V(C), with a preference for CV and CVV. Position C may contain any consonant, although word-initial /r/ does not occur. Position C may contain only <a href="trill%20consonant">trills</a> (/r/) or <a href="approximant">approximant</a>s (/w, l, j/). Position C may contain only nasals (), in which case the syllable as a whole is <a href="nasalization">nasalized</a>.

Senufo languages have a typical <a href="Niger%E2%80%93Congo%20languages">Niger–Congo</a> <a href="noun%20class">noun class</a> (or gender) system. <a href="Suffix">Suffix</a>es on nouns mark membership of one of the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can be inferred from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.

The basic word order in Nafaanra is <a href="subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb">subject–object–verb</a>, as can be seen in the following sentence:

Jordan lists the following list of <a href="pronoun">pronoun</a>s, commenting, "Although the pronoun system appears quite simple, it becomes complicated because all the tenses are shown by a combination of pronoun plus particle."

<a href="Grammatical%20tense">Tense</a> and <a href="Grammatical%20aspect">aspect</a> in Nafaanra are generally encoded in two places: in preverbal particles and on the verb form. Nafaanra has past, recent past, and future tenses and continuative aspect. In a simple sentence, the order of the various constituents can be rendered as follows: . When the negative suffix "-n" is present, no fusing of preverbal particles takes place. Nafaanra additionally expresses some tense/aspect matters by use of certain time adverbs and auxiliary verbs.
Past tense is marked by the preverbal particle "ná" (high tone, as opposed to the low tone continuative particle). Future tense is marked by the particle "wè". Simple sentences without a preverbal tense particle are interpreted as recent past (sometimes called "immediate"). If aspect marking is absent, simple sentences are generally interpreted as "completive".

Continuative aspect (sometimes called "progressive") denotes an action that is ongoing or repetitive. Continuative aspect is usually marked both by a preverbal particle "nà" (low tone) and by a change of the verb form. The verb "sɛ́", "go" used in the sentences below has the continuative form "síé". In sentences where both past tense particle "ná" and continuative particle "nà" are present, they combine to give the fused particle "náà". In sentences in the recent past tense, the preverbal continuative particle is omitted and continuative aspect is shown only on the verb.

Two classes of verbs can be differentiated on the basis of their behaviour in aspectually marked sentences. One class of verbs has two aspectually distinct forms, as seen in the above example sentences. Another class of verbs does not distinguish aspect—one and the same form shows up in both completive and continuative aspect. In sentences in the recent past tense, this gives rise to <a href="ambiguity">ambiguity</a> since the preverbal continuative particle is omitted there. Thus, the sentence "kòfí blú" can be interpreted in the following two ways:

Considerable fusion takes place between <a href="pronoun">pronominal</a> subjects and the preverbal particles. For example, "ná" "" fuses with "pé", "they", to produce "prá sɛ́" (they- go-completive), "they went", and "wè" "" fuses with "pé" in "píè sɛ́" (they- go-completive), "they will go".

<a href="Question">Question</a>s can be formed in several ways in Nafaanra. Basic <a href="yes%E2%80%93no%20question">yes–no question</a>s are constructed by adding a sentence-final question marker "rá". Constituent questions (sometimes called "Wh-questions" or "question word questions") are doubly marked. They contain a sentence-initial question word and are marked with a sentence-final question marker "hin".

The cardinal numbers without tonal marking are presented below; where possible, the tone pattern is added based on the list in Rapp. Some Supyire correlates are given for comparison. Numbers six to nine are derived by adding the numbers one to four to "kɔɔ", "five", by means of the conjunction "na".
The numbers 11–19 are formed by adding 1–9 to 10 by means of the conjunction "mbɔ", e.g. "kɛmbɔnunu", "eleven", "kɛmbɔkunɔ", "fifteen". In the tens and higher, the Nafaanra and Supyire systems diverge. Multiplication of "fulo", "twenty," and addition of "kɛ", "ten", (by means of the conjunction "ná") is used to form the 30–90 tens. Perhaps surprisingly, there are considerable differences between Rapp (1933) and Jordan (1980) here. In Rapp's 60, 70 and 80, "féle" seems to be used to mark ten, which conjoined with 6, 7 and 8 forms 60, 70 and 80.

Rapp (1933) compares the Nafaanra numerals for three ("táárɛ") and hundred ("lafaa") with "eta" and "ke-lafa" from <a href="Mpre%20language">Mpre</a>, a hitherto unclassified language from Ghana. It should be noted however that Mpre "eta" is <a href="Kwa%20languages">Kwa</a>-like (cf. Brong "esã", <a href="Ga%20language">Ga</a> "etɛ"), whereas the Nafaanra form "táárɛ" is transparently related to the forms found in the other (non-Kwa) Senufo languages (e.g. Supyire "tàànrè").
Nafaanra "lafaa" "hundred" is a typical Kwa numeral and is most probably borrowed from one of the surrounding Kwa languages (cf. <a href="Ga%20language">Dangme</a> "làfá", <a href="Gonja%20language">Gonja</a> "kì-làfá", <a href="Ewe%20language">Ewe</a> "alafá"). Rapp's implication of affinity between Mpre and Nafaanra seems therefore unwarranted at this level.

<a href="Morphophonology">Morphophonological</a> alternations occur here and there, most notably the reduction of "kúnɔ", "five" to "kɔ́ɔ̀" (preserving the tone pattern) and the change from "lafaa" to "lafɛɛ" in the hundreds.

The three basic <a href="colour">colour</a> words of Nafaanra are: "wɔɔ", "black", "finge", "white", and "ɲiɛ", "red". As with adjectives in Senufo languages, the form of the colour words reflects the noun class of the noun that is modified.
The <a href="cognate">cognate</a> forms in closely related Supyire are "-ɲyɛ-", "red; warm colored", and "-fyìn-", "white; light colored", in <a href="Supyire%20language">Supyire</a>. These adjectives are related to the respective verbs "fíníŋɛ́", "be white; whiten" and "ɲááŋá", "be red; redden", which in turn are <a href="causative">causative</a> forms of the now defunct verbs "fini","be white" and "ɲana", "be red".

Sample Nafaanra sentences from the <a href="SIL%20International">SIL</a>:

There is relatively little published on or in the Nafaanra language. The first linguistic publication to mention Nafaanra is Delafosse (1904), containing some notes on the Nafana people and a fairly extensive comparative Senufo word list, though it lacked any proper tonal marking. Rapp (1933) is an appendix to an article on the <a href="Kulango%20language">Kulango language</a> containing a German-Nafaanra ("Nafana-Sprache") word list of around 100 items, gathered during a stay of four hours at Sampa. Rapp notes in passing that special attention was paid to the marking of the tones.

After a period of silence on Nafaanra, Painter (1966) appeared, consisting of basic word lists of the Pantera and Fantera dialects. The SIL linguist Dean Jordan published an article on Nafaanra discourse in 1978, and together with his wife Carol Jordan has produced a translation of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, which appeared in 1984. Kropp-Dakubu's 1980 "West African language data sheets" vol II contains a few pages on Nafaanra put together in the late seventies by Dean and Carol Jordan, including a phonology, a list of nouns, a list of pronouns, a list of numbers, and some example sentences; tones are not marked. A more detailed phonology of Nafaanra by Jordan, also containing a <a href="Swadesh%20list">Swadesh list</a>, appeared in 1980. Several books of Nafana folk tales have been published by the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Mensah and Tchagbale in their 1983 linguistic atlas of Ivory Coast include a comparative Senufo word list of about 120 items; Nafaanra is present under the name "Nafara of Bondoukou". An orthography of Nafaanra, lacking tonal marking, is included in Hartell (1993). The area where Nafaanra is spoken has been the subject of recent archaeological-anthropological studies (Stahl 2004).

1950 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1950 Atlantic hurricane season was the first year in the Atlantic hurricane database (<a href="HURDAT">HURDAT</a>) that storms were given names in the <a href="Atlantic%20basin">Atlantic basin</a>. Names were taken from the <a href="Joint%20Army/Navy%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet</a>, with the first named storm being designated "Able", the second "Baker", and so on. It was an active <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">season</a> with sixteen tropical storms, with eleven of them developing into hurricanes. Six of these hurricanes were intense enough to be classified as <a href="major%20hurricane">major hurricane</a>s—a denomination reserved for storms that attained <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained winds</a> equivalent to a Category 3 or greater on the present-day <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20scale">Saffir–Simpson scale</a>. One storm, the twelfth of the season, was unnamed and was originally excluded from the yearly summary, and three additional storms were discovered in re-analysis. The large quantity of strong storms during the year yielded, prior to modern <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20reanalysis">reanalysis</a>, what was the highest seasonal <a href="accumulated%20cyclone%20energy">accumulated cyclone energy</a> (ACE) of the 20th century in the Atlantic basin; 1950 held the seasonal ACE record until broken by the <a href="2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. However, later examination by researchers determined that several storms in the 1950 season were weaker than thought, leading to a lower ACE than assessed originally.

The tropical cyclones of the season produced a total of 88 fatalities and $38.5 million in property damage (1950 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). The first <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming">officially named</a> Atlantic hurricane was <a href="Hurricane%20Able%20%281950%29">Hurricane Able</a>, which formed on August 12, brushed the North Carolina coastline, and later moved across <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a>. The strongest hurricane of the season, <a href="Hurricane%20Dog%20%281950%29">Hurricane Dog</a>, reached the equivalent of a <a href="List%20of%20Category%204%20Atlantic%20hurricanes">Category 4</a> hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale, and caused extensive damage to the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a>. Two major hurricanes affected Florida: <a href="Hurricane%20Easy%20%281950%29">Easy</a> produced the <a href="List%20of%20wettest%20tropical%20cyclones%20in%20the%20United%20States">highest 24-hour rainfall total recorded in the United States</a>, while <a href="Hurricane%20King">King</a> struck downtown Miami as a Category 4 hurricane and caused $27.75 million (1950 USD) of damage. The two major landfalls made the 1945–1950 period the only five-year period to feature five major hurricane landfalls in the United States—a record that held until tied in 2000–2005. The last storm of the year, an unnamed tropical storm, dissipated on November 13.

The season officially began on June 15 and ended on November 15; these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>s form in the <a href="Atlantic%20basin">Atlantic basin</a>. This season was the first time that the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">United States Weather Bureau</a> operated with <a href="radar">radar</a> technology to observe hurricanes away from land. Although the season began on June 15, tropical activity typically does not begin before August. The tropics remained tranquil through early August, and the U.S. Weather Bureau noted that the season had been "remarkably quiet". The inactive period ended on August 12, when the first tropical storm developed east of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. This storm received the name "Able" as part of the <a href="Joint%20Army/Navy%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet</a>. (The same alphabet was also used in the <a href="1951%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1951</a> and <a href="1952%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1952</a> seasons, before being replaced by female naming in <a href="1953%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1953</a>.)

Before the end of August, four hurricanes had formed in the Atlantic, two of which attained <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales">major hurricane status</a>. A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least ; a storm of this intensity would be classified as a Category 3 or greater on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a> introduced in the 1970s. In contrast to the busy August, only three named storms developed in September—although three of the August hurricanes lasted into September. <a href="Hurricane%20Dog%20%281950%29">Hurricane Dog</a> became the strongest hurricane of the season on September 6 with winds of ; its peak strength occurred over the open Atlantic Ocean, so it did not cause significant damage when it was at its strongest. It was among the most severe hurricanes on record in <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a>, where the hurricane struck early in its duration. Eight tropical storms or hurricanes formed in October, which is greater than in any other year.

In total, there were sixteen tropical storms during the season, of which five (Tropical Storm How, Tropical Storm Mike and three unnamed tropical storms) did not attain hurricane status. Overall, six major hurricanes occurred during the year. The <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a> made about 300 flights into hurricanes during the season, the most since the practice began in <a href="1943%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1943</a>. The number of storms was above average; in a typical year, eleven tropical storms, six hurricanes, and between two and three major hurricanes take place. With the numerous major hurricanes, the season produced a high <a href="accumulated%20cyclone%20energy">accumulated cyclone energy</a> (ACE) of 211, although it was originally assessed as 243 before reanalysis. At one point, the 1950 total was the highest on record, before being surpassed by the 2005 season. This value is an approximation of the combined <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> used by all tropical cyclones throughout the season.
The beginning of the hurricane season was inactive, with the formation of no tropical cyclones during June or July. The first storm of the year originated from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> that exited the west coast of Africa around August 5. Its status over the next few days were unknown due to sparse observations. On August 12, the system was designated Tropical Storm Able east of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>, which strengthened to hurricane status on August 14. Able gradually intensified as it tracked generally west-northwestward, and by 12:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on August 17, Able became a major hurricane. Initially, Able was thought to pose a threat to the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> and <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Instead, the hurricane turned to the northwest, reaching its peak intensity as a strong Category 3 hurricane, with winds of . The storm later turned to the northeast, passing just offshore <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> and <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a>. Steadily weakening and accelerating, Able struck <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> as a minimal hurricane, and later struck <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> as an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical storm</a>. It dissipated early on August 24 in the far northern Atlantic Ocean.

Along the coast of North Carolina, the hurricane produced light winds and rough waves, as well as moderate precipitation. Heavier rainfall occurred in southern <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, causing flooding in portions of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and producing slick roads that caused nine traffic fatalities. Able produced hurricane-force winds in <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, and damage across Canada totaled over $1 million (1950 <a href="Canadian%20dollar">CAD</a>, $  USD) in the agriculture, communications, and fishing industries. Two people died in Canada when their raft was overturned.
A tropical wave exited western Africa on August 13, which developed into Tropical Storm Baker east of the Lesser Antilles on August 18. It moved northwestward and later turned to the west, attaining hurricane status on August 21. The next day, the hurricane attained Category 2 intensity just as it crossed over <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a>, where heavy damage was reported. More than 100 homes were damaged or destroyed, which left thousands homeless. Afterward, the hurricane began to weaken, and later on August 22 its winds decreased to tropical storm status. The cyclone then struck <a href="Montserrat">Montserrat</a> as a strong tropical storm. The next day it struck southwestern <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical depression, passing over the Dominican Republic. Baker turned more to the west, re-attaining tropical storm status before striking eastern Cuba on August 24. In Cuba, 37 people died, and the property losses reached several million dollars.

On August 25, Baker weakened to tropical depression status while crossing Cuba, but soon thereafter regained tropical storm intensity in the western <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>. Two days later, Baker entered the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, and by the next day Baker had regained hurricane status. It turned northward, reaching a peak intensity of on August 30. Baker weakened slightly before making <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Gulf%20Shores%2C%20Alabama">Gulf Shores, Alabama</a> with winds of on August 31. Property and crop damage totaled $2.55 million (1950 USD), primarily between <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a> and <a href="Saint%20Marks%2C%20Florida">Saint Marks, Florida</a>. Torrential rainfall fell throughout the region, with the largest total occurring in <a href="Caryville%2C%20Florida">Caryville, Florida</a>, where of precipitation were recorded. The heavy precipitation was responsible for extensive crop damage across the region. The hurricane also spawned two tornadoes, one of which destroyed four houses and a building in <a href="Apalachicola%2C%20Florida">Apalachicola, Florida</a>. In <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>, high wind downed power lines, which caused one death and two injuries due to live wires. While inland, Baker tracked northwestward and eventually dissipated over southeastern <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> on September 1.

Hurricane Charlie developed on August 21 to the southwest of the <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> islands. At the time, the Weather Bureau did not consider Charlie to be a tropical cyclone until almost a week later. For four days, the storm tracked generally to the west as a weak tropical storm. On August 25, it turned to the northwest and intensified, becoming a hurricane on August 28. On August 30, Charlie attained peak winds of , although the <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a> estimated higher winds. At the time, the hurricane was stalled to the east-southeast of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, and subsequently turned to a westward drift. On September 2, Charlie turned to the north and northeast. At the time, it co-existed with two other hurricanes, <a href="Hurricane%20Dog%20%281950%29">Dog</a> and <a href="Hurricane%20Easy%20%281950%29">Easy</a>; it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in the Atlantic. Charlie slowly weakened and <a href="Extratropical%20cyclone%23Extratropical%20transition">lost tropical characteristics</a>, and by September 5 Charlie had transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> about southeast of <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>. It dissipated later on September 5 without having affected land.
Hurricane Dog is believed to have developed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on August 24. Its first observation as a tropical cyclone occurred on August 30, when it was a hurricane; the storm is believed to have begun farther east as a Cape Verde-type hurricane, but was not detectable before August 30. At the time, Dog was located east of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>, and it quickly attained major hurricane status as it moved to the west-northwest. Dog passed through the Lesser Antilles with winds of . It was considered among the worst hurricanes in the <a href="History%20of%20Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">history of Antigua</a>, where thousands were left homeless. Damage was estimated at $1 million (1950 USD, $  USD), and there were two deaths from drowning in the region.

After passing through the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a>, the hurricane turned to a northerly drift with continued intensification. On September 5, it attained wind speeds that would be equivalent to a <a href="List%20of%20Category%204%20Atlantic%20hurricanes">Category 4</a> hurricane on the present-day Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of . Operationally, the wind intensity value was estimated by Hurricane Hunters at when the hurricane was located about south-southwest of Bermuda; this estimate is now believed to have been an overestimation of the peak winds in Hurricane Dog, though the storm produced enormous wave heights at sea.

Maintaining peak intensity for about 18 hours, Dog began a weakening trend as it made a sharp turn to the west. It accelerated to the north on September 10, and two days later Dog passed within of <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a>. Newspapers attributed heavy rainfall in the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a>—which resulted in five deaths—to the hurricane. Further north, the hurricane killed 12 people in New England, and produced a total of $2 million (1950 USD, $  USD) of property damage. Twelve others died in two shipwrecks off the coast of Canada. The hurricane later became a strong extratropical cyclone, maintaining hurricane-force winds while passing south of Nova Scotia and eventually hitting <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> with hurricane-force gusts on September 18.
Hurricane Easy developed on September 1 from a <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> in the western Caribbean, which persisted after Hurricane Baker moved through the region in late August. Moving northeastward, the hurricane crossed Cuba on September 3 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. Easy turned to the northwest and strengthened to its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane. At the time, Easy was located just off the west coast of Florida; however, a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to its north caused the hurricane to stall, execute a small loop, and make <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Cedar%20Key%2C%20Florida">Cedar Key</a>. Following the landfall, Easy moved offshore, turned to the southeast, and made a second landfall near <a href="Hernando%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Hernando Beach</a> on September 6. The hurricane turned northwestward over the Florida Peninsula, and gradually weakened as it moved into <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> and the southeastern United States. On September 9, Easy dissipated over northeastern <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>.

Damage in Cuba was minor, although large portions of western Florida experienced hurricane-force winds and heavy rainfall. <a href="Yankeetown%2C%20Florida">Yankeetown</a> reported of precipitation in 24 hours, which at the time was the largest 24-hour rainfall total on record in the United States. The cumulative total rainfall on Yankeetown from Easy was , which still retains the record for the <a href="List%20of%20wettest%20tropical%20cyclones%20in%20the%20United%20States">wettest tropical cyclone</a> in Florida. Damage was heaviest in Cedar Key, where half of the houses were destroyed and most of the remaining were damaged. The rainfall caused heavy crop damage in the region. Across the state, Easy caused $3 million in damage (1950 USD), the total was less than expected, due to the sparse population of the affected area. Additionally, the hurricane was indirectly responsible for two deaths by electrocution. At the time, Easy was also known as the "Cedar Keys Hurricane".

On September 8, Tropical Storm Fox was present in the open Atlantic Ocean between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde, likely originating from a tropical wave. Hurricane Fox was first discovered by Hurricane Hunters on September 10, when it was located about east of Puerto Rico. A small system, the hurricane moved generally northwestward and gradually intensified. After turning toward the north, Fox reached its peak intensity with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of on September 14, as it passed about east of Bermuda. Following its peak intensity, the hurricane accelerated to the north and northeast. By September 17, Fox had <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">lost all tropical characteristics</a>, and later that day the circulation dissipated about halfway between the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and Newfoundland. Fox never affected land along its path. When Fox dissipated, it was the first time in 36 days without an active tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean.

Tropical Storm George originated on September 27 from a strong tropical wave northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. A large system, it moved to the northwest and later west-northwest. George began strengthening on September 30 as it decreased its forward speed. The next day, while remaining nearly stationary south of Bermuda, a nearby ship reported that George had reached hurricane status. It continued moving very slowly, passing only south of Bermuda. The island experienced winds of . Aside from <a href="rainband">rainband</a>s, little impact was reported on Bermuda.

The hurricane passed west of Bermuda on October 3. A day later, George reached its maximum intensity, attaining sustained winds of ; in its small eye, an Air Force Hurricane Hunter plane measured a central pressure of . It accelerated to the north and later to the northeast, and on October 5 George transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Shortly thereafter, it passed just south of Newfoundland, and on October 7 the remnants of George dissipated south of <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>.

A weak trough existed in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 29. A circulation developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October 1. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm How. Initially, the tropical storm moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October 2, estimated at . Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> coast due to the storm. On October 3, Tropical Storm How turned toward the southwest as it began weakening, and the next day it moved ashore near <a href="La%20Pesca%2C%20Tamaulipas">La Pesca, Tamaulipas</a> as a tropical depression. About six hours after making landfall, How dissipated over the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20Oriental">Sierra Madre Oriental</a> in northeastern Mexico. How was the only named storm in the season not to attain hurricane status.

On October 4, a trough was present in the western Caribbean Sea, and was possibly a tropical cyclone. Moving northwest, the system crossed the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> and became disrupted, while also associating with a cold front. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on October 7 and became more defined. On the next day, the system developed into Tropical Storm Item off the northwest coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. The storm moved to the southwest and intensified into a hurricane on October 9, reaching peak winds of on the next day based on Hurricane Hunters observations. It is possible that Item was stronger, due to the storm's small size but lack of direct observations. On October 11, the hurricane made landfall at 04:00 UTC near <a href="Nautla%2C%20Veracruz">Nautla, Veracruz</a>, with peak gusts of . The hurricane quickly dissipated over land.

In the sparsely populated area where Item moved ashore, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall. Newspaper reports considered it the worst storm to hit Mexico in ten years, with damage in Veracruz totaling around $1.5 million (1950 USD, $  USD). The strong winds sank 20 ships, and although there were no reports of casualties, Item caused 15 injuries. Communications were disrupted across the region, and downed trees blocked roads. Near <a href="Tuxpam">Tuxpam</a>, the winds damaged large areas of banana plantations.

A tropical storm was first observed on October 11 in the central Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. Two days later, a ship reported strong winds and a rapid pressure drop, indicating a hurricane was in the region; the tropical cyclone was given the name Jig. It moved northwestward, steadily intensifying before turning to the north and northeast. On October 15, Hurricane Jig passed about east of Bermuda, and later that day its sustained winds reach peak winds of , although the intensity was uncertain, based on estimates from the Hurricane Hunters. The hurricane began weakening on October 16. Jig became an extratropical cyclone later that day and quickly dissipated, never having affected land due to its small size.
A trough was present in the western Caribbean on October 11. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed just off the north coast of <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> on October 13, which moved northeastward and intensified into Tropical Storm King the next day. The tropical storm was a small weather system throughout its duration. On October 16, King reached hurricane strength while the passing between Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. The next day, King struck Cuba near <a href="Camag%C3%BCey">Camagüey</a>, Cuba with winds of , equivalent to an upper-end Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane killed seven people and caused $2 million (1950 USD, $  USD) in damage throughout the country.

After crossing Cuba, King rapidly deepened as it turned toward <a href="Miami%20metropolitan%20area">South Florida</a>, becoming the sixth and final major hurricane of the season on October 18. King made landfall around 04:30 UTC on October 18, with estimated winds of , or a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale; it was the most severe hurricane to impact the city since the <a href="1926%20Miami%20hurricane">1926 Miami hurricane</a>. As it approached Miami, the hurricane had a <a href="radius%20of%20maximum%20wind">radius of maximum wind</a>s of , and a minimum pressure of was reported as King moved across the city. The swath of destructive winds was only , likened to a small tornado. Early on October 19, King weakened to tropical storm status over north-central Florida, and on the next day it dissipated over western <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>. There was one additional death in Georgia.

Across Florida, damage totaled $27.75 million (1950 USD, $  USD), of which $15 million (1950 USD, $  USD) was in the Miami metropolitan area. A preliminary survey indicated there were 12,290 houses damaged in the region, with an additional eight destroyed. Along its path through the state, strong winds were observed around <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>, with a gust in <a href="Clewiston%2C%20Florida">Clewiston</a>. Overall, there were three deaths in the state. 

A tropical storm was present in the east-central Atlantic on October 17. It moved northwestward at first before turning to the northeast on October 19, when it was already a small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the Azores, and it reached a peak intensity of on October 21. Maintaining its peak strength for 30 hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern Azores. It turned to the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October 24. Subsequently, the system turned to the south and quickly dissipated. This tropical storm was not included in the "<a href="Monthly%20Weather%20Review">Monthly Weather Review</a>"'s summary of the 1950 hurricane season, and it was added to the <a href="List%20of%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20seasons">Atlantic hurricane database</a> in 1959.

In the wake of <a href="Hurricane%20King">Hurricane King</a> moving northward through Florida, an <a href="low%20pressure%20area">area of low pressure</a> developed into a tropical cyclone on October 18 south of Louisiana. This storm was given the name Love and quickly strengthened, reaching hurricane status shortly thereafter. The storm initially moved westward across the Gulf of Mexico, but soon swung southward into the central portion of the Gulf on October 19. Hurricane Love's maximum sustained winds are believed to have reached their peak intensity early on October 20. Throughout the hurricane's track, dry air infringed on the western side of the tropical cyclone's circulation, which produced unfavorable conditions for additional <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclogenesis</a>. On October 20, the storm began curving northeastward towards the coast of western Florida; however, the dry air completely circled Love's <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">center of circulation</a>, drastically weakening the cyclone in the process. On October 21, Love weakened to a tropical storm, and it struck the <a href="Big%20Bend%20%28Florida%29">Big Bend</a> region of Florida, north of <a href="Cedar%20Key%2C%20Florida">Cedar Key</a>. At the time, its winds were only of moderate gale force, and the storm degenerated into a trough of low pressure shortly thereafter. This combined with an approaching cold front to produce a powerful extratropical storm.

Certain areas began preparing for the storm along Florida's west coast. Hospitals set up emergency facilities in case of power failure, and some coastal residents left their homes. Initially, the storm was forecast to strike the <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a> area, but missed to the north as it weakened. It reportedly left little damage in the sparsely populated land where it made landfall.

A westerly moving trough was evident in the east-central Atlantic Ocean on October 24, south of a dissipating cold front. Ships in the region reported light winds, and surface observations suggested that a circulation developed by October 25; on that basis, it is estimated that a tropical depression formed. A nearby ship reported gale-force winds on October 27, suggesting that it intensified into a tropical storm with peak winds of . An approaching cold front turned the storm northward, which absorbed the storm on October 28. The <a href="557th%20Weather%20Wing">Air Weather Service</a> (AWS) noted the system as "Storm Mike", but the storm was not included in the annual Monthly Weather Review summary, nor was it included in the database until it was added by the <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20reanalysis%20project">Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project</a> in 2014.

Ships in the eastern Atlantic Ocean suggested that a tropical storm was present on October 28 with peak winds of . It was estimated to have originated the previous day. The small storm moved to the northwest and later west into an area of sparse observations, suggesting a weaker system. The system's track ended on October 29 due to uncertainty, but it was estimated to have dissipated soon after.

For several days in November, a trough was present across the west-central Atlantic Ocean. On November 10, three ships reported a cyclonic circulation northeast of Bermuda, with peak winds of . It was a large system, and would likely have been classified a subtropical cyclone in the satellite era. The storm moved northeastward and weakened, degenerating into a trough on November 12 before being merging with another system.

This was the first season in the Atlantic hurricane database in which cyclones that attained at least tropical storm status were given names. The names used to name storms during the 1950 season were taken from the <a href="Joint%20Army/Navy%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet</a>, which was also used in the <a href="1951%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1951</a> and <a href="1952%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1952</a> hurricane seasons before being replaced by female names in <a href="1953%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1953</a>. Names that were not assigned are marked in .

This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a tropical wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1950 USD.

Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'yō

"Jun'yō" was <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>ed in November 1943 and spent three months under repair. She was damaged by several bombs during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> in mid-1944, but quickly returned to service. Lacking aircraft, she was used as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed again in December. "Jun'yō" was under repair until March 1945, when work was cancelled as uneconomical. She was then effectively <a href="hulk%20%28ship%29">hulked</a> for the rest of the war. After the <a href="surrender%20of%20Japan">surrender of Japan</a> in September, the Americans also decided that she was not worth the cost to make her serviceable for use as a repatriation ship, and she was <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> in 1946–1947.

The ship was ordered in late 1938 as the fast luxury passenger liner "Kashiwara Maru" by "<a href="Nippon%20Yusen%20Kaisha">Nippon Yusen Kaisha</a>" (the Japan Mail Steamship Company). In exchange for a 60 percent subsidy of her building costs by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Navy%20of%20Japan">Navy Ministry</a>, she was designed to be converted to an auxiliary aircraft carrier, one of 10 such ships subsidized by the IJN.

"Jun'yō" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall</a> length of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of . She <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at <a href="Standard%20displacement%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a>. Her crew ranged from 1,187 to 1,224 officers and men. The ship was fitted with two <a href="Mitsubishi%20Heavy%20Industries">Mitsubishi-Curtis</a> geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> sets with a total of , each driving one <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>, using steam provided by six Mitsubishi three-drum <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. "Jun'yō" had a designed speed of , but reached during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s. The ship carried of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, which gave her a range of at .

"Jun'yō"s <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> was long and had a maximum width of . The ship was designed with two superimposed <a href="hangar">hangar</a>s, each approximately long, wide and high. Each hangar could be subdivided by four <a href="fire%20curtain">fire curtain</a>s and they were fitted with <a href="fire%20fighting%20foam">fire fighting foam</a> dispensers on each side. The hangars were served by two <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">aircraft elevators</a>.

The ship's air group was originally intended to consist of 12 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A5M">Mitsubishi A5M</a> (<a href="World%20War%20II%20Allied%20names%20for%20Japanese%20aircraft">"Claude"</a>) fighters, plus 4 in storage, 18 <a href="Aichi%20D3A">Aichi D3A</a> "Val" dive bombers, plus 2 in reserve, and 18 <a href="Nakajima%20B5N">Nakajima B5N</a> "Kate" <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s. This was revised to substitute a dozen <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a> fighters, together with 3 more in storage, for the A5Ms by the time the ship commissioned in 1942. As a result of the lessons learned from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June, the ship's fighter complement was strengthened to 21 Zeros, and the other aircraft reduced to 12 D3As and 9 B5Ns. By the end of the year, 6 more Zeros replaced an equal number of D3As. Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars, 8 or 9 were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce cramping below decks.

As a conversion from an ocean liner, the ship could not support much armor, although it had a <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a>. Two plates of Ducol steel, each thick, protected the sides of the ship's machinery spaces. The ship's <a href="aviation%20gasoline">aviation gasoline</a> tanks and <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> were protected by one layer of Ducol steel. Her machinery spaces were further subdivided by transverse and longitudinal <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a> to limit any flooding.

The ship's primary armament consisted of a dozen 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">Type 89</a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a> in six twin-gun mounts on <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s along the sides of the hull. "Jun'yō" was also initially equipped with eight triple mounts for <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">25 mm Type 96</a> light AA guns alongside the flight deck. In mid-1943, four more triple mounts were added and another four triple mounts in late 1943 and early 1944. Two of these last four mounts were mounted on the stern and the others were placed in front of and behind the island. A dozen single mounts were also added, some of which were portable and could be mounted on the flight deck. After the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, the ship's anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with three more triple mounts, two twin mounts and eighteen single mounts for the 25 mm Type 96 gun. These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. In October 1944, "Jun'yō" had a total of 91 Type 96 guns: 57 in nineteen triple mounts, 4 in two twin mounts, and 30 single mounts.

Two Type 94 high-angle <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control directors</a>, one on each side of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. Each director mounted a <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>. When "Jun'yō" was first commissioned only the rangefinders were fitted and the directors were added later. Four Type 95 directors controlled the 25 mm guns and another pair were added in early 1943. Early warning was provided by two <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20World%20War%20II%20radars%23Shipborne%20radar">Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1</a> <a href="early-warning%20radar">early-warning radar</a>s. The first of these was mounted on the top of the island in July 1942, shortly after she was completed, and the other was added later in the year on the port side of the hull, outboard of the rear elevator. A smaller <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20World%20War%20II%20radars%23Land-based%20radar">Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3</a> early-warning radar was added in 1944.

"Jun'yō"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid down by Mitsubishi on <a href="Slipway">Slipway</a> No. 3 at their <a href="shipyard">shipyard</a> in <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a> on 20 March 1939. She was <a href="yard%20number">yard number</a> 900 and had the name "Kashiwara Maru" at that time. The ship was purchased on 10 February 1941 by the Navy Ministry and she was temporarily referred to as No. 1001 Ship ("Dai 1001 bankan") to keep her conversion secret. She was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 26 June 1941 and <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 3 May 1942 as "Jun'yō".

Upon commissioning, the ship was assigned to the <a href="Fourth%20Carrier%20Division">Fourth Carrier Division</a> of the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Air Fleet</a>, together with , under the command of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Kakuji%20Kakuta">Kakuji Kakuta</a>. She was tasked to support <a href="Operation%20AL">Operation AL</a>, an attack planned to seize several <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the <a href="Kurile%20Islands">Kurile Islands</a> while the main body of the American fleet was occupied defending Midway. "Jun'yō" carried 18 A6M2 Zeros and 18 D3As for this operation. At dawn on 3 June, she launched 9 Zeros and a dozen D3As to attack <a href="Battle%20of%20Dutch%20Harbor">Dutch Harbor</a> on <a href="Unalaska%20Island">Unalaska Island</a>. They had to turn back due to bad weather, although an American <a href="PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalina</a> <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> was shot down by a Zero. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. As the aircraft from "Jun'yō" were regrouping after the attack, they were attacked by 8 <a href="Curtiss%20P-40">Curtiss P-40</a> fighters that shot down 2 Zeros and a pair of D3As while losing 2 of their own. Another D3A got lost and failed to make it back to the carrier. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A <a href="Martin%20B-26%20Marauder">Martin B-26 Marauder</a> bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> bomber was shot down by <a href="flak">flak</a> during the attack.

"Jun'yō" had initially been designated as an auxiliary aircraft carrier ("Tokusetsu kokubokan"), but following the loss of four Japanese fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, she was redesignated as a regular carrier ("Kokubokan") in July. <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Okada%20Tametsugu">Okada Tametsugu</a> assumed command on 20 July 1942. Upon arrival at <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a> on 9 October, together with her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> , the ship was assigned to the <a href="Second%20Carrier%20Division">Second Carrier Division</a> to begin operations against American forces in the Guadalcanal area as part of the <a href="3rd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">3rd Fleet</a>. 

On the night of 16 October, the two carriers were ordered to attack the American transports off <a href="Lunga%20Point">Lunga Point</a>, <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> and they moved south to their launching point north of Lunga. At 05:15 each ship launched nine each A6M Zeros and B5Ns (one of "Jun'yō"s B5Ns was forced to turn back with mechanical problems) which reached the target and discovered two <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s bombarding Japanese supply dumps on Guadalcanal around 07:20. "Hiyō"s aircraft attacked seven minutes later without effect, although the American ship shot down one B5N and damaged another which was forced to make a <a href="Emergency%20landing">crash landing</a>. "Jun'yō"s eight B5Ns engaged and also failed to hit their target, not least because they were attacked by <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine</a> <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">Grumman F4F Wildcat</a> fighters at 07:32. The Marine pilots shot down three B5Ns on their first pass and severely damaged another pair which were also forced to crash land. They then shot down the three remaining bombers after they missed "Lardner". The defending Zeros were only able to shoot down one Wildcat at the cost of one of "Hiyō"s fighters forced to crash land, although they claimed to have shot down thirteen Marine fighters. "Hiyō" was forced to depart the area after a fire reduced her top speed to and transferred three Zeros, one D3A and five B5Ns before she left. <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Kakuji%20Kakuta">Kakuji Kakuta</a>, commander of the Second Carrier Division, also transferred and hoisted his flag aboard "Jun'yō".
In late October 1942, during the Guadalcanal Campaign, "Jun'yō" took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Santa%20Cruz%20Islands">Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</a>. At this time, her air group consisted of eighteen Zeros, eighteen D3As and nine B5Ns. At 05:00 on 26 October 1942, she had launched fourteen Zeros and a few D3As to land at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, which had been falsely reported by the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> as in their hands, but they were greeted by <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine</a> <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">Grumman F4F Wildcat</a>s and all were shot down. At 09:30, "Jun'yō" launched another air strike that attacked the carrier , the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> and the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , scoring hits on the latter two, but inflicting little substantial damage. Three D3As and a B5N were shot down by returning <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">Douglas SBD Dauntless</a> dive bombers. Kakuta ordered another air strike to be launched at 14:15, using six B5Ns from the damaged and nine D3As from both carriers. Shortly afterwards, more aircraft were launched to attack the American ships, including six B5Ns and six D3As escorted by half a dozen Zeros. All of these aircraft attacked the carrier , which had been badly damaged by the attacks earlier in the day. American damage control measures had been partially successful, but one torpedo hit by a B5N from "Shōkaku" increased her <a href="List%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> from 7.5° to 14.5° and near-misses by the dive bombers started enough seams in her plating that her list increased to 18°. The Americans finally ordered the ship abandoned and the last wave of dive bombers hit "Hornet" twice more, but inflicted little further damage.

In mid-November 1942, "Jun'yō" was tasked to provide air cover for the convoy bringing reinforcements for the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal during the three-day-long <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a>. The ship had twenty-seven A6M3 Zeros, a dozen D3A2s and nine B5N2s for this task. Six of her Zeros were on <a href="Combat%20Air%20Patrol">Combat Air Patrol</a> when the convoy was discovered by two SBDs from "Enterprise" and shot down one dive bomber after it had made its spot report. They were unable to protect the convoy against further attacks by aircraft based at Henderson Field; seven transports were sunk and the remaining four transports were damaged before the end of the day. That afternoon, "Enterprise" had been discovered by a searching B5N and "Junyo" launched an air strike with her remaining aircraft, but they failed to locate the American carrier. In December 1942 and January 1943, the carrier covered several convoys that brought reinforcements to <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a>, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, and her air group protected the forces there for several days before returning to Truk on 20 January. The ship then covered the evacuation from Guadalcanal through early February.

"Jun'yō" briefly returned to Japan in February before she sailed for Truk on 22 March together with "Hiyō". Her air group was detached to <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on 2 April to participate in <a href="Operation%20I-Go">Operation I-Go</a>, a land-based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. Before returning to Truk in the middle of the month, "Jun'yō"s aircraft claimed to have shot down sixteen American aircraft for the loss of seven A6Ms and two D3As, and they sank the destroyer . The ship's air group was deployed to <a href="Buin%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buin, Papua New Guinea</a>, on 2 July in response to the American attack on <a href="Rendova%20Island">Rendova Island</a> on 30 June. Her fighters claimed 37 victories for the loss of nine aircraft before disbanding on 1 September. Leaving her aircraft behind, the carrier returned to Japan in late July.

"Jun'yō" ferried aircraft to <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> in mid-August and troops and equipment to the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> in September and October. En route from Truk to Kure on 5 November 1943, "Jun'yō" was hit off <a href="Bungo%20Suid%C5%8D">Bungo Suidō</a> by a torpedo from the submarine . Four men were killed, but the damage was light, other than the disabled rudder. The ship was under repair and refit until 29 February 1944 at <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a>. Meanwhile, her air group had been reconstituted at <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> on 1 November with 24 Zeros, 18 D3As and 9 B5Ns. The aircraft transferred to Truk on 1 December and then to <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> at the end of December before reaching Rabaul on 25 January 1944. Her fighters claimed 40 Allied aircraft shot down and another 30 probably destroyed, but the air group was virtually annihilated. The survivors were back at Truk on 20 February and the air group was disbanded.

In the meantime, the Japanese Navy had restructured its carrier air groups so that one air group was assigned to one carrier division, and the <a href="652nd%20Naval%20Air%20Group">652nd Naval Air Group</a> was assigned to the <a href="2nd%20Carrier%20Division">2nd Carrier Division</a> with "Hiyō", "Jun'yō" and "Ryūhō" on 1 March. The air group was last in priority to be rebuilt and only had 30 Model 21 Zeros, 13 Model 52 Zeros and four D3As on hand on 1 April of its authorized 81 fighters, 36 dive bombers and 27 torpedo bombers. The ship conducted training for her aircraft in the Inland Sea until 11 May, when she sailed for <a href="Tawi-Tawi">Tawi-Tawi</a> in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. The new base was closer to the oil wells in <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> on which the Navy relied and also to the <a href="Palau">Palau</a> and western Caroline Islands, where the Japanese expected the next American attack. However, the location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots, and American submarine activity restricted the ships to the anchorage.

The Japanese fleet was en route to Guimares Island in the central Philippines on 13 June, where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines, when <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Jisabur%C5%8D%20Ozawa">Jisaburō Ozawa</a> learned of the American attack on the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a> the previous day. Upon reaching Guimares, the fleet refuelled and sortied into the <a href="Philippine%20Sea">Philippine Sea</a>, where they spotted <a href="Task%20Force%2058">Task Force 58</a> on 18 June. The Americans failed to locate Ozawa's ships that day and the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers as Ozawa had decided on launching his air strikes early the following morning. At this time, the 652nd Naval Air Group consisted of 81 Zeros, 27 D3As, 9 <a href="Yokosuka%20D4Y">Yokosuka D4Y</a> "Judy" dive bombers and 18 <a href="Nakajima%20B6N">Nakajima B6N</a> "Jill" torpedo bombers, roughly evenly divided among the three ships. The three carriers began launching their first air strike of 26 bomb-carrying A6M2 Zeros, 16 A6M5 Zeros to escort the other aircraft and 7 B6Ns at about 09:30. Most of these aircraft were misdirected and failed to find any American ships, although a dozen persisted in their search and found one of the American task groups. A B6N, 5 bomb-carrying Zeros and an escorting Zero were shot down by the defending fighters and no damage was inflicted on any American ships.

A second air strike of 27 D3As, 9 D4Ys, 2 B6Ns and 26 escorting Zeros was launched around 11:00, accompanied by at least 18 A6Ms and B6Ns from "Shōkaku" and . They had also been given an erroneous spot report and could not find any American ships. The 652nd aircraft headed for airfield at <a href="Rota%20%28island%29">Rota</a> and <a href="Guam">Guam</a> to refuel while those from the other two carriers returned to them. A pair of Zeros and 6 D4Ys bound for Rota spotted the carriers and en route, but failed to inflict any damage on the American ships while losing 5 D4Ys to anti-aircraft fire. Radar had spotted those aircraft headed for Guam and they were intercepted by 41 <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">Grumman F6F Hellcat</a>s. Only a single A6M5, 1 D4Y and 7 D3As of the 49 Japanese aircraft survived the encounter and landed.
At dusk, the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon of the following day and Vice Admiral <a href="Marc%20Mitscher">Marc Mitscher</a> ordered an air strike launched. They found the ships of the Second Carrier Division and hit "Jun'yō" with two bombs near her island. The ship was not badly damaged, but flight operations had to be suspended. The 652nd Naval Air Group claimed seven American aircraft shot down and four more probably shot down, but lost eleven Zeros, plus another three that had to <a href="emergency%20landing">ditch</a>. The air group was disbanded on 10 July with many of its remaining personnel being assigned to <a href="Air%20Group%20653">Air Group 653</a>.

After repairs at Kure, "Jun'yō" remained in the Inland Sea without aircraft until 27 October, when she was tasked to transport material to Borneo. On 3 November, she was attacked by the submarine near <a href="Makung">Makung</a>, but her escorting destroyer, , deliberately intercepted the torpedoes and sank with no survivors. On her return voyage, the ship was unsuccessfully attacked by the submarines and . On 25 November, she sailed for <a href="Manila">Manila</a> via Makung to rendezvous with the battleship and the destroyers <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Suzutsuki%20%281942%29">"Suzutsuki"</a>, <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Fuyutsuki">"Fuyutsuki"</a>, and <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Maki%20%281944%29">"Maki"</a>. Having loaded 200 survivors of the battleship , "Jun'yō" was attacked by the submarines , and early in the morning of 9 December 1944. She was hit by three torpedoes that flooded several compartments and killed 19 men. These gave her a 10°–12° list to starboard, but she was able to proceed on one engine. She reached <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo</a> the following day and began repairs on 18 December.

The repairs were abandoned in March 1945 for lack of materials and the ship was moved from the dock to Ebisu Bay, Sasebo, on 1 April. Efforts to camouflage the ship began on 23 April and she was reclassified as a <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a> on 20 June. "Jun'yō"s armament was ordered removed on 5 August and the ship was surrendered to the Allies on 2 September. An American technical team evaluated the ship's condition on 8 October and deemed her a <a href="constructive%20total%20loss">constructive total loss</a>. "Jun'yō" was stricken from the <a href="Navy%20List">Navy List</a> on 30 November and scrapped between 1 June 1946 and 1 August 1947 by the Sasebo Ship Company.

George Tucker (politician)

George Tucker (August 20, 1775 – April 10, 1861) was an American attorney, politician, historian, author, and educator. His literary works include the first fiction of colonial life in Virginia and another which is among the nation's earliest science fictions. Tucker also published the first comprehensive biography of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, as well as his 1856 "History of the United States".

Tucker was the son of the first mayor of <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Bermuda">Hamilton, Bermuda</a>. He immigrated to Virginia at age 20, was educated at the <a href="College%20of%20William%20and%20Mary">College of William and Mary</a>, and was admitted to the bar. His first marriage ended with the death of his childless wife Mary Farley in 1799; he remarried and had six children with wife Maria Carter, who died at age 38 in 1823. His third wife, of 30 years, was Louisa Thompson who died in 1858.

Aside from his law practice, Tucker wrote distinctive monologues for various publications. His topics ranged widely from the conceptual to the technical—from <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>, suffrage, and morality to intracoastal navigation, wages, and banking. He was elected in 1816 to the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a> for one term, and served in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> from 1819 to 1825. From his youth until early middle age, Tucker's lofty social lifestyle was often profligate, and occasionally scandalous. Nevertheless, upon completion of his congressional term, his eloquent publications led Thomas Jefferson and <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> to extend to him an appointment to serve as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the newly founded <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>; he accepted and held that post until 1845.

After retiring, Tucker relocated to Philadelphia, continued his research, and expounded upon a variety of subjects, including monetary policy and socio-economics, until his death in Virginia at the age of 86.

George Tucker was born in <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> at <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Island%2C%20Bermuda">St. George's Island</a> on August 20, 1775. He was the second son of Daniel and Elizabeth Tucker, who were distant cousins. Daniel and his brothers established a mercantile partnership with a fleet of vessels shipping goods to America, Newfoundland, and the West Indies. Daniel was also a founder and Mayor of the port of Hamilton, Bermuda.

Tucker was educated in Bermuda primarily by a tutor engaged from Great Britain and also by <a href="Josiah%20Meigs">Josiah Meigs</a>. His assigned reading included "Tom Jones", "The Vicar of Wakefield", and "Arabian Nights", among the mainstays of an education on the American continent. At age fifteen he helped form a literary club, the Calliopean Society; Meigs later became a professor and reprised the name of the club at <a href="Calliopean%20Society">Yale</a>. Tucker at age 16 began to <a href="Reading%20law">read the law</a> under a successful and prosperous lawyer, George Bascomb. At Bascomb's death, the firm's clients urged Tucker to assume their representation, but feeling quite unqualified, he declined, deciding to begin plans for a career in the United States.

Shortly after his mother's death in 1795, Tucker sailed for Philadelphia, intending to continue his legal education in the United States. He briefly considered London for his studies but discarded the idea, in order to optimize his chances for "political advancement". After a free-spending time with other Bermudians in the capital city, he ran out of funds, and proceeded to <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg, Virginia</a> to seek advice and borrow money from his famous cousin <a href="St.%20George%20Tucker">St. George Tucker</a>, a maneuver he would repeat. He was admitted at the College of William & Mary, where he studied law under St. George and graduated after two years. Tucker was pleased to find the academic work undemanding, and his social life entertaining, as he gained access to the finer homes through his cousin.

Tucker traveled to New York and Philadelphia and, with letters of introduction in hand, was able to further acquaint himself with his adopted country and meet noted leaders, including <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> and New York governors <a href="John%20Jay">John Jay</a> and <a href="George%20Clinton%20%28vice%20president%29">George Clinton</a>. Despite his enjoyment of this high society, he returned to Williamsburg and there began a courtship with Mary Byrd Farley, who was possessed of much charm and fortune, and to whom he proposed. Though he had initially preferred to delay the wedding until he had passed the bar, he gave in to his heart's desire, borrowed the needed funds from an uncle, and they married in October 1797. To help Mary, who was chronically ill with consumption, Tucker arranged a trip to his old home in Bermuda. The stay there provided Mary no relief from her illness and confirmed his desire to be in Virginia. They returned to Williamsburg, setting up residence, with his intention to read for the <a href="bar%20exam">bar exam</a>. Except for trips to North Carolina to collect rents on his wife's property, Tucker avoided his work, attended horse races in Fredericksburg, and frequented fashionable watering places with friends and family; he made Thomas Jefferson's acquaintance at this time. Mary never recovered from her infirmities, and died childless in 1799.

Mary's death complicated Tucker's facile life, as her considerable estate was fraught with legal problems. It included a sugar plantation, thousands of acres of land, and a share in the Dismal Swamp Company. After a prolonged trip to the sugar plantation in Antigua, and on to Martinique and Bermuda, he returned to Williamsburg and then determined his future was in the nearby state capital of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> as a practicing attorney. Tucker ultimately succeeded in salvaging only part of his late wife's fortune.

Tucker arrived in Richmond with a letter of introduction from St. George to Governor <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>. His cousin's letter is said to have accurately portrayed Tucker's character and also foretold his future there: "To the best qualities of the heart he unites an excellent understanding, which has been well cultivated, and a very comprehensive knowledge of the world; nature has blessed him with a most exuberant flow of spirits, which sometimes betray him into acts of levity..." Tucker effectively entered the desired social circles in Richmond, bolstered by a well-furnished home near the Governor's own, and soon could count among his acquaintances not only the Governor (whom Tucker called "that slow dull man"), but also <a href="George%20Wythe">George Wythe</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Pendleton">Edmund Pendleton</a>, <a href="George%20Hay%20%28Virginia%29">George Hay</a> and most notably Charles Carter (1765–1829), who introduced him to daughter Maria Ball Carter—the granddaughter of <a href="Betty%20Washington%20Lewis">Betty Washington Lewis</a> and descendant of <a href="Robert%20Carter%20I">Robert Carter I</a>. They soon fell in love, and in February 1802 he married Maria, age seventeen and pregnant.

While Tucker began writing for publication, as an attorney he was initially deficient, being disabled by his fear of speaking in the courtroom; he later gained the requisite self-confidence. Tucker became a founding member of the <a href="Virginia%20Historical%20Society">Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society</a> in Richmond, an effort led by <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a> and <a href="John%20Floyd%20%28Virginia%20politician%29">John Floyd</a>; Tucker was named to the Society's Standing Committee.

Politically, Tucker was a Jeffersonian <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Republican</a>, delighted at the split in the Federalists between <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, and joined in the resentment toward Federalist attempts to "appoint a president" by party caucus. But in time he departed his <a href="Jacobin">near-Jacobin</a> leanings and became a pro-bank Republican. He once gave a speech in support of a <a href="Federalist">Federalist</a> in a local election, and a staunch Republican, Lewis Harvey, called him a party traitor and liar. In reaction, the often hot-tempered Tucker took a swing at him but missed due the intervention of a neutral party. Assuming his challenge unsuccessful, Tucker <a href="Duel">demanded satisfaction</a> which Harvey accepted. Tucker carefully arranged the duel, stipulating an extraordinary distance in paces, so as to diminish the superior marksmanship of his opponent. Fortunately for Tucker the duel was avoided at the last moment—though not before he had completed his will and arranged his estate for his expecting wife. Their first child, Daniel George, was born November 23, 1802.

Tucker sought out the foremost authors in Richmond to advance his interest in literature and the arts, and soon published an essay entitled "Letter to a Member of the General Assembly of Virginia on the Subject of the Late Conspiracy of the Slaves with a Proposal for Their Colonization" (1801), proposing a remedy to slavery. Tucker's "Letter" expressed his early opposition to slavery, portraying it as unproductive and uneconomical. He wrote that no country "can attain great heights in manufactures, commerce or agriculture where one half of the community labours unwillingly, and the other half does not labour at all." He recommended that revenues be secured (with a tax on slaveholders) and used to establish a colony for the slaves west of the Mississippi. He further asserted that the slave's inferiority was a result of time and circumstance, and not natural causes.

In the 1820s however, Tucker's views of slavery changed notably with personal experience, and profit, realized in his purchase and sale of slaves for his account and that of his father-in-law, Charles Carter. For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. Though he recounted the insipid benefits of slavery, he predicted its eventual death. Indeed, he freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years prior to his death.

Tucker's law practice could not support the expenses essential to his extravagant social exploits, which included gambling at cards and races, and he proceeded to waste the capital from Mary Tucker's estate. He was drawn to speculative investments and ultimately was embroiled in a financial scandal. In 1803, he joined other prominent citizens in organizing a lottery to raise funds for the Richmond Academy. He allegedly bought several chances for himself and, as remaining chances dwindled, resold some of them for a profit; he also was said to have positioned himself as one of four or five holders sure to be a winner. He held the winning stub when his ticket was purportedly found lodged in a joint of the drawing drum.

Tucker was asked for reimbursement, and after negotiation, paid it in part, borrowing the remainder from members of the academy board. He also acted as custodian of other funds, blended them with his own and spent it on overindulgence and land speculation. Later he was required to defend himself in these matters before the Virginia General Assembly. Though he was officially cleared of wrongdoing, the incidents tarnished his reputation and highlighted the style of his living in Richmond. Meanwhile, Maria gave birth to their eldest daughter, Eleanor Rosalie, on May 4, 1804.

Tucker relocated his family in 1806, including a newborn daughter Maria, to the Carters' home in Frederick County, Virginia, and attempted to put his financial house in order. Business required his frequent return to Richmond, and on one occasion he was arrested there for a delinquency owed to a loan company. The immediate problem was solved with the intervention of St. George. Tucker economized for two years, living a rural life with the Carters and other family and was able to purchase a home near the Dan River.

In May 1808 the family moved to "Woodbridge" in Pittsylvania County, where daughter Eliza was born in December. Maria was then faced with rearing four children in more rural, less favorable living conditions. For his part, Tucker was disappointed with an absence of the desired social life. While he thought all his neighbors "friendly and civil", they were also "unpolished and plain". With an increased effort in his law practice, Tucker discovered more success and acquired more clients, spread across four counties. He was also elected Commonwealth's Attorney for Pittsylvania county. Maria gave birth to daughter Lelia in October 1810 and Harriett in May 1813.
In 1811, Tucker was in Richmond to attend a benefit performance, and put his life in danger during the infamous <a href="Richmond%20Theatre%20fire">Richmond Theatre fire</a>. The event, including a play entitled <a href="Le%20p%C3%A8re%20de%20famille">"The Father, or Family Feuds"</a> and a pantomime afterwards named <a href="The%20Monk">"Raymond and Agnes</a>, was held in December. It being Christmas time, the auditorium was packed—with 518 adults and 80 children.

In his autobiography Tucker relates that, "The play was over... and there appearing to be much delay in bringing on the afterpiece... I had fortunately quitted the [play]house while it was on fire, tho' I did not know the fact... but the cry of fire prevented my reaching my lodgings, and hurried me back to witness a spectacle of human woe which I have never seen equalled. I was instrumental in saving several females from the flames." In the process, he suffered a head injury when struck by a falling timber, and was left with a permanent scar above his eye. The tragedy took the lives of 72 people, including the sitting Governor of Virginia <a href="George%20William%20Smith%20%28politician%29">George William Smith</a>. Victims also included many of the upper echelons in Richmond society.

Tucker's maritime roots in Bermuda instilled an interest in navigation, and he began an intense campaign with the legislatures of North Carolina and Virginia to improve the waterways to Norfolk along the Roanoke, Dan, and Staunton Rivers, in order to avoid inefficient portage required to Petersburg and Richmond. This effort culminated in his own bids for election to a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Pittsylvania County, which failed in 1813 and 1814 but then succeeded in 1816. Tucker and Maria then suffered the first loss of a child, Harriett, from whooping cough at age three.

Tucker continued his work in literature along with that in the law, and in 1814–1815 the Philadelphia "Port Folio" published a series of his essays entitled "Thoughts of a Hermit". Financial success was for once his as a result of these endeavors; he also realized profits from land sales near the Dan River, and the sale of Woodbridge when the family moved again, to <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Virginia">Lynchburg, Virginia</a> in 1818.

The death of daughter Harriett had been painful enough, but Maria's depression became uncontrollable and chronic when daughter Rosalie died unexpectedly at age 14 in 1818. Also during this period Maria's father, Charles Carter, encountered his own financial setbacks, and prevailed upon Tucker for assistance; Tucker, with the help of <a href="Lawrence%20Lewis%20%281767-1839%29">Lawrence Lewis</a>, was able to settle the Carters at "Deerwood", sharing part of the profits from Charles' management there.

With financial success came more clients and opportunities to serve his community. Tucker received many cases in debt collection, and he was appointed trustee of the Lynchburg Female Academy and vestryman at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. Tucker was also elected to serve in the United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825, representing the Lynchburg area in the <a href="16th%20United%20States%20Congress">16th</a>, <a href="17th%20United%20States%20Congress">17th</a>, and <a href="18th%20United%20States%20Congress">18th United States Congress</a>es. His financial largess was short-lived, as Tucker was unable to resist the allure of society and lavish living in Washington, not to mention the increased expenses of a larger immediate family.

Though Tucker and Maria were warned against her having more children in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled his face with a handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.

Due in part to these personal trials, he made no momentous contributions to Congress beyond his reliable positions representing Virginia's interests, with a consistent Jeffersonian Republican voting record. He did serve as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War. There are notable disparities between Tucker's more statist voting record and the nationalism predominant in his writings during this period and later. In his essay "On Instructions to Representatives", he provides an explanation in political theory—an inevitable obligation to think one way and yet vote another, in compliance with constituent preferences.

Near the end of Tucker's third congressional term in 1824, Thomas Jefferson presented him with an offer on behalf of the fledgling University of Virginia, sanctioned by Trustees <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> and Joseph C. Cabell, to serve as the first Professor of Moral Philosophy. The offer met the school's desire to appoint a non-Federalist to the post, and Tucker's connections with Cabell and St. George would also have facilitated his selection. Another factor was Tucker's recent 1822 "Essays on Various Subjects of Taste, Morals, and National Policy", which included papers from the "Port Folio". Madison had been provided a copy of these and recommended them to Jefferson, saying they were "among the best answers to the charges of our national ...backwardness." Tucker's selection may as well have been an accommodation to some of the school's opponents, including Episcopalians, Federalists, and notable western Virginians, many of whom were friends of Tucker's. Presumably, his prior monetary indiscretions were overlooked since no related formal charges were extant.

From Tucker's perspective, the offer was most opportune, as he considered his congressional seat in jeopardy, as well as his pocketbook. The professorship included a steady income, extra fees from philosophy students, tenure, and rent-free quarters on the <a href="The%20Lawn">University Lawn</a>. Tucker accepted the offer, effective in 1825, and also was chosen chairman of the faculty. As well as his primary discipline, he also assumed charge of the subjects of Political Economics and Rhetoric for the University. He was content with family life in Charlottesville, Virginia, though he "found solitude unbearable" after Maria's death and began an earnest search for a wife, whom he found in Louisa A. Thompson, a widow from Baltimore. In their thirty years together Tucker later said he had found "the same warmth and devoted affection with which I have been previously blest".

Tucker’s primary philosophical interest was what he and his contemporaries called “mental philosophy”, which involved the investigation of the principles and faculties of the human mind. He maintained that modern philosophers had acquired the discipline to free themselves from medieval “mysticism and folly,” in the same manner that modern chemists have cast aside <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>.

Tucker's effectiveness in the lecture hall is not objectively certain, and he may well have encountered difficulty with public speaking as he had in the courtroom previously. His continued faculty chairmanship certainly testified to his relative popularity among colleagues, and he published numerous works—including one satire, a fiction, three books on economics and statistics, a Jefferson biography, as well as two pamphlets. Together with Robley Dunglison he founded and edited the "Virginia Literary Museum" (1829–1830) in which he published voluminous writings; and he frequently sent essays to newspapers and magazines.

Some of Tucker's writing reflected a growing political skepticism of the workings of democracy beginning with the 1796 election. By the late 1820s, he was persuaded that political leadership positions should be reserved primarily for prosperous people with a tangible, and taxable, interest in government. <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">election in 1828</a> was for Tucker an example of the "triumph of democratic demagoguery which could bring about class warfare." Tucker worked arduously in Virginia to oppose Jackson and was a solid supporter of <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, with his second choice being <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>.

He opposed <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>, and favored limiting the franchise to half of free men, and allowing slaveholders to cast votes on behalf of three-fifths of their slaves; he also argued in favor of eliminating the <a href="secret%20ballot">secret ballot</a>. Tucker also promoted the <a href="Second%20National%20Bank">Second National Bank</a> and strongly criticized Jackson for defunding it.

Tucker's premier literary work was "The Valley of Shenandoah" (1824), the first fictional tale of life in Virginia. In relating the downfall of an aristocratic family in the Commonwealth's valley, it drew upon his personal witness of the financial ruin of his in-laws, the family of Charles Carter, and described the inability of an estate owner to manage his monetary affairs, such as he had personally experienced. Tucker further used the novel's characters, again reflecting personal experience, to emphasize that happiness in love and life resulted from the moderation of one's passions. "The Valley" stressed Tucker's professorial objective, that history must inform the reader with "the progress of society and the arts of civilization; with the advancement and decline of literature, laws, manners and commerce." He also conveyed through the fiction his view that gentility was independent of wealth, that the relationship between masters and slaves was imbued with mutual trust and happiness, and that the strong currents of socio-economic change were on the whole beneficent.

Using the pseudonym Joseph Atterley, in 1827 he wrote the satire "A Voyage to the Moon: With Some Account of the Manners and Customs, Science and Philosophy, of the People of Morosofia, and Other Lunarians". It is one of the earliest American works of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, and was relatively successful, earning Tucker $100 from the sale of 1000 copies. It received positive reviews from the "American Quarterly Review" and the "Western Monthly Review". Tucker uses "The Voyage" to ridicule the social manners, religion and professions of some of his colleagues, and to criticize some erroneous scientific methods and results apparent to him at the time.

In 1836, Tucker completed his manuscript of a comprehensive biography, "The Life of Thomas Jefferson, Third President of the United States". He sent his composition to James Madison for his approval, as the latter had assisted in its formation. Tucker included for his sanction a proposed dedication to the recipient. Madison replied with his full approbation and signature on June 26, 1836, just hours before his death the following day.

This premier study of the life of Jefferson was published in two volumes the following year, and received complimentary assessment in the "Edinburgh Review" from <a href="Henry%20Brougham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brougham%20and%20Vaux">Lord Brougham</a>, as "a very valuable addition to the stock of our political and historical knowledge. In it, Professor Tucker does not always accord with the illustrious subject of his biography. The work, indeed, manifests a laudable desire to do justice, and to decide impartially on contested topics; and hence, perhaps, it failed to give satisfaction to the ardent supporters, as well as to the bitter opponents, of Mr. Jefferson."

Tucker considered a trip abroad would enhance his insight and resume generally, and specifically prepare him for a possible, though not likely, diplomatic appointment. He expected there was much to be learned for his country's benefit in the British factories, great estates and crowded cities. With his finances in order and a three-month leave from the university, in 1839 he made a trip to Great Britain and after some time in Shakespeare country, <a href="Stratford-Upon-Avon">Stratford-Upon-Avon</a>, he settled in Liverpool. He did not succeed in making all the expected social connections, with the exception of the <a href="Thomas%20Coke%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Leicester%20%28seventh%20creation%29">1st Earl of Leicester</a> and his wife, with whom he frequently discussed politics and agriculture. Though admiring the succinct debates in Parliament, he found Queen Victoria's procession "more fit to amuse a child than one of my age". On the whole he found conversation did not come easy with the British, and concluded "there were more churls in England than in all of Europe besides." This journey, along with his interest in the doctrines of <a href="Thomas%20Robert%20Malthus">Thomas Robert Malthus</a> on populace, inspired Tucker to expound upon the mixed blessings of a prospective urbanized world. Some of his hypotheses were included in "The Progress of the United States in Population and Wealth" (Boston, 1843). This work gained him one of his proudest honors, a membership in the Statistical Society of Paris.

His enthusiasm for teaching at the university ebbed in his final years there. He was also perturbed by an increase in religious enthusiasm on campus and a <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance movement</a>, which he mildly protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary.

With the death of his last contemporary on the faculty in 1845, Tucker resigned his professorship and moved to Philadelphia, where he enjoyed the availability of more libraries, meetings at the American Philosophical Society and a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison. Nevertheless, there were drawbacks – for one, the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him—he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville. He later expressed doubt about the wisdom of the latter decision when he learned that three of them had, by law, been exiled from Virginia, and shortly thereafter died. As well, the two freed slaves who accompanied him to Philadelphia immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there.

Social life in the urban setting did not initially live up to his expectations, but after a time his writing and lecturing upon a variety of subjects filled the void. He also joined The American Institute for the Advancement of Science and successfully urged its members to establish a section on Political Economics and Statistics. He as well engaged in a debate, as antagonist of <a href="Malthusianism">Malthusian population theory</a> with proponent Alexander Everett.

In 1856, Tucker completed his four-volume "History of the United States, From Their Colonization to the End of the 26th Congress, in 1841". <a href="Robley%20Dunglison">Robley Dunglison</a> commented as follows on the work: "To aid him in the execution of his work, as [Tucker] himself remarks, it had been his good fortune to have a personal knowledge of many, who bore a conspicuous part in the Revolution, and of nearly all those who were the principal actors in the political dramas which succeeded. The history extends to the elevation of General <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> to the Presidency in 1841, which is as far as Tucker thought he could prudently go." The work includes a brief review of slavery, in which Tucker took issue with Jefferson's decades-old view in his "Notes on the State of Virginia" (1781), that slavery still had a degenerative effect upon slaveholders.

Though Tucker may have displayed in his old age "a spirit of pugnacity becoming earlier years", as one critic claimed, such a nature was not in evidence with his family. He corresponded positively and frequently with his children and vacationed with them in the summers in Virginia and New York. He appears to have been consistent in his devotion to his family, which was returned by them in kind. And his exchanges with them were replete with a concern for their financial well being. Musing his own past errors, he told them that "except for the loss of friends, a want of prudence in money matters has contributed nine tenths of the pain and vexation of [my] life".

Even after the death of his wife Louisa in 1858, Tucker's vitality persisted and, not long before the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> began, in January 1861 he journeyed south through Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia to Alabama to visit a friend in Mobile. In reaction to Georgia's secession from the union, speaking from his lingering southern loyalty, he commented, "it seems a poor remedy for an unpopular President". He thought the overriding need for "a wise provident government" would bring the southern states back under a modified constitution. But after some time spent in the south, he was compelled to say the people "seemed to be crazed in the fancies of imaginary evils and their strange remedies." Indeed, Tucker's youthful loyalties to the agrarian south had in his own maturation given way to a belief in the necessity and value of a commercial-industrial society. Nationalism had become the foundation of his politics over statism, and he could not understand why a compromise in lieu of war would not be embraced.

Tucker sustained head injuries at Mobile Bay when, awaiting his ship's departure for return to the north, he was struck by a large bale of cotton being loaded on board. He was moved to the home of daughter Eleanor and husband George Rives in <a href="Albemarle%20County%2C%20Virginia">Albemarle County, Virginia</a>, where he died on April 10, 1861, two days prior to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">Battle of Fort Sumter</a> and the beginning of the American Civil War. He was buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery.

Ontario Highway 420

King's Highway 420, commonly referred to as Highway 420, is a <a href="400-series%20highway">400-series highway</a> in the <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">Canadian province</a> of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> that connects the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Way">Queen Elizabeth Way</a> (QEW) with downtown <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Niagara Falls</a>. It continues east as a limited-access expressway named Niagara Regional Road 420 to connect with the <a href="Rainbow%20Bridge%20%28Niagara%20Falls%29">Rainbow Bridge</a> international crossing between Canada and the United States over the <a href="Niagara%20River">Niagara River</a>; this was part of Highway 420 until 1998. West of the QEW, the freeway ends at an <a href="at-grade%20intersection">at-grade intersection</a> with Montrose Road (Niagara Regional Road 98). The highway has a speed limit of , making it the only 400-series highway to have a speed limit less than for its entirety.

Originally constructed as a divided four-lane road with two <a href="traffic%20circle">traffic circle</a>s, the route of Highway 420 formed part of the QEW between 1941 and 1972 before being assigned a unique <a href="route%20number">route number</a>. This took place during the reconstruction of the four-lane divided highway into a freeway and the construction of the large interchange at the freeway's western terminus. In 1998, the section of Highway 420 east of Stanley Avenue was transferred to the responsibility of the <a href="Regional%20Municipality%20of%20Niagara">Regional Municipality of Niagara</a> and redesignated as Regional Road 420.

At , Highway 420 is the shortest <a href="400-series%20highway">400-series highway</a>, travelling through Niagara Falls from Montrose Road to Stanley Avenue, on the outskirts of the city's tourist district. East of Stanley Avenue (Regional Road 102) the highway becomes Niagara Regional Road 420 and is known as Falls Avenue and Newman Hill on approach to the Rainbow Bridge. This portion was designated a part of Highway 420 until 2000, when it was transferred to the City of Niagara Falls and the Regional Municipality of Niagara, although the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) still assists with the maintenance of it under a <a href="Connecting%20Link">Connecting Link</a> agreement.
East of Drummond Road,
Highway 420 features stylized light fixtures with the letters "ER", which stand for "Elizabeth Regina" and are a tribute to <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">The Queen Mother</a>.

Highway 420 begins in the west at a signalized intersection with Montrose Road (Regional Road 98), beyond which it continues as Watson Street through the residential neighbourhood of Greens Corners to Beaverdams Road (Regional Road 53).
East of Montrose Road, the highway is a four lane roadway divided by a raised paved <a href="central%20reservation">median</a>, and passes north of a forest as it approaches an <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">interchange</a> with the QEW. As well as a <a href="partial%20cloverleaf%20interchange">partial cloverleaf interchange</a> that provides almost all directional movements, this four-level <a href="stack%20interchange">stack interchange</a> features two <a href="overpass">flyovers</a> that arc from south to east as well as a four lane mainline that curves from north to east, directing most westbound Highway 420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW.
East of the QEW, Highway 420 encounters an interchange with Dorchester Road as both cross the <a href="Queenston-Chippawa%20Power%20Canal">Queenston-Chippawa Power Canal</a>.
This interchange was originally a <a href="traffic%20circle">traffic circle</a> that was removed in the early 1970s. The numerous lanes from the stack interchange to the west begin to converge between residential subdivisions east of Dorchester Road, gradually narrowing to four through lanes at the Drummond Road interchange. After passing beneath Portage Road, the route widens on approach to an <a href="at-grade">at-grade</a> intersection with Stanley Avenue. This intersection is the eastern end of both the freeway segment of the route and the signed King's Highway 420; east of Stanley Avenue the route is signed as Niagara Regional Road 420 and known as Falls Avenue.

Now separated by a landscaped median, the route progresses eastward, intersecting MacDonald Avenue and providing access to several residential and retail properties that adjoin the road. The route travels within a concrete trench and abruptly curves to the southeast as it passes beneath Victoria Avenue, with which there is a simple interchange. East of this point, the road was named Newman Hill until March 2012. Palmer Avenue and Ontario Avenue pass over the route as it descends a hill towards the <a href="Niagara%20Gorge">Niagara Gorge</a>. At the bottom, the route curves to the southwest, where it provides access to the Rainbow Bridge border crossing into the United States as well as the tourist district of the city.

Due to its association with the number <a href="420%20%28cannabis%20culture%29">420</a> in <a href="cannabis%20culture">cannabis culture</a>, Highway 420 is also the location for the annual Cannabis Conference and Protest, usually taking place sometime around April 20. The event includes a march beginning near Niagara Falls and travelling to Highway 420.

The history of Highway 420 predates its designation by nearly 75 years, tied in with the crossing of the Niagara Gorge between the twin cities of Niagara Falls. The first level crossing between the two cities was the Honeymoon Bridge, constructed in 1898. The wide structure spanned between the Canadian and American sides, above the <a href="Niagara%20River">Niagara River</a>. Its narrow design proved to be a fatal flaw, and on January 27, 1938, under the weight of a massive ice jam in the river, the structure collapsed.
A day later, the owners of the previous bridge — the <a href="International%20Railway%20%28New%20York%20%E2%80%93%20Ontario%29">International Railway Company</a> (IRC) — as well as the Minister of Highways <a href="Thomas%20Baker%20McQuesten">Thomas Baker McQuesten</a> announced intentions to construct a new span; a long political battle ensued for several years over the merits of private or public ownership of border crossings. In the end, the <a href="Niagara%20Falls%20Bridge%20Commission">Niagara Falls Bridge Commission</a> (NFBC) paid the IRC $615,000 to purchase the right-of-way of the old bridge as well as the rights to construct the new one.
The future Rainbow Bridge was royally dedicated by <a href="King%20George%20VI">King George VI</a> and <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Elizabeth</a> on June 7, 1939, just hours after the couple dedicated the QEW.

On May 16, 1940, Samuel Johnson, the vice-chair of the NFBC, and McQuesten, who along with his parliamentary role was chair of the commission, ceremonially turned the first sod for the new bridge using a two-handled shovel.
Construction had begun two weeks earlier on May 4.
The new bridge was assembled over the following 18 months; the design was prepared by New York engineering firm Waddell & Hardesty and supervised by the Edward Lupfer Corporation, the latter the designers of the <a href="Peace%20Bridge">Peace Bridge</a>.
The new structure was located downstream from the Honeymoon Bridge, as the gorge is slightly wider at that point, resulting in a span.

Meanwhile, McQuesten was overseeing construction of the QEW between Toronto and Fort Erie. The new <a href="dual%20highway">dual highway</a>, inspired by <a href="Autobahn">German Autobahns</a>, was the first of its kind in Canada.
The outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in September 1939 temporarily halted McQuesten's ambitions, as funding was quickly shifted to the war effort. As a result, construction on the new superhighway was put on hold south of Niagara Falls. McQuesten officially opened the QEW on August 23, 1940; the pavement ended south of Lundy's Lane. Despite the war, work began on a link between the highway and the Rainbow Bridge through the centre of Niagara Falls. This link would not be completed in time for the opening of the new bridge.

On November 1, 1941, the Rainbow Bridge was officially opened during a simple ceremony. The oldest living couple known to have wed in Niagara Falls, a pair from <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, were the first to cross, followed by a newlywed couple from <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>. This symbolically tied the history of the two bridges together, and was followed by McQuesten and Johnson walking towards the centre of the structure from the Canadian and American sides, respectively, and shaking hands at the centre. Several pyrotechnic explosions at both ends capped the ceremony, and the bridge was opened to traffic.
Work continued on the four lane bridge approach throughout 1941, and by mid-1942 it was possible to drive directly from the bridge onto the QEW. The new link featured a traffic circle at Dorchester Road as well as at the QEW.
Four gravel lanes opened between Niagara Falls and Fort Erie during the summer of 1941, becoming the main route of the QEW. As a result, what would become Highway 420 was referred to by several names, including the Queen Elizabeth Way Extension (and known by locals for decades as the "Queen E Extension")
and the Rainbow Bridge Approach.

During the mid-1960s, the <a href="Department%20of%20Highways">Department of Highways</a> examined the possibility of extending the freeway portion of the route east towards the Rainbow Bridge. They began to purchase properties lining Roberts Street in 1966.
In 1971, construction began on a three-level stack interchange between the QEW and the Rainbow Bridge Approach. This removed the two traffic circles along the approach.
The interchange between the QEW and Lundy's Lane (Highway 20) was also removed; instead, the new stack interchange included access to Montrose Road.
By April 1972, the Rainbow Bridge Approach was designated as Highway 420.

In 1998, the Niagara Falls Transportation Study was released, recommending that Roberts Street be rebuilt as a gateway to the city as opposed to a freeway. Highway 420 east of Stanley Avenue was transferred to Niagara Region.
While the section near the QEW junction has high-mast lighting, like other provincial freeways, the rest of the route (including Regional Road 420) had the "ER" lightposts, to commemorate the route's historical status as the original routing of the QEW and its historical tie to the <a href="Elizabeth%20Bowes-Lyon">Queen Mother</a>.

On September 23, 2010, Highway 420 was designated as the Niagara Veterans Memorial Highway.
On January 31, 2012, Niagara Regional Council approved the renaming of Roberts Street and Newman Hill as an extension of Falls Avenue, beginning March 1. Prior to this, Falls Avenue curved into Newman Hill at the Rainbow Bridge.

Westminster Assembly

The Westminster Assembly of Divines was a council of <a href="Divinity%20%28academic%20discipline%29">divines</a> (theologians) and members of the <a href="English%20Parliament">English Parliament</a> appointed from 1643 to 1653 to restructure the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. Several Scots also attended, and the Assembly's work was adopted by the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>. As many as 121 ministers were called to the Assembly, with nineteen others added later to replace those who did not attend or could no longer attend. It produced a new <a href="Form%20of%20Presbyterial%20Church%20Government">Form of Church Government</a>, a <a href="Westminster%20Confession%20of%20Faith">Confession of Faith</a> or statement of belief, two <a href="catechism">catechism</a>s or manuals for religious instruction (<a href="Westminster%20Shorter%20Catechism">Shorter</a> and <a href="Westminster%20Larger%20Catechism">Larger</a>), and a liturgical manual, the "<a href="Directory%20for%20Public%20Worship">Directory for Public Worship</a>", for the Churches of England and Scotland. The Confession and catechisms were adopted as doctrinal standards in the Church of Scotland and other <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> churches, where they remain normative. Amended versions of the Confession were also adopted in <a href="Congregational">Congregational</a> and <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> churches in England and <a href="New%20England">New England</a> in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Confession became influential throughout the English-speaking world, but especially in American Protestant theology.

The Assembly was called by the <a href="Long%20Parliament">Long Parliament</a> before and during the beginning of the <a href="First%20English%20Civil%20War">First English Civil War</a>. The Long Parliament was influenced by <a href="Puritanism">Puritanism</a>, a religious movement which sought to further reform the church. They were opposed to the religious policies of King <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> and <a href="William%20Laud">William Laud</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. As part of <a href="Solemn%20League%20and%20Covenant">a military alliance</a> with <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, Parliament agreed that the outcome of the Assembly would bring the English Church into closer conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Church was governed by a system of elected assemblies of elders called <a href="presbyterian%20polity">presbyterianism</a>, rather than rule by <a href="bishops">bishops</a>, called <a href="episcopal%20church%20government">episcopalianism</a>, which was used in the English church. Scottish <a href="commissioner">commissioner</a>s attended and advised the Assembly as part of the agreement. Disagreements over church government caused open division in the Assembly, despite attempts to maintain unity. The party of divines who favoured presbyterianism was in the majority, but the <a href="congregational%20polity">congregationalist</a> party, which held greater influence in the military, favoured autonomy for individual congregations rather than the subjection of congregations to regional and national assemblies entailed in presbyterianism. Parliament eventually adopted a presbyterian form of government but lacked the power to implement it. During the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a> of the monarchy in 1660, all of the documents of the Assembly were repudiated and episcopal church government was reinstated in England.

The Assembly worked in the <a href="Reformed%20Protestant">Reformed Protestant</a> theological tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of <a href="predestination">predestination</a> — that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of <a href="particular%20redemption">particular redemption</a> — that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed <a href="covenant%20theology">covenant theology</a>, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession is the first of the <a href="Reformed%20confessions">Reformed confessions</a> to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the <a href="fall%20of%20man">fall of man</a>, God promised eternal life to <a href="Adam">Adam</a> on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.

<a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> called the Westminster Assembly during a time of increasing hostility between <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, monarch of England and Scotland, and the <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>s. Puritans could be distinguished by their insistence that worship practices be supported implicitly or explicitly by the Bible, while their opponents gave greater authority to traditional customs. They believed the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, which had separated itself from the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> during the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, was still too heavily influenced by Catholicism. They sought to rid the church and nation of any of these remaining influences. This included the Church's <a href="episcopal%20polity">episcopal polity</a>, or rule by a hierarchy of <a href="bishops">bishops</a>. Puritans, unlike <a href="separatist">separatist</a>s, did not leave the established church. Under Charles, the Puritans' opponents were placed in high positions of authority, most notably <a href="William%20Laud">William Laud</a> who was made <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> in 1633, even though these "<a href="high%20churchmen">high churchmen</a>" were in the minority. Puritans were forced to keep their views private or face fines and imprisonment. Laud promoted advocates of <a href="Arminianism">Arminianism</a>, a theological perspective opposed to the <a href="Reformed">Reformed</a> theology of the Puritans. Worship practices such as kneeling at communion, bowing at the name of Christ, and the placement of communion tables at the East end of churches were also reinstated. To the Puritans, these seemed to be a step in the direction of Catholicism.

There were also conflicts between the king and the <a href="Scottish%20people">Scots</a>, whose church was ruled by a system known as <a href="presbyterian%20polity">presbyterianism</a>, which features elected assemblies. <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James</a>, Charles's predecessor as <a href="King%20of%20Scotland">King of Scotland</a>, made it clear that he intended to impose elements of episcopal church government and the <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a> on the Scots beginning in 1604. The Scots considered this a reversion to Roman Catholicism. Charles furthered English impositions on the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> in 1636 and 1637. This led to the <a href="First%20Bishops%27%20War">First Bishops' War</a> between Charles and the Scots in 1639. Charles called what came to be known as the <a href="Short%20Parliament">Short Parliament</a> to raise funds for the war, but he soon dissolved it when it began voicing opposition to his policies. Following the <a href="Second%20Bishops%27%20War">Second Bishops' War</a> with the Scots in 1640, Charles was forced to call another parliament to raise additional funds.

What came to be known as the <a href="Long%20Parliament">Long Parliament</a> also began to voice vague grievances against Charles, many of which were religious in nature. Parliament had many Puritans and Puritan-sympathizing members, who generally opposed the existing episcopal system, but there was little agreement over what shape the church should take. Later in 1640, the <a href="Root%20and%20Branch%20petition">Root and Branch petition</a> was presented to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">House of Commons</a>, the lower house of Parliament. It was signed by about 15,000 Londoners and called for total elimination of the episcopal system. Committees were organized in the House of Commons to enact religious reforms, leading to the imprisonment of Archbishop Laud and his supporters in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> as retaliation for their repression of Puritans. The <a href="Court%20of%20High%20Commission">Court of High Commission</a> and the <a href="Star%20Chamber">Star Chamber</a>, courts which had inflicted severe punishments on Puritan dissenters, were also abolished.

The idea of a national assembly of theologians to advise Parliament on further church reforms was first presented to the House of Commons in 1641. Such a proposal was also included in the <a href="Grand%20Remonstrance">Grand Remonstrance</a>, a list of grievances which Parliament presented to Charles on 1 December that year. Charles responded on 23 December that the church required no reforms. Undeterred, Parliament passed three bills in 1642 appointing an assembly and stipulating that its members would be chosen by Parliament. Charles, whose <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> was required for the bills to become law, was only willing to consider such an assembly if the members were chosen by the clergy. This was the practice for selection of members of <a href="Convocations%20of%20Canterbury%20and%20York">Convocation</a>, the assembly of clergy of the Church of England.

Defying the king, between 12 February and 20 April 1642, each <a href="county%20of%20England">county delegation of England</a> in the Commons chose two divines, in addition to two for each <a href="historic%20counties%20of%20Wales">county of Wales</a>, four for <a href="London">London</a>, and two for each University (<a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a>). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this way to ensure that their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14 May, to which the Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the <a href="Royal%20Standards%20of%20England">royal standard</a> at <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> on 22 August, marking the beginning of the <a href="First%20English%20Civil%20War">First English Civil War</a>. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was serious about reforming the church and induce the Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.
Parliament finally passed an ordinance to hold the assembly on its own authority without Charles's assent on 12 June 1643. It named as many as <a href="List%20of%20members%20of%20the%20Westminster%20Assembly">121 ministers</a> and thirty non-voting parliamentary observers: twenty from the Commons, and ten from the House of Lords. The Assembly was almost entirely English; Parliament appointed Englishmen for the counties of Wales, but the French <a href="stranger%20church">stranger church</a>es (churches of Protestant refugees from Catholic France) sent two ministers in place of any from the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a>. Many of the divines were internationally recognized scholars of the Bible, ancient languages, <a href="patristics">patristics</a>, and <a href="scholastic%20theology">scholastic theology</a>. Many were also famous preachers. Most of these theologians had retained their positions in the Church during the tenure of William Laud. Some had been ejected from their churches or cited by ecclesiastical courts for their views. Some had fled to the <a href="Continental%20Europe">Continent</a>, and one to the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">American colonies</a>. Nonetheless, they all considered themselves members of the Church of England and had received episcopal ordination. Most were <a href="conformist">conformist</a>s, meaning they agreed to follow the <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201558">Act of Uniformity 1558</a> and the Book of Common Prayer.

The Assembly was strictly under the control of Parliament, and was only to debate topics which Parliament directed. Assembly members were not permitted to state their disagreements with majority opinions or share any information about the proceedings, except in writing to Parliament. Parliament chose <a href="William%20Twisse">William Twisse</a>, an internationally respected theologian, to be the Assembly's <a href="prolocutor">prolocutor</a> or <a href="chairman">chairman</a>. Due to Twisse's ill health, <a href="Cornelius%20Burges">Cornelius Burges</a>, whom Parliament appointed as one of several <a href="assessor%20%28law%29">assessor</a>s, served as prolocutor "pro tempore" for most of the Assembly. Twenty-two appointed members of the Assembly died before 1649, and they along with those who did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members. Three non-voting scribes were also added in 1643.

The Assembly's first meeting began with a sermon by William Twisse in the <a href="nave">nave</a> of <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on 1 July 1643. The nave was so full that the House of Commons had to send members ahead to secure seats. Following the sermon, the divines <a href="procession">processed</a> to the <a href="Henry%20VII%20Chapel">Henry VII Chapel</a>, which would be their place of meeting until 2 October when they moved to the warmer and more private <a href="Jerusalem%20Chamber">Jerusalem Chamber</a>. After their initial meeting they adjourned for about a week, as Parliament had not yet given specific instructions.

On 6 July, they received a set of rules from Parliament and were ordered to examine the first ten of the <a href="Thirty-Nine%20Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a>, the current doctrinal standard of the Church of England, and "to free and vindicate the Doctrine of them from all Aspersions of false Interpretations". After a day of <a href="fasting">fasting</a>, the Assembly took a vow, as directed by Parliament, to "not maintain any thing in Matters of Doctrine, but what I think, in my conscience, to be truth". The divines organized themselves into three standing committees, though each committee was open to any member of the Assembly. The committees would be assigned topics and prepare propositions for debate in the full Assembly following each morning of committee meetings. In addition, over 200 "ad hoc" committees were appointed for tasks such as examination of candidate preachers, college <a href="fellow">fellow</a>s, and suspected heretics.

The Assembly resolved, after some debate, that all the doctrines of the Thirty-Nine articles would need to be proven from the Bible. Assembly members were prone to long speeches and they made slow progress, frustrating the leadership. The eighth of the Thirty-Nine Articles recommended the <a href="Apostles%27%20Creed">Apostles' Creed</a>, <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a>, and <a href="Athanasian%20Creed">Athanasian Creed</a>, considered to be basic statements of <a href="orthodoxy">orthodoxy</a>, to be received and believed. The Assembly was unable to resolve conflicts between those who would not be bound by creeds and those who wished to retain the existing language that the creeds be "thoroughly received and believed". The "excepters", who took the former position, argued that the articles only require the "matter" of the creeds be believed. On 25 August the article was put off until the rest of the articles could be dealt with. This early disagreement on fundamental issues revealed deep rifts between different factions of the assembly.

From the beginning of the First Civil War, the Long Parliament recognized that they would need assistance from the Scots. In return for a military alliance, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Scottish Parliament</a> required the English to sign the <a href="Solemn%20League%20and%20Covenant">Solemn League and Covenant</a> in 1643, which stipulated that the English would bring their church into greater conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament sent <a href="commissioner">commissioner</a>s to London to represent Scotland's interests to the English Parliament. Eleven of these, four theologians and seven members of Parliament, were also invited to the Assembly. The commissioners were given the opportunity to become full voting members of the Assembly but declined, preferring to maintain their independence as commissioners of their own nation and church. <a href="Samuel%20Rutherford">Samuel Rutherford</a>, <a href="George%20Gillespie">George Gillespie</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Henderson%20%28theologian%29">Alexander Henderson</a> were the most outspoken of the commissioners.
On 12 October 1643, Parliament ordered the Assembly to cease work on the Thirty-Nine Articles and to begin to frame a common form of church government for the two nations. The Assembly would spend a quarter of its full sessions on the subject of church government. The majority of the Assembly members supported presbyterian polity, or church government by elected assemblies of lay and clerical representatives, though many were not dogmatically committed to it. Several members of this group, numbering about twenty and including William Twisse, favoured a "primitive" episcopacy, which would include elements of presbyterianism and a reduced role for bishops.

There were also several <a href="congregational%20polity">congregationalist</a>s, who favoured autonomy for individual local churches. Their most influential divines were <a href="Thomas%20Goodwin">Thomas Goodwin</a>, <a href="Philip%20Nye">Philip Nye</a>, <a href="Sidrach%20Simpson">Sidrach Simpson</a>, <a href="Jeremiah%20Burroughs">Jeremiah Burroughs</a>, and <a href="William%20Bridge">William Bridge</a>. They were often called the "dissenting brethren" in the Assembly. They have sometimes been labelled "Independents", but they rejected this term. The Assembly members for the most part reserved the label "Independent" for separatists who left the established church. The congregationalist divines cannot be equated with <a href="separatists">separatists</a> and <a href="Brownist">Brownist</a>s, as they had accepted episcopal ordination and remained in the Church of England. Their influence was assisted by the success of <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> and his <a href="New%20Model%20Army">New Model Army</a> in the ongoing civil war. Cromwell and many others in the army supported congregationalism.

A third group of divines were known as <a href="Erastians">Erastians</a>, a term for those who believed that the state should have significant power over the church. The entire Assembly was Erastian in the sense that the body had been called by Parliament and was completely under state control. Those labelled "Erastian" at the Assembly believed the civil authority, rather than church officers, should hold the power of <a href="church%20discipline">church discipline</a>. This included the power to withhold communion from unrepentant sinners. They did not see any particular form of church government as divinely mandated, and because of this the dissenting brethren allied with them when it became clear that a presbyterian establishment would be much less tolerant of congregationalism than Parliament. There were only two divines at the Assembly who held the Erastian view, <a href="John%20Lightfoot">John Lightfoot</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Coleman">Thomas Coleman</a>, but the presence of members of Parliament, especially <a href="John%20Selden">John Selden</a>, as well as the fact of parliamentary oversight of the Assembly, gave Erastian views disproportional influence.

Several episcopalians, supporters of the existing system of bishops, were also included in the summoning ordinance, but Parliament may have nominated them to lend greater legitimacy to the Assembly and not have expected them to attend because Charles had not approved of the Assembly. Only one, <a href="Daniel%20Featley">Daniel Featley</a>, participated, and he only until his arrest for treason in October 1643.

Debate on church officers began on 19 October. The Assembly began with the issue of ordination, as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for <a href="ordination">ordination</a> of ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional <a href="presbytery%20%28church%20polity%29">presbytery</a> for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the <a href="visible%20church">visible church</a>. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.
On 3 or 4 January 1644, the five leading dissenting brethren signalled a break with the rest of the Assembly when they published "<a href="An%20Apologeticall%20Narration">An Apologeticall Narration</a>", a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17 January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.

Despite these efforts, on 21 February it became clear just how fundamentally opposed the groups were. Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in the unity of the church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15 November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement with the rest of the Assembly to Parliament, and on 11 December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.

Relations between the Assembly and Parliament were already deteriorating in 1644, when Parliament ignored the Assembly's request that "grossly ignorant and notoriously profane" individuals be barred from communion. While members of Parliament agreed that the sacrament should be kept pure, many of them disagreed with the presbyterian majority in the Assembly over who had the final power of <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a>, taking the Erastian view that it was the state. Also, by 1646, Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had won the war on behalf of Parliament. Cromwell, along with a majority of the army, was strongly in favour of <a href="religious%20toleration">religious toleration</a> for all sorts of Christians even if the national church was to be presbyterian. His rise to power as a result of his military victories made the idea of a strictly presbyterian settlement without <a href="freedom%20of%20worship">freedom of worship</a> for others very unlikely. Parliament at least wanted to know which sins in particular were grave enough to trigger excommunication by the church; the Assembly was reticent to provide such information, as the majority considered the power of the church in this area to be absolute.
In May 1645, Parliament passed an ordinance allowing excommunicants to appeal the church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20 October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. To the majority of the divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with <a href="breach%20of%20privilege">breach of privilege</a> and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.

The Nine Queries, as they came to be called, focused on the divine right ("jure divino") of church government. While the presbyterian divines were capable of defending their vision for church government as established by divine right in the Bible, they were unwilling to answer the queries because doing so would further expose the disunity of the Assembly and weaken their case in Parliament. In July 1647, the New Model Army invaded London and conservative members of Parliament were forced out. Parliament passed an ordinance establishing religious tolerance and ensuring that the Assembly's vision of a national, compulsory presbyterian church would never come to fruition. In London, where support for presbyterianism was greatest, presbyteries were established in only sixty-four of 108 city parishes, and regional presbyterian <a href="Presbyterian%20polity%23Synod">classes</a> were only formed in fourteen of England's forty counties. A planned national <a href="Presbyterian%20general%20assembly">general assembly</a> never met. Many presbyterians did, however, establish voluntary presbyteries in what was a de facto <a href="free%20church">free church</a> situation until the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a> in 1660, when a compulsory episcopal system was reinstated.

The new Form of Government was much more acceptable to the <a href="General%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland">General Assembly of the Church of Scotland</a>. They passed it on 10 February 1645, contingent on some particularities of presbyterian government which were expected to be worked out in a forthcoming Directory for Church Government. At the same time they announced their desire to formally unite the two churches. Following the rise of Cromwell and the secret <a href="Engagers">Engagement</a> of some Scots with Charles this hope was abandoned, and the documents were never formally adopted. The General Assembly ceased to function under Cromwell and the kings who succeeded him from 1649 to 1690.

During and after the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other documents which did not cause open rifts. The "<a href="Directory%20for%20Public%20Worship">Directory for Public Worship</a>", which was to replace the "Book of Common Prayer", was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3 January 1645. The "Directory", accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians for the most part preferred a fixed <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> while congregationalists favoured <a href="extemporaneous">extemporaneous</a> prayer. The "Directory" consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a <a href="metrical%20psalter">psalter</a>, translated by <a href="Francis%20Rous">Francis Rous</a> for use in worship.

A <a href="Westminster%20Confession%20of%20Faith">Confession of Faith</a> to replace the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record of the actions of the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were significant debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20 June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.

The Assembly had already done significant work on a <a href="catechism">catechism</a> between December 1643 and January 1647 containing fifty-five questions, before it decided to create two catechisms rather than one. The <a href="Westminster%20Larger%20Catechism">Larger Catechism</a> was intended to assist ministers in teaching the Reformed faith to their congregations. The <a href="Westminster%20Shorter%20Catechism">Shorter Catechism</a> was based on the Larger Catechism but intended for use in teaching the faith to children. Parliament demanded scripture proofs for the catechisms as well. The Scots General Assembly approved both catechisms in 1648.

The Assembly understood its mandate under the Solemn League and Covenant to have been fulfilled on 14 April 1648 when it delivered the scripture citations to Parliament, and the Scottish Commissioners had already left by the end of 1647. The Assembly continued to meet primarily for the purpose of examination of ministers for ordination. Most of the divines were unhappy with the republican <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth</a> that emerged after Colonel <a href="Pride%27s%20Purge">Pride's Purge</a> of the Long Parliament in 1648. As a result, a majority stopped attending rather than agree to the oath of <a href="Engagement%20to%20the%20Commonwealth">Engagement to the Commonwealth</a> that was imposed in 1649. Newspapers continued to report on the meetings of the Assembly as late as March 1653. The Assembly must have stopped meeting sometime between then and Cromwell's dissolution of the <a href="Rump%20Parliament">Rump Parliament</a> on 20 April 1653.

The Assembly was a product of the British Reformed tradition, taking as a major source the Thirty-Nine Articles as well as the theology of <a href="James%20Ussher">James Ussher</a> and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also considered themselves to be within the broader European Reformed tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental Reformed theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustinian</a> theological tradition exemplified by <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Bradwardine">Thomas Bradwardine</a>, and <a href="John%20Wycliffe">John Wycliffe</a>. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of <a href="church%20fathers">church fathers</a> and medieval scholastic theologians.
The Confession starts with the doctrine of <a href="revelation">revelation</a>, or how people can know about God. The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature as well as the Bible, but they also believed that the Bible, or Scripture, is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of God. The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time. Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew <a href="Niqqud">vowel points</a>, marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation, of the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> were probably not part of the original. This caused significant debate between Reformed polemicists and Roman Catholics. Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative <a href="magisterium">magisterium</a> to interpret the Bible as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of <a href="perspicuity%20of%20Scripture">perspicuity</a>, that the essential teachings of the Bible could be interpreted by anyone. English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine. The divines had a strong view of the <a href="inspiration%20of%20the%20Bible">inspiration of the Bible</a>, and believed that God revealed himself in the <a href="proposition">proposition</a>s found in Scripture. While the issue of <a href="biblical%20inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a>, the belief that there are no errors in the Bible, did not arise until the eighteenth century, the divines clearly did not believe the Bible to contain any errors. Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of <a href="biblical%20inspiration">biblical inspiration</a>, believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the Hebrew text were inspired by God. On the other hand, they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles. They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration.

Puritans believed that God is sovereign over all of history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated. There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God's decree of <a href="predestination">predestination</a> to the <a href="redemption%20%28theology%29">redemption</a> purchased by Christ's death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved, a doctrine called <a href="particular%20redemption">particular redemption</a>. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as <a href="hypothetical%20universalism">hypothetical universalism</a>. <a href="Edmund%20Calamy%20the%20Elder">Edmund Calamy</a> held such a view, and he argued that Christ's death, as well as saving those who had been chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe. The Assembly's Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation.

<a href="Covenant%20theology">Covenant theology</a> is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly developed during the seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are described in terms of two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant of grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the <a href="fall%20of%20man">fall of man</a>, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the <a href="tree%20of%20knowledge%20of%20good%20and%20evil">tree of knowledge of good and evil</a>. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.

The divines associated William Laud and his followers with Catholicism, which they were even more strongly opposed to. Before the civil war, the divines saw these two groups as the greatest threat to the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled <a href="antinomians">antinomians</a>. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as no longer relevant for Christians. The divines saw these groups as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.

The work of the Westminster Assembly was repudiated by the Church of England during the Restoration in 1660. The <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201662">Act of Uniformity 1662</a>, a law requiring even greater adherence to the Book of Common Prayer and support for episcopalianism than had previously been required, forced Puritan ministers to <a href="Great%20Ejection">leave the Church</a>. Though some presbyterians continued to desire to be readmitted to the established church, <a href="Clarendon%20Code">restrictions on worship for non-conformists</a> led to presbyterians putting aside differences with congregationalists and adopting congregational church orders.

The Civil War brought with it the end of the consensus among English Protestants that there should be a single church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of <a href="denominationalism">denominationalism</a>, the doctrine that the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.
The Confession produced by the Assembly was adopted with amendments by <a href="Congregationalist">Congregationalist</a>s in England in the form of the 1658 <a href="Savoy%20Declaration">Savoy Declaration</a>, as well as by <a href="Particular%20Baptist">Particular Baptist</a>s in the form of the <a href="1689%20Baptist%20Confession">1689 Baptist Confession</a>. When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland was reestablished in 1690 following the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>, it ratified the Westminster Confession, but not any other document produced at Westminster. The Confession remains, according to the 1929 <a href="Declaratory%20Articles">Declaratory Articles</a>, the Church of Scotland's "principal <a href="subordinate%20standard">subordinate standard</a>", subordinate to the Bible. Memorization of the Shorter Catechism has been made a requirement for children in many Presbyterian churches.

The migrations and missionary efforts of each of these groups lead to the widespread significance of the Westminster Assembly throughout the English-speaking world. The Assembly's Confession was particularly influential in American Protestant theology. It was included with congregationalist changes as part of the 1648 <a href="Cambridge%20Platform">Cambridge Platform</a>, a statement produced by ministers of <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">colonial Massachusetts</a> and the surrounding region, and again in <a href="Connecticut%20Colony">colonial Connecticut</a> as part of the 1708 <a href="Saybrook%20Platform">Saybrook Platform</a>. The Confession was modified for American Baptists in the 1707 <a href="Philadelphia%20Confession">Philadelphia Confession</a>. The <a href="Adopting%20Act%20of%201729">Adopting Act of 1729</a> required <a href="American%20Presbyterian">American Presbyterian</a>s to agree to the theology of the Assembly's Confession, and the Confession remains a part of the <a href="Presbyterian%20Church%20%28USA%29">Presbyterian Church (USA)</a>'s "<a href="Book%20of%20Confessions">Book of Confessions</a>". The Confession has been called "by far the most influential doctrinal symbol in American Protestant history" by the historian of religion <a href="Sydney%20E.%20Ahlstrom">Sydney E. Ahlstrom</a>.

Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)

Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) is the seventh <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by English <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="the%20Kinks">the Kinks</a>, released in October 1969. Kinks frontman <a href="Ray%20Davies">Ray Davies</a> constructed the <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a> as the soundtrack to a <a href="Granada%20Television">Granada Television</a> play and developed the storyline with novelist <a href="Julian%20Mitchell">Julian Mitchell</a>; however, the television programme was cancelled and never produced. The rough plot revolved around Arthur Morgan, a carpet-layer, who was based on Ray and guitarist <a href="Dave%20Davies">Dave Davies</a>' brother-in-law Arthur Anning. A mono version was released in the UK, but not in the US. It is now available on the 2011 deluxe-edition re-issue.

"Arthur" was met with nearly unanimous acclaim upon release. It received generous coverage in the US rock press, with articles running in underground magazines such as "Fusion" and "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>". It garnered back-to-back reviews by Mike Daly and <a href="Greil%20Marcus">Greil Marcus</a> in "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine's lead section; Daly rated it "the Kinks' finest hour", and Marcus ranked it "the best British album of 1969". Reviews in the UK were also positive. Although "Arthur" received a mixed review in "<a href="New%20Musical%20Express">New Musical Express</a>", "Disc & Music Echo" praised the album's musical integrity, and "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" called it "Ray Davies' finest hour ... beautifully British to the core".

The album, although not very successful commercially, was a return to the charts in the US for the band. Their previous effort, "<a href="The%20Kinks%20Are%20the%20Village%20Green%20Preservation%20Society">The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</a>", received acclaim from critics but failed to chart in any country upon its 1968 release, with total US sales estimated at under 25,000 copies. The Kinks returned to the "<a href="Billboard%20charts">Billboard</a>" charts in 1969 after a two-year absence, with the lead single from the record, "<a href="Victoria%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">Victoria</a>", peaking at number 62. The album itself reached number 50 on the "<a href="Record%20World">Record World</a>" charts, and number 105 on "Billboard", their highest position since 1965. It failed to chart in Britain. "Arthur" paved the way for the further success of their 1970 comeback album "<a href="Lola%20Versus%20Powerman%20and%20the%20Moneygoround%2C%20Part%20One">Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One</a>" and its accompanying US Top 10 and UK Top 5 hit "<a href="Lola%20%28song%29">Lola</a>".

British production company <a href="Granada%20Television">Granada TV</a> approached <a href="Ray%20Davies">Ray Davies</a> in early January 1969, expressing interest in developing a movie or <a href="Television%20play">play for television</a>. Davies was to collaborate with writer <a href="Julian%20Mitchell">Julian Mitchell</a> on the "experimental" programme, with a soundtrack by the Kinks to be released on an accompanying <a href="LP%20album">LP</a>. Agreements were finalised on 8 January, but the project was not revealed until a press release on 10 March. Separately, the Kinks began work on the programme's companion record, entitled "Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)". Development of "Arthur" occurred during a rough period for the band, due to the commercial failure of their previous album "<a href="The%20Kinks%20Are%20the%20Village%20Green%20Preservation%20Society">The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</a>" and the subsequent <a href="Single%20%28music%29">single</a>, "<a href="Plastic%20Man%20%28song%29">Plastic Man</a>", as well as the departure of founding member and bassist <a href="Pete%20Quaife">Pete Quaife</a>. In early 1969, Quaife had told the band he was quitting, though the other members did not take the remark seriously. When an article in the "<a href="New%20Musical%20Express">New Musical Express</a>" mentioned Maple Oak, the band that he had formed without the rest of the Kinks' knowledge, Davies unsuccessfully asked Quaife to return for the upcoming sessions of "Arthur". As a replacement, Davies called up bassist John Dalton, who had previously filled in for Quaife.

Davies travelled to United Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California on 11 April 1969, to produce American pop band <a href="The%20Turtles">The Turtles</a>' LP "<a href="Turtle%20Soup">Turtle Soup</a>" with engineer Chuck Britz. While in Los Angeles, Davies helped negotiate an end to the concert ban placed on the Kinks by the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Musicians">American Federation of Musicians</a> in 1965. Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. After negotiations with Davies, the Federation relented, opening up an opportunity for the group to return to touring in America. Once the main sessions for the Turtles LP were completed, Davies returned to England. While Davies was abroad, the other members of the band had been rehearsing and practising for the upcoming album, as well as lead guitarist <a href="Dave%20Davies">Dave Davies</a>' solo album, nicknamed "<a href="A%20Hole%20in%20the%20Sock%20of%20%28Dave%20Davies%29">A Hole in the Sock of</a>". When Ray returned, the Kinks regrouped at his house in <a href="Borehamwood">Borehamwood</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, to rehearse the upcoming album "Arthur".

The group turned to the recording proper on 1 May 1969. The first tracks worked on were "<a href="Drivin%27%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">Drivin'</a>", intended as their next single release, and "Mindless Child Of Motherhood", written by Dave Davies (the latter would eventually be used as the <a href="B-side">B-side</a> to "Drivin, and was not included on the LP). The Kinks began a two-week series of focused sessions on 5 May, laying down an early version of the entire "Arthur" album. Recording was interrupted when the Kinks travelled to <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> on 17 May to play three dates at the Melkart Hotel; sessions for "Arthur" resumed the day after their return, and most of the recording for the album was finished by the end of the month. Mixing and <a href="Dubbing%20%28music%29">dubbing</a> began in early June, with arranger Lew Warburton handling string overdubs. The Kinks played a few small gigs in England throughout the remainder of the month, but devoted most of their time to finishing Dave Davies' solo album.

Writing for the TV play progressed through May and June, and on 15 June mixing for Dave Davies' solo LP was completed (tapes for this record were eventually delivered to Pye and Reprise Records, although it never saw official release). A press release announced that the "Arthur" LP was scheduled for a late July release. As Davies and Mitchell completed their script, the "Arthur" TV play began to crystallise, and British filmmaker <a href="Leslie%20Woodhead">Leslie Woodhead</a> was assigned the role of director. By early September production was scheduled to begin, with a planned broadcast of late September, but these plans were continually delayed. As problems with the TV play got progressively worse—and, consequently, distracted the Kinks from completing the post-production of the album—the release dates for both projects were pushed further and further back. In early October Ray Davies moved from Borehamwood back to his old family home on <a href="Fortis%20Green">Fortis Green</a>, in <a href="Muswell%20Hill">Muswell Hill</a>, and travelled to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, where he delivered the tapes to Reprise for "Arthur"'s American release. The album's release date was finally set for 10 October, and the Kinks began gearing up for an upcoming US tour to support the album, for which they would depart on 17 October. Shooting for the TV play was eventually set for 1 December. <a href="Roy%20Stonehouse">Roy Stonehouse</a> was hired as a designer, and the casting was completed; however, the show was cancelled at the last minute when the producer was unable to secure financial backing. Davies and Mitchell were frustrated at an entire year's work wasted—Doug Hinman stated that Davies witnessed "his grand artistic visions once again dashed by bureaucracy and internal politics".

The story is partially inspired by the Davies brothers' older sister Rose, who emigrated to Australia in 1964 with her husband Arthur Anning. Her departure devastated Ray Davies, and it inspired him to write the song "Rosy Won't You Please Come Home", included on the 1966 album "<a href="Face%20to%20Face%20%28The%20Kinks%20album%29">Face to Face</a>". The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted. Writer Julian Mitchell detailed the story line and characters in depth, explaining in the <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a> for the album's LP release:

Davies would later comment in his autobiography, "<a href="X-Ray%20%28book%29">X-Ray</a>", that Anning later "told me that he ... knew it ["Arthur"] had been partly inspired by him ... [it] reminded him of home ... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, saying that he was flattered." With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew ("Victoria", "Young and Innocent Days"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons ("Australia"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home ("Shangri-La"), the resolve of the British people during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> ("Mr. Churchill Says"), the privations that marked the <a href="Rationing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">austerity period after the war</a> ("She's Bought a Hat Like <a href="Princess%20Marina%20of%20Greece%20and%20Denmark">Princess Marina</a>"), and the death of his brother in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> ("Yes Sir, No Sir", "Some Mother's Son").

"Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)" was released in the UK and US on 10 October 1969. It was the last Kinks album to be released in mono, and the mono edition was not released in the US. The album set the stage for the Kinks' return to touring the United States in late 1969, and paved the way for even greater commercial success with the hit song "<a href="Lola%20%28song%29">Lola</a>" in 1970.

While the sessions for "Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)" were nearing completion in June 1969, the track "<a href="Drivin%27%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">Drivin'</a>" was released as a single in the UK, backed with "Mindless Child of Motherhood". For the first time since their breakthrough in 1964, a Kinks single failed to make an impression on the UK charts—<a href="Johnny%20Rogan">Johnny Rogan</a> notes that "This was the first of two pilot singles for ... "Arthur" and its failure did not augur well." The group followed with another single in September, "<a href="Shangri-La%20%28Ray%20Davies%20song%29">Shangri-La</a>", which again failed to chart in the UK. As with "Village Green", the album itself failed to chart when released in October.

In the US, "<a href="Victoria%20%28The%20Kinks%20song%29">Victoria</a>" was chosen as the lead single, backed with the album track "Brainwashed", and was released the same week as the LP. The single proved to be relatively successful, and reached number 62 on the "Billboard" <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">Hot 100</a>—their highest position since their Top 20 hit "<a href="Sunny%20Afternoon">Sunny Afternoon</a>" in 1966. The success of the single led to its release in the UK; backed with "<a href="Mr.%20Churchill%20Says">Mr. Churchill Says</a>", it reached a peak of number 30. "Arthur" itself was a moderate commercial success in the US, where it peaked at number 105 (the highest for a Kinks album since 1965) and remained on the charts for 20 weeks.

<a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a>, the Kinks' US label, devised an elaborate, multi-levelled <a href="Promotion%20%28marketing%29">promotional</a> campaign for "Arthur" in early 1969. The most famous branch of the programme involved a promo package entitled "God Save The Kinks". The set featured various items, including a consumer's guide to the band's albums, a bag of "grass" from the "Daviesland village green", and an LP entitled "Then, Now and Inbetween". The set was accompanied by a positive letter from Hal Halverstadt of creative services at Warner/Reprise, part of which read, "... [We are led] to believe that The Kinks may not have had it at all... The Kinks are to be supported, encouraged, cheered. And saved." The campaign was officially launched on 3 July, at a meeting between Ray Davies and Reprise executives in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>. Reprise considered seeding false stories in the press to create an "outlaw" image for the group as part of the campaign, including pieces about marijuana possession and income tax evasion. Ray called the idea "mad", and the programme was dropped. Several pieces, however, were used in the press kit for "Arthur"'s release, with titles including "English Pop Group Arrested on Rape Rap".

Artwork for "Arthur" was created by Bob Lawrie. The album was packaged in a <a href="gatefold">gatefold</a> sleeve, and included a shaped insert depicting <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> (holding a house containing Arthur Morgan), with lyrics on the reverse. Liner notes in the UK were written by <a href="Geoffrey%20Cannon">Geoffrey Cannon</a> and Julian Mitchell; in the US, notes by rock critic <a href="John%20Mendelsohn%20%28musician%29">John Mendelsohn</a> replaced Cannon's.

The album was critically acclaimed at the time of release, especially in the US rock press. It was favourably compared to contemporary works, namely "<a href="Tommy%20%28rock%20opera%29">Tommy</a>" by <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a>, released earlier in the year. In "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine, "Arthur" was spotlighted in its lead section, with back-to-back reviews by <a href="Mike%20Daly">Mike Daly</a> and <a href="Greil%20Marcus">Greil Marcus</a>. Daly called it "an album that is a masterpiece on every level: Ray Davies' finest hour, the Kinks' supreme achievement". Rolling Stone reviewer Greil Marcus also praised the record, and said: "Less ambitious than "Tommy", and far more musical ... Arthur is by all odds the best British album of 1969. It shows that <a href="Pete%20Townshend">Pete Townshend</a> still has worlds to conquer and that The Beatles have a lot of catching up to do.<a href="https%3A//greilmarcus.net/2016/11/30/kinks-arthur-110169/"></a>" A review by Sal Imam ran in Boston's "Fusion" magazine read that "If Tommy was the greatest rock opera, then Arthur most surely is the greatest rock musical." Writing in his "Consumer Guide" column of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> gave the record a positive review, saying that although Ray Davies' lyrics could get "petulant and preachy at times", the album featured "excellent music and production".

Reception in the UK was not as warm, although reviews were still generally positive. "<a href="Disc%20%28magazine%29">Disc & Music Echo</a>" commented that ""Arthur" works as a complete score because it is basic and simple and pleasing to the ear, and powerfully conjures up pictures in the eye." "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" seconded Mike Daly's comments in "Rolling Stone", again calling it "Ray Davies' finest hour", and adding that it was "beautifully British to the core". Doug Hinman would later comment on the album's reception in Britain: "In the British music press there [was] less celebration, and coverage [was] relatively routine, though everyone saw the rock opera angle."

Today the album receives generally positive reviews. <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> stated that "Arthur" was "one of the most effective concept albums in rock history, as well as one of the best and most influential British pop records of its era", and in 2003 Matt Golden of "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus</a>" called it "the best rock opera ever". <a href="Switch%20%28Mexican%20magazine%29">"Switch"</a> magazine included "Arthur" on their "100 Best Albums of the 20th Century" in 1999, and in 2003 <a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">"Mojo"</a> featured the album on their list of the "Top 50 Most Eccentric Albums". The album was also included in the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

Conte di Cavour-class battleship

The "Conte di Cavour"–class battleships were a group of three <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s built for the Royal Italian Navy ("<a href="Regia%20Marina">Regia Marina</a>") in the 1910s. The ships were completed during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, but none saw action before the end of hostilities. was sunk by a <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> explosion in 1916 and sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> in 1923. The two surviving ships, and , supported operations during the <a href="Corfu%20Incident">Corfu Incident</a> in 1923. They were extensively reconstructed between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before.

Both ships participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Calabria">Battle of Calabria</a> in July 1940, when "Giulio Cesare" was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers <a href="Battle%20of%20Taranto">attacked</a> the fleet at <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a> in November 1940, and "Conte di Cavour" was torpedoed. She was <a href="Ship%20grounding">grounded</a> with most of her hull underwater and her repairs were not completed before the <a href="Italian%20surrender">Italian surrender</a> in September 1943. "Conte di Cavour" was scrapped in 1946. "Giulio Cesare" escorted several convoys, and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Spartivento">Battle of Cape Spartivento</a> in late 1940 and the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Sirte">First Battle of Sirte</a> in late 1941. She was designated as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> in early 1942, and escaped to <a href="Malta">Malta</a> after Italy surrendered. The ship was transferred to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1949 and renamed "Novorossiysk". The Soviets also used her for training until she was sunk when a <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> exploded in 1955. She was scrapped in 1957.

The "Conte di Cavour"–class ships were designed by <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Engineer <a href="Edoardo%20Masdea">Edoardo Masdea</a>, Chief Constructor of the "Regia Marina", and were ordered in response to French plans to build the s. They were intended to be superior to the "Courbet"s and to remedy 's perceived flaws of weak protection and armament. As upgrading a warship's protection and armament on a similar displacement typically requires a loss in speed, the ships were not designed to reach the of their predecessor. They were still given a advantage over the standard of most foreign dreadnoughts. Foreign dreadnoughts were being designed with guns, but the "Regia Marina" was forced to use guns in the "Conte di Cavour"s because Italy lacked the ability to build larger guns. An additional gun, making a total of 13, was added to offset this deficiency.

Taking advantage of the lengthy building times of these ships, other countries were able to build dreadnoughts that were superior in protection and armament, with the exception of the French. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of the 305-millimeter guns and armor plates as well as shortages of labor. The <a href="Italo-Turkish%20War">Italo-Turkish War</a> of 1911–1912 diverted workers at the shipyards for repairs and maintenance of the ships participating in the war. The Italians imported the raw nickel steel for their armor from America and Britain and processed it into their equivalent of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armor">Krupp cemented armor</a>, called Terni cemented, but there were problems with this process and suitable plates took longer to produce than planned.

The ships of the "Conte di Cavour" class were <a href="length%20at%20the%20waterline">long at the waterline</a>, and <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. They had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . They <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at normal load, and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. The "Conte di Cavour" class was provided with a complete <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a> and their hulls were subdivided by 23 longitudinal and transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a>. The ships had two <a href="rudder">rudder</a>s, both on the centerline. They had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.

The original machinery for all three ships consisted of three <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> sets, arranged in three engine rooms. The center engine room housed one set of turbines that drove the two inner <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s. It was flanked by compartments on either side, each housing one turbine set which powered the outer shafts. Steam for the turbines was provided by 20 Blechynden <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s in "Conte di Cavour" and "Leonardo da Vinci", eight of which burned oil and twelve of which burned both oil and coal. "Giulio Cesare" used a dozen each oil-fired and mixed-firing <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox%20boiler">Babcock & Wilcox boiler</a>s. Designed to reach a maximum speed of , none of the ships reached this goal on their <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, despite generally exceeding the rated power of their turbines. They only achieved speeds ranging from using . The ships could store a maximum of of coal and of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> that gave them a range of at , and at . Each ship was equipped with three <a href="turbo%20generator">turbo generator</a>s that provided a total of 150 kilowatts at 110 <a href="volt">volt</a>s.

As built, the ships' main armament comprised thirteen 46-<a href="Caliber%23Caliber%20as%20measurement%20of%20length">caliber</a> <a href="305%20mm%20/46%20Model%201909">305-millimeter guns</a>, designed by <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> and <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a>, in five gun turrets. The turrets were all on the centerline, with a twin-gun turret <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> over a triple-gun turret in fore and aft pairs, and a third triple turret amidships, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X', and 'Y' from bow to stern. This was only one fewer gun than the Brazilian , then the most heavily armed battleship in the world; "Rio de Janeiro"s guns were mounted in seven twin-gun turrets. The turrets had an elevation capability of −5° to +20 degrees and the ships could carry 100 <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a> for each gun, although 70 was the normal load. Sources disagree regarding these guns' performance, but naval historian Giorgio Giorgerini claims that they fired <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armor-piercing (AP)</a> projectiles at the rate of one round per minute and that they had a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of which gave a maximum range of . The turrets had hydraulic training and elevation, with an auxiliary electric system.

The <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> on the first two ships consisted of eighteen 50-caliber <a href="120%20mm%20Italian%20naval%20gun%2350-calibre%20M1909">guns</a>, also designed by Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers, mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the sides of the hull. These guns could depress to −10 degrees and had a maximum elevation of +15 degrees; they had a rate of fire of six shots per minute. They could fire a high-explosive projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . The ships carried a total of 3,600 rounds for them. For defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, the ships carried fourteen 50-caliber <a href="QF%2014%20pounder%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20I%20%26amp%3B%20II%20naval%20gun">guns</a>; thirteen of these could be mounted on the turret tops, but they could be mounted in 30 different positions, including some on the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> and upper decks. These guns had the same range of elevation as the secondary guns, and their rate of fire was higher at 10 rounds per minute. They fired a AP projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . The ships were also fitted with three submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a> and the third in the stern.

The "Conte di Cavour"-class ships had a complete <a href="waterline">waterline</a> armor belt that was high; of this was below the waterline and above. It had a maximum thickness of amidships, reducing to towards the stern and towards the bow. The lower edge of this belt was a uniform in thickness. Above the main belt was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armor thick that extended up to the lower edge of the main deck. Above this strake was a thinner one, 130 millimeters thick, that extended from the bow to 'X' turret. The upper strake of armor protected the casemates and was thick. The ships had two armored <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">decks</a>: the main deck was thick in two layers on the flat that increased to on the slopes that connected it to the main belt. The second deck was thick, also in two layers. Fore and aft transverse bulkheads connected the armored belt to the decks.

The frontal armor of the <a href="gun%20turrets">gun turrets</a> was in thickness with thick sides, and an roof and rear. Their <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s also had 230-millimeter armor above the forecastle deck that reduced to between the forecastle and upper decks and 130 millimeters below the upper deck. The forward <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> had walls 280 millimeters thick; those of the aft conning tower were 180 millimeters thick. The total weight of the protective armor was , just over 25 per cent of the ships' designed displacement. The total weight of the entire protective system was , 30.2 per cent of their intended displacement.

Shortly after the end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76 mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new <a href="Cannon%2076/40%20Model%201916">40-caliber 76-millimeter</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a> were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two <a href="license-built">license-built</a> <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">2-pounder</a> AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast 'B' turret. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a <a href="Macchi%20M.18">Macchi M.18</a> <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, one or both of the ships was equipped with a fixed <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a> on the port side of the forecastle.

The sisters began an extensive reconstruction program directed by <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> ("Generale del Genio navale") Francesco Rotundi in October 1933. This lasted until June 1937 for "Conte di Cavour" and October 1937 for "Giulio Cesare", and resulted in several changes. A new bow section was grafted over the existing bow which increased their length by to and their beam increased to . Their draft at deep load increased to for "Conte di Cavour" and for "Giulio Cesare". All of the changes made during their reconstruction increased their displacement to at <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> and at deep load. The ships' crews increased to 1,260 officers and enlisted men.
Only 40% of the original ship's structure remained after the reconstruction was completed.
Two of the propeller shafts were removed and the existing turbines were replaced by two Belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at . The boilers were replaced by eight <a href="superheated">superheated</a> <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s with a working pressure of . On her sea trials in December 1936, before her reconstruction was fully completed, "Giulio Cesare" reached a speed of from . In service their maximum speed was about . The ships now carried of fuel oil which provided them with a range of at a speed of .
The center turret and the <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s were removed and all of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen <a href="120%20mm%20Italian%20naval%20gun%2350-calibre%20OTO%201933">120-millimeter guns</a> in six twin-gun turrets and eight AA guns in twin turrets. In addition the ships were fitted with a dozen 54-caliber <a href="Societ%C3%A0%20Italiana%20Ernesto%20Breda">Breda</a> <a href="Cannone-Mitragliera%20da%2037/54%20%28Breda%29"></a> light AA guns in six twin-gun mounts and twelve <a href="Breda%20Model%201931%20Machine%20Gun">Breda M31 anti-aircraft</a> <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, also in twin mounts. The guns were bored out to <a href="320%20mm%20Model%201934%20naval%20gun"></a> and their turrets were modified to use electric power, a fixed loading angle of +12 degrees, and the guns could now elevate to +27 degrees. The 320 mm AP shells weighed and had a maximum range of with a muzzle velocity of . In 1940 the 13.2 mm machine guns were replaced by 65-caliber <a href="Breda%20Model%2035"></a> AA guns in twin mounts. "Giulio Cesare" received two more twin mounts as well as four additional 37 mm guns in twin mounts on the forecastle between the two turrets in 1941.
The tetrapodal mast was replaced with a new forward conning tower, protected with thick armor. Atop the conning tower there was a director fitted with two rangefinders, with a base length of .

The deck armor was increased during reconstruction to a total of over the engine and boiler rooms and over the magazines, although its distribution over three decks, each with multiple layers, meant that it was considerably less effective than a single plate of the same thickness. The armor protecting the barbettes was reinforced with plates. All this armor weighed a total of .

The existing underwater protection was replaced by the <a href="Pugliese%20torpedo%20defense%20system">Pugliese system</a> that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo <a href="warhead">warhead</a>. It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ships' increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.

"Conte di Cavour" and "Giulio Cesare" served as <a href="flagship">flagship</a>s in the southern <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> during World War I, but saw no action and spent little time at sea. "Leonardo da Vinci" was also little used and was sunk by an internal <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> explosion at <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a> harbor on the night of 2/3 August 1916 while loading ammunition. Casualties included 21 officers and 227 enlisted men killed. The Italians blamed <a href="Austro-Hungarian">Austro-Hungarian</a> <a href="saboteur">saboteur</a>s, but unstable propellant may well have been responsible. The ship was refloated, upside down, on 17 September 1919 and righted on 24 January 1921. The "Regia Marina" planned to modernize her by replacing her center turret with six AA guns, but lacked the funds to do so and sold her for scrap on 22 March 1923.

In 1919, "Conte di Cavour" sailed to North America and visited ports in the United States as well as <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax</a>, Canada. "Giulio Cesare" made port visits in the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> in 1919 and 1920. "Conte di Cavour" was mostly inactive in 1921 because of personnel shortages and was refitted at La Spezia from November to March 1922. Both battleships supported Italian operations on <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> in 1923 after an Italian general and his staff <a href="Corfu%20incident">were murdered on the Greco-Albanian border</a>; <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> was not satisfied with the Greek Government's response so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island. "Conte di Cavour" bombarded the town with her 76 mm guns, killing 20 and wounding 32 civilians.

"Conte di Cavour" escorted <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20III%20of%20Italy">King Victor Emmanuel III</a> and his wife aboard "Dante Alighieri", on a state visit to Spain in 1924 and was placed in reserve upon her return until 1926, when she conveyed Mussolini on a voyage to Libya. The ship was again placed in reserve from 1927 until 1933. Her sister became a gunnery training ship in 1928, after having been in reserve since 1926. "Conte di Cavour" was reconstructed at the CRDA <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> Yard while "Giulio Cesare" was rebuilt at <a href="Cantieri%20del%20Tirreno">Cantieri del Tirreno</a>, Genoa between 1933 and 1937. Both ships participated in a naval review by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Naples">Bay of Naples</a> in May 1938 and covered the <a href="invasion%20of%20Albania">invasion of Albania</a> in May 1939.
Early in World War II, the sisters took part in the Battle of Calabria (also known as the Battle of Punta Stilo) on 9 July 1940, as part of the 1st Battle Squadron, commanded by Admiral <a href="Inigo%20Campioni">Inigo Campioni</a>, during which they engaged major elements of the British <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a>. The British were escorting a convoy from Malta to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, while the Italians had finished escorting another from <a href="Naples">Naples</a> to <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>, Libya. Admiral <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Andrew Cunningham</a>, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, attempted to interpose his ships between the Italians and their base at Taranto. Crew on the fleets spotted each other in the middle of the afternoon and the Italian battleships opened fire at 15:53 at a range of nearly . The two leading British battleships, and , replied a minute later. Three minutes after she opened fire, shells from "Giulio Cesare" began to straddle "Warspite" which made a small turn and increased speed, to throw off the Italian ship's aim, at 16:00. At that same time, a shell from "Warspite" struck "Giulio Cesare" at a distance of about . The shell pierced the rear funnel and detonated inside it, blowing out a hole nearly across. Fragments started several fires and their smoke was drawn into the boiler rooms, forcing four boilers off-line as their operators could not breathe. This reduced the ship's speed to . Uncertain how severe the damage was, Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they successfully disengaged. Repairs to "Giulio Cesare" were completed by the end of August and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept British convoys to <a href="Malta">Malta</a> in August and September.

On the night of 11 November 1940, "Conte di Cavour" and "Giulio Cesare" were at anchor in Taranto harbor when they were attacked by 21 <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s from the British <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> , along with several other warships. One torpedo exploded underneath 'B' turret at 23:15, and her captain requested tugboats to help <a href="Ship%20grounding">ground</a> the ship on a nearby <a href="sandbank">sandbank</a>. His admiral vetoed the request until it was too late and "Conte di Cavour" had to use a deeper, , sandbank at 04:30 on 12 November. In an effort to lighten the ship, her guns and parts of her superstructure were removed and "Conte di Cavour" was refloated on 9 June 1941. Temporary repairs to enable the ship to reach Trieste for permanent repairs took until 22 December. Her guns were operable by September 1942, but replacing her entire electrical system took longer and she was still under repair when Italy surrendered a year later. The "Regia Marina" made plans to replace her secondary and anti-aircraft weapons with a dozen <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s in twin mounts, twelve 64-caliber , and twenty-three 65-caliber 20 mm AA guns. Her hulk was damaged in an air raid and capsized on 23 February 1945. Refloated shortly after the end of the war, "Conte di Cavour" was scrapped in 1946.
"Giulio Cesare" participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Spartivento">Battle of Cape Spartivento</a> on 27 November 1940, but never got close enough to any British ships to fire at them. The ship was damaged in January 1941 by a near miss during an air raid on Naples; repairs were completed in early February. She participated in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Sirte">First Battle of Sirte</a> on 17 December 1941, providing distant cover for a convoy bound for Libya, again never firing her main armament. In early 1942, "Giulio Cesare" was reduced to a training ship at Taranto and later <a href="Pula">Pola</a>. She steamed to Malta in early September 1943 after the Italian surrender. The unsuccessfully attacked the ship in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Taranto">Gulf of Taranto</a> in early March 1944.

After the war, "Giulio Cesare" was allocated to the Soviet Union as <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Treaties%2C%201947">war reparations</a> in 1949, and renamed "<a href="Novorossiysk">Novorossiysk</a>", after the Soviet city on the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. The Soviets used her as a training ship when she was not undergoing one of her eight refits in their hands. In 1953, all remaining Italian light AA guns were replaced by eighteen <a href="37%20mm%20automatic%20air%20defense%20gun%20M1939%20%2861-K%29">37 mm 70-K</a> AA guns in six twin mounts and six singles. They also replaced her fire-control systems and added <a href="radar">radar</a>s, although the exact changes are unknown. The Soviets intended to rearm her with their own <a href="Obukhovskii%2012%26quot%3B/52%20Pattern%201907%20gun">305 mm guns</a>, but this was forestalled by her loss. While at anchor in <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a> on the night of 28/29 October 1955, she detonated a large German <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> left over from World War II. The explosion blew a hole completely through the ship, making a hole in the forecastle forward of 'A' turret. The flooding could not be controlled and she later capsized with the loss of 608 men. "Novorossiysk" was stricken from the Navy List on 24 February 1956, salvaged on 4 May 1957, and subsequently scrapped.

Stede Bonnet

Stede Bonnet (1688 – 10 December 1718) was an early eighteenth-century <a href="Barbados">Barbadian</a> <a href="piracy">pirate</a>, sometimes called "The Gentleman Pirate" because he was a moderately wealthy land-owner before turning to a life of crime. Bonnet was born into a wealthy <a href="English%20people">English</a> family on the island of <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, and inherited the family estate after his father's death in 1694. In 1709, he married Mary Allamby, and engaged in some level of <a href="militia">militia</a> service. Because of marital problems, and despite his lack of sailing experience, Bonnet decided he should turn to piracy in the summer of 1717. He bought a sailing vessel, named it "Revenge", and travelled with his paid crew along the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Eastern Seaboard</a> of what is now the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, capturing other vessels and burning other Barbadian ships.

Bonnet set sail for <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>, <a href="The%20Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, to the haven for pirates known as the "<a href="pirates%27%20republic">pirates' republic</a>", but he was seriously wounded "en route" during an encounter with a <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a> warship. After arriving in Nassau, Bonnet met Edward Teach, the infamous pirate <a href="Blackbeard">Blackbeard</a>. Incapable of leading his crew, Bonnet temporarily ceded his ship's command to Blackbeard. Before separating in December 1717, Blackbeard and Bonnet plundered and captured merchant ships along the East Coast. After Bonnet failed to capture the "Protestant Caesar", his crew abandoned him to join Blackbeard aboard the "<a href="Queen%20Anne%27s%20Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a>". Bonnet stayed on Blackbeard's ship as a guest, and did not command a crew again until summer 1718, when he was pardoned by <a href="Province%20of%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> governor <a href="Charles%20Eden%20%28politician%29">Charles Eden</a> and received clearance to go <a href="privateer">privateer</a>ing against Spanish shipping. Bonnet was tempted to resume his piracy, but did not want to lose his pardon, so he adopted the alias "Captain Thomas" and changed his ship's name to "Royal James". He had returned to piracy by July 1718.

In August 1718, Bonnet anchored the "Royal James" on an estuary of the <a href="Cape%20Fear%20River">Cape Fear River</a> to <a href="careening">careen</a> and repair the ship. In late August and September, Colonel <a href="William%20Rhett">William Rhett</a>, with the authorization of <a href="Province%20of%20South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> governor <a href="Robert%20Johnson%20%28governor%29">Robert Johnson</a>, led a naval expedition against pirates on the river. Rhett and Bonnet's men <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Fear%20River">fought each other</a> for hours, but the outnumbered pirates ultimately surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and brought them to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charles Town</a> in early October. Bonnet escaped on 24 October, but was recaptured on <a href="Sullivan%27s%20Island%2C%20South%20Carolina">Sullivan's Island</a>. On 10 November, Bonnet was brought to trial and charged with two acts of piracy. Judge Nicholas Trott sentenced Bonnet to death. Bonnet wrote to Governor Johnson to ask for <a href="pardon">clemency</a>, but Johnson endorsed the judge's decision, and Bonnet was hanged in Charles Town on 10 December 1718.

Bonnet was born in 1688, as he was christened at Christ Church parish on 29 July 1688. His parents, Edward and Sarah Bonnet, owned an estate of over southeast of <a href="Bridgetown">Bridgetown</a>, which was bequeathed to Bonnet upon his father's death in 1694. It is not known where Bonnet received his education, but many who knew him described him as bookish, and Judge Nicholas Trott alluded to Bonnet's <a href="liberal%20education">liberal education</a> when sentencing him. Bonnet married Mary Allamby in Bridgetown on 21 November 1709. They had three sons—Allamby, Edward, and Stede—and a daughter, Mary. Allamby died before 1715, while the other children survived to see their father abandon them for piracy. Edward's granddaughter, Anne Thomasine Clarke, was the wife of General Robert Haynes, for 36 years Speaker of the Assembly of Barbados. 
In "<a href="A%20General%20History%20of%20the%20Pyrates">A General History of the Pyrates</a>", <a href="Charles%20Johnson%20%28pirate%20biographer%29">Charles Johnson</a> wrote that Bonnet was driven to piracy by Mary's <a href="nagging">nagging</a> and "[d]iscomforts he found in a married State".
Details of Bonnet's military service are unclear, but he held the rank of <a href="major">major</a> in the Barbados militia. The rank was probably due to his land holdings, since deterring <a href="slave%20rebellion">slave revolts</a> was an important function of the militia. Bonnet's militia service coincided with the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, but there is no record that he took part in the fighting.

During the spring of 1717, Stede Bonnet decided to become a pirate, despite having no knowledge of shipboard life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sixty-<a href="long%20ton">ton</a> <a href="sloop">sloop</a>, which he equipped with ten <a href="Naval%20artillery%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Sail">guns</a> and named the "Revenge". This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> or by <a href="boarding%20%28attack%29">boarding</a> them or by converting a <a href="privateer">privateer</a> vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by his crew. In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> intelligence reported that he departed <a href="Carlisle%20Bay%2C%20Barbados">Carlisle Bay, Barbados</a> under cover of darkness.

Bonnet's initial cruise took him to the coast of the <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Colony of Virginia</a>, near the entrance of the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the Barbadian ship "Turbet" to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He then sailed north to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at <a href="Gardiners%20Island">Gardiners Island</a>. By August 1717, Bonnet had returned to <a href="the%20Carolinas">the Carolinas</a>, where he attacked two more ships, a brigantine from <a href="Boston">Boston</a> and a Barbadian sloop. He stripped the brigantine, but brought the cargo-filled Barbadian sloop to an <a href="inlet">inlet</a> off North Carolina to use for <a href="careening">careening</a> and repairing the "Revenge". After the Barbadian sloop's tackle was used to careen the "Revenge", the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were then burned. In September 1717, Bonnet set course for <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>, which was then an infamous pirate den on the island of <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a> in the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. "En route", he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish <a href="Man-of-war">man of war</a>. The "Revenge" was badly damaged, Bonnet was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the sloop was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet replaced his casualties and refitted the "Revenge," increasing the sloop's armament to twelve guns.

While at Nassau, Bonnet met <a href="Captain%20%28nautical%29">Captain</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Hornigold">Benjamin Hornigold</a> and <a href="Blackbeard">Edward Thatch</a> for the first time; Thatch, better known as Blackbeard, played a large role in the remainder of Bonnet's life. Disabled by his wounds, Bonnet temporarily ceded command of the "Revenge" to Blackbeard, but remained aboard as a guest of the more experienced pirate captain. Blackbeard and Bonnet weighed <a href="anchor">anchor</a> and sailed northward to <a href="Delaware%20Bay">Delaware Bay</a>, where they plundered eleven ships. On 29 September 1717, the "Revenge", captained by Blackbeard, plundered the sloop "Betty", which had a cargo full of Madeira wine. Captain Codd, whose merchant ship was taken on 12 October, described Bonnet as walking the deck in his nightshirt, lacking any command and still unwell from his wounds. The "Revenge" later captured and looted the "Spofford" and "Sea Nymph", which were leaving <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. On 22 October, the "Revenge" stopped and robbed the "Robert" and "Good Intent" of their supplies.

Blackbeard and Bonnet left Delaware Bay and returned to the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean</a> in November, where they successfully continued their piracy. On 17 November, a 200-ton ship named the "Concorde" was attacked by two pirate craft nearly away from the island of <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>. The lieutenant on board described the pirate vessels as one having 12 guns and 120 men and the other having eight guns and 30 men. The crew of the "Concorde" put up a fight, but surrendered after the pirates bombarded them with "two volleys of cannons and musketry". Blackbeard took the "Concorde" and sailed south into the <a href="Grenadines">Grenadines</a>, where he renamed the ship "<a href="Queen%20Anne%27s%20Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a>", possibly as an insult to <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George I</a>. Some time after 19 December, Bonnet and Blackbeard separated. Bonnet now sailed into the western Caribbean. In March 1718, he encountered the 400-ton merchant vessel "Protestant Caesar" off <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>. The ship escaped him, and his frustrated crew became restive. When Bonnet encountered Blackbeard again shortly afterwards, Bonnet's crew deserted him to join Blackbeard. Blackbeard put a <a href="henchman">henchman</a> named Richards in command of the "Revenge". Bonnet, surprised that his colleague had betrayed him, found himself as a guest aboard the "<a href="Queen%20Anne%27s%20Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a>". Bonnet confided in a few loyal crew members that he was ready to give up his criminal life if he could exile himself in Spain or Portugal. Bonnet would not exercise command again until the summer of 1718.

Under Captain Richards, the "Revenge" captured a Jamaican sloop, the "Adventure", captained by <a href="David%20Herriot">David Herriot</a>. Herriot joined the pirates, and Blackbeard now possessed three ships. Bonnet accompanied Blackbeard to <a href="Province%20of%20South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, where Blackbeard's four vessels blockaded the port of <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charles Town</a> in the late spring of 1718. Needing a place to rest and refit their vessels, Blackbeard and Bonnet headed north to <a href="Topsail%20Island">Topsail Island</a>, where the "<a href="Queen%20Anne%27s%20Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a>" ran aground and was lost. Leaving the remaining three vessels at Topsail Island, Blackbeard and Bonnet went ashore and journeyed to <a href="Bath%2C%20North%20Carolina">Bath</a>, which was then capital of <a href="Province%20of%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. Once there, both men accepted pardons from Governor <a href="Charles%20Eden%20%28politician%29">Charles Eden</a> under King George's Act of Grace, putatively on condition of their renouncing piracy forever. While Blackbeard quietly returned to Topsail Island, Bonnet stayed in Bath to get a "clearance" to take the "Revenge" to <a href="Danish%20West%20Indies">Denmark's Caribbean colony</a> of <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">St. Thomas</a>, where he planned to buy a <a href="letter%20of%20marque">letter of marque</a> and go <a href="privateer">privateer</a>ing against Spanish shipping. Eden granted Bonnet this clearance.

Bonnet returned to Topsail Island to find that Blackbeard had beached the majority of their former crew, robbed the "Revenge" and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop "Adventure," carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the "Revenge." Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard. Bonnet reinforced the "Revenge" by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had <a href="Marooning">marooned</a> on a <a href="bar%20%28landform%29">sandbar</a> in Topsail Island.

Shortly after Bonnet resumed command, a <a href="bumboat">bumboat</a>'s crew told him that Blackbeard was moored in <a href="Ocracoke%20Inlet">Ocracoke Inlet</a>. Bonnet set sail at once to hunt down his treacherous ex-confederate, but could not find him, and Bonnet never met Blackbeard again. Although Bonnet apparently never discarded his hopes of reaching St. Thomas and getting his letter of marque, two pressing problems now tempted him back into piracy. First, Blackbeard had stolen the food and supplies he and his men needed to subsist (one pirate testified at his trial that no more than ten or eleven barrels remained aboard the "Revenge"). Second, St. Thomas was now in the midst of the <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">Atlantic hurricane season</a>, which would last until autumn. However, returning to freebooting meant nullifying Bonnet's pardon.

Hoping to preserve his pardon, Bonnet adopted the alias "Captain Thomas" and changed the "Revenge"'s name to the "Royal James". The name "Royal James" that Bonnet conferred on his sloop was presumably a reference to the younger Prince <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Stuart</a>, and may suggest that Bonnet or his men had <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> sympathies. One of Bonnet's prisoners further reported witnessing Bonnet's men drinking to the health of the "Old Pretender" and wishing to see him king of the English nation.

Bonnet further tried to disguise his return to piracy by engaging in a pretence of trade with the next two vessels he robbed. Soon afterward, Bonnet quit the charade of trading and reverted to naked piracy. In July 1718, he cruised north to Delaware Bay, pillaging another eleven vessels. He took several prisoners, some of whom joined his pirate crew. While Bonnet set loose most of his prizes after looting them, he retained control of the last two ships he captured: the sloops "Francis" and "Fortune". On 1 August 1718, the "Royal James" and the two captured sloops sailed southward from Delaware Bay. The captured sloops lagged behind, and Bonnet threatened to sink them if they did not stay closer. During the passage, Bonnet and his crew divided their loot into shares of about £10 or £11 and distributed them amongst themselves. This is the only time Bonnet is known to have practised this important pirate custom, and it suggests he had by then abandoned his unorthodox practice of paying regular wages to his crew.

Twelve days out of Delaware Bay, Bonnet entered the <a href="estuary">estuary</a> of the <a href="Cape%20Fear%20River">Cape Fear River</a> and anchored near the mouth of a small waterway now known as Bonnet's Creek. The "Royal James" had begun to leak badly and was in need of <a href="careening">careening</a>. Shortly afterwards, a small <a href="shallop">shallop</a> entered the river and was captured. Bonnet had the shallop broken up to help repair the "Royal James". The work of careening was done, in whole or in part, by the prisoners Bonnet had captured. Bonnet threatened at least one man with marooning if he did not work with the slaves to repair the "Royal James"'. Bonnet remained in the Cape Fear River for the next 45 days. According to Bonnet's <a href="boatswain">boatswain</a>, Ignatius Pell, the pirates intended to wait out the hurricane season there.

By the end of August, news had reached Charles Town that Bonnet's vessels were moored in the Cape Fear River. <a href="Robert%20Johnson%20%28governor%29">Robert Johnson</a>, governor of South Carolina, authorised Colonel <a href="William%20Rhett">William Rhett</a> to lead a naval expedition against the pirates, even though the Cape Fear River was in North Carolina's <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>. After a false start due to the appearance of another pirate ship near Charles Town, Rhett arrived at the mouth of the Cape Fear River on 26 September with two eight-gun sloops, the "Henry" and the "Sea Nymph", and a force of 130 militia men. Bonnet initially mistook Rhett's squadron for merchantmen and sent three <a href="canoe">canoe</a>s to capture them. Unfortunately for Rhett, his <a href="flagship">flagship</a> "Henry" had run aground in the river mouth, enabling Bonnet's canoe crews to approach, recognize the heavily armed and manned sloops as hostile and return uninjured to warn Bonnet. The sun had set by the time the rising tide lifted the "Henry" off the river bottom.

The 46 pirates were scattered among the three sloops. During the night, Bonnet brought all of them aboard the "Royal James" and planned to fight his way out to sea in the morning rather than risk the Cape Fear River's narrow channels in the dark. Bonnet also wrote a letter to Governor Johnson, threatening to burn all the ships in Charles Town Harbour. At daybreak, on 27 September 1718, Bonnet set sail toward Rhett's force, and all three sloops opened fire, initiating the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Fear%20River">Battle of Cape Fear River</a>. The two South Carolinian sloops split up in an effort to bracket the "Royal James". Bonnet tried to avoid the trap by steering the "Royal James" close to the river's western shore, but ran aground in the process. Rhett's closing sloops also ran aground, leaving only the "Henry" in range of the "Royal James".

The battle was at a stalemate for the next five or six hours, with all the participants immobilized. Bonnet's men had the advantage that their deck was heeled away from their opponents, giving them cover, while the "Henry"'s deck was tilted toward the pirates, thus exposing Rhett's men to punishing musket volleys. Bonnet's force suffered twelve casualties while killing ten and wounding fourteen of Rhett's 70-man crew. Most of Bonnet's men fought enthusiastically, challenging their enemies to board and fight hand to hand, and tying a knot in their flag as a mock signal to come aboard and render aid. Bonnet himself patrolled the deck with a pistol drawn, threatening to kill any pirate who faltered in the fight. Nevertheless, some of the prisoners who had been forced to join the pirate crew refused to fire on Rhett's men, and one narrowly escaped death at Bonnet's hands in the confusion of the engagement.

The battle was ultimately decided when the rising tide lifted Rhett's sloops free while temporarily leaving the "Royal James" stranded. Bonnet was left helpless, watching while the enemy vessels repaired their rigging and closed to board his paralysed vessel. Outnumbered almost three to one, Bonnet's men would have had little hope of winning a boarding action. Bonnet ordered his gunner, George Ross, to blow up the "Royal James's" powder magazine. Ross apparently attempted this, but was overruled by the remainder of the crew, who surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and returned to Charles Town with his prisoners on 3 October.

In Charles Town, Bonnet was separated from the bulk of his crew and held for three weeks along with his boatswain, Ignatius Pell, and his <a href="sailing%20master">sailing master</a>, David Herriott, at the home of Town Marshal Nathaniel Partridge. Pirate Edward Robinson and the remaining crew were held outside of Charles Town at the Watch House, at White Point. On 24 October, Bonnet and Herriott escaped, probably by colluding with local merchant <a href="Richard%20Tookerman">Richard Tookerman</a>. Governor Johnson at once placed a £700 bounty on Bonnet's head and dispatched search teams to track him down. Bonnet and Herriott, accompanied by a slave and an Indian, obtained a boat and made for the north shore of Charles Town Harbour, but foul winds and lack of supplies forced the four of them onto <a href="Sullivan%27s%20Island%2C%20South%20Carolina">Sullivan's Island</a>. Governor Johnson sent a posse under Rhett to Sullivan's Island to hunt for Bonnet. The posse discovered Bonnet after an extensive search, and opened fire, killing Herriott and wounding the two slaves. Bonnet surrendered and was returned to Charles Town. While awaiting trial, some sort of civil uprising in his support took place within the city, an event authorities would later describe as having nearly resulted in the burning of the town and the overthrow of the government. Bonnet possibly awaited his execution in the Court of Guard, a militia guardhouse in the city where the current <a href="Exchange%20and%20Provost">Exchange and Provost</a> stands today.

On 10 November 1718, Bonnet was brought to trial before Sir <a href="Nicholas%20Trott">Nicholas Trott</a>, sitting in his capacity as <a href="Vice%20admiralty%20court">Vice-Admiralty</a> judge. Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to <a href="hanging">hang</a>. Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the "Francis" and the "Fortune", whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned <a href="Turn%20state%27s%20evidence">King's evidence</a> in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a <a href="character%20evidence">character witness</a> in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.

While awaiting his execution, Bonnet wrote to Governor Johnson, begging abjectly for <a href="clemency">clemency</a> and promising to have his own arms and legs cut off as assurance that he would never again commit piracy. Charles Johnson wrote that Bonnet's visibly disintegrating mind moved many Carolinians to pity, particularly the female population, and London papers later reported that the governor delayed his execution seven times. Bonnet was eventually <a href="hanged">hanged</a> at <a href="White%20Point%20Garden">White Point Garden</a>, in Charles Town, on 10 December 1718.

The actual degree of authority any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, as he had no access to the procedures and sanctions of <a href="admiralty%20law">admiralty law</a> that supported government captains. Many pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be deposed in the same manner. Because of his ignorance of nautical matters, Bonnet was in an even weaker position than other pirate captains, as is demonstrated by the utter domination Blackbeard exercised over him during their collaboration. During Bonnet's early career, his crew seems to have been less than loyal to him and to have greatly preferred the more charismatic and experienced Blackbeard.

At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own authority over his pirate crew. He told the court that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, and said he had warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop "Francis". The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster appears to have been a common feature of pirate crews in the <a href="early%20modern%20Europe">early modern era</a>.

Nevertheless, Bonnet's crew represented him as being a leader, and it appears likely that, after his rescue of Blackbeard's marooned crewmen, he became at least a co-equal commander aboard the "Royal James". He appears to have been entrusted with the company's treasure, and made most major command decisions such as the direction of the ship and what vessels to attack. Most significantly, at Delaware Bay he ordered two of his crew to be <a href="flagellation">flogged</a> for breaches of discipline. Pirates did not lightly submit to flogging, as they resented the frequent use of this punishment in the naval and merchant services from which most of them came, and thus only a leader who commanded the obedience of his crew could successfully order such penalties.

Bonnet's <a href="Jolly%20Roger">flag</a> is traditionally represented as a white skull above a horizontal long bone between a heart and a dagger, all on a black field. Despite the frequent appearance of this flag in modern pirate literature, no known early-<a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian</a> period source describes any such device, much less attributes it to Bonnet. This version of Bonnet's flag is probably one of a number of pirate flags appearing on an undated manuscript with unknown <a href="provenance">provenance</a> in Britain's <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a>, which was donated by Dr. Philip Gosse in 1939. Bonnet's crew and contemporaries generally referred to him flying a "bloody flag", which likely means a dark red flag. There is also a report from the 1718 "<a href="The%20Boston%20News-Letter">Boston News-Letter</a>" of Bonnet flying a death's-head flag during his pursuit of the "Protestant Caesar", with no mention of color or of any long bone, heart, or dagger.

Bonnet is alleged to have been one of the few pirates to make his prisoners <a href="walking%20the%20plank">walk the plank</a>. No contemporary source makes any mention of Bonnet forcing prisoners to walk the plank, and modern scholars such as Marcus Rediker, Professor of History at the <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a>, generally agree that the whole concept of pirates forcing prisoners to walk the plank belongs to a later age than Bonnet's.

Bonnet has been portrayed several times in literature. He is a major character in <a href="Tim%20Powers">Tim Powers</a>' "<a href="On%20Stranger%20Tides">On Stranger Tides</a>," along with other famous piratical characters, particularly Blackbeard. In this novel, Bonnet takes up piracy after having been framed by Blackbeard, who has used Bonnet's hatred for his wife (only married two years in the novel) against him. "Kate Bonnet: The Romance of a Pirate's Daughter", by 19th century author <a href="Frank%20Stockton">Frank Stockton</a>, is a satirical novel relating the adventures of a fictional daughter of Bonnet named Kate. Portrayals of Bonnet also extend to video games, such as <a href="Sid%20Meier%27s%20Pirates%21%20%282004%20video%20game%29">"Sid Meier's Pirates!"</a> and "". In the 1941 film "<a href="The%20Devil%20and%20Daniel%20Webster%20%28film%29">The Devil and Daniel Webster</a>", the Devil summons Bonnet to join a Jury of the damned, announcing Bonnet and fellow seaman <a href="Floyd%20Ireson">Floyd Ireson</a> as "the fiendish butchers".

A plaque commemorating Bonnet stands near Bonnet's Creek in <a href="Southport%2C%20North%20Carolina">Southport, North Carolina</a>, on the Cape Fear River. The Yacht Basin Provision Company also holds an annual Stede Bonnet Regatta near Southport, commemorating the infamous pirate's dash for the ocean.

Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūjō

Ryūjō ( "Prancing Dragon") was a light <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> built for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) during the early 1930s. Small and lightly built in an attempt to exploit a loophole in the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922, she proved to be top-heavy and only marginally stable and was back in the <a href="shipyard">shipyard</a> for modifications to address those issues within a year of completion. With her stability improved, "Ryūjō" returned to service and was employed in operations during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>. During World War II, she provided air support for operations in <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281941%E2%80%931942%29">the Philippines</a>, <a href="Malayan%20Campaign">Malaya</a>, and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20Campaign">Dutch East Indies</a>, where her aircraft participated in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20the%20Java%20Sea">Second Battle of the Java Sea</a>. During the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid">Indian Ocean raid</a> in April 1942, the carrier attacked British merchant shipping with both her guns and her aircraft. "Ryūjō" next participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Aleutian%20Islands">Battle of the Aleutian Islands</a> in June. She was sunk by American carrier aircraft at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a> on 24 August 1942.

"Ryūjō" was planned as a light carrier of around <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard displacement</a> to exploit a loophole in the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922 that carriers under standard displacement were not regarded as "aircraft carriers". While "Ryūjō" was under construction, Article Three of the <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval Treaty</a> of 1930 closed the above-mentioned loophole; consequently, "Ryūjō" was the only light aircraft carrier of her type to be completed by Japan.

"Ryūjō" had a length of <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. with a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of . She <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at standard load and at normal load. Her crew consisted of 600 officers and enlisted men.
To keep "Ryūjō"s weight to 8,000 metric tons, the hull was lightly built and no armor could be provided, although some protective plating was added abreast the machinery spaces and <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s. She was also designed with only a single <a href="hangar">hangar</a>, which would have left an extremely low profile (there being just of <a href="freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a> <a href="amidships">amidships</a> and aft). Between the time the carrier was laid down in 1929 and launched in 1931, however, the Navy doubled her aircraft stowage requirement to 48 in order to give her a more capable air group. This necessitated the addition of a second hangar atop the first, raising freeboard to . Coupled with the ship's narrow beam, the consequent top-heaviness made her minimally stable in rough seas, despite the fitting of <a href="Sperry%20Corporation">Sperry</a> active <a href="stabilizer%20%28ship%29">stabilizer</a>s. This was a common flaw amongst many treaty-circumventing Japanese warships of her generation.

The <a href="Tomozuru%20Incident">Tomozuru Incident</a> of 12 March 1934, in which a top-heavy <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> capsized in heavy weather, caused the IJN to investigate the stability of all their ships, resulting in a number of design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. "Ryūjō", already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the <a href="Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal">Kure Naval Arsenal</a> for modifications that strengthened her keel and added <a href="ballast">ballast</a> and shallow <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a>s to improve her stability. Her <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>s were moved higher up the side of her hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.

Shortly afterward, "Ryūjō" was one of many Japanese warships caught in a <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a> on 25 September 1935 while on maneuvers during the "<a href="4th%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29%23The%20Fourth%20Fleet%20Incident">Fourth Fleet Incident</a>." The ship's <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>, <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> and superstructure were damaged and the hangar was flooded. The <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> was raised one deck and the bow was remodelled with more <a href="flare%20%28ship%29">flare</a> to improve the sea handling. After these modifications, the beam and draft increased to and respectively. The displacement also increased to at standard load and at normal load. The crew also grew to 924 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was fitted with two geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> sets with a total of , each driving one <a href="propeller%20shaft%20%28ship%29">propeller shaft</a>, using steam provided by six <a href="Kampon">Kampon</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. "Ryūjō" had a designed speed of , but reached during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s from . The ship carried of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, which gave her a range of at . The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ship's starboard side amidships and exhausted horizontally below flight deck level through two small funnels.

"Ryūjō" was a <a href="flush%20deck">flush-decked</a> carrier without an <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23I">island</a> <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>; the navigating and control bridge was located just under the forward lip of the flight deck in a long glassed-in "greenhouse", whilst the superstructure was set back from the ship's <a href="stem%20%28ship%29">stem</a>, giving "Ryūjō" a distinctive open bow. The flight deck was wide and extended well beyond the aft end of the superstructure, supported by a pair of pillars. Six transverse <a href="arrestor%20wire">arrestor wire</a>s were installed on the flight deck and were later modernised in 1936 to stop a aircraft. The ship's hangars were both long and wide, and had an approximate area of . Between them, they gave the ship the capacity to store 48 aircraft, although only 37 could be operated at one time. After the Fourth Fleet Incident, "Ryūjō"s bridge and the leading edge of the flight deck were rounded off to make them more streamlined. This reduced the length of the flight deck by .

Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">elevators</a>; the forward platform measured and the rear . The small rear elevator became a problem as the IJN progressively fielded larger and more modern carrier aircraft. Of all the aircraft in front-line service in 1941, only the <a href="Nakajima%20B5N">Nakajima B5N</a> "Kate" <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a> would fit, when positioned at an angle with its wings folded. This effectively made "Ryūjō" a single-elevator carrier and considerably hindered transfer of aircraft in and out of the hangars for rearming and refueling during combat operations.

As completed, "Ryūjō"s primary <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA)</a> armament comprised six twin-gun mounts equipped with 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">12.7-centimeter Type 89</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s mounted on projecting <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s, three on either side of the carrier's hull. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. Twenty-four anti-aircraft (AA) Type 93 <a href="13.2%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20machine%20gun">13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun</a>s were also fitted, in twin and quadruple mounts. Their effective range against aircraft was . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round <a href="magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazines</a> reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.

During the carrier's 1934–36 refit, two of the mountings were exchanged for two twin-gun mounts for <a href="license-built">license-built</a> <a href="25%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20anti-aircraft%20gun">Hotchkiss</a> <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">25 mm Type 96</a> light AA guns, resulting in a savings of approximately of top-weight that improved the ship's overall stability. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to "handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, [and] it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast". These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. The machine-guns were replaced during a brief refit in April–May 1942 with six triple-mount AA guns.

Following the <a href="Japanese%20ship-naming%20conventions">Japanese ship-naming conventions</a> for aircraft carriers, "Ryūjō" was named "Dragon Horse". The ship was <a href="Keel">laid down</a> at the <a href="Mitsubishi%20Heavy%20Industries">Mitsubishi's</a> <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a> shipyard on 26 November 1929. She was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 2 April 1931, towed to <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20Arsenal">Yokosuka Naval Arsenal</a> on 25 April for <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a>, and <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 9 May 1933 with Captain <a href="Toshio%20Matsunaga">Toshio Matsunaga</a> in command. While training in mid-1933, her initial air group consisted of nine <a href="Mitsubishi%20B1M">Mitsubishi B1M</a>2 (Type 13) torpedo bombers, plus three spares, and three <a href="Nakajima%20A1N">A1N1</a> (Type 3) <a href="fighter%20plane">fighters</a>, plus two spares. Matsunaga was relieved by Captain <a href="Torao%20Kuwabara">Torao Kuwabara</a> on 20 October. After the Tomozuru Incident, the ship was reconstructed from 26 May to 20 August 1934.

Captain <a href="Ichiro%20Ono">Ichiro Ono</a> assumed command on 15 November 1934 and "Ryūjō" became the flagship of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Hideho%20Wada">Hideho Wada</a>'s <a href="First%20Carrier%20Division">First Carrier Division</a>. The following month the ship was chosen to evaluate <a href="dive%20bomber">dive-bombing</a> tactics using six <a href="Nakajima%20E4N">Nakajima E4N</a>2-C Type 90 <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a>, six <a href="Yokosuka%20B3Y">Yokosuka B3Y1</a> Type 92 torpedo bombers, and a dozen <a href="Nakajima%20A2N">A2N1</a> Type 90 fighters. The reconnaissance aircraft proved to be unsuitable after several months' testing. "Ryūjō" participated in the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935 where she was attached to the <a href="IJN%20Fourth%20Fleet">IJN Fourth Fleet</a>. The fleet was caught in a typhoon on 25 September and the ship was moderately damaged. "Ryūjō" arrived at Kure on 11 October 1935 for repairs, modifications, and a refit that lasted until 31 May 1936. On 31 October Ono was relieved by Captain <a href="Shun%27ichi%20Kira">Shun'ichi Kira</a>.
In mid-1936, the ship was used to evaluate a dozen <a href="Aichi%20D1A">Aichi D1A</a> dive bombers and dive-bombing tactics. She also embarked at that time 24 <a href="Nakajima%20A4N">A4N1</a> fighters, plus four and eight spare aircraft respectively. In September, "Ryūjō" resumed her role as flagship of First Carrier Division, now commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="Sabur%C5%8D%20Sat%C5%8D">Saburō Satō</a>. Her air group now consisted of a mixture of B3Y1 torpedo bombers, D1A1 dive bombers and A2N fighters, but her torpedo bombers were transferred after fleet maneuvers in October demonstrated effective dive bombing tactics. Captain <a href="Katsuo%20Abe">Katsuo Abe</a> assumed command of the ship on 16 November.

The First Carrier Division arrived off Shanghai on 13 August 1937 to support operations of the Japanese Army in <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912-1949%29">China</a>. Her aircraft complement consisted of 12 A4N fighters (plus four spares) and 15 D1A dive bombers. The dive bombers attacked targets in and near Shanghai. The Japanese fighters had their first aerial engagement on 22 August when four A4Ns surprised 18 <a href="Nationalist%20Chinese%20Air%20Force">Nationalist</a> <a href="Curtiss%20Hawk%20III">Curtiss Hawk III</a> fighters and claimed to have shot down six without loss. The following day, four A4Ns claimed to have shot down nine Chinese fighters without loss to themselves. The carriers returned to <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo</a> at the beginning of September to resupply before arriving off the South China coast on 21 September to attack Chinese forces near <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a>. Nine fighters from "Ryūjō" escorted a raid on the city and claimed six of the defending fighters. While escorting another raid later that same day, the Japanese pilots claimed five aircraft shot down and one probably shot down. The dive bombers attacked targets near Canton until the ship sailed to the Shanghai area on 3 October. Her air group was flown ashore on 6 October to support Japanese forces near Shanghai and <a href="Nanking">Nanking</a>. "Ryūjō" returned home in November and briefly became a training ship before she was assigned to Rear Admiral <a href="Tomoshige%20Samejima">Tomoshige Samejima</a>'s <a href="Second%20Carrier%20Division">Second Carrier Division</a>.

In February 1938 the ship replaced her A4N <a href="biplane">biplane</a>s with nine <a href="Mitsubishi%20A5M">Mitsubishi A5M</a> "Claude" <a href="monoplane">monoplane</a> fighters. The division supported Japanese operations in Southern China in March–April and again in October. Captain <a href="Kiichi%20Hasegawa">Kiichi Hasegawa</a> assumed command on 15 November 1939. "Ryūjō" was given a refit that lasted from December 1939 through January 1940 and became a training ship until November when she became the flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="Kakuji%20Kakuta">Kakuji Kakuta</a>'s <a href="Third%20Carrier%20Division">Third Carrier Division</a>. Hasegawa was relieved by Captain <a href="Ushie%20Sugimoto">Ushie Sugimoto</a> on 21 June. The ship's air group then consisted of 18 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 16 A5M4 fighters. When the <a href="First%20Air%20Fleet">First Air Fleet</a> was formed on 10 April 1941, "Ryūjō" became flagship of <a href="Fourth%20Carrier%20Division">Fourth Carrier Division</a>.

The ship's assignment at the beginning of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> was to support the invasion of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, initially by attacking the American naval base at <a href="Davao%20City">Davao</a>, <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> on the morning of 8 December. Her air group had not changed, but four of each type of aircraft were spares. "Ryūjō"s initial airstrike consisted of 13 B5Ns escorted by nine A5Ms with a smaller, follow-on airstrike later in the day by two B5Ns and three A5Ms. They accomplished little, destroying two <a href="Consolidated%20PBY">Consolidated PBY</a> <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>s on the ground for the loss of one B5N and A5M. The ship covered the landing at Davao on 20 December and her B5Ns attacked a British <a href="oil%20tanker">oil tanker</a> south of Davao. In January 1942 her aircraft supported Japanese operations in the <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a>.

In mid-February 1942, "Ryūjō"s aircraft attacked ships evacuating from Singapore, claiming eight ships damaged, three burnt, and four sunk. They also covered convoys carrying troops to Sumatra. The ship was unsuccessfully attacked by several <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> light bombers of <a href="No.%2084%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 84 Squadron RAF</a> on 14 February. The following day two waves of B5Ns, totaling 13 aircraft, attacked the British <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , but managed only to damage the ship's <a href="Supermarine%20Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a> seaplane. Follow-on attacks later that day were also unsuccessful. Two days later, B5Ns destroyed , a Dutch destroyer that had run aground in the Gaspar Strait and been abandoned on 14 February. The carrier sailed to <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a> the next day and arrived on 20 February. A week later she was assigned to cover the convoy taking troops to <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, <a href="Java">Java</a>. Her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March and six B5Ns sank the American destroyer after it had been abandoned by its crew. Six other B5Ns bombed the port of <a href="Semarang">Semarang</a>, possibly setting one merchantman on fire.

"Ryūjō" arrived in Singapore on 5 March and the ship supported operations in Sumatra and escorted convoys to <a href="Burma">Burma</a> and the <a href="Andaman%20Islands">Andaman Islands</a> for the rest of the month. On 1 April, while the 1st Air Fleet was starting <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid">its raid in the Indian Ocean</a>, Malay Force, consisting of "Ryūjō", six <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, and four destroyers, left Burma on a mission to destroy merchant shipping in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>. B5Ns damaged one freighter on 5 April before the force split into three groups. "Ryūjō"s aircraft bombed the small ports of <a href="Cocanada">Cocanada</a> and <a href="Vizagapatam">Vizagapatam</a> on the southeastern coast of India the next day, doing little damage, in addition to claiming two ships sunk and six more damaged during the day. The carrier and her escorts, the light cruiser and the destroyer "<a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Y%C5%ABgiri%20%281930%29">Yugiri</a>" claimed to have sunk three more ships by gunfire. All together, Malay Force sank 19 ships totaling almost , before reuniting on 7 April and arriving at Singapore on 11 April. A week later, her B5Ns were detached for torpedo training and the ship arrived at Kure on 23 April for a brief refit.

The newly commissioned carrier joined Carrier Division 4, under the command of Kakuta, with "Ryūjō" on 3 May 1942. They formed the core of the 2nd Carrier Strike Force, part of the Northern Force, tasked to attack the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, an operation planned to seize several of the islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the <a href="Kurile%20Islands">Kurile Islands</a> while the main body of the American fleet was occupied <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">defending Midway</a>. "Ryūjō"s air group now consisted of 12 A6M2 Zeros and 18 B5Ns, plus two spares of each type. The ship transferred to <a href="Mutsu%20Bay">Mutsu Bay</a> on 25 May and then to <a href="Paramushiro">Paramushiro</a> on 1 June before departing the same day for the Aleutians.

At dawn on 3 June, she launched nine B5Ns, escorted by six Zeros, to attack <a href="Battle%20of%20Dutch%20Harbor">Dutch Harbor</a> on <a href="Unalaska%20Island">Unalaska Island</a>. One B5N crashed on takeoff and only six of the B5Ns and all of the Zeros were able to make it through the bad weather, destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the <a href="oil%20depot">oil storage tanks</a> and barracks. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. One Zero from "Ryūjō" from the second strike was damaged by a <a href="Curtiss%20P-40">Curtiss P-40</a> and crash landed on the island of Akutan. The aircraft, later dubbed the <a href="Akutan%20Zero">Akutan Zero</a>, remained largely intact and was later salvaged and test-flown. On the following day, the two carriers launched another airstrike, consisting of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns, which successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A <a href="Martin%20B-26%20Marauder">Martin B-26 Marauder</a> bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> bomber was shot down by <a href="flak">flak</a> during the attack.

"Ryūjō" arrived back at Mutsu Bay on 24 June, but departed for the Aleutians four days later to cover the second reinforcement convoy to <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu</a> and <a href="Kiska%20Island">Kiska Island</a>s and remained in the area until 7 July in case of an American counterattack. She arrived at Kure on 13 July for a refit and was transferred to Carrier Division 2 a day later.

The <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">American landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi</a> on 7 August caught the Japanese by surprise. The next day, "Ryūjō" was transferred to Carrier Division 1 and departed for <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> on 16 August together with the other two carriers of the division, and . Her air group consisted of 24 Zeros and nine B5N2s. Admiral <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>, <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>, ordered Truk to be bypassed and the fleet refueled at sea after an American carrier was spotted near the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> on 21 August. At 01:45 on 24 August, Vice Admiral <a href="Ch%C5%ABichi%20Nagumo">Chūichi Nagumo</a>, commander of the Mobile Force, ordered "Ryūjō" and the heavy cruiser , escorted by two destroyers, detached to move in advance of the troop convoy bound for <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> and to attack the Allied air base at <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Henderson Field</a> if no carriers were spotted. This Detached Force was commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="Ch%C5%ABichi%20Hara">Chūichi Hara</a> in "Tone".

"Ryūjō" launched two small airstrikes, totaling 6 B5Ns and 15 Zeros, beginning at 12:20 once the Diversionary Force was north of <a href="Lunga%20Point">Lunga Point</a>. Four <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">Grumman F4F Wildcat</a> fighters from <a href="United%20States%20Marine">Marine</a> Fighter Squadron <a href="VMF-223">VMF-223</a> on <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a> (CAP) near Henderson Field spotted the incoming Japanese aircraft around 14:20 and alerted the defenders. Ten more Wildcats from VMF-223 and <a href="VMF-212">VMF-212</a> <a href="Scrambling%20%28military%29">scrambled</a>, as well as 2 <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a> <a href="Bell%20P-400">Bell P-400</a>s from the <a href="67th%20Fighter%20Squadron">67th Fighter Squadron</a> in response. Nine of the Zeros <a href="strafe">strafe</a>d the airfield while the B5Ns bombed it with bombs to little effect. The Americans claimed to have shot down 19 aircraft, but only three Zeros and three B5Ns were lost, although another B5N was forced to crash-land. Only three Wildcats were shot down in turn.

Around 14:40, the Detached Force was spotted again by several search aircraft from the carrier , although the Japanese ships did not immediately spot the Americans. They launched three Zeros as CAP at 14:55, shortly before two of the searching <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a> torpedo bombers near-missed "Ryūjō" astern with four bombs three minutes later. Two more Zeros reinforced the CAP shortly after 15:00, just in time to intercept two more searching Avengers, shooting down one. In the meantime, the carrier had launched an airstrike against the Detached Force in the early afternoon that consisted of 31 <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">Douglas SBD Dauntless</a>es and eight Avengers; the long range precluded fighter escort. They sighted the carrier shortly afterward and attacked. They hit "Ryūjō" three times with bombs and one torpedo; the torpedo hit flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms. No aircraft from either "Ryūjō" or "Saratoga" were shot down in the attack.

The bomb hits set the carrier on fire and she took on a <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> from the flooding caused by the torpedo hit. "Ryūjō" turned north at 14:08, but her list continued to increase although the fires were put out. The progressive flooding disabled her machinery and caused her to stop at 14:20. The order to abandon ship was given at 15:15 and the destroyer moved alongside to rescue the crew. The ships were bombed several times by multiple B-17s without effect before "Ryūjō" capsized about 17:55 at coordinates with the loss of 7 officers and 113 crewmen.

Fourteen aircraft that she had dispatched on raids returned shortly after "Ryūjō" sank and circled over the force until they were forced to ditch. Seven pilots were rescued.

Gilberto Silva

Gilberto Aparecido da Silva (; born 7 October 1976) is a Brazilian former professional <a href="association%20football">footballer</a>.

Born and raised in <a href="poverty">poverty</a> in the Brazilian municipality of <a href="Lagoa%20da%20Prata">Lagoa da Prata</a>, Gilberto joined the youth academy at local club <a href="Am%C3%A9rica%20Futebol%20Clube%20%28MG%29">América Mineiro</a>, where he made his senior debut as a centre-back in 1998. After starring the following season, where he helped gain the club promotion into the <a href="Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20A">Campeonato Brasileiro Série A</a>, he joined city rivals <a href="Clube%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Mineiro">Atlético Mineiro</a>. During his time at Atlético, Gilberto transitioned into a defensive midfielder under head coach <a href="Carlos%20Alberto%20Parreira">Carlos Alberto Parreira</a>, and flourished in his new role, gaining a call-up to the <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazilian national team</a> for the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a>, where he featured prominently as his country won the tournament.

As a result of his World Cup performances, Gilberto garnered a move to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> to sign for <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> that summer for a fee of £4.5 million. During his six years at Arsenal, Gilberto gained a reputation as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world, and starred in a midfield duo alongside <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a>. He would feature as a member of the "<a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">Invincibles</a>", where he captured his first top-flight league title as his team went undefeated the whole season, as well as winning two <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s. Gilberto also holds distinct records at Arsenal, recording their first goal at the <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates Stadium</a>, as well as their fastest ever goal, scoring in 20 seconds in against <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV Eindhoven</a> in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2002–03 UEFA Champions League</a>. After departing Arsenal, Gilberto relocated to Greece, playing for <a href="Panathinaikos%20F.C.">Panathinaikos</a>, where he won a domestic double. He then returned to Brazil in 2011, signing for <a href="Gr%C3%AAmio%20Foot-Ball%20Porto%20Alegrense">Grêmio</a>, where he remained for two years, before returning to Atlético to win the <a href="2013%20Copa%20Libertadores">2013 Copa Libertadores</a> prior to retiring.

Gilberto featured at senior level for much of his international career, representing Brazil over a period of 9 years. He enjoyed a period of sustained success with his country, as he featured prominently in their victorious campaign at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, as well as being a core component as the team also won the <a href="2005%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup">2005 FIFA Confederations Cup</a>, while also featuring as <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> in their <a href="Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica">Copa América</a> win in <a href="2007%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica">2007</a>. After retaining the Confederations Cup in <a href="2009%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup">2009</a>, Gilberto expressed his desire to prolong his club career, which coincided with limited playing time for Brazil, prompting his retirement from international competition prior to the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>, after amassing 93 appearances for the side.

Gilberto served as technical director at Panathinaikos in 2016.

As a child, Gilberto lived in the city of <a href="Lagoa%20da%20Prata">Lagoa da Prata</a> with his father (a <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a>), his mother (a <a href="housewife">housewife</a>) and three sisters. His family lived in a small house which his father built, in the district of Usina Luciânia. Despite financial hardship, causing his sisters and him to share a single room, he had a relatively carefree childhood: he describes it as "[a time when] I had no responsibility in my life, I played football on the street with cousins and friends, and we never had any contact with drugs or violence". In 1988 (aged 12), he got the chance to break out of poverty by playing football, joining <a href="Am%C3%A9rica%20Futebol%20Clube%20%28MG%29">América Mineiro</a> as a youth player. It was during these years at América Mineiro that Gilberto was taught defensive discipline by playing as a <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Centre%20back">central defender</a>. When not playing football, Gilberto was taught furniture-making skills by his father, which he would come to use in the following years. In 1991, Gilberto's father retired leaving the 15-year-old to provide financially for his whole family, a task made more difficult by his mother's ill-health.

Because of the low wage at América Mineiro, he was forced to quit football to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this would be the end of his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.

In 1997, Gilberto's friends convinced him to give football another try, which led to him re-signing for América Mineiro on 1 June 1997, this time as a full-time professional. Aged 22, Gilberto played as a central defender for the first team. During his first season for América Mineiro he was regarded as a key player by the club, despite being criticised by some fans for inconsistency. He helped them win the <a href="Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20B">Série B</a> division, and consequently gain <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to <a href="Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20A">Série A</a>.

During Gilberto's third season at América Mineiro, with the team back to Série B after relegation in Série A in 1999, he played 20 games and scored one goal, helping the club to finish runners-up in the league. In 2000, aged 24, he joined rival club <a href="Clube%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Mineiro">Atlético Mineiro</a>. In his first season for the club, he fractured his right <a href="tibia">tibia</a> and, as a result, missed a number of games. In his second season, he was moved by the <a href="manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a> <a href="Carlos%20Alberto%20Parreira">Carlos Alberto Parreira</a> from central defence to a defensive midfield role where he flourished. He scored three goals in the 2001 season and became a revelation in Brazilian club football.

Gilberto's performance in the 2002 FIFA World Cup caught the attention of many coaches. Gilberto expressed a desire to move to England, saying, "It would be fantastic to play against the likes of <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a> again." As a result, <a href="Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a> clubs <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> and <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> led the chase to sign him. In August, while still under contract to Atlético Mineiro, Gilberto joined Arsenal on their pre-season tour of <a href="Austria">Austria</a>; while he had not yet signed for Arsenal the deal looked set to go ahead. However, complications arose when a transfer embargo was placed on Atlético Mineiro due to unpaid wages to some players at the club, including Gilberto. There was also an issue of obtaining a UK <a href="work%20permit">work permit</a> for Gilberto. Despite the complications, Gilberto ended a summer of speculation and joined Arsenal on 7 August 2002 for a fee of £4.5 million. Upon signing Gilberto, Arsenal manager <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a> said, "What I like was the fact that he kept things simple. He can play all across the midfield but the holding role just in front of the defence is what he does best."
When Gilberto moved to England and began training with Arsenal, he bought a house in <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>, South <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. Having been used to life in small Brazilian towns, he initially struggled to adapt to the new way of life in London. However, on the pitch, he settled in very quickly. On 11 August 2002 he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the second half of the <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a> game in which he scored the winning goal. As the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League">2002–03 FA Premier League</a> season began, Gilberto faced stiff competition for a place in midfield from compatriot <a href="Edu%20Gaspar">Edu</a>. After two substitute appearances, Gilberto finally broke into the starting eleven on 27 August, helping Arsenal to a 5–2 win against <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. Gilberto's good form continued as he set a new record for the fastest goal scored in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, scoring after 20.07 seconds against <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a> on 25 September 2002. However, his legal problems continued, since his transfer to England still was not fully resolved. As a result, Gilberto instructed his lawyers to start legal proceedings against Atlético Mineiro for unpaid wages in November 2002. For the second half of the 2002–03 season, he remained a regular starter in the Arsenal side. Even though he suffered a lapse in form towards the end of the season, he won an <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> winner's medal, playing in the <a href="2003%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> as Arsenal beat <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> 1–0.

<a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> was an even better season for Gilberto, as he was instrumental in helping Arsenal win the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> title whilst going the entire season unbeaten. He played in 32 of Arsenal's 38 unbeaten Premier League games during the season. His next season started equally impressively, as he scored the first goal in Arsenal's 3–1 <a href="2004%20FA%20Community%20Shield">Community Shield</a> win over <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a>. During the opening games of the season, he started to experience severe pain in his back, and after a match at <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> on 27 September 2004, a scan revealed he had fractured his back. At first it was reported that he would be out of action for a month. Later reports suggested the injury could be season-threatening.

Gilberto's doctor ordered him to wear a back brace for three months to aid the healing of the fractured bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil for the duration of his rehabilitation. During his time there, he doubted whether he would ever be able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> on 22 April 2005. During the whole <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%202004%E2%80%9305">2004–05 season</a>, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him. Gilberto's difficult <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2004–05 season</a> ended in consolation as Arsenal finished runners-up in the Premier League and won the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> against Manchester United in a <a href="penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a>.

In June 2005, football agent Jacques Lichtenstein took Atlético Mineiro to court over Gilberto's transfer in 2002. Lichtenstein's lawyer argued that he and his informal partner, <a href="Ronny%20Rosenthal">Ronny Rosenthal</a>, never received an allegedly agreed 10% commission from Gilberto's £4.5 million transfer to Arsenal from Atlético Mineiro in July 2002. Arsène Wenger and Arsenal vice-chairman <a href="David%20Dein">David Dein</a> both gave evidence in court, saying that Arsenal dealt directly with Atlético Mineiro and that no agent was involved in the deal. The case was conducted before The Hon. Mr Justice Jack, who on 29 June ruled against Lichtenstein, and ordered the claimants pay Atletico Minéiro £94,000 in legal costs. A year later, the case could have caused problems for Arsenal, when former player <a href="Ashley%20Cole">Ashley Cole</a> criticised the club for "hypocrisy and double standards" in the way they approached Gilberto.
With legal matters subsided, the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06 season</a> began. Following midfielder and team <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a>'s departure from Arsenal, Gilberto became a senior member of the Arsenal team. Shortly into the season, in September 2005, his desire to see his career out with the club led to Gilberto extending his Arsenal contract to June 2009. A month later this loyalty was repaid when, on 18 October 2005, Gilberto made his first appearance for Arsenal as captain, against <a href="Sparta%20Prague">Sparta Prague</a>. Although Gilberto had a period of bad form during the winter months of the season, his good defensive performances during the latter stages of the UEFA Champions League (in particular, games against <a href="Real%20Madrid">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> and <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a>) gained him praise. On 17 May 2006 Gilberto played for Arsenal in the <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">UEFA Champions League Final</a> against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, which Arsenal lost 2–1.

Following the departure of defender <a href="Sol%20Campbell">Sol Campbell</a> and retirement of striker <a href="Dennis%20Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</a> in the summer of 2006, Gilberto was announced as Arsenal's vice-captain for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07 season</a>. He began the season well, as he scored the first ever goal at the Dutch <a href="DSB%20Stadion">DSB Stadion</a> in a pre-season <a href="friendly%20match">friendly match</a>. He then scored Arsenal's first ever goal in a competitive match at the <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates Stadium</a> in a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa. His good form continued for Arsenal as he scored several league goals, garnering praise for his performances as stand-in captain while <a href="Thierry%20Henry">Thierry Henry</a> was injured. Gilberto and his agent (Paulo Villana) also reiterated the player's desire to honour his contract with the Gunners. Meanwhile, Gilberto's good form carried through to the second half of the season. Even though Arsenal only managed to finish fourth in the league, he ended the season as Arsenal's second highest scorer with 10 Premier League goals. The explanation for his unusually high tally is the fact that Henry suffered two lengthy injury spells, in which Gilberto stepped up as captain to take <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a>. Gilberto's goal scoring record combined with his own good form in midfield and his leadership of Wenger's youthful squad led some Arsenal fans and football pundits to label Gilberto as Arsenal's best player of the season, and one of the best in the Premier League.

The buildup of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08 season</a> saw Arsenal captain Thierry Henry leave the club to join Barcelona. This coupled with the fact that Gilberto was Arsenal's vice-captain during the 2006–07 season led many people to assume that Gilberto would take over Henry's role. However, to the surprise of Gilberto, <a href="William%20Gallas">William Gallas</a> was given the captain's armband instead. In August, after returning to Arsenal's pre-season training late due to his involvement in the <a href="Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica">Copa América</a> tournament (and thus missing the start of the season), Gilberto then lost his place in the first team to young midfielder <a href="Mathieu%20Flamini">Mathieu Flamini</a>. This reignited speculation linking Gilberto to Italy due to rumours that he was unhappy being on the bench at Arsenal. However, reports that he was being snubbed at the club were dismissed by Wenger, who insisted that Gilberto would remain at Arsenal to fight for his place. Despite this, in October 2007, rumours in the press re-emerged that Gilberto was angry at Wenger for being asked to play in defence in a <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> game against <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, and had resultantly refused to play. Gilberto ended up playing the game in midfield though, with he and Wenger both denying rumours of a rift with each other. Gilberto subsequently commented that while he was not happy being a substitute, he would remain professional and fight for his place at the club. Also in October, Gilberto ceded the Brazilian captaincy to <a href="L%C3%BAcio">Lúcio</a> upon his compatriot's return from injury.

Through the winter months of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2007–08</a> season, Gilberto started a limited number of games for the "Gunners", though he kept his place in the Brazil team, starting several games for "A Seleção". After becoming more and more frustrated with not playing regularly, Gilberto admitted in February 2008 that he had been made to feel "totally useless" by Wenger. Despite this, he declined to make a decision on his future; something which prompted Wenger to promise talks with Gilberto. Amidst Gilberto's frustration at Arsenal, he targeted playing in <a href="Brazil%20national%20under-23%20football%20team">Brazil's Olympic</a> team <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">in Beijing</a> during August 2008; a competition which he had never played in. Off the pitch, Gilberto was reported to have passed his <a href="British%20nationality%20law%23British%20citizenship%20by%20naturalisation">UK Citizenship test</a>, and that he would subsequently apply for a <a href="British%20passport">British passport</a>. April saw Gilberto's season take a turn for the better; making 5 starts – a substantial portion of his seasonal total of 12 – even managing to score a goal. The goal came against <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> on 19 April, and despite its deflective nature leading to some classing it as a possible own goal, the Premier League's <a href="Dubious%20Goals%20Committee">Dubious Goals Committee</a> eventually credited the goal to Gilberto. However, Gilberto's return to favour did not stop Arsenal's 2007–08 season ending trophyless. The club subsequently faced the possibility of several players leaving; among those rumoured to leave was Flamini, the player who had kept Gilberto out of the first team. The Frenchman ended up moving to <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> on 6 May, and a subsequent gap was left in the Arsenal midfield. Gilberto became less likely to leave the club during Summer 2008 as a result, and Wenger remarked that he wanted to keep Gilberto; Gilberto saying he wanted to stay and possibly even renew his contract at Arsenal. Gilberto finished the 2007–08 season with 36 appearances for Arsenal, albeit only 12 of these being Premier League starts.

Following Brazil's summer international games, he was seriously linked with a move to Greek club <a href="Panathinaikos%20F.C.">Panathinaikos</a>. The speculation concluded when Gilberto agreed terms with the <a href="Athens">Athenian</a> side on 17 July 2008, for an undisclosed fee. During his first season at the club, Gilberto helped the side reach the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. He managed to win both the 2009–10 Greek Championship and Cup with Panathinaikos, being the starting holding midfielder and producing numerous solid displays. In Gilberto's final home game for Panathinaikos on 23 May 2011, he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory over <a href="P.A.O.K.%20F.C.">PAOK</a>, for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Superleague%20Greece%23Playoffs">Greek UEFA Champions League playoffs</a>. Two days later, he played his final game for the team, winning 2–0 against <a href="AEK%20Athens%20F.C.">AEK Athens</a>.

On 23 May 2011, Gilberto ended his 9-year career in Europe by signing an 18-month deal with <a href="Gr%C3%AAmio%20Foot-Ball%20Porto%20Alegrense">Grêmio</a>, of <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>.

In the past, Gilberto hinted that he may one day return to Brazil to play for Atlético Mineiro. After his football career finishes, he has said that he would like to, "Live in a small farm and ride a horse and have all of my family next to me." On 10 November 2012, it was confirmed that Gilberto's wish would be granted, as he signed a pre-contract with "Galo".

On 9 December 2012, Gilberto was welcomed at <a href="Tancredo%20Neves%20International%20Airport">Aeroporto dos Confins</a> by fans of Atlético Mineiro, returning to the <a href="Belo%20Horizonte">Belo Horizonte</a> side after 11 years away. Gilberto spoke of winning the <a href="2013%20Copa%20Libertadores">2013 Copa Libertadores</a> title upon his return. Gilberto achieved this wish on 24 July 2013, with a <a href="2013%20Copa%20Libertadores%20Finals">final victory</a> over <a href="Club%20Olimpia">Club Olimpia</a> of Paraguay.

On 11 December 2015, after two years without a club, he officially announced his retirement as a footballer, intending to pursue a career as an international consultant for clubs and players.

In October 2001, his good performances from that year earned Gilberto a call-up to the Brazilian national team (""A Seleção"") by <a href="Luiz%20Felipe%20Scolari">Luiz Felipe Scolari</a> for the 2002 World Cup qualification games. He made his international debut against <a href="Chile%20national%20football%20team">Chile</a> on 7 October, coming on as a substitute. On 7 November, he made his debut in the starting line-up of the national team against <a href="Bolivia%20national%20football%20team">Bolivia</a>. His international career continued to flourish in early 2002: he scored twice against Bolivia and once against <a href="Iceland%20national%20football%20team">Iceland</a>. In 2002, he was a surprise inclusion in the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20squads%23Brazil">Brazil squad</a> for the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a> in <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. He was expected to play a small part in the tournament. However, defensive midfielder and Brazilian team captain <a href="Emerson%20Ferreira%20da%20Rosa">Emerson</a> was injured in training just before the first World Cup game. In light of the setback, coach Scolari called upon Gilberto to fill the gap which Emerson left. Gilberto ended up playing in every minute of every match of the tournament, which Brazil went on to win. In the words of <a href="Veja%20%28magazine%29">Veja magazine</a>, Gilberto "carried the piano for <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="Rivaldo">Rivaldo</a> to play their tunes on". He was not without attacking use either, setting up Ronaldo's semi-final goal to put Brazil through to the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a>. It was Gilberto's performance in this tournament which led to him being classed as one of the top defensive midfielders in the world.

On 22 June 2005, Gilberto played in Brazil's 1–1 draw against <a href="Japan%20national%20football%20team">Japan</a>, in his only game of the <a href="2005%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup">2005 FIFA Confederations Cup</a>. His absence as a first team regular could be explained by his lack of games, and thus match fitness, for Arsenal during the season leading up to the tournament. Gilberto's appearance in the tournament gained him a winners medal, as Brazil went on to win the competition. On the back of his good Champions League form, Gilberto was selected for the Brazil national football team for the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>. Gilberto was substituted on in two games, and started twice due to another injury to Emerson. Brazil were beaten 1–0 by <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> in the quarter final. Following Brazil's World Cup disappointment, midfielder <a href="Juninho%20Pernambucano">Juninho</a> called for the older members of the Brazil squad (including Gilberto) to retire from international football. On the back of Gilberto's childhood idol <a href="Dunga">Dunga</a> being appointed Brazil coach, Gilberto did not take Juninho's advice, and subsequently continued his international career.

On 1 June 2007, Gilberto captained Brazil against <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> at the first senior international match at the new <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>. Having had a seemingly good headed goal disallowed after 20 minutes, he set up Brazil's only goal as the game ended 1–1. During the summer of 2007 Gilberto played in the <a href="2007%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica">Copa América</a> tournament, in which he was chosen to captain Brazil in the absence of <a href="L%C3%BAcio">Lúcio</a>. They went on to beat <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a> 3–0 in the <a href="2007%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%20Final">final</a>, though he missed the final game through suspension. Following the end of the 2007–08 Premier League season, Gilberto was called up to the Brazil national team for <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28CONMEBOL%29">2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers</a> during the summer as well as a tour of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

Gilberto is often called "the invisible wall" in Brazil. His play often goes unnoticed as he positions himself between the two centre backs and the rest of midfield, breaking up opposition attacks before they gather momentum. In this role, he is a part of the defensive unit for both club and country. When playing, he is more passive than most players in defence. Rather than tackle an opponent, he is more likely to shadow him, thus pushing him back. As a result, he has an unusually clean record for a defensive midfielder: he has twice gone 45 games or more without receiving a single <a href="Misconduct%20%28football%29">booking</a> during his Arsenal career.

Gilberto is good at helping to defend against opponents who play a <a href="Long%20ball%20%28association%20football%29">long ball</a> game because he often <a href="Man%20marking">man marks</a> the opposition's attacking <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">target-man</a>. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, something to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.

Despite Gilberto's high pass completion rate, his passing has been described as erratic in the past.

According to ProZone (a data analysis system used by football managers) figures cited by "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" in January 2007, Gilberto was, together with <a href="Paul%20Scholes">Paul Scholes</a> of Manchester United and <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard</a> of <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, one of the few midfielders in England to attain "the elite Champions League level" of performance.

Gilberto is a patron of The Street League, a UK based charity which organises football matches for homeless people, <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s and <a href="asylum%20seeker">asylum seeker</a>s. In June 2003, he travelled to <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> on tour with 17 Street League players. The tour included a visit to his home town Lagoa da Prata and games against local <a href="shanty%20town">shanty town</a> teams at the <a href="Est%C3%A1dio%20do%20Maracan%C3%A3">Maracanã stadium</a>.

In May 2016, Gilberto joined Panathinaikos as technical director. He left in December, after seven months in the role.

Gilberto is a keen musician. In his spare time, he plays the <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a> and the <a href="guitar">guitar</a>. When he first moved to England he took up mandolin lessons and played publicly at his local pub in <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>. He later started learning the guitar instead.

He has a <a href="giant%20anteater">giant anteater</a> named after him at <a href="London%20Zoo">London Zoo</a>. Gilberto is an adoptee of the animal, which he received from a London Zoo competition winner. The footballer described the South American animal as "my slightly more hairy brother!"

21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg

The 21st "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Skanderbeg" (1st Albanian) was a <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> <a href="Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger">mountain infantry</a> <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> of the "<a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>", the armed wing of the German <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> that served alongside, but was never formally part of, the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> during World War II.

The division was developed around the nucleus of an ethnic <a href="Albanians">Albanian</a> battalion which had briefly seen combat against the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a> in eastern <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> as part of the <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29">13th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian)</a>. Composed of Albanians with mostly German and <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslav "Volksdeutsche"</a> (ethnic German) <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officers</a> and <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s, it was given the title "Skanderbeg" after <a href="medieval">medieval</a> Albanian lord <a href="George%20Kastrioti%20Skanderbeg">George Kastrioti Skanderbeg</a>, who defended the <a href="Ottoman%20Albania">region of Albania</a> against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> for more than two decades in the 15th century.

"Skanderbeg" never reached divisional strength, being at most a <a href="brigade">brigade</a>-sized <a href="formation%20%28military%29">formation</a> of between 6,000 and 6,500 troops. In May 1944, members of the division arrested 281 Jews in <a href="Pristina">Pristina</a> and handed them over to the Germans, who transported them to the <a href="Bergen-Belsen%20concentration%20camp">Bergen-Belsen concentration camp</a>, where many were killed. The division itself was better known for this action and for murdering, raping, and looting in predominantly <a href="Serb">Serb</a> areas than for participating in combat operations on behalf of the German <a href="war%20effort">war effort</a>. Its only significant military actions took place during a German anti-Partisan offensive in the <a href="German%20occupied%20territory%20of%20Montenegro">German occupied territory of Montenegro</a> in June and July 1944. Following those operations, the unit was deployed as a guard force at the <a href="chromium">chromium</a> mines in <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, where it was quickly overrun by the Partisans, leading to widespread <a href="desertion">desertion</a>. Reinforced by German "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" personnel and with fewer than 500 Albanians remaining in its ranks, it was disbanded on 1 November 1944. The remaining members were incorporated into the <a href="7th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Mountain%20Division%20Prinz%20Eugen">7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division "Prinz Eugen"</a>. After the war, divisional commander "SS-<a href="Brigadef%C3%BChrer">Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS</a>" <a href="August%20Schmidhuber">August Schmidhuber</a> was found guilty of war crimes by a court in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> and executed in 1947.

On 7 April 1939, five months prior to the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a> <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Albania">invaded</a> <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281928%E2%80%9339%29">Albania</a>. The country was overrun in five days, and Italian King <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20III%20of%20Italy">Victor Emmanuel III</a> accepted the crown offered by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Albania">Parliament of Albania</a>. The <a href="Royal%20Albanian%20Army">Royal Albanian Army</a> was incorporated into the <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Army">Royal Italian Army</a> and a <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a> was appointed to administer the country as a <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a>. Following the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> on 6 April 1941, <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281939%E2%80%9343%29">Italian Albania</a> was expanded to include adjacent parts of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> incorporated mainly from the Yugoslav "<a href="Subdivisions%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%23Banovinas%20%281929%E2%80%931941%29">banovinas</a>" (regional subdivisions) of <a href="Vardar%20Banovina">Vardar</a> and <a href="Morava%20Banovina">Morava</a>. Most of <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> was annexed to Albania, and in the beginning, Albanians living there enthusiastically welcomed the Italian occupation. Some <a href="Kosovo%20Albanians">Kosovo Albanians</a> even suggested that Albanians were "<a href="Aryan%20race">Aryans</a> of <a href="Illyrians">Illyrian</a> heritage". Although officially under Italian rule, the Albanians in Kosovo were given control of the region and encouraged to open Albanian-language schools, which had been banned by the Yugoslav government. The Italians also gave the inhabitants Albanian citizenship and allowed them to fly the <a href="flag%20of%20Albania">flag of Albania</a>. The Royal Italian Army expelled most of the Serbs and Montenegrins that had <a href="Yugoslav%20colonisation%20of%20Kosovo">settled</a> Kosovo during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>. The Kosovo Albanians despised the Serbs for the oppression they had experienced at their hands during the <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a>, <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and under Yugoslav rule. They took advantage of their changed circumstances, attacked their Serb neighbours, and burned the homes of as many as 30,000 Serb and Montenegrin settlers.

Albania remained occupied by Italy until its surrender to the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> in September 1943. In August of that year, faced with the imminent collapse of the Italian <a href="war%20effort">war effort</a>, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> deployed the <a href="2nd%20Panzer%20Army">2nd Panzer Army</a> to the Balkans to take over areas previously occupied by Italy. One of the Italian areas seized by the Germans was Albania, where the <a href="XXI%20Mountain%20Corps%20%28Wehrmacht%29">XXI Mountain Corps</a> of "<a href="Generaloberst">Generaloberst</a>" <a href="Lothar%20Rendulic">Lothar Rendulic</a>'s 2nd Panzer Army had been deployed. A <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> plenipotentiary general, and a special representative of <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, SS-"<a href="Brigadef%C3%BChrer">Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS und Polizei</a>" <a href="Josef%20Fitzthum">Josef Fitzthum</a>, were both based in the Albanian capital of <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a>. The Germans took control of all Albanian forces that had been collaborating with the Italians prior to their capitulation, including the "<a href="Balli%20Komb%C3%ABtar">Balli Kombëtar</a>", an <a href="Anti-communism">anti-communist</a> and <a href="Nationalism">nationalist</a> <a href="militia">militia</a>. The Germans strengthened the Albanian army and gendarmerie, but quickly decided those troops were unreliable. That year, a number of Albanians from Kosovo and the <a href="Sand%C5%BEak">Sandžak</a> region were recruited into the <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29">13th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian)</a>, a "Waffen-SS" division composed largely of <a href="Bosniaks">Bosnian Muslims</a> and <a href="Croats">Croats</a> with mostly German officers, that operated in the <a href="puppet%20state">puppet</a> <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (). A key recruiter amongst Albanians for the "Waffen-SS" was "SS-<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>" <a href="Karl%20von%20Krempler">Karl von Krempler</a>. For about six months the division included about 1,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and the Sandžak who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment (I/2), which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28). The division later recruited a further 500 men from the Sandžak.

The formation of an Albanian "Waffen-SS" division was Fitzthum's idea, initially opposed by the German Foreign Ministry representative for the Balkans <a href="Hermann%20Neubacher">Hermann Neubacher</a>, and also by the head of the <a href="Reich%20Main%20Security%20Office">Reich Main Security Office</a> "SS-<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei</a>" <a href="Ernst%20Kaltenbrunner">Ernst Kaltenbrunner</a>, who influenced Himmler to shelve it. But the Albanian government supported the idea; in the face of increasing difficulties Himmler soon changed his mind, and in February 1944 the idea received <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>'s approval.

In February 1944, Hitler approved the creation of an Albanian "<a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>" division that was to serve only inside Kosovo, and was intended to protect ethnic Albanians but remain under German control. It was meant to be one of three Muslim "Waffen-SS" divisions serving in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, the other two being the 13th SS Division and the <a href="23rd%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Kama%20%282nd%20Croatian%29">23rd "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Kama" (2nd Croatian)</a>. Himmler's goal was to expand "Waffen-SS" recruiting in the Balkans and form two <a href="corps">corps</a> of two divisions each, with one corps to operate in the region of <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> in the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the "<a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Volksdeutsche</a>" <a href="7th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Mountain%20Division%20Prinz%20Eugen">7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division "Prinz Eugen"</a> and together would form a Balkan "Waffen-SS" mountain army of five divisions.
In March 1944, <a href="Bedri%20Pejani">Bedri Pejani</a>, the chairman of the <a href="Second%20League%20of%20Prizren">Second League of Prizren</a>, an organization created after the Italian surrender to advance the interests of Kosovo Albanians, proposed to Hitler that a force of 120,000–150,000 Kosovo Albanian volunteers be raised to fight the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav</a> and <a href="Albanian%20resistance%20during%20World%20War%20II">Albanian</a> partisans. Pejani asked the German leadership to give the Albanians equipment and supplies to fight the communist insurgency, and requested the expansion of the borders of the German puppet state of Albania at the expense of the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German occupied territory of Serbia</a> and the <a href="German%20occupied%20territory%20of%20Montenegro">German occupied territory of Montenegro</a>. These requests were not fulfilled. Nevertheless, in April 1944, Himmler ordered the establishment of the new Albanian volunteer division that Hitler had authorised. It was subsequently named after the medieval Albanian warrior <a href="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a>. By this point, the Germans and some members of the Albanian puppet government believed that about 50,000 ethnic Albanians could be recruited to join the "Waffen-SS". The Germans had initially envisioned a force of 10,000–12,000 men for the Albanian SS division. Himmler saw the Muslim Albanians as a potential source of manpower in Germany's war against the Yugoslav Partisans, who faced significant difficulties in recruiting Kosovo Albanians to join their ranks.

On 17 April 1944, the Albanian battalion of the 13th SS Division was transferred via rail directly from combat in Bosnia to Kosovo to form part of the new Albanian division. The head of "Waffen-SS" recruitment, SS-"Obergruppenführer" <a href="Gottlob%20Berger">Gottlob Berger</a>, reported to Himmler that the Albanians "... were quite sad about leaving." Himmler himself expected "great usefulness" from the unit since the Albanians that fought in the 13th SS Division had proven to be "highly motivated and disciplined" in the fight against the Partisans in the NDH. After the war, Bosnian Muslim former members of the 13th SS Division stated that while with the division the Albanians had shot unarmed civilians and were "very brutal".

On 23 May, Fitzthum noted the failure of the Albanian units that had been used in operations against the Partisans. He reported that he had dissolved four Albanian battalions organized by the Wehrmacht, describing most Albanian army and gendarmerie officers as "totally corrupt, unusable, undisciplined and untrainable." The Germans found that Kosovo Albanians were more cooperative than Albanians from Albania-proper. This was mainly because they feared a return to Yugoslav rule. Thus, many of the division's recruits were Kosovo Albanians, although some were refugees from Albania-proper. The quality of most of these recruits was poor, and only between 6,000 and 6,500 were considered suitable to receive training. Those that were accepted were a combination of about 1,500 former <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army">Royal Yugoslav Army</a> <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>, elements of the failed Albanian army and gendarmerie, volunteers from both pre-war and expanded Albania, and conscripts from families that had more than two sons. The Albanians may have joined for a range of reasons, including access to modern weapons and military training, to help revise the borders of Albania, revenge, and even the opportunity for looting.

The enlistment of Albanian civilians was organized in close cooperation with the Albanian puppet government. In June 1944, Neubacher successfully displaced Pejani, whom he considered "insane". The Albanian Minister of the Interior and new chairman of the Second League of Prizren, <a href="Xhafer%20Deva">Xhafer Deva</a>, was a key factor in recruiting Albanians for the new division. Fitzthum, who had developed a close friendship with Deva, noted that the right-wing and anti-Serb politician was vital for German recruitment efforts. In contrast to the 13th SS Division, the use of Islam as an incentive to join the "Waffen-SS" disappeared completely from the German agenda, while the utilisation of ethnic tensions became much more important. No field <a href="imam">imam</a> is documented in the new division and ideological training was avoided entirely, because the Germans feared that such instruction would upset their new recruits.

The division was founded as the "21. Waffen-SS Gebirgsdivision der SS Skanderbeg (albanische Nr.1)" on 1 May 1944, as part of the XXI Mountain Corps. Most or all of the division's officers, <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s (NCOs), and specialists were German, and were mainly provided by the 7th and 13th SS Divisions, which noticeably weakened those formations. The divisional artillery regiment was formed from the 1st Albanian Artillery Regiment. The division was placed under the command of SS-"Standartenführer" <a href="August%20Schmidhuber">August Schmidhuber</a>, who was promoted to SS-"<a href="Oberf%C3%BChrer">Oberführer</a>" in June. Members took a religious oath using the <a href="Quran">Quran</a>, pledging "<a href="jihad">jihad</a> against unbelievers." The division was originally equipped with captured Italian Carro Armato <a href="M15/42%20tank">M15/42 tank</a>s, which proved to be unreliable. Its garrison was located in the town of <a href="Prizren">Prizren</a>.

Early on, it became clear that most of the division's Muslim Albanian members seemed to be interested only in settling scores with their Christian Serb adversaries, who became the target of numerous atrocities. In order to put a stop to the crimes, the Germans had to disarm battalions of the division in the towns of <a href="Pe%C4%87">Peć</a> and Prizren and arrest the Albanian officers, with one commanding officer even being sent to prison in Germany. On 14 May 1944, members of the division raided <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> homes in Pristina, arrested 281 Jews and handed them over to the Germans, who sent them to the <a href="Bergen-Belsen%20concentration%20camp">Bergen-Belsen concentration camp</a>, where many were killed. The historian <a href="Noel%20Malcolm">Noel Malcolm</a> describes this event as "the most shameful episode in Kosovo's wartime history." The division was later involved in a massacre of Albanian partisans. It was also responsible for the expulsion of up to 10,000 Slavic families from Kosovo as new Albanian settlers arrived from the poor areas of northern Albania. The arrival of these Albanians was encouraged by Italian authorities, and it is estimated that as many as 72,000 Albanians were settled or re-settled in Kosovo during the war. Between 28 May and 5 July 1944, the division apprehended a total of 510 Jews, communists and other anti-fascists and turned them over to the Germans. It also carried out retaliatory hangings of suspected saboteurs.

In June 1944, "Skanderbeg" engaged in large-scale field manoeuvres in eastern Montenegro. In <a href="Andrijevica">Andrijevica</a>, the division summarily executed more than 400 <a href="Orthodox%20Christian">Orthodox Christian</a> civilians. It participated in operations "Endlich" (Finally) and "Falkenauge" (Hawkeye) in June and July, as well as "Draufgänger" (Daredevil), during which it was the main force used by the Germans. These operations were focused on the destruction of strong Partisan forces in the <a href="Gjakova">Đakovica</a>, Peć and <a href="Mokra%20Gora%20%28mountain%29">Mokra Gora</a> areas. By the end of Operation "Draufgänger", more than 400 men had deserted or otherwise gone missing. According to Neubacher, the division was carelessly committed to fighting in the early stages of its training and performed poorly. Between 18 and 27 August, the division fought the Partisans in and around <a href="Debar">Debar</a> but failed to capture the city. During the summer of 1944, Deva was sidelined within the League. Fitzthum was so concerned about the impact that this would have on the development of the division that he wrote to Himmler. By the end of August 1944, the Germans had decided that the division was only of use for basic guarding duties. Some members were charged with guarding <a href="chromium">chromium</a> mines near Kosovo before the area was overrun by the Partisans. In the ensuing clashes, one of the division's regiments lost more than 1,000 men and many Albanians deserted. Some of the desertions occurred after a Partisan offensive northeast of <a href="Gusinje">Gusinje</a>. <a href="Army%20Group%20E">Army Group E</a> reported that the division's performance showed that it had "absolutely no military value."

On 1 September 1944, members of the division stationed in <a href="Tetovo">Tetovo</a> and <a href="Gostivar">Gostivar</a> mutinied, killing their German officers and NCOs. By this time, the division numbered fewer than 7,000 men, less than one third of its intended strength. Within two months of its initial deployment, 3,500 had deserted. Himmler brought in 3,000–4,000 "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" (German navy) personnel from Greece to make up the numbers, but this had little effect on the division's fighting ability. The desertions were mainly caused by Germany's defeats, serious shortfalls in food and equipment, as well as from observing constant overflights by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Force">United States Army Air Force</a>, Allied propaganda, and the approaching end of Germany's military hegemony in the Balkans. Further reasons for the escalating number of desertions included the news that both Bulgaria and Romania had joined the Allies, <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>'s amnesty which ended on 15 September, and a demand by Albania's <a href="Party%20of%20Labour%20of%20Albania">Party of Labour</a> that fighting-age men join the <a href="National%20Liberation%20Movement%20%28Albania%29">National Liberation Front</a>.

By the beginning of October 1944, the division's strength had fallen to about 4,900 men, fewer than 1,500 of whom were fit for combat. Between April and October, 3,425 had deserted, constituting over half the division's strength. Schmidhuber reported that even the 697 members of the battalion that had served in the 13th SS Division had deserted. The unit was blighted by shortages of equipment and armaments, and a lack of German staff to train new recruits, as demonstrated by the fact that over the summer and autumn only a single battalion had been readied for combat. Schmidhuber held his men in contempt, and he, his superiors, and Fitzthum explained their failure to create an effective security force by denigrating the Albanians' culture and military reputation. Later, less-involved members of the Wehrmacht stated that the principal issue regarding the unit's reliability may have been that the Germans did not work closely with the Albanians at the local level. In mid-October, the division was engaged in heavy fighting around Đakovica. It also aided the Wehrmacht in its orderly withdrawal from Kosovo, covering the Wehrmacht's flanks and engaging the Partisans. By this time, desertions had significantly affected the division's strength, and its 86 officers and 467 NCOs were left with a force of only 899 men, about half of whom were Albanian. On 24 October, "Generaloberst" <a href="Alexander%20L%C3%B6hr">Alexander Löhr</a>, the commander of Army Group E, ordered that all Albanian members of the division be disarmed and released.

On 1 November 1944, the division was disbanded. Kosovo Albanians took up arms against the Partisans upon learning that the region would not be unified with Albania after the war, despite earlier Partisan promises. Atrocities occurred when 30,000 Partisans were sent to Kosovo to quell Albanian resistance in the region. Between 3,000 and 25,000 Kosovo Albanians were killed in the ensuing violence.

The remaining German troops and former naval personnel were reorganized as the regimental "<a href="Kampfgruppe">Kampfgruppe</a> Skanderbeg" under the command of SS-"<a href="Obersturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmbannführer</a>" Alfred Graf. The unit withdrew from the Kosovo region in mid-November along with the rest of the German troops in the area. Many Serbs and Montenegrins then took revenge against the region's ethnic Albanians, especially collaborators and those who had been members of the division. In his strongly apologetic history of the 7th SS Division, which he commanded at the time, <a href="Otto%20Kumm">Otto Kumm</a> wrote that "Kampfgruppe Skanderbeg" reached <a href="Ljubovija">Ljubovija</a> on the <a href="Drina">Drina</a> river, it was placed under the command of the 7th SS Division, which was securing the river crossings in that area. According to Kumm, the "Kampfgruppe" held the towns of <a href="Zvornik">Zvornik</a> and <a href="Drinja%C4%8Da">Drinjača</a> during the first half of December 1944 as part of the Ljubovija bridgehead. It withdrew across the Drina and fought its way north, towards <a href="Br%C4%8Dko">Brčko</a> on the <a href="Sava">Sava</a> river, where it relieved the Wehrmacht forces holding the town. In late December, the "Kampfgruppe"'s assault gun battery was committed to the <a href="Syrmian%20Front">Syrmian Front</a> at <a href="Vinkovci">Vinkovci</a>. The remainder of the "Kampfgruppe" was deployed to <a href="Bijeljina">Bijeljina</a>.

In January 1945, the handful of naval personnel that survived were transferred to the <a href="32nd%20SS%20Volunteer%20Grenadier%20Division%2030%20Januar">32nd SS Volunteer Grenadier Division 30 Januar</a>, and the remnants of the former division were reorganized as II Battalion of the 14th SS Volunteer Mountain Infantry Regiment of the 7th SS Division. On 21 January 1945, Schmidhuber was promoted to SS-"Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS" and placed in command of the 7th SS Division. After the war, he was found guilty of war crimes and hanged. In February 1945, the battalion was disbanded altogether and its remaining manpower was assigned to the German police regiment near <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>.

The division itself was considered to have been a military failure. Not one of its members was awarded an <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> while serving in it. Schmidhuber observed that, "[w]ith a light mortar you can basically chase him [the Albanian] around the world. During the attack he goes only as far as he finds something to steal or sack. For him, the war is over when he captures a goat, a ploughshare or the wheel of a sewing machine." Professor Paul Mojzes writes that the division was better known for committing atrocities against Serbs than it was for contributing to the German war effort. Its role in deporting Jews from Kosovo has been challenged by the Albanian historian Shaban Sinani, who claims that the division did not participate in any deportations on the Germans' behalf. David Patterson, a historian specializing in anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, writes that the division "played a major role in rendering the Balkans "<a href="Judenfrei">Judenrein</a>" in the winter of 1943–1944." During the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a> of 1998–1999, the American journalist <a href="Chris%20Hedges">Chris Hedges</a> alleged that some <a href="Kosovo%20Liberation%20Army">Kosovo Liberation Army</a> leaders were directly descended from members of the division and were ideologically influenced by it. Malcolm has challenged this claim.

The division's identification symbol was the Albanian <a href="double-headed%20eagle">double-headed eagle</a>. Despite its short existence, a collar patch depicting a goat-crested helmet was manufactured for the division but there is no evidence that it was ever used. Photographs exist of a machine-woven cuff band with the title "Skanderbeg", but this was awarded to the 14th SS Volunteer "Gebirgsjäger" Regiment of the 7th SS Division in autumn 1944, and not to this division. Members of the <a href="cadre%20%28military%29">cadre</a> staff were photographed wearing an Albanian arm shield depicting a black Albanian double-headed eagle on a red field. Many of the division's Muslim members wore traditional grey-coloured <a href="Taqiyah%20%28cap%29">skull caps</a> instead of the standard SS field cap. Others wore the traditional Albanian highlander hat, the "<a href="Qeleshe">Qeleshe</a>".

The principal units of the division were:

Quebec Agreement

The Quebec Agreement was an agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States outlining the terms for the coordinated development of the science and engineering related to <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear energy</a>, and, specifically <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s. It was signed by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> on 19 August 1943, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, at the <a href="First%20Quebec%20Conference">First Quebec Conference</a> in <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a>, Canada.

The Quebec Agreement stipulated that the US and UK would pool their resources to develop nuclear weapons, and that neither country would use them against the other, or against other countries without mutual consent, or pass information about them to other countries. It also gave the United States a veto over post-war British commercial or industrial uses of nuclear energy, and vice versa. The agreement merged the British <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> project with the American <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, and created the Combined Policy Committee to control the joint project. Although Canada was not a signatory, the Agreement provided for a Canadian representative on the Combined Policy Committee in view of Canada's contribution to the effort.

British scientists performed important work as part of the <a href="British%20contribution%20to%20the%20Manhattan%20Project">British contribution to the Manhattan Project</a>, and in July 1945 British permission required by the agreement was given for the use of nuclear weapons against Japan. The September 1944 Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire extended Anglo-American co-operation into the post-war period, but after the war ended, American enthusiasm for the alliance with Britain waned. The <a href="McMahon%20Act">McMahon Act</a> ended technical co-operation through its control of "restricted data". On 7 January 1948, the Quebec Agreement had superseded by a "<a href="modus%20vivendi">modus vivendi</a>", an agreement which allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada.

The <a href="neutron">neutron</a> was discovered by <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> at the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> in February 1932. In April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Walton">Ernest Walton</a> split <a href="lithium">lithium</a> atoms with accelerated <a href="proton">proton</a>s.

Hahn wrote to his colleague <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a>, who, with her nephew <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a>, explained that the uranium <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> had been split. By analogy with the <a href="Fission%20%28biology%29">division of biological cells</a>, they named the process "<a href="nuclear%20fission">fission</a>".
The discovery of fission raised the possibility that an extremely powerful <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> could be created. The term was already familiar to the British public through the writings of <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, in his 1913 novel "<a href="The%20World%20Set%20Free">The World Set Free</a>". Sir <a href="Henry%20Tizard">Henry Tizard</a>'s <a href="Committee%20on%20the%20Scientific%20Survey%20of%20Air%20Defence">Committee on the Scientific Survey of Air Defence</a> was originally formed to study the needs of anti-aircraft warfare, but branched out to study air warfare generally. In May 1939, a few months before the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> in Europe in September 1939, it was directed to conduct research into the feasibility of atomic bombs. Tizard tasked <a href="George%20Paget%20Thomson">George Paget Thomson</a>, the professor of physics at <a href="Imperial%20College%20London">Imperial College London</a>, and <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, an Australian physicist at the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>, with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing.

Oliphant's team reached a strikingly different conclusion. He had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a> and Frisch, who could not work on the university's secret projects like <a href="radar">radar</a> because they were <a href="enemy%20alien">enemy alien</a>s, and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. They calculated the <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a> of a metallic sphere of pure <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a>, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as would suffice, and would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.

Oliphant took the <a href="Frisch%E2%80%93Peierls%20memorandum">Frisch–Peierls memorandum</a> to Tizard. As a result, the <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Committee</a> was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort. Four universities provided the locations where the experiments were taking place. The University of Birmingham undertook theoretical work, such as determining what size of critical mass was needed for an explosion. This group was run by Peierls, with the help of fellow German refugee scientist <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a>. The laboratories at the <a href="University%20of%20Liverpool">University of Liverpool</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> experimented with different types of <a href="isotope%20separation">isotope separation</a>. Chadwick's group at Liverpool dealt with <a href="thermophoresis">thermal diffusion</a>, a phenomenon observed in mixtures of mobile particles where the different particle types exhibit different responses to the force of a <a href="temperature%20gradient">temperature gradient</a>. <a href="Francis%20Simon">Francis Simon</a>'s group at Oxford investigated the <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a>, which works on the principle that at differing pressures uranium 235 would diffuse through a barrier faster than uranium 238. This was determined to be the most promising method. <a href="Egon%20Bretscher">Egon Bretscher</a> and <a href="Norman%20Feather">Norman Feather</a>'s group at Cambridge investigated whether another element, now called <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>, could be used as a <a href="fissile">fissile</a> material. Because of the presence of a team of refugee French scientists led by <a href="Hans%20von%20Halban">Hans von Halban</a>, Oxford also had the world's main supply of <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a>, which helped them theorise how uranium could be used for power.

In July 1941, the MAUD Committee produced two comprehensive reports that concluded that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The MAUD Committee unanimously recommended pursuing its development as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. But even before its report was completed, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, had been briefed on its findings by his scientific advisor, <a href="Frederick%20Lindemann%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cherwell">Frederick Lindemann</a>, and had decided on a course of action. A new directorate known by the deliberately misleading name of <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> was created to co-ordinate this effort. Sir <a href="John%20Anderson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Waverley">John Anderson</a>, the <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a>, became the minister responsible, and <a href="Wallace%20Akers">Wallace Akers</a> from <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> (ICI) was appointed its director.

The prospect of Germany developing an atomic bomb was also of great concern to scientists in the United States, particularly those who were refugees from <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and other <a href="fascist">fascist</a> countries. In July 1939, <a href="Leo%20Szilard">Leo Szilard</a> and <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> wrote the <a href="Einstein-Szilard%20letter">Einstein-Szilard letter</a>, warning the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, of the danger. In response, Roosevelt created an <a href="Advisory%20Committee%20on%20Uranium">Advisory Committee on Uranium</a> in October 1939, chaired by <a href="Lyman%20Briggs">Lyman Briggs</a> of the <a href="National%20Bureau%20of%20Standards">National Bureau of Standards</a>. Research concentrated on slow fission for power production, but with a growing interest in isotope separation. On 12 June 1940, <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>, the president of the <a href="Carnegie%20Institution%20of%20Washington">Carnegie Institution of Washington</a>, and <a href="Harry%20Hopkins">Harry Hopkins</a>, a key advisor to the president, went to the president with a proposal to create a <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC) to co-ordinate defence-related research. The NDRC was formally created on 27 June 1940, with Bush as its chairman. It absorbed the Advisory Committee on Uranium which had gone beyond its original role and was now directing research. It became the Uranium Committee of the NDRC.
One of Bush's first actions as the chairman of the NDRC was to arrange a clandestine meeting with <a href="Air%20Commodore">Air Commodore</a> <a href="George%20Pirie%20%28RAF%20officer%29">George Pirie</a>, the British air attaché in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington</a>, and <a href="Brigadier">Brigadier</a> Charles Lindemann, the British Army attaché (and Frederick Lindemann's brother), to discuss a British offer of a full exchange of technical information. Bush was strongly in favour of this proposal, and at their meeting on 8 July 1940, he offered advice on how it should be presented. It was endorsed at a <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20States">Cabinet</a> meeting on 11 July, and an official acceptance was conveyed to <a href="Philip%20Kerr%2C%2011th%20Marquess%20of%20Lothian">Lord Lothian</a>, the <a href="British%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20States">British Ambassador to the United States</a>, on 29 July.

Among the wealth of information that the <a href="Tizard%20Mission">Tizard Mission</a>, a scientific mission sent to the United States to promote the exchange of military science and technology, brought to America were details about the MAUD Committee's deliberations and activities. Some information from the MAUD Committee had already been conveyed to the United States by <a href="Ralph%20H.%20Fowler">Ralph H. Fowler</a>, the British scientific attaché to Canada. Cockcroft, a member of the Tizard Mission, brought more. Cockcroft and Fowler met with the Uranium Committee, but the information flow was largely one-way. Cockcroft reported that the American atomic bomb project lagged behind the British, and was not proceeding as fast. Work conducted in America included research by Szilard and <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> into the possibility of a controlled <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a>; preliminary investigations into isotope separation using <a href="centrifugation">centrifugation</a>, gaseousness diffusion and thermal diffusion processes; and efforts to produce plutonium in the <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> at the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a>. 

<a href="Kenneth%20Bainbridge">Kenneth Bainbridge</a> from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> attended a MAUD Committee meeting on 9 April 1941, and was surprised to discover that the British were convinced that an atomic bomb was technically feasible. The Uranium Committee met at Harvard on 5 May, and Bainbridge presented his report. Bush engaged a group headed by <a href="Arthur%20Compton">Arthur Compton</a>, a <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel laureate in physics</a> and chairman of the Department of Physics at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, to investigate further. Compton's report, issued on 17 May 1941, did not address the design or manufacture of a bomb in detail. Instead it endorsed a post-war project concentrating on atomic energy for power production. On 28 June 1941, Roosevelt created the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD), with Bush as its director, personally responsible to the president. The new organisation subsumed the NDRC, now chaired by <a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20Harvard%20University">President of Harvard University</a>. The Uranium Committee became the Uranium Section of the OSRD, but was soon renamed the S-1 Section for security reasons.

Britain was at war, but the US was not. Oliphant flew to the United States in late August 1941, ostensibly to discuss the radar programme, but actually to find out why the United States was ignoring the MAUD Committee's findings. He discovered to his dismay that the reports and other documents sent directly to Briggs had not been shared with all members of the committee; Briggs had locked them in a safe. Oliphant then met with <a href="William%20D.%20Coolidge">William D. Coolidge</a>, who was acting in Compton's place while the latter was in South America; <a href="Samuel%20K.%20Allison">Samuel K. Allison</a>, a colleague of Compton's at the University of Chicago; <a href="Ernest%20O.%20Lawrence">Ernest O. Lawrence</a>, the director of the Radiation Laboratory; Fermi and Conant to explain the urgency. In these meetings he spoke of an atomic bomb with forcefulness and certainty. Allison recalled that when Oliphant met with the S-1 Section, he "came to a meeting, and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb and said we had no right to work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost $25 million, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us."

Bush and Conant received the final MAUD Report from Thomson on 3 October 1941. With this in hand, Bush met with Roosevelt and Vice-President <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wallace">Henry A. Wallace</a> at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> on 9 October 1941, and obtained a commitment to an expanded and expedited American atomic bomb project. Two days later, Roosevelt sent a letter to Churchill in which he proposed that they exchange views "in order that any extended efforts may be coordinated or even jointly conducted."

Roosevelt regarded this offer of a joint project as sufficiently important to have the letter personally delivered by <a href="Frederick%20L.%20Hovde">Frederick L. Hovde</a>, the head of the NDRC mission in London, but Churchill did not respond until December. He assured Roosevelt of his willingness to collaborate, and informed him that Hovde had discussed the matter with Sir John Anderson and Lord Cherwell, as Frederick Lindemann was now known. The MAUD Committee had considered the issue of collaboration with the United States, and had concluded that while pilot isotope separation plants could be established in the United Kingdom, full-scale production facilities would have to be built in the United States. The British expressed concerns about the security of the American project. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by <a href="atomic%20spies">atomic spies</a>. <a href="John%20Cairncross">John Cairncross</a> had given the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> a copy of the MAUD Committee report. Although not conveyed to the Americans, the British had other concerns about what might happen after the war if the Americans embraced <a href="United%20States%20non-interventionism">isolationism</a>, as had occurred after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, and Britain had to fight the Soviet Union alone. The opportunity for a joint project was therefore missed. British and American exchange of information continued but their programmes remained separate.
The Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on 7 December 1941 led to the United States' entry into the war. Funding now became available in amounts undreamt of the year before. OSRD contracts were due to expire at the end of June 1942, and there was intense wartime competition for raw materials. It was agreed that in 1942–1943, the United States Army would fund $53 million of an $85 million programme. On 18 June 1942, <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="James%20C.%20Marshall">James C. Marshall</a> was ordered to organise the Army component. He established his headquarters on the 18th floor of <a href="Tower%20270">270 Broadway</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, with the innocuous name of the <a href="Manhattan%20Engineer%20District">Manhattan Engineer District</a>, following the usual practice of naming <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers%23Divisions%20and%20districts">engineer districts</a> after the city in which its headquarters was located. The project soon adopted the name "Manhattan" as well. By September 1942, Bush and Conant felt that the time had come for the Army to take over, something already approved by the president on 17 June 1942, and <a href="brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a> became the director of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. Groves attempted to tighten security through a policy of strict <a href="compartmentalization%20%28information%20security%29">compartmentalisation</a> similar to the one that the British had imposed on radar.

The American effort soon overtook the British. British scientists who visited the United States in 1942 were astounded at the progress and momentum the Manhattan Project had assumed. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised Churchill that: "We must face the fact that ... [our] pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger'. Soon we shall have little or none". But Bush and Conant had already decided that British help was no longer needed. In October 1942, they convinced Roosevelt that the United States should independently develop the atomic bomb, despite the agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain.

The positions of the two countries were the reverse of what they had been in 1941. American officials were concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. The <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a>, felt that since the United States was doing "ninety percent of the work" on the bomb, it would be "better for us to go along for the present without sharing anything more than we could help". In December 1942, Roosevelt agreed to restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war, even if doing so impeded the American project. The Americans stopped sharing any information on heavy water production, the <a href="calutron">method of electromagnetic separation</a>, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of atomic bomb design, or the facts about <a href="fast%20neutron">fast neutron</a> reactions. This adversely impacted the work of the <a href="Montreal%20Laboratory">Montreal Laboratory</a>, the joint British and Canadian project that was investigating <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a> design. In retaliation, the British stopped sending scientists to America, slowing the pace of work there, which had relied on British scientists. The Americans then ceased all information sharing.
The Tube Alloys Directorate considered whether Britain could produce a bomb without American help. A gaseous diffusion plant to produce 1 kg of <a href="weapons-grade">weapons-grade</a> uranium per day was estimated to cost up to £3 million in research and development, and anything up to £50 million to build in wartime Britain. A nuclear reactor to produce 1 kg of plutonium per day would have to be built in Canada. It would take up to five years to build and cost £5 million. The project would also require facilities for producing the required heavy water for the reactor costing between £5 million and £10 million, and for producing uranium metal, which would cost another £1.5 million. The project would need overwhelming priority, as it was estimated to require 20,000 workers, many of them highly skilled, 500,000 tons of steel, and 500,000 kW of electricity. Disruption to other wartime projects would be inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the <a href="European%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">war in Europe</a>. The unanimous response was that before embarking on this, another effort should be made to obtain American co-operation.

By March 1943 Bush and Conant had decided that British help would benefit some areas of the Manhattan Project. In particular, it could benefit enough from assistance from Chadwick and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a>, and the construction company <a href="KBR%20%28company%29">Kellogg</a> wanted British comments on the design of the <a href="K-25">gaseous diffusion plant</a> it was building.

Churchill took up the matter with Roosevelt when they met at the <a href="Washington%20Conference%20%281943%29">Washington Conference</a> on 25 May 1943. A meeting was arranged that afternoon between Cherwell and Bush in Hopkins's office in the White House, with Hopkins looking on. Both stated their respective positions, and Cherwell explained that Britain's post-war interest was in nuclear weapons, and not commercial opportunities. Hopkins reported back to Roosevelt, and Churchill and Roosevelt agreed that information interchange should be reviewed, and that the atomic bomb project should be a joint one. Hopkins sent Churchill a telegram confirming this on 17 June, but American policy did not change, largely because Roosevelt did not inform Bush when they next met on 24 June. When Churchill pressed for action in a telegram on 9 July, Hopkins counselled Roosevelt that "you made a firm commitment to Churchill in regard to this when he was here and there is nothing to do but go through with it."
Bush was in London on 15 July 1943 to attend a meeting of the British <a href="Churchill%20war%20ministry">War Cabinet</a>'s Anti-U-Boat Committee. Sir <a href="Stafford%20Cripps">Stafford Cripps</a> took him to see Churchill who told Bush that the President had given him his word of honour on full co-operation, and that he was incensed at obstruction by American bureaucrats. Bush suggested that he take up the matter with Stimson, who was also in London. Churchill did so on 17 July, and Stimson promised to submit the matter to Roosevelt. On 20 July, Roosevelt wrote to Bush with instructions to "renew, in an inclusive manner, the full exchange with the British Government regarding Tube Alloys", but since Bush was in London, he did not see this letter for another ten days. Stimson, Bush and Stimson's special assistant, <a href="Harvey%20Bundy">Harvey Bundy</a>, met Churchill, Cherwell and Anderson at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a> in London on 22 July. None of them was aware that Roosevelt had already made his decision.

Stimson had just finished a series of arguments with the British about the need for an <a href="Operation%20Overlord">invasion of France</a>. He was reluctant to appear to disagree with them about everything, and, unlike Bush, sensitive to insinuations that Britain was being unfairly treated. He spoke in conciliatory terms about the need for good post-war relations between the two countries. For his part, Churchill disavowed interest in the commercial applications of nuclear technology. The reason for British concern about the post-war co-operation, they explained, was not commercial concerns, but so that Britain would have nuclear weapons after the war. Bush then proposed a five-point plan, which Stimson promised to put before the president for approval.

Anderson drafted an agreement for full interchange, which Churchill re-worded "in more majestic language". Anderson feared that Groves might tell Stimson and Bush that "like all Americans who come to our misty island, they have been taken in by our hypocritical cunning and carried away by our brilliant Prime Minister". When Conant found out about the agreement, he expressed the opinion that he would feel more at home on the staff of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", a newspaper renowned for its anti-British views. Anderson arrived in Washington with the draft on 5 August, and went over it with Conant and Bush. From the American point of view, nothing made it into the final draft that contradicted the existing policy on interchange of information. Anderson extracted one important concession: the creation of the Combined Policy Committee to oversee the joint project with representation from the United States, Britain and Canada. Conant's objections to Anderson's proposed arrangements for information interchange were met by assigning the task to the Combined Policy Committee. Stimson, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a> and <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="William%20R.%20Purnell">William R. Purnell</a> reviewed the document and made minor changes, and it was then sent to the British Embassy for approval.

A speedy drafting process was required because Roosevelt, Churchill and their political and military advisors converged for the <a href="Quadrant%20Conference">Quadrant Conference</a> at the <a href="Citadelle%20of%20Quebec">Citadelle of Quebec</a> on 17 August, hosted by the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister of Canada</a>, <a href="Mackenzie%20King">Mackenzie King</a>. Most of the discussions were about the invasion of France. Although the Quebec Agreement was a bilateral one to which Canada was not a signatory, the British felt that Canada's contribution to Tube Alloys was significant enough that high-level representation was appropriate. King was therefore asked to nominate a Canadian member of the Combined Policy Committee, and he selected <a href="C.%20D.%20Howe">C. D. Howe</a>, the Canadian <a href="Minister%20of%20Munitions%20and%20Supply">Minister of Munitions and Supply</a>. Stimson, Bush and Conant would be the American members, while <a href="Field%20marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Field Marshal</a> Sir <a href="John%20Dill">John Dill</a> and Colonel <a href="John%20Llewellin%2C%201st%20Baron%20Llewellin">J. J. Llewellin</a> would be the British members.

On 19 August Roosevelt and Churchill signed the Quebec Agreement, which was typed on four pages of Citadelle notepaper, and formally titled "Articles of Agreement governing collaboration between the authorities of the USA and UK in the matter of Tube Alloys". The United Kingdom and the United States agreed that "it is vital to our common safety in the present War to bring the Tube Alloys project to fruition at the earliest moment", and that this was best accomplished by pooling their resources. The Quebec Agreement stipulated that:

The only part of the Quebec Agreement that troubled Stimson was the requirement for mutual consent before atomic bombs could be used. Had Congress known about it, they would never have supported it. The American veto over post-war British commercial and industrial uses made it clear that Britain was the junior partner in the <a href="Grand%20Alliance%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Grand Alliance</a>. Churchill in particular considered the Quebec Agreement to be the best deal he could have struck under the circumstances, and the restrictions were the price he had to pay to obtain the technical information needed for a successful post-war nuclear weapons project. <a href="Margaret%20Gowing">Margaret Gowing</a> noted that the "idea of the independent deterrent was already well entrenched."

The Quebec Agreement was a secret agreement. Its terms were known to but a few insiders, and its very existence was not revealed to the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>. The <a href="Joint%20Committee%20on%20Atomic%20Energy">Joint Committee on Atomic Energy</a> was given an oral summary on 12 May 1947. On 12 February 1951, Churchill wrote to President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> for permission to publish it, but Truman declined. Churchill therefore omitted it from his memoir, "<a href="The%20Second%20World%20War%20%28book%20series%29">Closing the Ring</a>" (1951). It remained a secret until Churchill read it out in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> on 5 April 1954. However, on 4 September 1943 the Soviet <a href="atomic%20spy">atomic spy</a> <a href="Ursula%20Kuczynski">Ursula Kuczynski</a> ("Sonia") reported details of the agreement to the <a href="Main%20Intelligence%20Directorate">GRU</a> in Moscow, which she had probably obtained from Fuchs.

Even before the Quebec Agreement was signed, Akers had already cabled London with instructions that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Simon should leave immediately for North America. They arrived on 19 August, the day it was signed, expecting to be able to talk to American scientists, but were unable to do so. Two weeks passed before American officials learned of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Bush told Akers that his action was premature, and that the Combined Policy Committee would first have to agree on the rules governing the employment of British scientists. With nothing to do, the scientists returned to the UK. Groves briefed the OSRD <a href="S-1%20Executive%20Committee">S-1 Executive Committee</a>, which had replaced the S-1 Committee on 19 June 1942, at a special meeting on 10 September 1943. The text of the Quebec Agreement was vague in places, with loopholes that Groves could exploit to enforce compartmentalisation. Negotiations on the terms of technical interchange dragged on until December 1943. The new procedures went into effect on 14 December with the approval of the Military Policy Committee (which governed the Manhattan Project) and the Combined Policy Committee. By this time British scientists had already commenced working in the United States.
Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times. The first occasion was on the afternoon of 8 September 1943; Stimson discovered that he was the chairman only that morning. This first meeting established a Technical Subcommittee chaired by American <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20D.%20Styer">Wilhelm D. Styer</a>. The Americans did not want Akers on the Technical Subcommittee due to his ICI background, so Llewellin nominated Chadwick, whom he also wanted to be Head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. The other members of the Technical Committee were <a href="Richard%20C.%20Tolman">Richard C. Tolman</a>, who was Groves's scientific advisor, and <a href="Jack%20Mackenzie">C. J. Mackenzie</a>, the president of the Canadian <a href="National%20Research%20Council%20%28Canada%29">National Research Council</a>. It was agreed that the Technical Committee could act without consulting the Combined Policy Committee whenever its decision was unanimous. It held its first meeting at <a href="The%20Pentagon">The Pentagon</a> on 10 September 1943.

There remained the issue of co-operation between the Manhattan Project's <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> in Chicago and the Montreal Laboratory. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 17 February 1944, Chadwick pressed for resources to build a nuclear reactor at what is now known as the <a href="Chalk%20River%20Laboratories">Chalk River Laboratories</a>. Britain and Canada agreed to pay the cost of this project, but the United States had to supply the heavy water. Because it was unlikely to have any impact on the war, Conant in particular was cool about the proposal, but heavy water reactors were still of great interest. Groves was willing to support the effort and supply the heavy water required, but with certain restrictions. The Montreal Laboratory would have access to data from the Metallurgical Laboratory's research reactors at <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne</a> and the <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> at Oak Ridge, but not from the production reactors at the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a>; nor would they be given any information about the chemistry of plutonium, or of methods for separating it from other elements. This arrangement was formally approved by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944.

Chadwick supported the <a href="British%20contribution%20to%20the%20Manhattan%20Project">British contribution to the Manhattan Project</a> to the fullest extent, abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured. While the pace of research eased as the war entered its final phase, scientists were still in great demand, and it fell to Anderson, Cherwell and Sir <a href="Edward%20Victor%20Appleton">Edward Appleton</a>, the <a href="Permanent%20Secretary">Permanent Secretary</a> of the <a href="Department%20of%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Scientific and Industrial Research</a>, which was responsible for Tube Alloys, to prise them away from the wartime projects in which they were invariably engaged. A British Mission led by Akers assisted in the development of gaseous diffusion technology in New York. Another, led by Oliphant, who acted as deputy director at the <a href="Berkeley%20Radiation%20Laboratory">Berkeley Radiation Laboratory</a>, assisted with the <a href="electromagnetic%20separation">electromagnetic separation</a> process. As head of the British Mission to the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a>, Chadwick, and later Peierls, led a multinational team of distinguished scientists that included Sir <a href="G.%20I.%20Taylor">Geoffrey Taylor</a>, <a href="James%20L.%20Tuck">James Tuck</a>, <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>, <a href="William%20Penney">William Penney</a>, Frisch, and Fuchs. Four members of the British Mission became group leaders at Los Alamos. Penney observed the <a href="bombing%20of%20Nagasaki">bombing of Nagasaki</a> on 9 August 1945 and participated in the <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> nuclear tests in 1946.

A major strain on the Agreement came up in 1944, when it was revealed to the United States that the United Kingdom had made a secret agreement with <a href="Hans%20von%20Halban">Hans von Halban</a> to share nuclear information with France after the war in exchange for free use of <a href="patent">patent</a>s related to nuclear reactors filed by French physicist <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Joliot-Curie">Frédéric Joliot-Curie</a> and his <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France">Collège de France</a> team. Upon this revelation, the United States and Canada objected, stating that the Halban agreement violated the terms of the Quebec Agreement, namely the section about third-party information-sharing without prior mutual consent. The United Kingdom broke its obligations to France in order to satisfy the United States. Anderson was extremely concerned about alienating the French, and he and the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs">Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, suggested that the French be offered an undertaking that France would subsequently be included in the Manhattan Project, but Churchill did not agree, and remained adamantly opposed to any disclosures to France or the Soviet Union. After the war, the French government repudiated the Halban agreement.

The issue of patent rights was a complex one, and attempts to negotiate deals between Britain and the United States in 1942, and between Britain and Canada in 1943, had failed. After the Quebec Agreement was signed, British and American experts sat down together again and hammered out an agreement, which was endorsed by the Combined Policy Committee in September 1944. This agreement, which also covered Canada, was <a href="retrospective">retrospective</a> to the signing of the Quebec Agreement in August 1943, but owing to necessary secrecy, was not finalised until 1956, and covered all patents held in November 1955. Each of the three countries agreed to transfer to the others any rights it held in the others' countries, and waive any claims for compensation against them.

Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir <a href="Ronald%20Ian%20Campbell">Ronald Ian Campbell</a>, the deputy head of the British Mission to the United States, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, <a href="Edward%20Wood%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Halifax">Lord Halifax</a>, in early 1945. Dill died in Washington on 4 November 1944, and was replaced both as Chief of the <a href="British%20Defence%20Staff%20%E2%80%93%20US">British Joint Staff Mission</a> and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Henry Maitland Wilson</a>. It was therefore Wilson who, on 4 July 1945, under the clause of the Quebec Agreement that specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent, agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.

In September 1944, a second wartime conference was held in Quebec known as the <a href="Octagon%20Conference">Octagon Conference</a>. In the wake of a string of Allied victories, thoughts turned to post-war planning. Afterwards, Roosevelt and Churchill spent some time together at Roosevelt's <a href="Home%20of%20Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt%20National%20Historic%20Site">Springwood estate</a> in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20New%20York">Hyde Park, New York</a>. They discussed post-war collaboration on nuclear weapons, and on 19 September signed the Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire, detailing the agreement resulting from what they discussed. Most of this dealt with Bohr's thoughts on international control, but it also provided that "[f]ull collaboration between the United States and the British Government in developing Tube Alloys for military and commercial purposes should continue after the defeat of Japan unless and until terminated by joint agreement."

Of Roosevelt's advisors, only Hopkins and Admiral <a href="William%20D.%20Leahy">William D. Leahy</a> knew of this secret wartime agreement, and Leahy, possibly because he never believed that the atomic bomb would work, and was therefore perhaps not paying much attention, had only a muddled recollection of what had been said. When Wilson raised the Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located many years later in the papers of <a href="Vice%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Wilson%20Brown%20%28admiral%29">Wilson Brown, Jr.</a>, Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled in Roosevelt's Hyde Park papers by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, and who thought it had something to do with naval guns or boiler tubes.

Truman, who had succeeded Roosevelt on the latter's death on 12 April 1945, <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, who had replaced Churchill as prime minister in July 1945, Anderson and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">United States Secretary of State</a> <a href="James%20F.%20Byrnes">James F. Byrnes</a> conferred while on a boat cruise on the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a>, and agreed to revise the Quebec Agreement, with a view to replacing it with a looser form of co-operation on nuclear matters between the three governments. Groves, Secretary of War <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a> and Patterson's advisor <a href="George%20L.%20Harrison">George L. Harrison</a> met with a British delegation consisting of Anderson, Wilson, <a href="Malcolm%20MacDonald">Malcolm MacDonald</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20High%20Commissioners%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20Canada">High Commissioner to Canada</a>, <a href="Roger%20Makins%2C%201st%20Baron%20Sherfield">Roger Makins</a> from the British Embassy in Washington, and <a href="Denis%20Rickett">Denis Rickett</a>, Anderson's assistant, on 15 November 1945 to draw up a communiqué. They agreed to retain the Combined Policy Committee. The Quebec Agreement's requirement for "mutual consent" before using nuclear weapons was replaced with one for "prior consultation", and there was to be "full and effective cooperation in the field of atomic energy", but in the longer Memorandum of Intention, signed by Groves and Anderson, this was only "in the field of basic scientific research". Patterson took the communiqué to the White House, where Truman and Attlee signed it on 16 November 1945. A draft agreement was approved by the Combined Policy Committee on 4 December 1945 as the basis for the revocation of the Quebec Agreement.
The next meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 15 April 1946 produced no accord on collaboration, and resulted in an exchange of cables between Truman and Attlee. Truman cabled on 20 April that he did not see the communiqué he had signed as obligating the United States to assist Britain in designing, constructing and operating an atomic energy plant. Attlee's response on 6 June 1946 "did not mince words nor conceal his displeasure behind the nuances of diplomatic language." At issue was not just technical co-operation, which was fast disappearing, but the allocation of uranium ore. During the war this was of little concern, as Britain had not needed any ore, so all the production of the Congo mines and all the ore seized by the <a href="Alsos%20Mission">Alsos Mission</a> had gone to the United States, but now it was also required by the British atomic project. Chadwick and Groves reached an agreement by which ore would be shared equally.

The defection of <a href="Igor%20Gouzenko">Igor Gouzenko</a> and the resulting espionage conviction of <a href="Alan%20Nunn%20May">Alan Nunn May</a>, a British physicist who had worked at the Montreal Laboratory, made it politically impossible for US officials to exchange information with the UK. The <a href="McMahon%20Act">McMahon Act</a>, which was signed by Truman on 1 August 1946, and went into effect at midnight on 1 January 1947, ended technical co-operation. Its control of "restricted data" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information. The remaining scientists were denied access to papers that they had written just days before. The McMahon Act fuelled resentment from British scientists and officials alike, and led directly to the British decision in January 1947 to develop its own nuclear weapons. In the United States, there was a furore over the British veto over the use of nuclear weapons when the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was informed of the Quebec Agreement (but not the November 1945 agreement) on 12 May 1947, resulting in intense pressure on Truman to drop the provision. On 7 January 1948, Bush, <a href="James%20Fisk%20%28physicist%29">James Fisk</a>, Cockcroft and Mackenzie concluded an agreement known as the "<a href="modus%20vivendi">modus vivendi</a>", that allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada, which officially repealed the Quebec Agreement. Like the Quebec Agreement it replaced, the "modus vivendi" was classified "Top Secret".

As the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> set in, enthusiasm in the United States for an alliance with Britain cooled as well. A September 1949 poll found that 72 per cent of Americans agreed that the United States should not "share our atomic energy secrets with England". The reputation of the British was further tarnished by the 1950 revelation that Fuchs was a Soviet atomic spy. British wartime participation in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was crucial to the success of <a href="High%20Explosive%20Research">High Explosive Research</a>, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the McMahon Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear <a href="Special%20Relationship">Special Relationship</a> between America and Britain under the <a href="1958%20US%E2%80%93UK%20Mutual%20Defence%20Agreement">1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement</a>.

Clarence 13X

Clarence Edward Smith (February 22, 1928 – June 13, 1969), better known by his assumed names Clarence 13X and Allah, was an American leader and founder of the <a href="Five-Percent%20Nation">Five-Percent Nation</a>. He was born in Virginia, and moved to New York City as a young man before serving in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. After returning to New York, he learned that his wife had joined the <a href="Nation%20of%20Islam">Nation of Islam</a> (NOI) and followed her, taking the name Clarence 13X. He served in the group as a security officer, martial arts instructor, and student minister before leaving for an unclear reason in 1963. He enjoyed gambling, which was condemned by the NOI, and disagreed with the NOI's teachings that <a href="Wallace%20Fard%20Muhammad">Wallace Fard Muhammad</a> was a divine messenger.

After leaving the NOI, Clarence 13X formed a new group with other former members. He concluded that all black men were divine and took the name <a href="Allah">Allah</a> to symbolize this status. He rejected the belief in an invisible God, teaching that God could be found within each black man. In his view, women were "earths" that complemented and nurtured men; he believed that they should be submissive to men. He and a few assistants retained some NOI teachings and pioneered novel interpretations of them. They devised teachings about the meaning of letters and numerals: understanding the meaning of each letter and number was said to provide deep truths about God and the universe. Clarence 13X referred to his new movement as the "Five Percenters", referencing a NOI teaching that only five percent of the population knew and promoted the truth about God. One way that he distinguished his group from his previous faith was by rejecting dress codes or strict behavioral guidelines—he allowed the consumption of alcohol, and at times, the use of illegal drugs.

Clarence 13X was shot by an unknown assailant in 1964 but survived the attack. After an incident several months later in which he and several of his followers vandalized stores and fought with police, he was arrested and placed in psychiatric care. He was diagnosed with <a href="paranoid%20schizophrenia">paranoid schizophrenia</a>. He referred to himself as "Allah", which had become his preferred name. He was released from custody after a 1966 ruling by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> placed limits on confinement without trial. Although he initially taught his followers to hate white people, he eventually began to cooperate with white city leaders. They gave him funding for a night school, and in return, he tried to prevent violence in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. Clarence 13X was fatally shot in June 1969; the identity of his killer is unknown. The mayor of New York City and several other prominent leaders expressed condolences to his followers. Although the Five Percenters faltered in the immediate aftermath of his death, the movement rebounded after new leadership emerged. The group took a non-hierarchical approach to leadership, and no single leader replaced Clarence 13X. He has been held in high regard by Five Percenters, who celebrate his birthday as a holiday.

Clarence Edward Smith was born on February 22, 1928, and raised in <a href="Danville%2C%20Virginia">Danville, Virginia</a>, with his five brothers and one sister. During his childhood, Virginia was <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">racially segregated</a>, and he witnessed incidents of racism, including a fight between his father and a white man that was sparked by racial tensions. In 1946, he moved with his mother to New York City, where they settled in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. He attended only two years of high school.

In 1949, Smith fathered a child, Clarence Jowers, with Willieen Jowers. Although he married a woman named Dora Smith in 1950, he fathered another child, Otis Jowers, with Willieen in 1951; he also had several sons and daughters with Dora. Smith joined the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> in the early 1950s and was stationed in Korea from 1952 to 1954, where he served as an infantryman in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. After returning to the U.S., he lived in Harlem and served in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Reserve">United States Army Reserve</a> until 1960. During his military service, he became skilled in <a href="karate">karate</a>.

Dora Smith embraced the <a href="Nation%20of%20Islam">Nation of Islam</a> (NOI) while her husband was away and he converted after returning to New York. By 1961, he had registered at <a href="Mosque%20No.%207">Mosque No. 7</a> and changed his name to Clarence 13X in accordance with NOI practice. Before his conversion, he often smoked marijuana and gambled, activities forbidden by the NOI. After joining the group, he studied the <a href="Beliefs%20and%20theology%20of%20the%20Nation%20of%20Islam">NOI's doctrines</a> and quickly progressed within their organizational structure, possibly thanks to skills learned in the military. His responsibilities included teaching martial arts and serving on the <a href="Fruit%20of%20Islam">Fruit of Islam</a> security team. He was also recognized as a skilled speaker and reached the rank of "student minister" at Mosque No. 7. By 1963, he had come to the attention of the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a>—informants recorded his presence at rallies led by <a href="Malcolm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX">Malcolm X</a>.

The early 1960s were a turbulent period for the NOI; unrest was caused by conflicts between leaders <a href="Elijah%20Muhammad">Elijah Muhammad</a> and Malcolm X. Around that time, Clarence 13X became disenchanted with the organization, although the root of his qualms is not known. NOI members have offered contradictory accounts of the events that caused his exit and whether he left voluntarily. His departure has been variously attributed to doubts about the NOI's theology, violations of their moral code, objections to the luxurious lifestyles of their senior leadership, or Malcolm X's distrust of him. Dora Smith elected to stay with the group, prompting the couple's separation. Before leaving the NOI, Clarence 13X had begun to doubt their teaching that <a href="Wallace%20Fard%20Muhammad">Wallace Fard Muhammad</a> was a divine messenger. He believed that the NOI's teachings were contradictory because they taught that God is black but encouraged reverence of Fard Muhammad, who was not of exclusively African descent. Clarence 13X concluded that divinity was found in all black men, rather than in a single person. Several times before he left the NOI, he was censured by leadership for these assertions. His friend John 37X elected to leave with him. Malcolm X also left the NOI in 1963 and remained on good terms with Clarence 13X. Clarence 13X did not join Malcolm X's newly created group, <a href="Muslim%20Mosque%2C%20Inc.">Muslim Mosque, Inc.</a>

After leaving the NOI, Clarence 13X and John 37X continued to study the group's teachings, sometimes while smoking marijuana. They assumed new names: Clarence 13X took Allah, and John 37X, Abu Shahid. After reading an NOI book with 34 riddles, known as the "Lost-Found Lessons", John 37X concluded that numbers represented specific concepts, such as knowledge or wisdom. He referred to this system as "living mathematics". During its development, he was imprisoned on firearms charges. While John 37X was in prison, Clarence 13X taught a system of beliefs he referred to as "supreme wisdom", which he saw as the core of Islam, to groups of young men. He was assisted by his friend James Howard, with whom he developed a modified version of living mathematics, "supreme mathematics", and an accompanying doctrine about letters, the "supreme alphabet". The development of these systems, considered a "divine science" by adherents, may have been influenced by the teachings of <a href="Sufism">Sufism</a>; like some schools of Sufism, they found esoteric meanings in the alphabet. David Smydra of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" compares these teachings to <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>; Felicia Miyakawa of <a href="Middle%20Tennessee%20State%20University">Middle Tennessee State University</a> sees similarities to <a href="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> and <a href="Kemetism">Kemetism</a>.

Clarence 13X developed novel teachings, assigning <a href="backronym">backronym</a>s to familiar words. He stated that the letters of the word "Allah" stood for "arm, leg, leg, arm, head", signifying the human body. This was said to prove that humanity held a divine nature. He named parts of the New York area after locations in the Middle East that are significant to Islam: Harlem was referred to as <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>, and <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="Medina">Medina</a>. Other disaffected NOI members, including some who served the Fruit of Islam, were soon drawn to his burgeoning group. Several people from the NOI who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X also joined; Clarence 13X incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders. In the group's early years, some Five Percenters attended NOI events, and Clarence 13X's theology had much in common with the teachings of the NOI, although there were notable differences. He taught his followers that he was an incarnation of God, and they each were gods. His followers were thus encouraged to look within themselves in their search for God. Clarence 13X taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of African descent not found in Europeans and their descendants, echoing statements made by Elijah Muhammad. He did not enforce the NOI's strict moral rules: one way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the NOI, including gambling, alcohol consumption, and drug use. Clarence 13X told his followers to avoid developing addictions but that drug use was not inherently wrong. He strictly forbade the consumption of pork, arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the United States, such as rats and dogs, and hence should not be consumed. Owing to their belief that black men are gods, the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet.

Early members of the group often proselytized on street corners for hours, and Clarence 13X's assistants led classes about the group's teachings, strictly enforcing study habits. He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters. Once they did so, they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths. These lessons were taught in a form that resembled <a href="catechisms">catechisms</a>. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a> has compared to <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> meetings.

Clarence 13X's group was initially known as the "Suns of Almighty God Allah" or the "Blood Brothers". After Malcolm X's death, the group became known as the "Five Percenters" or the "Five Percent Nation". The name was drawn from the NOI's claim to be the five percent of the black community who knew and promoted the truth about God; Clarence 13X considered his movement to be the five percent of the NOI that still held to truth and integrity. The other 95 percent were said to be unaware of the truth or corrupt. Clarence 13X assembled an inner circle of assistants, nine of whom are referred to by Five Percenters as the "First Born": they are said to embody his attributes. The assistants were assigned to spread the group's teachings to younger people, many of whom took African names, including some from non-Islamic societies. Clarence 13X taught <a href="Afrocentrism">Afrocentrism</a> to his disciples and often wore a <a href="dashiki">dashiki</a>; male Five Percenters members frequently wore tasseled <a href="kufi">kufi</a>s, and female members wore colorful African head wraps. Some Five Percenters supported themselves via drug dealing and petty theft; others intentionally committed minor legal infractions, hoping to proselytize to others who had been arrested.

Clarence 13X's followers saw him as a divine messenger and referred to him as "Father Allah". This elevated him to a higher position than Elijah Muhammad, who had deemed himself the "Messenger of Allah". Eventually, Clarence 13X stopped identifying himself as a Muslim and spoke out against the reverence of Fard Muhammad, casting him as a "mystery God". He rejected the idea that God is invisible, which he felt weakened people. He encouraged his followers to learn about and respect other spiritual traditions.

Although female converts were initially referred to as "nurses", Clarence 13X renamed them "earths" in 1967. He taught that women were not gods, as he believed that they were created by man and did not possess creative power. In his view, women could nurture, but only men could make children. Women were said to resemble the Earth in their ability to sustain life. Clarence 13X had a patriarchal philosophy, and the Five Percenters were initially overwhelmingly male. He spoke in favor of fathers' arranging their daughters' marriages and told women to embody submission by serving their husbands as God. <a href="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> or <a href="serial%20monogamy">serial monogamy</a> were allowed, and legal marriage was discouraged. Clarence 13X encouraged his followers to have many children and discouraged the use of birth control.

NOI leaders were angry that Clarence 13X freely taught portions of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members; although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop, he refused. Clarence 13X also experienced conflict within his family: his children did not revere him, and hostility quickly developed between core Five Percenters and some of his sons when Willeen Jowers brought them to visit him.

On December 9, 1964, Clarence 13X was shot twice in the torso while at a popular gathering place in the basement of a Harlem tenement. He was brought to <a href="Harlem%20Hospital">Harlem Hospital</a>, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist <a href="Michael%20Muhammad%20Knight">Michael Muhammad Knight</a> speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a <a href="Christ%20figure">Christ figure</a>. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence 13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence 13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence 13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.

The Five Percenters soon attracted attention from media and law enforcement. Local papers published negative coverage of the group, casting them as a violent hate group or a street gang. The "<a href="New%20York%20Amsterdam%20News">New York Amsterdam News</a>" reported that Clarence 13X had threatened to kill white children if his group did not receive a government subsidy. In 1965, the FBI initiated an investigation of his group and may have provided sensationalized rumors to the press. That year, FBI director <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a> deemed Clarence 13X as a "Harlem rowdy", and feared that he would form ties with more dangerous groups. The FBI developed a detailed file on Clarence 13X; in 1967, Hoover described him as a potential threat to President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, and sent a detailed folder about him to the <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">United States Secret Service</a>.

After Malcolm X's death in 1965, Clarence 13X mourned his loss but did not attend his funeral. In May 1965, while visiting the site of Mosque No. 7, then closed, Clarence 13X and several of his companions were told to leave by a police officer. They left, began to vandalize nearby buildings, and blocked the street near the former headquarters of Muslim Mosque, Inc. More police arrived and subdued Clarence 13X after an altercation, bringing him into custody with several of his followers. After being arrested, he refused to identify himself and was charged with assault and drug possession. About 60 of his followers attended his arraignment, but were removed from the court after shouting "Peace". Clarence 13X proclaimed his innocence and announced his intent to defend himself in court. He told the judge that he was Allah, and that the city would face grave judgment if he were not released. The judge disregarded his prognostication and set his bail at $9,500. At a court date in June, about 50 Five Percenters protested outside the court; afterwards, several were arrested on charges of making <a href="Molotov%20cocktails">Molotov cocktails</a>. In July, the court sent Clarence 13X to <a href="NYC%20Health%20%2B%20Hospitals/Bellevue">Bellevue Hospital Center</a> for a <a href="psychiatric%20examination">psychiatric examination</a>. While in the hospital, he made a few disciples and communicated with some followers through a hospital window. Under his instructions, Five Percenters resisted future NOI leader <a href="Louis%20Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a>'s attempts to convert them.

Knight states that Clarence 13X's psychiatric results were not processed for an unusually long time; he posits that the delay was due to FBI involvement and argues that Clarence 13X was a <a href="political%20prisoner">political prisoner</a>. In November 1965, Clarence 13X was ruled incompetent to stand trial and committed to the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Mental%20Hygiene">New York State Department of Mental Hygiene</a>, which placed him at the <a href="Matteawan%20State%20Hospital%20for%20the%20Criminally%20Insane">Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane</a>. After he declared himself Allah and a "Master Gambler", the doctors concluded that he had <a href="schizophrenic%20reaction">schizophrenic reaction</a>, paranoid type with <a href="delusions%20of%20grandeur">delusions of grandeur</a>; he faced indefinite commitment. Many Five Percenters and their converts traveled to the hospital to meet with him and receive instruction. He also proselytized to fellow inmates, converting one young white man, who later became a committed follower.

While Clarence 13X was in prison, the Five Percenters continued to proselytize and teach their doctrines. He instructed his followers to adopt names different from those used in the NOI to differentiate their group. After attaining a certain degree of knowledge of the group's doctrines, members were allowed to adopt the surname "Allah" and sometimes "God" as a first name. This was in recognition of Clarence 13X's teachings that black men were gods, and that each member should worship himself. His followers often took the name Allah, but would refrain from referring to themselves as such in his presence, in deference to his authority. After a decision ("<a href="Pate%20v.%20Robinson">Pate v. Robinson</a>") by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> in 1966, limits were placed on the confinement of mentally ill criminals, causing many to be released. Clarence 13X was consequently released in March 1967.

In mid-1967, New York City mayor <a href="John%20Lindsay">John Lindsay</a> sought to develop closer ties with leaders of impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by concerns voiced by the <a href="New%20York%20Police%20Department">New York Police Department</a> (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, <a href="Barry%20Gottehrer">Barry Gottehrer</a>, to meet with Clarence 13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence 13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence 13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at <a href="Gracie%20Mansion">Gracie Mansion</a>, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and with help from the <a href="National%20Urban%20League">National Urban League</a>, obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence 13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence 13X in "The Mayor's Man". The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence 13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.

In February 1968, Lindsay estimated that there were about 500 to 700 Five Percenters. Some of Clarence 13X's followers attempted to create break-away groups, proclaiming themselves prophets and starting their own movements. They generally retained aspects of Five Percenter doctrine with different emphases.

After the <a href="assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">assassination</a> of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> in April 1968, Lindsay feared that rioting would occur in Harlem. He traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences; Clarence 13X and his followers were among those who accompanied him as he walked the streets. Clarence 13X also instructed his followers to try to prevent violence and looting. He was commended by the city's leadership for his efforts, and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of Five Percenter teachings and portions of the <a href="Quran">Quran</a>. Willieen Jowers recalled that Clarence 13X admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time. He later described himself as "neither anti-white nor pro-black" and saw some of his white contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings. His white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in Harlem during the <a href="February%201969%20nor%27easter">February 1969 nor'easter</a>. He was accepted as a Five Percenter, as Clarence 13X maintained that "civilization"—rather than race—was valued by the group. Clarence 13X made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed. Contrary to his radical reputation, he endorsed some conservative positions in the late 1960s, including capital punishment, respect for the U.S. flag, and American involvement in Vietnam. He also allowed his supporters to attend Christmas celebrations. Knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement. Clarence 13X was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young Five Percenters and won some concessions from the institution's leadership. Some secular black leaders disliked him, owing to his supportive comments about the mayor and neglect of revolutionary rhetoric. On one occasion, he was invited to address an audience of black Marxists, then spoke to them about numerology.

Around 1968, Clarence 13X fathered a son with a young convert named Gusavia. That year, <a href="Gloria%20Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a> published an article about Clarence 13X in "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine. She blamed the NOI for the previous attempt to kill him, arguing that they were angered by his claim to be Allah and thus above Elijah Muhammad. Clarence 13X also received coverage from international media, including a Canadian television program.

By 1969, Clarence 13X was sleeping little. He feared that he would be killed and instructed his followers to remain strong if he died. On June 12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for an hour or two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him while he was in the lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.

Clarence 13X's funeral was held four days after his death. It was attended by about 400 people and was followed by a procession through Harlem. His death put the leadership of his movement in question—there was no clear successor. At that time, his followers were primarily teenagers, and several of his top leaders subsequently struggled with drug addiction.

Most local media sources gave Clarence 13X positive coverage in the wake of his death. The <a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">"Daily News"</a> connected his murder with the recent death of NOI activist Charles Kenyatta, casting them as part of a "Muslim War". The mayor believed that the NYPD told them this and was angered by their claim. Louis Farrakhan denied culpability, maintaining that he had good relations with Clarence 13X. NYPD investigators suspected that he was killed by members of an extortion ring, possibly connected to the <a href="Fair%20Play%20for%20Cuba%20Committee">Fair Play for Cuba Committee</a>. In August 1969, an arrest was made in connection with his murder. The suspect denied involvement, and charges were soon dropped. Five Percenters have posited different culprits, including the CIA, the NOI, or a disgruntled follower.

Five Percenter membership plunged after Clarence 13X's death, but rebounded in 1970 after new leadership emerged and revitalized the group. After his death, the group was not dominated by a single leader. This may have been a result of their teaching that all black men are gods, which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable.

Knight doubts that Clarence 13X set out to build a movement or a culture, but after his death, the movement expanded and gained converts across the United States. Five Percenters have celebrated Clarence 13X's birthday as a holiday, and minimized the descriptions of his flaws in their accounts of his life. Numerous <a href="apocrypha">apocrypha</a>l stories from his life have circulated among the group; some accounts have claimed that he gambled only as a means to reach others with his teachings. He did not leave behind a record of his teachings, and the group had few formalized tenets at the time of his death. In the following decades, the group's doctrine became more complicated.

<a href="Akbar%20Muhammad">Akbar Muhammad</a> of the NOI described Clarence 13X as "confused", although relations between the Five Percenters and NOI leaders have improved over time. Clarence 13X's teachings may have influenced the doctrines of <a href="Dwight%20York">Dwight York</a>, founder of the <a href="Nuwaubian%20Nation">Nuwaubian Nation</a>. York saw Clarence 13X's teachings as an insufficient, incomplete path.

Lawyer <a href="Sidney%20Davidoff">Sidney Davidoff</a>, one of Lindsay's assistants, deemed Clarence 13X "a little bit snake-oil salesman and a little bit crazy, but no more unstable than anyone else preaching a gospel on the street corner." Davidoff saw Clarence 13X's <a href="black%20supremacy">black supremacist</a> teachings as a way to instill confidence in young people. Knight states that Clarence 13X went from a "'Harlem rowdy' to [a] legitimate community leader", and Lindsay later cast Clarence 13X's role in the city as similar to that of <a href="Al%20Sharpton">Al Sharpton</a>. <a href="Mattias%20Gardell">Mattias Gardell</a> of <a href="Uppsala%20University">Uppsala University</a> views Clarence 13X as a "gifted philosopher".

Jumping Flash!

Jumping Flash! is a <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> co-developed by Exact and Ultra and published by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>. The first installment in the "Jumping Flash!" series, it was first released for the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> on 28 April 1995 in Japan, 29 September 1995 in Europe and 1 November 1995 in North America. It was re-released through the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> store on <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> in 2007.

Presented in a <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person perspective</a>, the game follows a robotic rabbit named "Robbit" as he searches for missing jet pods scattered by the game's <a href="astrophysicist">astrophysicist</a> antagonist character Baron Aloha. Robbit must explore each section of Crater Planet to retrieve all of the jet pods, stop Aloha and save the world from being destroyed. The game was designed as a <a href="technology%20demonstration">technology demonstrator</a> for the PlayStation console and was revealed in early 1994 under the provisional title of "Spring Man". "Jumping Flash!" utilises much of the <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> used in "Geograph Seal", an earlier game by Exact for the <a href="X68000">Sharp X68000</a> home computer.

"Jumping Flash!" has been described as an ancestor of as well as an early showcase for <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D graphics</a> in <a href="Video%20game%20console">console gaming</a>. It was generally well received by critics, who praised its graphics and unique 3D platforming gameplay, but it was eventually overshadowed by later 3D platformers of the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fifth%20generation%29">fifth console generation</a>. "Jumping Flash!" spawned two sequels: "<a href="Jumping%20Flash%21%202">Jumping Flash! 2</a>" and "<a href="Robbit%20Mon%20Dieu">Robbit Mon Dieu</a>". It received overwhelmingly positive reviews at the time of release, and made an appearance in "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>"s "Top 100 Games of All Time" just one year after. The game was described as the third-most underrated video game of all time by Matt Casamassina of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> in 2007. It also holds the <a href="Guinness%20World%20Record">Guinness World Record</a> as the "first platform video game in true 3D".

"Jumping Flash!" is presented in a <a href="First%20person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> perspective. The player assumes the role of Robbit, a robotic rabbit, and can freely move Robbit in three-dimensional space and can rotate the <a href="virtual%20camera%20system">camera</a> in any direction. The top part of the screen shows the remaining time, the player's score, and a character named Kumagoro—Robbit's sidekick <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> who offers the player warnings and hints. The top left corner of the screen shows the collected <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s; the top right corner contains the radar showing the locations of objects including enemies, power-ups, jet pods and enemy projectiles. The bottom shows a health meter on the sides and the number of remaining lives in the centre. The player starts the game with three lives; a new life is granted once one million points are earned.

The core of the gameplay is focused on the player's ability to make Robbit jump. Robbit can jump up to three times in mid-air, which allows him to reach extreme heights. Unlike other platform games that continue to face horizontally when the player jumps, in "Jumping Flash!" the camera tilts downwards when a double-jump or triple-jump is performed to allow the player to see Robbit's shadow and easily plan a landing spot. The player has the ability to shoot a low-powered laser beam at a target indicator in the middle of the screen. The player can find and use fireworks for Robbit to damage enemies. These include <a href="cherry%20bomb">cherry bomb</a>s, <a href="bottle%20rocket">rockets</a>, <a href="Roman%20candle%20%28firework%29">Roman candle</a>s and spinners.

Each level has a time limit of ten minutes, which ends the game if it is exceeded. A player losing all lives is presented with a choice to <a href="continue%20%28video%20games%29">continue</a> or return to the title screen. Power-ups scattered across each world, presented as picture frames, include carrots that extend Robbit's health, <a href="1-up">extra lives</a>, time-outs that stop the clock and freeze the level's dynamics for a few seconds, hourglasses that extend the player's time, and power pills that make Robbit invincible for a short period of time. Enemies in the game vary from <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> versions of creatures to robots and plants.

The game is composed of six worlds with three levels each, totalling to 18 main levels. The objective of the main levels in each world is to collect four jet pods. Each final level of a world consists of a boss fight. The level designs vary from snow-capped mountains to carnivals. While most of the levels are large, outdoor excursions, two are enclosed within a narrow interior. The game features hidden <a href="Bonus%20stage">bonus levels</a>, which are triggered when secret entrances are found. Bonus levels consist of blocks with balloons in them; popping the balloons yields either coins or power-ups. A <a href="time%20attack">time attack</a> mode is available for any level the player has completed.

The game begins on Crater Planet and revolves around the story of an insane <a href="astrophysicist">astrophysicist</a>, Baron Aloha. Planning to make a large profit from his evil ingenuity, Aloha removes giant pieces of land from the planet using machines to turn them into private resorts. Aloha also removes and hides the twelve jet pods that propel each world. Witnessing the destruction, the residents of Crater Planet call for help, and in response the Universal City Hall dispatches one of their agents, a mechanical rabbit named Robbit. Robbit is ordered to explore each world to retrieve the jet pods, stop Aloha, and save Crater Planet from destruction. At the end of the game, Aloha flees to his home, Little Muu, and vows revenge on Robbit.

Throughout the game, Aloha surrounds himself with creatures called MuuMuus that appear as small, white, five-limbed creatures with miniature palm trees on their heads. Many of the game's <a href="full%20motion%20video">full motion video</a>s feature the MuuMuus in an <a href="izakaya">izakaya</a> tavern, recounting their defeat at the hands of Robbit.

"Jumping Flash!" was developed by Japanese developers Exact (Excellent Application Create Team) and Ultra. The game was first revealed in early 1994 under the provisional title "Spring Man" as a <a href="technology%20demonstration">technology demonstration</a> for the upcoming <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> console. <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> hoped "Jumping Flash!" would be remembered as the first appearance of a new "platform star" with the same longevity as <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> or <a href="Mario">Mario</a>. The game uses the same <a href="game%20engine">engine</a> and shares similar gameplay traits with "Geograph Seal", a 3D <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> released for the <a href="Sharp%20X68000">Sharp X68000</a> home computer the previous year by Exact. After seeing "Geograph Seal" and realising the potential in their game design, Sony's director of entertainment in Japan, Koji Tada, paired Exact with Ultra to develop a new game for the upcoming PlayStation console. Tada replaced Hiroyuki Saegusa as director of the game, although he had kept all key Exact staff to work on the project.

The initial development was split into two phases. Exact developed the game engine and its gameplay; Ultra designed the story and 3D cutscenes, and created characters such as the mechanical rabbit protagonist, Robbit. Ultra felt they needed to depart from the "stereotypical science fiction vibe" that included the usual "space ranger" or <a href="double%20agent">double agent</a> protagonists. To create a sense of individuality among platform games, the developers implemented a dynamic camera that would automatically pan down towards the shadow of Robbit on the ground during large jumps, allowing players to carefully line up their landings. "Jumping Flash!" was considered the first game of the platform genre to be developed with full 3D computer graphics. The music for "Jumping Flash!" was composed by Japanese video games and <a href="anime">anime</a> music composer <a href="Takeo%20Miratsu">Takeo Miratsu</a>. Many of the tracks, along with tracks from "Jumping Flash! 2", were included on the "Jumping Flash! 2 Original Soundtrack" album, which Miratsu also composed.

The game received generally positive reviews upon release. Critics mainly praised its unique innovation, advanced graphics, gameplay and clean textures. The four reviewers of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" gave it their "Game of the Month" award, citing the outstanding graphics and particularly the innovative 3D gameplay. They described the style as "cutesy" but not off-putting. "Major Mike" of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" said that despite the game appearing "strange", it had action, strategy, and some humour. "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" said that "[many] of the boundaries have been redefined in a big way", contrasting it with <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> platformers with a first-person perspective and explorable 3D environments. They called it "simply superb" and gave it a "Revolutionary" five-star rating.

"Maximum" stated that "Jumping Flash!" was one of the most "imaginative, playable, enjoyable" and original titles seen on the <a href="fifth%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">fifth generation of video game consoles</a>. They criticised its length and lack of difficulty, expressing that it could have been one of the "greatest games ever" if it was longer and more difficult, and questioned whether it was "a really worthwhile" purchase. <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> called the graphics "mind blowing" and the game itself "totally unique", but criticised the overall length and ease of play. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s 1996 review similarly disapproved the difficulty, stating that despite the small worlds and easy difficulty, it is "a great, genre-pushing game", also saying it is an essential for all PlayStation owners. In 1996, "Next Generation" listed it as number 86 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", saying it had created the genre of 3D platforming. They particularly praised "the vertigo inducing sense of height as Robbit leaps from platform to platform." In a 2007 review, <a href="Greg%20Miller%20%28Internet%20celebrity%29">Greg Miller</a> of IGN condemned the graphics as "dated", having "jagged edges" and "muddled" colours, and said every aspect of the game is "weak" and that it had not stood "the test of time". In a retrospective review, Andrew Yoon of <a href="Engadget">Engadget</a> praised the gameplay and innovation, saying the "grainy" and "antiquated" graphics did no harm to the vibrant atmosphere of the game.

Speaking in 2007, Rob Fahey of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> stated that "Jumping Flash!" was arguably one of the most important ancestors of any 3D platform game, as well as asserting that the game would always have a part in videogaming history. Albert Kim of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" stated that the game provided perhaps the most euphoric sensation of videogaming at the time and described the first-person perspective as "hypnotic". Matt Thorson, the creator of the <a href="indie%20game">indie</a> video game "<a href="TowerFall">TowerFall</a>", praised the game, saying "something about the sensation of leaping through 3D space captured my childhood imagination".

<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> cited its first-person platforming as a precursor to "<a href="Mirror%27s%20Edge">Mirror's Edge</a>", despite suggesting that the jumping remained "woefully out of place" in the platform genre. In 2007, Matt Casamassina of IGN ranked "Jumping Flash!" as the third-most underrated video game of all time. After release, co-developer Ultra renamed themselves "Muu Muu", after the creatures featured in the game.

Due to its popularity, Sony produced two sequels to "Jumping Flash!", including one spin-off. A direct sequel, "<a href="Jumping%20Flash%21%202">Jumping Flash! 2</a>"—also developed by Exact—was released worldwide for the PlayStation the following year; it continued the story of Robbit and the subsequent rise and fall of Baron Aloha. The game received positive reviews upon release, with critics particularly praising its updated features. "<a href="Robbit%20Mon%20Dieu">Robbit Mon Dieu</a>" was released exclusively in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999, and was the final instalment in the series. It was met with mixed reviews, and following Exact's merger with <a href="SCEI">SCEI</a> in 2000, the series came to an end. Both "Jumping Flash!" and "Jumping Flash! 2" were re-released via the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> in 2007 and 2009, respectively. A loose spin-off titled "<a href="Pocket%20MuuMuu">Pocket MuuMuu</a>" was released exclusively in Japan for the <a href="PocketStation">PocketStation</a> in 1999 before Exact's closure.

Cleveland Bay

The Cleveland Bay is a <a href="horse%20breed">breed</a> of <a href="horse">horse</a> that originated in England during the 17th century, named after its colouring and the <a href="Cleveland%2C%20England">Cleveland</a> district of <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. It is a well-muscled horse, with legs that are strong but short in relation to the body. The horses are always <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> in colour, although a few light hairs in the mane and tail are characteristic of some breed lines. It is the oldest established horse breed in England, and the only non-draught horse developed in Great Britain. The ancestors of the breed were developed during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> for use as <a href="pack%20horse">pack horse</a>s, when they gained their nickname of "Chapman Horses". These pack horses were <a href="crossbred">crossbred</a> with <a href="Andalusian%20horse">Andalusian</a> and <a href="Barb%20%28horse%29">Barb</a> blood, and later with <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabians</a> and <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>s, to create the Cleveland Bay of today. Over the years, the breed became lighter in frame as they were employed more as <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">carriage</a> and <a href="equestrianism">riding</a> horses. The popularity of the Cleveland Bay has greatly fluctuated since it was first imported to the United States in the early 19th century. Despite serious declines in the population after the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, the breed has experienced a resurgence in popularity since the 1970s, although only around 550 horses existed worldwide as of 2006.

They have been patronized by members of the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">British Royal Family</a> throughout their history, and they are still used to pull <a href="carriage">carriage</a>s in royal processions today. The breed has also been used to develop and improve several <a href="warmblood">warmblood</a> and <a href="draft%20horse">draught horse</a> breeds. Today they are used for farm work and driving, as well as under-saddle work. They are particularly popular for <a href="fox%20hunting">fox hunting</a> and <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a>, both <a href="Purebred">pure blooded</a> and when crossed with <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>s. The Cleveland Bay is a rare breed, and both the United Kingdom-based <a href="Rare%20Breeds%20Survival%20Trust">Rare Breeds Survival Trust</a> and the United States-based <a href="The%20Livestock%20Conservancy">Livestock Conservancy</a> consider the population to be at critical limits for extinction.

The Cleveland Bay generally stands between , and is always <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> in colour. Bright bay horses (bays with a more reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. <a href="Horse%20markings">White markings</a>, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse inadmissible to the <a href="stud%20book">stud book</a>. Horses are expected to have complete <a href="point%20coloration">black points</a>, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below the knees and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registry. The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and <a href="Yorkshire%20Coach%20Horse">Yorkshire Coach Horse</a> bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged as it makes creating matching driving teams and pairs very easy. When the breed was first developed, the horses almost always had a countershaded dorsal stripe, but these disappeared with the <a href="outcrossing">outcrossing</a>s of the 18th century.

The breed has a large head, slightly convex profile, and a long, well-muscled neck. The <a href="withers">withers</a> are well-muscled, which often makes them less pronounced, the chest is broad and deep, the shoulders are muscular and sloping, and the <a href="Rump%20%28animal%29">croup</a> slightly sloping. The legs are short in relation to the body, but strong and well-muscled. The legs have little or no <a href="feathering%20%28horse%29">feather</a>, as the breed was developed partially for working in the heavy clay soils of its native country, where heavy feather led to increased disease prevalence. They are hardy and long-lived horses, and docile in temperament. In the early 20th century, when a breed standard was issued by the British Cleveland Bay Society for use in judging shows, a section was added on the <a href="horse%20gait">movement</a> of the horses, describing the desired action, especially at the <a href="Trot%20%28horse%20gait%29">trot</a>. This was included in part because military potential was still considered a factor in evaluating harness horses and a good trot was necessary for an <a href="artillery">artillery</a> horse. It was also evaluated because breeds with large action at the trot often also have a potential for <a href="jumping%20%28horse%29">jumping</a>. The combination of desired characteristics means that the breed is useful for breeding <a href="show%20jumping">show jumpers</a>, <a href="three%20day%20eventing">eventers</a> and <a href="Steeplechase%20%28horse%20racing%29">steeplechase</a>rs (the latter especially when crossed with <a href="Thoroughbreds">Thoroughbreds</a>).

Partbred Cleveland Bays are sometimes called Cleveland Bay Sporthorses, although they are referred to by the US and UK registries as part breds. They are eligible for registration with the Cleveland Bay Part Bred Registry, but must not be registered with any other registry. To be eligible, horses must have at least one grandparent registered with the main Cleveland Bay Horse Society stud book. The Australasian registry refers to part breds as Sporthorses, although they still require at least 25 percent Cleveland Bay blood.

Originally developed in the <a href="Cleveland%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Cleveland</a> district of <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, England, the Cleveland Bay is said to be the oldest established English horse breed, and the only horse native to Britain that does not belong to the heavy horse group. The closest breed in type, although completely unrelated, is the <a href="Irish%20Draught">Irish Draught</a>.

The earliest breeding of the ancestors of the Cleveland Bay was done in large part by English churches and monasteries, to meet a need for pack horses to carry trade goods between abbeys and monasteries in northeast England. These medieval horses gained the nickname of "Chapman Horses" because of their use by travelling <a href="merchant">merchant</a>s known as "chapmen". What is now the Cleveland Bay was developed from <a href="Barb%20%28horse%29">Barb</a> and <a href="Andalusian%20horse">Andalusian horse</a>s crossed with Chapman Horse mares. The Barb blood came mainly from horses imported by wealthy young men on their <a href="Grand%20Tour%20of%20Europe">Grand Tour of Europe</a>, bought off the docks in <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a> and transported back to England. The Andalusian blood came from horses bred at the royal stud in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Cordoba</a> and given to English royalty by the King of Spain. The stallions were often available for breeding to local horses, and the first infusion of Andalusian blood was added to the native Chapman Horses. The Spanish horses also made their way to the outlying estates of English nobility, and were then taken by <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s men after the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. Once in the hands of Cromwell's men, many of the stallions were made available for locals to cross with the existing Chapman Horses, adding a second infusion of Andalusian bloodlines. In the late 17th century a second infusion of Barb blood was added when Cleveland breeders purchased horses directly from soldiers at <a href="English%20Tangier">Tangier</a> or from the <a href="Moors">Moors</a> themselves.

Between 1685 and 1785 this Chapman Horse/Andalusian/Barb cross developed into the original Cleveland Bay. During this century the type grew bigger due to better feeding, and by 1785 had developed through <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a> into the "agricultural type" Cleveland Bay. This original type was heavier and more <a href="draft%20horse">draft-like</a> than the breed of today. This was due to a need for strength more than speed on the farms and poor roads of 17th- and 18th-century England. As roads improved and speed became more important in the late 18th century, <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> and <a href="Arabian%20%28horse%29">Arabian</a> blood was added. The resulting horses were used extensively as <a href="Driving%20%28horse%29">coach horses</a>, and were lighter of frame, with a well-arched neck and powerful shoulders, making for a flashy carriage horse. The Thoroughbred blood was added despite the claims of breeders that the Cleveland Bay was "free from taint of black or blood", meaning either Thoroughbred "blood" or the <a href="Old%20English%20Black">Old English "Black"</a> and its descendents. The addition of Thoroughbred breeding is thought responsible for Cleveland Bays born with red legs (as opposed to the black normally associated with bay horses), generally the result of a <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> Thoroughbred sire in the family tree.

The British Cleveland Bay Horse Society was formed in 1883, and the first stud book was published in 1884. The 19th century saw the export of many Cleveland Bays overseas, to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, India, Russia and the European continent. In the early 19th century, Cleveland Bays were first imported to <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> in the United States, and in 1884 the <a href="Upperville%20Colt%20%26amp%3B%20Horse%20Show">Upperville Colt & Horse Show</a> was created in Virginia by <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Dulany">Colonel Richard Henry Dulany</a> to showcase his imported Cleveland Bay stallion and the offspring of the stallion. The Cleveland Bay Society of America was formed in 1885, and the stud book began publication in 1889, although horses were registered who had lived as far back as 1860. Judging from the descriptions of the earliest registered horses, it is possible that many of the "Cleveland Bays" registered were actually <a href="Yorkshire%20Coach%20Horse">Yorkshire Coach Horse</a>s; however, all were registered as Clevelands, and that is what they are known as today. Over 2,000 horses were registered with the association by 1907. The horses were of interest to <a href="Buffalo%20Bill%20Cody">Buffalo Bill Cody</a>, who drove four Cleveland Bay stallions in his <a href="Buffalo%20Bill%27s%20Wild%20West">Wild West Show</a>.

Before the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, having seen the cavalry feats of mounted <a href="Boers">Boers</a> during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, Britain increased its cavalry reserves. Smaller Cleveland Bays were used to carry British troopers, and larger members of the breed pulled <a href="artillery">artillery</a>; the British War Office offered premiums on Cleveland Bay stallions. Although the First World War was not the cavalry war the British expected, large numbers of horses were used to pull artillery and losses were high. Because the war caused a depletion in stock, in 1920 and 1921, the British society opened a special register for previously unregistered mares of Cleveland Bay type, including some already registered with the <a href="Yorkshire%20Coach%20Horse">Yorkshire Coach Horse</a> (a Cleveland/Thoroughbred cross) registry, after they had passed an inspection that certified them to be of proper breed type. The subsequent foals of these mares were eligible for registration into the main British Cleveland Bay stud book, and were also eligible to compete in competitions reserved for breed members. Some of this progeny was bred and owned by <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a>.

However, interest in the Cleveland Bay was waning, due to increased mechanisation, and the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of the early 1930s reduced exports by almost a third. There was a brief revival of interest in the late 1930s in the United States when they became popular as foundation stock for hunters. The decline continued, quickening after the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>; in 1960 the War Office stopped offering premiums on stallions, and many breeders discontinued breeding. By 1962, only four purebred stallions were present in the UK. <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> saved the breed by purchasing Mulgrave Supreme, a stallion that was about to be sold to a buyer in the United States. The stallion was bred to pure- and part-bred mares, and within 15 years there were 36 purebred stallions in the UK. <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, used the breed for many years in <a href="combined%20driving">international driving</a> competitions. In the late 1960s and 1970s, interest in the breed increased, and part-bred Cleveland Bays were in demand for use as riding horses, especially for use as <a href="show%20hunter">hunters</a> and <a href="show%20jumping">jumpers</a>. In 1964, a Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred cross competed in show jumping in the <a href="Equestrian%20at%20the%201964%20Summer%20Olympics">Tokyo Olympics</a>. Another half-bred Cleveland Bay competed for the British Olympic team in show jumping at the <a href="Equestrian%20at%20the%201968%20Summer%20Olympics">1968 Mexico City Olympics</a>, while a third was a reserve mount for the Canadian show jumping team at the <a href="Equestrian%20at%20the%201976%20Summer%20Olympics">1976 Montreal Olympics</a>. In the late 1960s and '70s, horses continued to be exported to many countries. Japan, the United States and Australia have continued to import the horses from England, and in New Zealand crosses between Cleveland Bays and native mares were in demand on cattle and sheep <a href="Station%20%28New%20Zealand%20agriculture%29">stations</a>.

Since 1977, Elizabeth II has been a patron of the Society, and during the Society's centenary year of 1984 she acted as its president. The British Cleveland Bay Horse Society also maintains a separate registry for part-bred horses. In the late 20th century, the breed again gained the attention of the United States public, and in 1985 the US association was reactivated, renamed the Cleveland Bay Society of North America. The US <a href="American%20Livestock%20Breeds%20Conservancy">American Livestock Breeds Conservancy</a> considers their status to be critical, which means there is an estimated global population of less than 2,000, and fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States. The UK <a href="Rare%20Breeds%20Survival%20Trust">Rare Breeds Survival Trust</a> also considers their status to be critical, with less than 300 breeding females registered worldwide. The <a href="Equus%20Survival%20Trust">Equus Survival Trust</a> also considers the breed population to be at critical levels, meaning there are between 100 and 300 breeding females left in the world. Currently, there are about 135 purebred horses in the US and Canada recorded with the North American registry. There are also small populations in Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. In 2006, an estimated 550 Cleveland Bay horses existed worldwide, of which about 220 were <a href="mare">mare</a>s; the 2005 <a href="foal">foal</a> crop produced fewer than 50 horses.

The Cleveland Bay is a versatile horse and is still used today for many tasks, including driving and farmwork. In the 1920s, Cleveland Bays replaced black <a href="Hanoverian%20%28horse%29">Hanoverians</a> in the British royal stables, and both the Cleveland Bay and Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred crosses are used as royal carriage horses today. The horses are used as heavy <a href="fox%20hunting">hunters</a>, as they are powerful and able to carry a man weighing for a full day of hunting over large obstacles and through heavy clay. When crossed with Thoroughbreds, the resulting progeny are lighter and faster, but still strong and heavy of bone. When <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a> was first beginning as a sport during the mid-19th century, Cleveland Bays were among the initial stars. Two mares, Star and Fanny Drape, were two of the top performers. Fanny Drape was known to have cleared a stone wall with a rider on her back, and a bar while being jumped in-hand. In 2006, a Cleveland Bay stallion named Tregoyd Journeyman was used as a model for a new horse figure by <a href="Breyer%20horse">Breyer Animal Creations</a>, and the stallion participated in that year's Breyer model horse festival. Purebred and crossbred Cleveland Bays make up the majority of the bay horses in the <a href="Royal%20Mews">Royal Mews</a>, the British royal stables, where they receive intense training to desensitize them before they are put to work drawing royal carriages.

The Cleveland Bay was used in the creation of the <a href="Oldenburg%20%28horse%29">Oldenburg</a> breed, because of its stamina, strength, and jumping ability. The breed was also used to create and improve the <a href="Holsteiner%20%28horse%29">Holstein</a> and <a href="Hanoverian%20%28horse%29">Hanoverian</a> breeds. In the late 18th century, the Cleveland Bay was used to create the short-lived <a href="Yorkshire%20Coach%20Horse">Yorkshire Coach Horse</a> through crosses with Thoroughbreds. These Yorkshires were used mainly to pull mail and passenger coaches, hence their name. Called by some the "New Cleveland Bay", foreigners often could not distinguish between the two breeds, and many horses registered as Cleveland Bays in European coach horse studbooks were actually Yorkshire Coach Horses. In the 19th century, the Cleveland Bay was crossed with French and Belgian draft horses to create the <a href="Vladimir%20Heavy%20Draft">Vladimir Heavy Draft</a>, a Russian breed developed to fill that country's need for a heavy draft breed.

Witchfinder General (film)

Witchfinder General (titled onscreen as Matthew Hopkins: Witchfinder General) is a 1968 British-American <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> directed by <a href="Michael%20Reeves">Michael Reeves</a> and starring <a href="Vincent%20Price">Vincent Price</a>, <a href="Ian%20Ogilvy">Ian Ogilvy</a> and <a href="Hilary%20Dwyer">Hilary Dwyer</a>. The screenplay was by Reeves and Tom Baker based on <a href="Ronald%20Bassett">Ronald Bassett</a>'s novel of the <a href="Witchfinder%20General%20%28novel%29">same name</a>. Made on a <a href="low-budget%20film">low budget</a> of under £100,000, the movie was co-produced by <a href="Tigon%20British%20Film%20Productions">Tigon British Film Productions</a> and <a href="American%20International%20Pictures">American International Pictures</a>. The story details the heavily fictionalised murderous <a href="witch-hunt">witch-hunt</a>ing exploits of <a href="Matthew%20Hopkins">Matthew Hopkins</a>, a 17th-century English lawyer who claimed to have been appointed as a "" by Parliament during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> to root out <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">sorcery</a> and <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>. The film was retitled The Conqueror Worm in the United States in an attempt to link it with <a href="Roger%20Corman">Roger Corman</a>'s earlier series of <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>-related films starring Price in spite of its narrative bearing no relation to Poe's stories, with American prints book-ending the film through Price reading the titular <a href="The%20Conqueror%20Worm">poem</a> through narration.

Director Reeves featured many scenes of intense onscreen torture and violence that were considered unusually sadistic at the time. Upon its <a href="film%20release">theatrical release</a> throughout the spring and summer of 1968, the movie's gruesome content was met with disgust by several film critics in the UK, despite having been extensively <a href="censorship">censored</a> by the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Censors</a>. In the US, the film was shown virtually intact and was a box office success, but it was almost completely ignored by reviewers.

"Witchfinder General" eventually developed into a <a href="cult%20film">cult film</a>, partially attributable to Reeves's 1969 death from a drug overdose at the age of 25, only nine months after "Witchfinder"s release. Over the years, several prominent critics have championed the film, including <a href="J.%20Hoberman">J. Hoberman</a>, <a href="Danny%20Peary">Danny Peary</a>, <a href="Robin%20Wood%20%28critic%29">Robin Wood</a> and <a href="Derek%20Malcolm">Derek Malcolm</a>. In 2005, the magazine "<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>" named "Witchfinder General" the 15th-greatest horror film of all time.

In 1645, during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, <a href="Matthew%20Hopkins">Matthew Hopkins</a> (Vincent Price), an opportunist witchhunter, takes advantage of the breakdown in social order to impose a reign of terror in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>. Hopkins and his assistant, <a href="John%20Stearne%20%28witch-hunter%29">John Stearne</a> (<a href="Robert%20Russell%20%28English%20actor%29">Robert Russell</a>), visit village after village, brutally torturing confessions out of suspected witches. They charge the local magistrates for the work they carry out.

Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy) is a young <a href="Roundhead">Roundhead</a>. After surviving a brief skirmish and killing his first enemy soldier (and thus saving the life of his Captain), he rides home to <a href="Brandeston">Brandeston</a>, Suffolk, to visit his lover Sara (Hilary Dwyer). Sara is the niece of the village priest, John Lowes (<a href="Rupert%20Davies">Rupert Davies</a>). Lowes gives his permission to Marshall to marry Sara, telling him there is trouble coming to the village and he wants Sara far away before it arrives. Marshall asks Sara why the old man is frightened. She tells him they have been threatened and become outcasts in their own village. Marshall vows to Sara, "rest easy and no-one shall harm you. I put my oath to that." At the end of his army leave, Marshall rides back to join his regiment, and chances upon Hopkins and Stearne on the path. Marshall gives the two men directions to Brandeston then rides on.

In Brandeston, Hopkins and Stearne immediately begin rounding up suspects. Lowes is accused at his home and tortured. He has needles stuck into his back (in an attempt to locate the so-called "<a href="Witches%27%20mark">Devil's Mark</a>"), and is about to be killed, when Sara stops Hopkins by offering him sexual favours in exchange for her uncle's safety. However, soon Hopkins is called away to another village. Stearne takes advantage of Hopkins' absence by raping Sara. When Hopkins returns and finds out what Stearne has done, Hopkins will have nothing further to do with the young woman. He instructs Stearne to begin torturing Lowes again. Shortly before departing the village, Hopkins and Stearne execute Lowes and two women.

Marshall returns to Brandeston and is horrified by what has happened to Sara. He vows to kill both Hopkins and Stearne. After "marrying" Sara in a ceremony of his own devising and instructing her to flee to <a href="Lavenham">Lavenham</a>, he rides off by himself. In the meantime, Hopkins and Stearne have become separated after a Roundhead patrol attempts to commandeer their horses. Marshall locates Stearne, but after a brutal fight, Stearne is able to escape. He reunites with Hopkins and informs him of Marshall's desire for revenge.

Hopkins and Stearne enter the village of Lavenham. Marshall, on a patrol to locate the King, learns they are there and quickly rides to the village with a group of his soldier friends. Hopkins, however, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, has set a trap to capture Marshall. Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and take them to the castle to be interrogated. Marshall watches as needles are repeatedly jabbed into Sara's back, but he refuses to confess to witchcraft, instead vowing again to kill Hopkins. He breaks free from his bonds and stamps on Stearne's face, at the same time that his army comrades approach the castle dungeon. Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly strikes Hopkins. The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done. One of them puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him dead. Marshall's mind snaps and he shouts, "You took him from me! You took him from me!" Sara, also apparently on the brink of insanity, screams uncontrollably over and over again.

<a href="Tigon%20British%20Film%20Productions">Tigon British Film Productions</a> owned the rights to Ronald Bassett's 1966 novel, "<a href="Witchfinder%20General%20%28novel%29">Witchfinder General</a>", which was loosely based on the historical <a href="Matthew%20Hopkins">Matthew Hopkins</a>, a self-described "witchhunter" who claimed to have been commissioned by Parliament to prosecute and execute witches. Hopkins was in fact never given an official mandate to hunt witches. <a href="Tony%20Tenser">Tony Tenser</a>, the founder and chief executive of Tigon, had read Bassett's book while it was still in <a href="galley%20proof">galley</a> form and purchased the rights on impulse before publication. Despite the novel being "tedious low-brow popular history", Tenser felt it "had some scope, had some breadth to it; there was canvas for a film." Tenser offered the film to Michael Reeves, who had just completed Tigon's "<a href="The%20Sorcerers">The Sorcerers</a>" (1967), starring <a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>.

Reeves provided a story outline which met with Tenser's enthusiastic approval. Tenser immediately began putting together a preliminary budget, and requested that Reeves quickly complete a full film script, stressing to Reeves that the production would need to commence by September of that year to avoid shooting during cold weather. Reeves called in his childhood friend Tom Baker (who had co-written "The Sorcerers" with Reeves) to assist him with the script. Reeves and Baker began drafting a screenplay with <a href="Donald%20Pleasence">Donald Pleasence</a> firmly in mind as the film's star. However, once <a href="American%20International%20Pictures">American International Pictures</a> became involved in the production, they insisted that their contract star, <a href="Vincent%20Price">Vincent Price</a>, be given the lead, and Pleasence was dropped from the film. With the abrupt change of star, Reeves and Baker had to rethink their original concept of presenting Hopkins as "ineffective and inadequate … a ridiculous authority figure", which they had believed Pleasence could play to perfection. They knew the tall, imposing Price, with his long history of horror roles, would have to be more of a straightforward villain, and they made changes to their script accordingly.

As was required by law for British film productions of that time, the completed first draft of the screenplay was presented by Tenser to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) on 4 August to determine if any possible censorship issues could be anticipated. On the same day, a preliminary report was issued by a BBFC examiner, who, noting that Tenser was an "ape", referred to the screenplay as "perfectly beastly" and "ghoulish". The script was returned to Tenser a few days later, with a more detailed report from the same examiner, which described the screenplay as "a study in sadism in which every detail of cruelty and suffering is lovingly dwelt on … a film which followed the script at all closely would run into endless censorship trouble." After a second draft was subsequently written and sent to the BBFC only eleven days after the first draft, the reaction was nearly the same. It was returned to Tenser with an "exhaustive list" of requirements to reduce the film's possible offensiveness.

Reeves and Baker completed a third and final draft that was "substantially toned down" in content from the previous attempts. This version of the screenplay, which was filmed with only a few minor revisions during the production, was missing many of the more explicit moments of violence described in the first submitted drafts: the death spasms of the <a href="pre-credit">pre-credit</a>s hanging victim, Lowes getting stabbed fifteen times with a steel spike, and a sniper's victim somersaulting through the air and slamming into a tree. A sequence depicting the <a href="Battle%20of%20Naseby">Battle of Naseby</a> was to be filmed, during which a soldier's head was to be cut off on screen. Most significantly, the film's finale was completely altered. In the original ending, Stearne falls in with a group of gypsies and attempts to rape one of their women, who successfully fights off her attacker by plunging her thumbs into his eyes, blinding him. The gypsies then stake him to death. Marshall arrives and convinces the gypsies to assist him in ambushing Hopkins. Hopkins is viciously beaten by Marshall, who forces a "confession" out of the bloodied man. Marshall partially drowns Hopkins (whose thumbs have been tied to his feet), then finally hangs him. Tenser had previously expressed concerns regarding the scope of the Battle of Naseby sequence as well as the gypsy-ending, noting that these would both require the employment of additional groups of extras. He asked Reeves and Baker to remove the battle sequence and simplify the ending for the final draft.


Production began on 18 September 1967 with a budget of £83,000. Thirty-two thousand pounds was provided by AIP, with £12,000 for Price's expenditures and fees, and £20,000 for production costs. Philip Waddilove, a former BBC radio and record producer, contributed £5,000 in return for associate producer billing. Although the film would be the biggest-budgeted title in Tigon's history, for AIP their part of the budget represented a relatively small expenditure of money. Not much in terms of real quality was expected by AIP heads <a href="Samuel%20Z.%20Arkoff">Samuel Z. Arkoff</a> and <a href="James%20H.%20Nicholson">James H. Nicholson</a>, and the movie was intended to be nothing more than a <a href="Write-off">tax write-off</a>.

The interiors were filmed in two specially converted aircraft hangars near <a href="Bury%20St.%20Edmunds">Bury St. Edmunds</a> in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, which were leased for £1,500; this cost-measure resulted in much of the dialogue having to be re-recorded later, because the tin roofs of the hangars caused an echo. The exterior shots range from the <a href="Dunwich">Dunwich</a> Coast (for the scene with the fisherman) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a> of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at <a href="Black%20Park">Black Park</a> in southeast <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, a location frequently used by <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a>. <a href="Lavenham">Lavenham</a> Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired a <a href="cherry%20picker">cherry picker</a> from a local utility company for £10, because the unit couldn't afford a <a href="Crane%20shot">camera crane</a>. The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the <a href="Stanford%20Battle%20Area">Stanford Battle Area</a> near <a href="Thetford">Thetford</a>, <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>—the producer, through connections with the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Government">government</a>, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">St John The Evangelist</a> in <a href="Rushford%2C%20Norfolk">Rushford in Norfolk</a>. The <a href="moat">moat</a> drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at <a href="Kentwell%20Hall">Kentwell Hall</a>, in <a href="Long%20Melford">Long Melford</a>. The climax of the film was shot at <a href="Orford%20Castle">Orford Castle</a>, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.

The production went relatively smoothly except for the unrelentingly antagonistic relationship that developed between Reeves and Price. Reeves kept it no secret from everyone associated with the production that the American actor was not his choice for the role, and the director's comments had reached the actor back in the US. Reeves refused the courtesy of meeting Price at <a href="Heathrow%20Airport">Heathrow Airport</a> when he arrived in England, a "deliberate snub calculated to offend both Price and AIP." "Take me to your goddamn young genius," Price reportedly said to co-producer Philip Waddilove, who greeted the actor at the airport instead of Reeves. When Price went on location and met Reeves for the first time, the young director told the actor, "I didn't want you, and I "still" don't want you, but I'm stuck with you!"

According to <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a> in his book, "Nightmare Movies", when Reeves made a suggestion on the set, Price objected and told the director: "I've made 87 films. What have "you" done?" And Reeves responded: "I've made three good ones." "Reeves hated me," Price later recalled. "He didn't want me at all for the part. I didn't like him, either. It was one of the first times in my life that I've been in a picture where the director and I just clashed."
Price felt that all the actors on the set had a difficult time with the director, explaining: "Michael Reeves could not communicate with actors. He would stop me and say, 'Don't move your head like that.' And I would say, 'Like what? What do you mean?' He'd say, 'There—you're doing it again. Don't do that'." Price reportedly became so upset with Reeves that he refused to watch the film's <a href="dailies">dailies</a>.

In one scene, Reeves needed Price to shoot his <a href="flintlock">flintlock</a> between the ears of the horse he was riding. When Price realised that Reeves had ordered that an actual blank charge was to be used so the weapon's puff of smoke would be visible, he shouted, "What? You want the gun to go bang between the ears of this fucking nag? How do you think he's going to react?" However, Reeves insisted and, when the gun went off, the horse reared and sent Price tumbling onto the ground. Price was not hurt but he was extremely angered by the incident.

On the final day of shooting, Price showed up on the set visibly intoxicated. Reeves seethed to Waddilove, "He's drunk—how dare he be drunk on my set! I'll kill the bastard." Waddilove soon discovered that Reeves planned to inflict painful revenge on the actor. During preparations for Price's violent death scene, the director was overheard instructing Ogilvy to "really lay into Vincent" with the stage axe. Although when the scene was filmed Ogilvy indeed responded with blows that were not faked, Waddilove had earlier found some foam padding and fitted Price's costume with it, protecting the actor from any injury.

Despite the tension between the two men during the production, when Price saw the movie the following year, he admitted that he finally understood what Reeves had been after and wrote the young director a ten-page letter praising the film. Reeves wrote Price back, "I knew you would think so." Years after Reeves's death, Price said, "I realised what he wanted was a low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance. He did get it, but I was fighting him almost every step of the way. Had I known what he wanted, I would have cooperated."

In addition to his difficult relationship with Price, Reeves had to deal with a few production problems during the shooting. On the first day, Price was thrown from his horse and sent back to his hotel to recover. The actor returned to work the following day. Towards the end of filming, a strike was called when the British technicians union learned the production company was not hiring a large enough crew as required by union rules. After an extra man was hired, the crew resumed working. On two occasions, Reeves was short of actors. Waddilove replaced an absent actor as a Roundhead officer during Wymark's one-day scene. Waddilove's wife, Susi, played one of the women in the animal enclosure during the witch-burning sequence.

The film's violent climax was edited together in its present shape due to a continuity problem. In the screenplay, the soldier played by Nicky Henson was supposed to shoot both Price "and" Ogilvy dead. However, the actor only had one flintlock pistol, which had been clearly established in previous scenes, and was therefore only able to shoot one person. When the error was discovered, Reeves immediately told the actor: "All right, just shoot Vincent and I'll get Ian to scream and shout and go mad and <a href="freeze%20frame%20shot">freeze frame</a> on Hilary Dwyer screaming."

Several "alternate" <a href="Nudity%20in%20film">nude scenes</a> were filmed during the production. Set in a <a href="public%20house">pub</a> and involving local "wenches", the sequences were reportedly solely intended for the movie's German release version. Reeves refused to take part in the filming of these sequences and they were completed by the crew after the "regular" versions of the scenes had been shot, with Tigon's Tenser acting as director. According to Waddilove, <a href="Louis%20M.%20Heyward">Louis M. Heyward</a> appeared at the location only to ensure those additional scenes were filmed. The credits read, "Additional scenes by Louis M Heyward." According to Ogilvy, this was an <a href="in-joke">in-joke</a> because for Reeves, "additional scenes" meant "some prick of a producer putting his oar in and messing up what the director had done."

For its time, "Witchfinder General" was considered an unusually sadistic film experience. British film censor <a href="John%20Trevelyan%20%28censor%29">John Trevelyan</a> was reportedly a distant cousin of Michael Reeves and accepted the director's good intentions when Reeves explained why he felt it was necessary to include such intense violence in the movie. Trevelyan nonetheless argued, "The film gave the impression that it was exploiting violence, and in particular, sadism for commercial reasons." Consequently, the film was cut extensively by the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Censors</a> for its UK release. Nearly two complete minutes of what was described as "excesses of sadistic brutality" were removed. Reeves agreed to make some of the initial minor cuts himself, but when additional and more extensive demands were made he adamantly refused to take part in any further editing.

Trevelyan claimed that Reeves later wrote him a letter admitting that the cuts were not as harmful as he had expected. No copy of the letter has ever surfaced, and based on several other comments the director subsequently made about how the edits "ruined the film", Reeves's biographer Benjamin Halligan believes Trevelyan may have somehow "misremembered" the existence of this letter, confusing it with an earlier missive from the director in which he made a plea for the BBFC's leniency.

Even the truncated version was met with considerable controversy by UK film critics. <a href="Dilys%20Powell">Dilys Powell</a> in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times%20%28UK%29">The Sunday Times</a>" complained "17th-century hanging, burning, raping, screaming, and Vincent Price as England's prize torture-overseer. Peculiarly nauseating." "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" felt the film was filled with "gratuitous sadism." Margaret Hinxman of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</a>" dismissed it as a "sadistic extravaganza." Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. <a href="John%20Russell%20Taylor">John Russell Taylor</a> in the London "<a href="The%20Times">Times</a> Saturday Review" said the film "… is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else … There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject … Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period." "Films and Filming" noted, ""Witchfinder General" has no explicit 'message', but it does say something about the springs of despair and it says it forcefully. It is a very frightening film … Matthew Hopkins is the best of Price's recent performances. "Witchfinder General" is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one …" "<a href="Monthly%20Film%20Bulletin">Monthly Film Bulletin</a>" observed, "Not since "<a href="Peeping%20Tom%20%28film%29">Peeping Tom</a>" has a film aroused such an outcry about nastiness and gratuitous violence as this one … the tone of the film is oddly muted, with torture and death in plenty, but viewed matter-of-factly and without stress … Throughout the whole film there is a vivid sense of a time out of joint, which comes as much from the stray groups of soldiers who skirmish against unseen attackers in the woods or hang wearily about by the wayside waiting for battle to commence, as from the bloody crimes committed in the name of religion by Matthew Hopkins."

Playwright <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a> was particularly repulsed by "Witchfinder". In his regular column in "<a href="The%20Listener%20%28magazine%29">The Listener</a>", published eight days after the film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be "punctuated by belly laughs" and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean it made me feel dirty." Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in "The Listener", Reeves noted: "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence … Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such—and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that "Witchfinder General" works as intended."

AIP heads Arkoff and Nicholson had originally contributed their portion of the budget as a tax write-off, but when they were screened the completed film they were astonished by its quality. Nicholson told Louis Heyward, "It is one of the best we have gotten from England. Everybody thinks this is about the best production in the Poe series for the past few years." Arkoff noted that "Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been seen in a long time. Vincent was more savage in the picture. Michael really brought out the balls in him. I was surprised how terrifying Vincent was in that … I hadn't expected it."

In the US, the film was not subject to any <a href="film%20censorship%20in%20the%20United%20States">censorship</a> at all, and was released virtually intact to AIP's usual mix of <a href="Drive-in%20theater">drive-ins</a> and <a href="grindhouse">grindhouse</a>s. However, in an attempt to link the film with Roger Corman's earlier Edgar Allan Poe series of films, it was retitled "The Conqueror Worm". Brief <a href="prologue">prologue</a> and <a href="epilogue">epilogue</a> narrations (by Price) taken from Poe's poem were added to justify the new title. As Danny Peary noted in his "<a href="Cult%20Movies%20%28book%29">Cult Movies</a>" book, the film went nearly unnoticed by critics during its US release: "The few snoozing trade reviewers who saw it treated it as just another entry in AIP's Edgar Allan Poe series … and gave it such dismal notices that future bookings were scarce." "Hollywood Citizen News" was appalled by the film: "A disgrace to the producers and scripters, and a sad commentary on the art of filmmaking … a film with such bestial brutality and orgiastic sadism, one wonders how it ever passed customs to be released in this country." The trade journal "Box Office" noted that: "Fans of the horror film will be glad to know that Vincent Price is back to add another portrait to his gallery of arch-fiends … bathed in the most stomach-churning gore imaginable …" "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" opined that "Dwyer gives evidence of acting talent, but she and all principals are hampered by Michael Reeves's mediocre script and ordinary direction." Despite the lack of critical support, the movie was a modest success stateside, earning $1.5 million for AIP according to "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" magazine. In his biography of Reeves, Benjamin Halligan claims the film made $10 million in the US.

The film's retitling by AIP caused a minor fracas in Hong Kong. A group of British sailors had seen the movie at the base cinema under its original title and one week later unwittingly saw the movie again in a local cinema, playing under the American release title. They immediately demanded their money back and, when the manager refused, they tipped over litter bins, threw popcorn at the screen, and "almost tore the theatre apart." The manager changed his mind and paid the sailors back for the price of the tickets, and sent a bill to AIP for the damages.

Very soon after its initial release in the spring of 1968, several critics began championing the film in the UK and US. <a href="Robin%20Wood%20%28critic%29">Robin Wood</a> wrote that ""Witchfinder General" is certainly [Reeves’] most successfully achieved work … what one is immediately struck by is the assurance and intensity of what is on the screen… the English countryside is felt as a real presence: it is difficult to think of other films in which it has been used so sensitively and meaningfully. With it is associated Paul Ferris’ theme-music, which suggests a traditional air without being actual quotation. Against the peace and fertility of nature is set the depravity of men." <a href="David%20Pirie">David Pirie</a>, who wrote extensively and enthusiastically about the film in his 1973 book "A Heritage of Horror", reviewed the film in 1971 for "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out</a>", commenting: "one of the most personal and mature statements in the history of British cinema … The performances are generally excellent, and no film before or since has used the British countryside in quite the same way." Danny Peary noted, ""The Conqueror Worm" is a stunning film in many ways, but probably Reeves's greatest achievement is that he was able to maintain an extraordinary momentum throughout, until the film ends as it began, with a woman (this time Sara) screaming." In 2000, <a href="Derek%20Malcolm">Derek Malcolm</a> included "Witchfinder General" as part of his series "The Century of Films", a list of what he considered to be the one hundred most "artistically or culturally important" movies of the 20th Century. Malcolm asserted that the film "is one of the most compulsively watchable ever made in Britain" and "transcends its genre with the sheer panache of its making." In 2005, <a href="J.%20Hoberman">J. Hoberman</a> of the "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" stated that the film "has long been a cult item – in part because its talented 25-year-old director, Michael Reeves, died of a drug overdose before the film's release, but mainly because it is an extraordinarily bleak story of political evil … Reeves shot on location and the movie has a robust autumnal quality perfectly matched by Price's overripe performance … it remains contemporary, and even frightening, in its evocation of cynical Puritanism and mass deception."

In his 2007 book, "Madness Unchained: A Reading of Virgil's 'Aeneid", Lee Fratantuono described "Witchfinder General" as a modern retelling of the main themes of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s epic "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>", and its central image of the unrelenting nature of fury and madness and its power to corrupt essentially good heroes. Fratantuono has written that in the film Reeves "has captured exactly the point of Virgil's great epic of madness and its horrifying conclusion."

Writer Mark Thomas McGee noted that "Witchfinder General" "did fantastic business and kicked off a second wave of Edgar Allan Poe movies" produced by American International Pictures, including <a href="Gordon%20Hessler">Gordon Hessler</a>'s "<a href="The%20Oblong%20Box%20%28film%29">The Oblong Box</a>" starring Price (originally scheduled to be directed by Reeves, but handed over to Hessler after Reeves bowed out a week prior to production) and "<a href="Murders%20in%20the%20Rue%20Morgue%20%281971%20film%29">Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>" (1971). Hessler's "<a href="Cry%20of%20the%20Banshee">Cry of the Banshee</a>" (1970), which featured "Witchfinder" co-stars Price and Hilary Dwyer, was also vaguely associated with Poe in advertisements ("Edgar Allan Poe Probes New Depths of Terror!"); it was dismissed by <a href="AllMovie">AllMovie</a> as "a rehashing of "Witchfinder General"." This new Poe "series" was short-lived and effectively over by 1971.

According to AIP's Louis Heyward, "Witchfinder General" "was very successful in Germany—it was the most successful of the violence pictures—it started a vogue." "Copycat" films financed, or partially financed, by German production companies included "<a href="Mark%20of%20the%20Devil">Mark of the Devil</a>" (1970), with <a href="Herbert%20Lom">Herbert Lom</a> and <a href="Udo%20Kier">Udo Kier</a>, "<a href="The%20Bloody%20Judge%20%28film%29">The Bloody Judge</a>" (1970), directed by <a href="Jesus%20Franco">Jesus Franco</a> and starring <a href="Christopher%20Lee">Christopher Lee</a>, and "Hexen geschändet und zu Tode gequält" (1973), released in the U.S. years later on video as "<a href="Mark%20of%20the%20Devil%20Part%20II">Mark of the Devil Part II</a>".

Tigon's own "<a href="The%20Blood%20on%20Satan%27s%20Claw">The Blood on Satan's Claw</a>" (1970) was produced "as a successor, in spirit if not in story" to "Witchfinder General", and borrowed Reeves's usage of "the usually tranquil English countryside as a place of terror." <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a> has referred to the film as a prime example of a short-lived subgenre he called "folk horror", grouping it with "Satan's Claw" and "<a href="The%20Wicker%20Man">The Wicker Man</a>".

Some critics maintain that <a href="Ken%20Russell">Ken Russell</a>'s "<a href="The%20Devils%20%28film%29">The Devils</a>" (1971) was influenced by Reeves's film, with one writer calling Russell's movie "the apex of the 'historical' witch-persecution films started by "Witchfinder General"." However, Russell said that he hated Reeves's film, describing it as "one of the worst movies I have ever seen and certainly the most nauseous."

The film has had a minor influence on <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal music</a>. In 1980, the movie inspired a band to call themselves <a href="Witchfinder%20General%20%28band%29">Witchfinder General</a>. Another metal band, <a href="Cathedral%20%28band%29">Cathedral</a>, released a 1996 <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> titled "Hopkins (The Witchfinder General)", featuring a song of the same name. That song also appeared on their album, "The Carnival Bizarre" and the music video was included as an extra on the U.K. DVD release of Reeves's film. The song "Witchfinder General" also appeared on heavy metal band Saxon's 2004 album titled "Lionheart".

The film was the inspiration for a <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> play "Vincent Price and The Horror of The English Blood Beast" by Matthew Broughton, first broadcast in March 2010.

Carl Douglas, popular for recording the disco song "<a href="Kung%20Fu%20Fighting">Kung Fu Fighting</a>" in the 1970's also recorded "Witchfinder General" in 1974, on the album titled "The Soul of the Kung Fu Fighter".

In 2016, director <a href="Nicolas%20Winding%20Refn">Nicolas Winding Refn</a> revealed that he had bought the <a href="remake">remake</a> rights to "Witchfinder General".

While some reviewers have praised the film for its ostensible "historical accuracy", others have strongly questioned its adherence to historical fact. Dr. Malcolm Gaskill, <a href="Fellow">Fellow</a> and former Director of Studies in history at <a href="Churchill%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Churchill College, Cambridge</a>, and author of "Witchfinders: A 17th-Century English Tragedy", critiqued the film for the <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> History website, calling it "a travesty of historical truth" while acknowledging that "there is much to be said in favour of "Witchfinder General"—but as a film, not as history." Based purely on its level of historical accuracy, Gaskill gave the film "3 stars" on a scale of 0–10.

Gaskill had several complaints regarding the film's "distortions and flights of fancy". While Hopkins and his assistant John Stearne really did torture, try and hang John Lowes, the vicar of Brandeston, Gaskill notes that other than those basic facts the film's narrative is "almost completely fictitious." In the movie, the fictional character of Richard Marshall pursues Hopkins relentlessly to death, but in reality the "gentry, magistrates and clergy, who undermined his work in print and at law" were in pursuit of Hopkins throughout his (brief) murderous career, as he was never legally sanctioned to perform his witch-hunting duties. And Hopkins wasn't axed to death, he "withered away from <a href="Tuberculosis">consumption</a> at his <a href="Essex">Essex</a> home in 1647". Vincent Price was 56 when he played Hopkins, but "the real Hopkins was in his 20s". According to Gaskill, one of the film's "most striking errors is its total omission of court cases: witches are simply tortured, then hanged from the nearest tree."

Censorship and musical rights issues kept a complete, pristine version of "Witchfinder General" from being released on <a href="videotape">videotape</a>, <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> or <a href="DVD">DVD</a> for many years. Although uncensored theatrical prints have been available for archival showings in the US for several years, video releases of the title were repeatedly compromised.

The "Export Version", which contained both the previously cut violence and alternate shots of topless nudity filmed for overseas release, was passed uncut by the BBFC in 1995, and released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> by Redemption. In 2001, a DVD was released in the UK by Metrodome consisting of two versions, the complete "Director's Cut" containing the two minutes of previously censored violence, and the aforementioned "Export Version", also with the violence intact but including shots of nudity added to certain sequences. In both versions, the two minutes of violence have been taken from what has been described as "a grainy VHS source." Some critics complained that watching the film in this manner was an often "jarring" or "distracting" viewing experience. In addition, the soundtrack of the newly inserted nude shots had "brief snippets of audio repeating itself because of the timing involved in inserting the previously cut footage".

In the US, while censorship of the film has never been a factor, the film nonetheless experienced numerous delays in appearing on home video in its originally intended form. When <a href="Orion%20Pictures">Orion Pictures</a> acquired the rights to many of AIP's titles in the 1980s, they were unable to also purchase rights to the musical soundtracks of some of the films, and added synthesizer scores by composer Kendall Schmidt in lieu of the original music. "Witchfinder General" was one of these "problem" titles. For years, Paul Ferris's acclaimed full orchestral score was not available in the US on home video releases, although it was included on theatrical and syndicated television prints. The <a href="HBO">HBO</a> videotape release from the late 1980s utilised the Orion version, which also included the nude inserts. <a href="Tim%20Lucas">Tim Lucas</a> noted that the spoken soundtrack to these newly added "spicy" shots "doesn't match it correctly."

In 2005, writer Steve Biodrowski reported that a "definitive version" of the film had been restored and would be released in the US on DVD by <a href="MGM">MGM</a>-<a href="United%20Artists">UA</a> in August of that year, as part of their Midnite Movies series. After <a href="Sony">Sony</a> purchased the rights to the MGM film library, James Owsley (Director of Restorations at MGM) advised Philip Waddilove (one of "Witchfinder General"s producers) that the date of the DVD release was postponed until October 2006. In an interview conducted in August 2005, Waddilove revealed that he had learned Sony had "little interest" in the film and no official announcement of any pending DVD release had ever been made. Waddilove noted that "the principal at Sony doesn't greenlight DVDs of anything older than ten years!!" However, the film was indeed released under the Midnite Movies banner on 11 September 2007 by <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20Home%20Entertainment">20th Century Fox Home Entertainment</a>. The release includes the complete, uncut version of the film with the Ferris score intact. Price's opening and closing narration tacked on to the AIP "Conqueror Worm" version, as well as the alternate nude sequences, were not available on this release, but they were included in the UK <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> release from Odeon Entertainment issued in June 2011. The Blu-ray utilised the same <a href="high-definition%20video">high-definition</a> transfer as the 2007 MGM DVD and was completely uncut. In 2013, <a href="Scream%20Factory">Scream Factory</a> included the film as part of the company's multi-title Vincent Price Blu-ray <a href="box%20set">box set</a> released in fall of 2013.

Deinosuchus

Deinosuchus () is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="genus">genus</a> related to the <a href="alligator">alligator</a> that lived 80 to 73 million years ago (<a href="annum">Ma</a>), during the late <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="Geologic%20time%20scale%23Terminology">period</a>. The name translates as "terrible crocodile" and is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "deinos" (δεινός), "terrible", and "soukhos" (σοῦχος), "crocodile". The first remains were discovered in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> (United States) in the 1850s; the <a href="genus">genus</a> was named and described in 1909. Additional fragments were discovered in the 1940s and were later incorporated into an influential, though inaccurate, skull reconstruction at the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>. Knowledge of "Deinosuchus" remains incomplete, but better <a href="Skull">cranial</a> material found in recent years has expanded scientific understanding of this massive predator.

Although "Deinosuchus" was far larger than any modern crocodile or alligator, with the largest adults measuring in total length, its overall appearance was fairly similar to its smaller relatives. It had large, robust teeth built for crushing, and its back was covered with thick hemispherical <a href="osteoderm">osteoderm</a>s. One study indicated "Deinosuchus" may have lived for up to 50 years, growing at a rate similar to that of modern crocodilians, but maintaining this growth over a much longer time.

"Deinosuchus" fossils have been described from 10 US states, including Texas, Montana, and many along the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a>. Fossils have also been found in northern Mexico. It lived on both sides of the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a>, and was an opportunistic <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a> in the coastal regions of eastern North America. "Deinosuchus" reached its largest size in its western habitat, but the eastern populations were far more abundant. Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate <a href="species">species</a>. "Deinosuchus" was probably capable of killing and eating large <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s. It may have also fed upon <a href="sea%20turtle">sea turtle</a>s, fish, and other aquatic and terrestrial prey.

Despite its large size, the overall appearance of "Deinosuchus" was not considerably different from that of modern crocodilians. "Deinosuchus" had an <a href="alligator">alligator</a>-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being significantly smaller than the other two. Each <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22 teeth. The tooth count for each <a href="dentary">dentary</a> (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close to the rear of the <a href="jaw">jaw</a>s were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.

Modern saltwater crocodiles (<a href="Saltwater%20crocodile">"Crocodylus porosus"</a>) have the strongest recorded bite of any living animal, with a maximum force of . The bite force of "Deinosuchus" has been estimated to be to . It has been argued that even the largest and strongest <a href="theropoda">theropod</a> dinosaurs, such as "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>", probably had bite forces inferior to that of "Deinosuchus".

"Deinosuchus" had a secondary bony palate, which would have permitted it to breathe through its nostrils while the rest of the head remained submerged underwater. The <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the front end and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a <a href="ball%20and%20socket%20joint">ball and socket joint</a>. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern <a href="eusuchia">eusuchia</a>n crocodilians.

The <a href="osteoderm">osteoderm</a>s (scutes) covering the back of "Deinosuchus" were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of "Deinosuchus" out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms have been used to suggest that, despite its bulk, "Deinosuchus" could probably have walked on land much like modern-day crocodiles.

The large size of "Deinosuchus" has generally been recognized despite the fragmentary nature of the fossils assigned to it. However, estimates of how large it really was have varied considerably over the years. The original estimate from 1954 for the type specimen of the then-named ""Phobosuchus riograndensis"" were based on a skull of and a lower jaw of long, reconstructed with similar proportions to the <a href="Cuban%20crocodile">Cuban crocodile</a> giving a total estimated length of . However, this reconstruction is currently considered to be inaccurate. Using more complete remains, it was estimated in 1999 that the size attained by specimens of "Deinosuchus" varied from with weights from . This was later corroborated when it was noted that most known specimens of "D. rugosus" usually had skulls of about with estimated total lengths of and weights of . A reasonably well-preserved skull specimen discovered in <a href="Texas">Texas</a> indicated the animal's head measured about , and its body length was estimated at . However, the largest fragmentary remains of "D. riograndensis" were 1.5 times the size of those of the average "D. rugosus" and it was determined that the largest individuals of this species may have been up to in length and perhaps weighed as much as .

A particularly large mandibular fragment from a "D. riograndensis" specimen was estimated to have come from an individual with a skull length of . This length was used in conjunction with a regression equation relating skull length to total length in the <a href="American%20alligator">American alligator</a> to estimate a total length of for this particular specimen. This is only slightly lower than previous estimates for the species. "Deinosuchus" has often been described as the largest <a href="Crocodyliformes">crocodyliform</a> of all time. However other crocodyliformes such as "<a href="Purussaurus">Purussaurus</a>", "<a href="Rhamphosuchus">Rhamphosuchus</a>", and "<a href="Sarcosuchus">Sarcosuchus</a>" may have equaled or exceeded it in size.

"Deinosuchus" was present on both sides of the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a>. Specimens have been described from 10 U.S. states: Utah, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and North Carolina. David Schwimmer has said "Deinosuchus" fossils have been found in South Carolina and Delaware as well, but none of them from those two states have been formally described. A "Deinosuchus" osteoderm from the <a href="San%20Carlos%20Formation">San Carlos Formation</a> was also reported in 2006, so the giant crocodilian's range may have included parts of northern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. There is also a report describing a possible "Deinosuchus" scute from Colorado. "Deinosuchus" fossils are most abundant in the <a href="Gulf%20Coastal%20Plain">Gulf Coastal Plain</a> region of Georgia, near the Alabama border. All known specimens of "Deinosuchus" were found in rocks dated to the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> <a href="Stage%20%28stratigraphy%29">stage</a> of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Geologic%20time%20scale%23Terminology">period</a>. The oldest examples of this genus lived approximately 82 Ma, and the youngest lived around 73 Ma.

The distribution of "Deinosuchus" specimens indicates these giant crocodilians may have preferred <a href="Estuary">estuarine</a> environments. In the <a href="Aguja%20Formation">Aguja Formation</a> of Texas, where some of the largest specimens of "Deinosuchus" have been found, these massive predators probably inhabited <a href="Brackish%20water">brackish-water</a> <a href="bay">bay</a>s. Although some specimens have also been found in <a href="ocean">marine</a> deposits, it is not clear whether "Deinosuchus" ventured out into the ocean (like modern-day <a href="Saltwater%20Crocodile">saltwater crocodiles</a>); these remains might have been displaced after the animals died. "Deinosuchus" has been described as a "conspicuous" component of a purportedly distinct biome occupying the southern half of Late Cretaceous North America.

In 1954, Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird speculated that "Deinosuchus" "may very well have hunted and devoured some of the dinosaurs with which it was contemporaneous". Colbert restated this hypothesis more confidently in 1961: "Certainly this crocodile must have been a predator of dinosaurs; otherwise why would it have been so overwhelmingly gigantic? It hunted in the water where the giant theropods could not go." David R. Schwimmer proposed in 2002 that several <a href="hadrosaurid">hadrosaurid</a> tail vertebrae found near <a href="Big%20Bend%20National%20Park">Big Bend National Park</a> show evidence of "Deinosuchus" tooth marks, strengthening the hypothesis that "Deinosuchus" fed on dinosaurs in at least some instances. In 2003, Christopher A. Brochu agreed that "Deinosuchus" "probably dined on <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a>s from time to time." "Deinosuchus" is generally thought to have employed hunting tactics similar to those of modern crocodilians, ambushing dinosaurs and other terrestrial animals at the water's edge and then submerging them until they drowned. A 2014 study suggested that it would have been able to perform a "<a href="Crocodilia%23Feeding">death roll</a>", like modern crocodiles.
Schwimmer and G. Dent Williams proposed in 1996 that "Deinosuchus" may have preyed on <a href="Sea%20turtle">marine turtles</a>. "Deinosuchus" would probably have used the robust, flat teeth near the back of its jaws to crush the turtle shells. The "<a href="Pleurodira">side-necked</a>" sea turtle "<a href="Bothremydidae">Bothremys</a>" was especially common in the eastern habitat of "Deinosuchus", and several of its shells have been found with bite marks that were most likely inflicted by the giant crocodilian.

Schwimmer concluded in 2002 that the feeding patterns of "Deinosuchus" most likely varied by geographic location; the smaller "Deinosuchus" specimens of eastern North America would have been opportunistic feeders in an ecological niche similar to that of the modern <a href="American%20Alligator">American alligator</a>. They would have consumed marine turtles, large fish, and smaller dinosaurs. The bigger, but less common, "Deinosuchus" that lived in Texas and Montana might have been more specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs. Schwimmer noted no theropod dinosaurs in "Deinosuchus"'s eastern range approached its size, indicating the massive crocodilian could have been the region's <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>.

A 1999 study by Gregory M. Erickson and Christopher A. Brochu suggested the growth rate of "Deinosuchus" was comparable to that of modern crocodilians, but was maintained over a far longer time. Their estimates, based on growth rings in the <a href="Dorsum%20%28biology%29">dorsal</a> osteoderms of various specimens, indicated each "Deinosuchus" might have taken over 35 years to reach full adult size, and the oldest individuals may have lived for more than 50 years. This was a completely different growth strategy than that of large dinosaurs, which reached adult size much more quickly and had shorter lifespans. According to Erickson, a full-grown "Deinosuchus" "must have seen several generations of dinosaurs come and go".

Schwimmer noted in 2002 that Erickson and Brochu's assumptions about growth rates are only valid if the osteodermal rings reflect annual periods, as they do in modern crocodilians. According to Schwimmer, the growth ring patterns observed could have been affected by a variety of factors, including "migrations of their prey, wet-dry seasonal climate variations, or oceanic circulation and nutrient cycles". If the ring cycle were biannual rather than annual, this might indicate "Deinosuchus" grew faster than modern crocodilians, and had a similar maximum lifespan.

In 1858, <a href="geologist">geologist</a> <a href="Ebenezer%20Emmons">Ebenezer Emmons</a> described two large fossil teeth found in <a href="Bladen%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Bladen County, North Carolina</a>. Emmons assigned these teeth to "<a href="Polyptychodon">Polyptychodon</a>", which he then believed to be "a <a href="genus">genus</a> of crocodilian reptiles". Later discoveries showed that "Polyptychodon" was actually a <a href="pliosaur">pliosaur</a>, a type of marine reptile. The teeth described by Emmons were thick, slightly curved, and covered with vertically grooved enamel; he assigned them a new <a href="species">species</a> name, "P. rugosus". Although not initially recognized as such, these teeth were probably the first "Deinosuchus" remains to be scientifically described. Another large tooth that likely came from "Deinosuchus", discovered in neighboring <a href="Sampson%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Sampson County</a>, was named "Polydectes biturgidus" by <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a> in 1869.

In 1903, at <a href="Willow%20Creek%2C%20Montana">Willow Creek, Montana</a>, several fossil osteoderms were discovered "lying upon the surface of the soil" by <a href="John%20Bell%20Hatcher">John Bell Hatcher</a> and T.W. Stanton. These osteoderms were initially attributed to the <a href="Ankylosauridae">ankylosaurid</a> dinosaur "<a href="Euoplocephalus">Euoplocephalus</a>". Excavation at the site, carried out by W.H. Utterback, yielded further fossils, including additional osteoderms, as well as vertebrae, <a href="rib">rib</a>s, and a <a href="Pubis%20%28bone%29">pubis</a>. When these specimens were examined, it became clear that they belonged to a large crocodilian and not a dinosaur; upon learning this, Hatcher "immediately lost interest" in the material. After Hatcher died in 1904, his colleague <a href="William%20Jacob%20Holland">W.J. Holland</a> studied and described the fossils. Holland assigned these specimens to a new genus and species, "Deinosuchus hatcheri", in 1909. "Deinosuchus" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> δεινός/"deinos", meaning "terrible", and σοῦχος/"suchos", meaning "crocodile".
A 1940 expedition by the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> yielded more fossils of giant crocodilians, this time from <a href="Big%20Bend%20National%20Park">Big Bend National Park</a> in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. These specimens were described by Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird in 1954, under the name "Phobosuchus riograndensis". Donald Baird and <a href="Jack%20Horner%20%28paleontologist%29">Jack Horner</a> later assigned the Big Bend remains to "Deinosuchus", which has been accepted by most modern authorities. The genus name "Phobosuchus", which was initially created by <a href="Franz%20Nopcsa%20von%20Fels%C5%91-Szilv%C3%A1s">Baron Franz Nopcsa</a> in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained a variety of different crocodilian species that turned out to not be closely related to each other.

The American Museum of Natural History incorporated the skull and jaw fragments into a plaster restoration, modeled after the present-day <a href="Cuban%20Crocodile">Cuban crocodile</a>. Colbert and Bird stated this was a "conservative" reconstruction, since an even greater length could have been obtained if a long-skulled modern species, such as the saltwater crocodile had been used as the template. Because it was not then known that "Deinosuchus" had a broad snout, Colbert and Bird miscalculated the proportions of the skull, and the reconstruction greatly exaggerated its overall width and length. Despite its inaccuracies, the reconstructed skull became the best-known specimen of "Deinosuchus", and brought public attention to this giant crocodilian for the first time.

Numerous additional specimens of "Deinosuchus" were discovered over the next several decades. Most were quite fragmentary, but they expanded knowledge of the giant predator's geographic range. As noted by Chris Brochu, the osteoderms are distinctive enough that even "bone granola" can adequately confirm the presence of "Deinosuchus". Better cranial material was also found; by 2002, David R. Schwimmer was able to create a composite computer reconstruction of 90% of the skull.

Since the discovery of the earliest fragmentary remains that will come to be known as "Deinosuchus", it was found that it was a relative of <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s, going as far as placing it in the same <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> (<a href="crocodylidae">crocodylidae</a>) in 1954, this assignment was mostly supported by dental features but was overturned in 1999 when the finding of new specimens from <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28US%20state%29">Georgia</a> helped place "Deinosuchus" in a phylogenetic analysis, finding it in a basal position within the clade <a href="Alligatoroidea">Alligatoroidea</a> along with "<a href="Leidyosuchus">Leidyosuchus</a>". This classification was bolstered in 2005 by the discovery of a well-preserved "Deinosuchus" <a href="Skull">brain case</a> from the Blufftown Formation of Alabama, which shows some features reminiscent of those in the modern American alligator, "Deinosuchus" however, was not a direct ancestor of modern alligators.

The species pertaining to "Deinosuchus" since the resurrection of the <a href="genus%20%28biology%29">generic</a> name in 1979 have been traditionally recognized as "D. rugosus" from Appalachia and the larger "D. hatcheri/riograndensis" from Laramidia, characterized by differences of the shape of their <a href="osteoderms">osteoderms</a> and teeth. However, this view was not universally supported and Schwimmer (2002) recognized just one species, "Deinosuchus rugosus", with the differences found between the two species explained as the result of the larger size of the western morph. This proposal was endorsed by Lucas et al. (2006), but was criticized by other authors and an SVP 2010 abstract Schwinner reported new fossils of specimens from both sides of the interior seaway that indicated that the differences between the two morphs were not just size related, teeth from large eastern specimens retained the common characteristics of other specimens of the region and osteoderms from small specimens of the western morph were no different from those of large ones, supporting the specific separation of the two morphs, "D. rugosus" and "D. hatcheri/riograndensis". In their overview of crocodyliform material from the <a href="Kaiparowits%20Formation">Kaiparowits Formation</a> of Utah, Irmis et al. (2013) noted that "D. rugosus" is dubious due to its holotype teeth being undiagnostic, and recommended using "Deinosuchus hatcheri" for "Deinosuchus" material from Laramidia, while stressing that cranial "Deinosuchus" material from Appalachia has not been described.

LSWR N15 class

The LSWR N15 class was a British 2–<a href="Cylinder%20%28locomotive%29">cylinder</a> <a href="4-6-0">4-6-0</a> express passenger <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a> designed by <a href="Robert%20W.%20Urie">Robert W. Urie</a>. The class has a complex build history spanning three sub-classes and eight years of construction from 1919 to 1926. The first batch of the class was constructed for the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a> (LSWR), where they hauled heavy <a href="express%20passenger%20train">express trains</a> to the south coast ports and further west to <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>. After the Lord Nelsons they were the second biggest express passenger locomotives in the Southern Railway.

Following the <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">grouping of railway companies</a> in 1923, the LSWR became part of the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Southern Railway</a> (SR) and its publicity department gave the N15 locomotives names associated with <a href="Arthurian%20legend">Arthurian legend</a>; the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs. The <a href="Chief%20Mechanical%20Engineer">Chief Mechanical Engineer</a> (CME) of the newly formed company, <a href="Richard%20Maunsell">Richard Maunsell</a>, modified the Urie locomotives in the light of operational experience and increased the class strength to 74 locomotives. Maunsell and his Chief Draughtsman <a href="James%20Clayton%20%28engineer%29">James Clayton</a> incorporated several improvements, notably to the <a href="steam%20circuit">steam circuit</a> and <a href="valve%20gear">valve gear</a>.

The new locomotives were built over several batches at <a href="Eastleigh%20railway%20works">Eastleigh</a> and <a href="North%20British%20Locomotive%20Company">Glasgow</a>, leading to the nicknames of "Eastleigh Arthurs" and "Scotch Arthurs" in service. The class was subjected to smoke deflection experiments in 1926, becoming the first British class of steam locomotive to be fitted with <a href="smoke%20deflectors">smoke deflectors</a>. Maunsell's successor, <a href="Oliver%20Bulleid">Oliver Bulleid</a>, attempted to improve performance by altering <a href="Steam%20locomotive%20exhaust%20system">exhaust</a> arrangements. The locomotives continued operating with <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a> (BR) until the end of 1962. One example, <a href="LSWR%20N15%20Class%2030777%20Sir%20Lamiel">30777 "Sir Lamiel"</a>, is preserved as part of the <a href="National%20Collection">National Collection</a> and can be seen on mainline <a href="railtour">railtour</a>s.

Robert Urie completed his <a href="LSWR%20Class%20H15">H15 class</a> <a href="Mixed-traffic%20locomotive">mixed-traffic</a> 4-6-0 design in 1913 and the prototype was built in August 1914. It showed a marked improvement in performance over <a href="Dugald%20Drummond">Dugald Drummond</a>’s <a href="LSWR%20T14%20class">LSWR T14 class</a> 4-6-0 when tested on local and express passenger trains. The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with the outbreak of the First World War, which prevented construction of further class members. Despite the interruption caused by the conflict, Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from <a href="London">London</a> to the south-west of England. Passenger loadings on the heavy boat trains to the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a>’s (LSWR) ports of <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a> and <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> had been increasing prior to the war, and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR's passenger locomotive fleet. His response was to produce a modern, standard <a href="Express%20passenger%20train">express passenger</a> design similar to the H15.

Trials undertaken in 1914 with the H15 class prototype had demonstrated to Urie that the basic design showed considerable speed potential on the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Routes">Western section</a> of the LSWR from <a href="Basingstoke%20railway%20station">Basingstoke</a> westwards, and could form the basis of a powerful new class of 4-6-0 express passenger locomotive with larger driving wheels. The LSWR required such a locomotive, which would need to cope with increasing train loads on this long and arduous route to the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a>. The result was the N15 class design, completed by Urie in 1917. It incorporated features from the H15 class, including eight-wheel double <a href="bogie">bogie</a> <a href="tender%20%28rail%29">tenders</a> with outside <a href="Locomotive%20frame">plate frames</a> over the wheels and exposed <a href="Walschaerts%20valve%20gear">Walschaerts valve gear</a>. High running plates along the boiler were retained for ease of oiling and maintenance.

Despite the similarities, the N15 class represented a refinement of the H15 template. The cylinders were increased in size to in diameter, the largest used on a British steam locomotive at that time. The substantial <a href="fire-tube%20boiler">boiler</a> design was also different from the parallel version used on the H15, and became the first tapered types to be constructed at Eastleigh Works. Contrary to boiler construction practices elsewhere where tapering began near the firebox, it was restricted to the front end of the N15's barrel to reduce the diameter of the <a href="smokebox">smokebox</a>, and consequently the weight carried by the front bogie. The design also featured Urie's design of narrow-diameter "stovepipe" chimney, a large dome cover on top of the boiler, and his <a href="Superheater%23Applications">"Eastleigh" superheater</a>.

The N15 design was approved by the LSWR management committee, though the order for construction was postponed until wartime control of raw materials was relaxed. Government approval was obtained in mid–1918, and <a href="Eastleigh%20railway%20works">Eastleigh Works</a> began to produce the LSWR's first new locomotive class since 1914. The first locomotives, later known by crewmen as the "Urie N15s", were built in two ten-engine batches by the LSWR's Eastleigh Works between 1918–19 and 1922–23. Of the first batch, the prototype, No. 736 entered service on 31 August 1918, with four more appearing between September 1918 and April 1919. They shared a similar profile to Urie's H15 class with the use of flat-sided Drummond-style cabs with gently curving roofs. The double bogie tenders were outwardly similar in appearance to those used on the H15s, although strengthened during construction with extra internal bracing to hold of water. 
A shortage of copper delayed completion of Nos. 741–745, and the last of the batch emerged from Eastleigh in November 1919. After the running-in of Nos. 736–745 and an intensification of the LSWR timetable to the West Country, a second batch of ten was ordered in October 1921. They entered service over the period June 1922–March 1923, and were numbered in the series 746–755.

At "<a href="Railways%20Act%201921">Grouping</a>" in January 1923, the LSWR became part of the new <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Southern Railway</a>, whose <a href="Chief%20Mechanical%20Engineer">Chief Mechanical Engineer</a> was <a href="Richard%20Maunsell">Richard Maunsell</a>. Maunsell planned to introduce his own designs of express passenger locomotive, one of which was to become the future <a href="SR%20Lord%20Nelson%20class">Lord Nelson class</a>. Despite this, there was a short-term need to maintain existing services that required modification and expansion of Urie's N15 design.

Maunsell's projected design of express passenger locomotive was not ready for introduction during the summer timetable of 1925, so a third batch of ten N15s was ordered for construction at Eastleigh. This batch was part of an outstanding LSWR order to rebuild 15 of Drummond's unsuccessful 4-cylinder <a href="LSWR%20F13%20class">F13</a>, <a href="LSWR%20G14%20class">G14</a> and <a href="LSWR%20P14%20class">P14 classes</a> 4-6-0s into 2–cylinder H15 class locomotives. Only the five F13s were converted to H15s; the remaining ten G14 and P14s (Nos. 448–457, renumbered E448–E457) were rebuilt as N15s, implementing modifications to Urie's original design.

The modifications are attributed to Maunsell's Chief Draughtsman <a href="James%20Clayton%20%28engineer%29">James Clayton</a>, who had transferred to <a href="Ashford%20railway%20works">Ashford railway works</a> in 1914 from <a href="Derby%20Works">Derby works</a>. They were the result of cooperation between the <a href="South%20Eastern%20and%20Chatham%20Railway">South Eastern and Chatham Railway</a> (SECR) and the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> (GWR) when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War. The aim was to create a series of standard freight and passenger locomotives for use throughout Britain, and meant that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design. These included streamlined steam passages, long-travel valves, the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure.

Maunsell initiated trials with Urie N15 No. 442 in 1924, and proved that better performance could be obtained by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements. As a result, Clayton reduced the N15 cylinder diameter to and replaced the safety valves with Ross pop valves set to boiler pressure. The Urie boiler was retained, though the Eastleigh superheater was replaced by a Maunsell type with 10 per cent greater superheating surface area. This was supplemented by a larger <a href="Steam%20locomotive%20components">steam chest</a> and an increased-diameter chimney casting specially designed for the rebuilds. It incorporated a rim and <a href="Capuchon%20%28chimney%29">capuchon</a> to control exhaust flow into the atmosphere. Valve events (the timing of <a href="valve%20gear">valve</a> movements with the piston) were also revised to promote efficient steam usage and the wheels were re-balanced to reduce hammerblow.

When rebuilding was complete, only the numbers, smokebox doors with centre tightening handles and the flat-sided cabs remained of the G14 and P14 classes. The rebuilds retained their distinctive Drummond "watercart" tenders, which were modified with the removal of the complex injector feedwater heating equipment. The "watercart" tenders were of water and coal capacity. The ten rebuilds became the first members of the King Arthur class upon entering service.

As the Drummond G14 and P14 4-6-0s were rebuilt to the N15 specification at Eastleigh, a lack of production capacity due to repair and overhaul meant that Maunsell ordered a further batch of 20 locomotives from the <a href="North%20British%20Locomotive%20Company">North British Locomotive Company</a> in 1924. The company had under-quoted to gain the contract, which meant that production of the batch was rushed. The necessity to maintain an intensive timetable on the Southern Railway's Western section prompted an increase of the order to 30 locomotives (Nos. E763–E792). Their construction in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> would gain them the "Scotch Arthurs" nickname in service. They were all delivered to the Southern Railway by October 1925, and featured the front-end refinements used on the Drummond rebuilds.

The North British batch was built to the Southern's new composite <a href="loading%20gauge">loading gauge</a> and differed from previous batches in having an Ashford-style cab based upon that used on the <a href="SECR%20N%20class">N class</a>. Unlike the Drummond cab retained by Nos. 448–457 and E741–E755, the Ashford cab was of an all-steel construction and had a roof that was flush with the cab sides, allowing it to be used on gauge-restricted routes in the east of the network. It was inspired by the standard cab developed in 1904 by <a href="Richard%20Deeley">R. M. Deeley</a> for the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a>, and was one of a number of Midland features introduced by Clayton to the SECR and subsequently the Southern Railway. The smokebox door was revised to the Ashford pattern, which omitted the use of central tightening handles in favour of clamps around the circumference. The batch was fitted with the Urie-designed, North British-built capacity double-bogie tenders.

With the "Scotch Arthurs" in service, the Southern Railway had an ample fleet of express passenger locomotives for its Western section routes. As part of a process of fleet standardisation, the Operating Department expressed a desire replace obsolescent locomotives on the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Operations">Eastern</a> and <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Operations">Central sections</a> with the King Arthur class. In May 1925, a batch of 25 locomotives (Nos. E793–E817) based upon the Scotch Arthurs was ordered for construction at Eastleigh with smaller firebox grates and improved water heating surfaces. After the first 14 (Nos. E793–E806) were built, it was decided to discontinue construction in favour of Maunsell's new 4-cylinder Lord Nelson class design in June 1926.

The Operating Department intended to equip Nos. E793–E807 with six-wheel, capacity tenders for use on the former SECR lines of the Eastern section. These were to replace Scotch Arthurs Nos. E763–E772 on boat train duties. This was because the tenders attached to Nos. E763–E772 were better suited to the longer routes of the Western section. The final ten engines (Nos. E808–E817) were for the former LBSCR routes of the Central section, where short <a href="Turntable%20%28rail%29">turntables</a> restricted tender size to the Ashford variety used on the N class. After the order was changed to the Lord Nelson class design, 14 N class tenders were fitted to Nos. E793–E806 for use the Central section. The high <a href="draw-gear">draw-gear</a> (the link between locomotive and tender) of the N class tenders necessitated modification to the frames beneath the cab.

When the former Drummond G14 and P14 4-6-0s were rebuilt to Maunsell's N15 specification in February 1925, the Southern Railway decided to give names to all express passenger locomotives. Because of the railway's association with the West of England, the Public Relations Officer, <a href="John%20Elliot%20%28railway%20manager%29">John Elliot</a> suggested that members of the N15 class should be named after characters and places associated with the legend of <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a>. When Maunsell was told of the decision to name the locomotives, he replied: "Tell <a href="Herbert%20Ashcombe%20Walker">Sir Herbert [Walker</a>] I have no objection, but I warn you, it won't make any difference to the working of the engines". Walker was the General Manager of the Southern Railway, who had told Elliot that Maunsell's permission was required. The first G14 to be rebuilt, No. E453, was given the first name and christened "King Arthur". The Urie locomotives (hitherto referred as N15s rather than King Arthurs) were also given names connected with <a href="Arthurian%20legend">Arthurian legend</a> and were referred to as "Urie Arthurs"; the Maunsell batches of N15s were nicknamed the "Eastleigh" and "Scotch Arthurs".

The N15 class was intended to haul heavy expresses over the long <a href="South%20Western%20Main%20Line">LSWR mainlines</a> between <a href="London%20Waterloo%20railway%20station">Waterloo</a>, <a href="Weymouth%20railway%20station">Weymouth</a>, <a href="Exeter%20Central%20railway%20station">Exeter</a> and <a href="Plymouth%20Friary%20railway%20station">Plymouth</a>. Locomotives were changed at before the upgrading of the South Western Mainline in 1922, when fast running through to Exeter was possible. The Southern Railway's motive power re-organisation following the <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">Grouping</a> of 1923 saw the class allocated to sheds across the network and used on to cross-country trains. Operations were expanded to more restricted Central and Eastern section mainlines in 1925, and suitably modified class members hauled commuter and heavy boat trains from to and expresses to . In 1931, No. E780 "Sir Persant" hauled the inaugural "<a href="Bournemouth%20Belle">Bournemouth Belle</a>" <a href="Pullman%20train%20%28UK%29">Pullman</a> train from Waterloo to .

In peacetime, the class was occasionally used on fast freights from <a href="Southampton%20Docks">Southampton Docks</a>, although it was common to see them at the head of freight and troop trains during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Ten "Urie Arthurs" were transferred to the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> (LNER) in October 1942, and were based at Heaton shed for use on freight and occasional passenger trains in the north east and southern <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. They returned to the Southern Railway in July 1943 after the introduction of <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Transportation%20Corps">United States Army Transportation Corps</a> <a href="USATC%20S160%20Class">S160 class</a> <a href="2-8-0">2-8-0</a>s into service. From 1945 the King Arthur class regularly deputised for <a href="SR%20West%20Country%20and%20Battle%20of%20Britain%20classes">Bulleid's new Pacifics</a>, which were experiencing poor serviceability due to mechanical failures. The entire class came into British Railways ownership in 1948: they could be found in most areas of the <a href="Southern%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">Southern Region</a> on medium-length expresses and stopping trains on the ex-LSWR mainline.

In 1926 the N15 class became the first in Britain equipped with <a href="smoke%20deflector">smoke deflector</a>s, with several designs tested. Experiments were undertaken throughout 1926 and included the fitting of a curved plate above the smokebox of No. E753 "Melisande" to channel air from below the chimney to lift the exhaust above the locomotive when on the move. Nos. E450 "Sir Kay" and E753 "Sir Gillemere" had air scoops attached to the chimney, whilst E772 "Sir Percivale" was fitted with large, square German-type smoke deflectors. Finally, No. E453 "King Arthur" was fitted with small, rectangular smoke deflectors fitted to the handrails on the smokebox sides. The experiments produced mixed results, and Maunsell requested the assistance of the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> in staging <a href="Wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel tests</a> . These resulted in a standard plate design (illustrated in the infobox), which was gradually fitted to the class from late 1927 onwards.

Under LSWR ownership, the N15s were initially well received by crews, though the batch soon gained a reputation for poor steaming on long runs. Through running of the class into Exeter was stopped in favour of engine changes at Salisbury, and Urie attributed the problem to poor driving technique. A series of trial runs changed this assumption, and demonstrated that steam pressure gradually decreased on the flat. The trials also revealed that the robust construction of the motion produced the heaviest <a href="hammerblow%20%28railway%29">hammerblow</a> of any British locomotive class, and had caused cracked frames on the test locomotive.

Another criticism from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated the installation of a <a href="tarpaulin">tarpaulin</a> sheet over the rear of the cab and the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The <a href="Black%20Friday%20%281921%29%23The%20mining%20crisis%2C%20March%201921">1921 Coal Miners’ strike</a> meant that two class members (Nos. 737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing by the end of the year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.

When Maunsell inherited the design as CME of the Southern Railway, he began trials using the weakest N15 (No. 442) in 1924. The results indicated that better performance could be obtained by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements, although the first two recommendations were deemed too costly for immediate implementation by the Locomotive Committee. Eight extra King Arthur-type boilers were ordered from North British and fitted to N15s Nos. 737–742 by December 1925 in an effort to improve steaming. The remaining Urie boilers were fitted with standard Ross pop safety valves to ease maintenance. Maunsell also addressed draughting problems caused by the narrow Urie "stovepipe" chimney. The exhaust arrangements were modified on No. 737 using the King Arthur chimney design and reduced-diameter <a href="blastpipe">blastpipe</a>s. This proved successful, and all "Urie N15s" were modified over the period 1925–1929. The oil-burning equipment was refitted to Nos. 737 and 739 during the 1926 <a href="1926%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20strike">General Strike</a> and removed in December of that year.

Beginning in 1928, all but No. 755 had their <a href="Cylinder%20%28locomotive%29">cylinder</a> diameter reduced from to when renewals were due, improving speed on flat sections of railway, but affecting their performance on the gradients west of Salisbury. No. 755 "The Red Knight" was modified in 1940 by Maunsell's successor, <a href="Oliver%20Bulleid">Oliver Bulleid</a> with his own design of cylinders and streamlined steam passages. This was married to a <a href="Lema%C3%AEtre%20exhaust">Lemaître</a> multiple-jet <a href="blastpipe">blastpipe</a> and wide-diameter chimney, allowing the locomotive to produce performances akin to the more powerful Lord Nelson class. Four other N15s were so modified with four more on order, though the latter were cancelled due to wartime shortages of metal. The soft exhaust of the Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipe precipitated an adjustment to the smoke deflectors on three converted locomotives, with the tops angled to the vertical in an attempt to improve air-flow along the boiler cladding. This failed to achieve the desired effect, and the final two modified locomotives retained the Maunsell-style deflectors.

The final modifications to the "Urie N15s" involved the conversion of five locomotives (Nos. 740, 745, 748, 749 and 752) to oil-firing in 1946–1947. This was in response to a government scheme to address a post-war coal shortage. The oil tanks were fabricated from welded steel and fitted within the tender coal space. After initial problems with No. 740 "Merlin" were rectified, the oil-fired locomotives proved good performers on Bournemouth services. A further addition to the oil-fired locomotives was electric headcode and cab lighting, which was retained when the engines reverted to coal-firing in 1948.

The improved front-end layout applied to the first batch of "Eastleigh Arthurs" (Nos. E448–E457) ensured continuous fast running on flat sections of track around London, although their propensity for speed was sometimes compromised over the hilly terrain west of Salisbury. The inside bearings of the Drummond "watercart" tenders proved problematic, as they were too small for the load carried and suffered from water ingress. The retention of the tall Drummond cab prevented use away from the Western section of the Southern Railway. Despite these problems, their operational reliability prompted the management to arrange the visit of No. E449 "Sir Torre" to the Darlington Railway Centenary celebrations in July 1925. No. E449 also recorded speeds of up to on the South West Mainline near in 1929. This proved that with the right components, Urie's original design could perform well.

Despite the successful use of modified N15 components to rebuild Nos. E448–E457, the mechanically similar "Scotch Arthurs" proved disappointing when put into service from May 1925. The performance of those allocated to the Eastern section was indifferent, and failed to improve upon the <a href="double-heading">double-headed</a> ex-SECR <a href="4-4-0">4-4-0</a>s they were to replace. Reports of poor steaming and hot driving and tender wheel axleboxes were common from crewmen and shed fitters. After investigation, the problems were attributed to poor workmanship during construction as the North British Locomotive Company underquoted production costs to gain the contract. Defects were found in boiler construction across the batch, and necessitated six replacement boilers, re-riveting, re-fitting of tubes and replacement of firebox stays. The hot driving wheel axleboxes were caused by the main frames being out of alignment. A 1926 report suggested that all affected locomotives should be taken to Eastleigh for repair. Once repaired, the "Scotch Arthurs" proved as capable as the rest of the class in service.

"Scotch Arthurs" Nos. E763–E772 received new tenders between 1928 and 1930 in a series of tender exchanges with the Lord Nelson and <a href="LSWR%20S15%20class">LSWR S15</a> classes. This ensured that they could exchange their Urie bogie tenders with the Ashford design for use on the shorter Eastern section routes. Whilst useful for the roster clerks at Battersea shed, any transfer to the Western section was hampered because of their shorter range. By 1937, all had reverted to the Urie bogie tenders, though Nos. E768–E772 were attached to new Maunsell flush-sided tenders with brake vacuum reservoirs fitted behind the coal space. These were again swapped with Maunsell LSWR-style bogie tenders fitted to the Lord Nelson class.

The second batch of "Eastleigh Arthurs" displaced the ex-<a href="SECR%20K%20and%20K1%20classes">K class</a> tanks and ex-<a href="LB%26amp%3BSCR%20H2%20class">LBSCR H2 "Atlantic"</a> <a href="4-4-2%20%28locomotive%29">4-4-2</a> locomotives on the and routes respectively. They were well liked by crews and used on this part of the network until the arrival of electrification. No. E782 "Sir Brian" was used on the former <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Great Northern</a> main line for performance trials against the SECR <a href="SECR%20K%20and%20K1%20classes">K and K1 class tanks</a> following a <a href="Sevenoaks%20railway%20accident">railway accident at Sevenoaks, Kent</a> in 1927. The tests were supervised by the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a>'s CME, Sir <a href="Nigel%20Gresley">Nigel Gresley</a>, who commented that the class was unstable at high speeds. The instability was caused by motion hammerblow and exacerbated by irregularities in track-work. This caused excessive stress to the axleboxes and poor riding characteristics on the <a href="footplate">footplate</a>. Despite this, the class benefited from an excellent maintenance regime.

Maunsell's replacement <a href="Oliver%20Bulleid">Oliver Bulleid</a> believed that there was little need to improve draughting on this series. However, reports of poor steaming with No. 792 "Sir Hervis de Revel" gave him an opportunity to trial a Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipe and wide-diameter chimney on a Maunsell Arthur in 1940. This did not enhance performance to the extent of No. 755 "The Red Knight". Under British Railways ownership, the locomotive was re-fitted with the Maunsell chimney in March 1952 with no further problems reported. In another wartime experiment, Bulleid fitted No. 783 "Sir Gillemere" with three thin "stovepipe" chimneys in November 1940. These were set in a triangular formation to reduce visibility of exhaust from the air in response to attacks made by low-flying aircraft on Southern Railway trains. The "stovepipes" were reduced to two, producing a fierce exhaust blast that dislodged soot inside tunnels and under bridges. The experiment was discontinued in February 1941 and the locomotive re-fitted with a Maunsell King Arthur chimney. The last experiment was with spark-arresting equipment in response to lineside fires caused by poor quality coal. Nos. 784 "Sir Nerovens" and 788 "Sir Urre of the Mount" were fitted with new wide-diameter chimneys in late 1947. Test-trains showed mixed results and the trials were stopped in 1951 after improvements in coal quality and the fitting of internal smokebox spark-arrestors.

The detail variations across the class meant the "Urie N15s" were placed into store over the winters of 1949 and 1952. The Maunsell King Arthur examples were easier to maintain, and the large number of modern Bulleid Pacific and British Railways <a href="Steam%20locomotives%20of%20British%20Railways%23BR%20standard%20classes">Standard</a> classes were able to undertake similar duties. The "Urie N15s" were brought into service during the summer months, although their deteriorating condition was demonstrated when No. 30754 "The Green Knight" was withdrawn with cracked frames in 1953. The slow running-down of the "Urie N15s" continued between 1955–1957, and several were stored prior to withdrawal. The last three were withdrawn from Basingstoke shed, with No. 30738 "King Pellinore" the final example to cease operation in March 1958. All were broken up for scrap, though their names were given to 20 <a href="BR%20Standard%20Class%205">BR Standard class 5</a> locomotives allocated to the Southern Region between 1959–1962.

The Maunsell King Arthur class also faced a decrease in suitable work on the Central and Eastern sections following the introduction of BR Standard class 5 and <a href="BR%20standard%20class%204%204-6-0">BR Standard class 4</a> 4-6-0s in 1955. The gradual withdrawal of the "Urie N15s", H15s and <a href="SR%20N15X%20class">SR N15x</a> classes presented an opportunity to replace the ageing Drummond "watercart" tenders fitted to Nos. 448–457 with Urie bogie tenders. This coincided with a 1958 programme to similarly change the Ashford tenders fitted to eight of the second batch "Eastleigh Arthurs". The class remained intact until the completion of the <a href="Railway%20electrification%20system">Eastern section electrification</a> when 17 were made redundant in 1959. More withdrawals took place in 1960 when an increase in Bulleid Pacifics allocated to the Western section reduced available work. The ranks thinned to 12 in 1961, and further withdrawals reduced the class to one, No. 30770 "Sir Prianius". The class outlasted the newer – but less numerous – <a href="SR%20Lord%20Nelson%20Class">Lord Nelson</a> class by one month when No. 30770 was withdrawn from Basingstoke Shed in November 1962. 


Under LSWR ownership, the "Urie N15s" were painted in Urie's LSWR sage green <a href="livery">livery</a> for passenger locomotives. This was distinct from Drummond's sage green because it was more olive in colour, and yellowed with cleaning and weathering. Black and white <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway%23Locomotive%20liveries">lining</a> decorated the boiler bands and borders of the sage green panels. The lettering was in <a href="Gilded">gilt</a>: the initials "LSWR" located on the side of the tender, the locomotive number on the cabside.

The first Southern livery continued that of the LSWR, though with primrose yellow <a href="decal">transfers</a> showing "SOUTHERN" and the locomotive number, placed on the tender. The lining separating the black border on tender and cab side panels was changed to yellow. Primrose yellow <a href="decal">transfers</a>, showing "SOUTHERN" and the locomotive number, were placed on the tender. An "E" prefix was located above the tender number (e.g. E749), denoting that the class was registered for maintenance at Eastleigh works. The gilt numerals on the cabside and tender rear were replaced by a cast oval plate with "Southern Railway" around the edge and the number located in the centre. Yellow numerals were painted onto the front <a href="buffer%20beam">buffer beam</a> to ease identification. In February 1925 Maunsell developed a deeper green with black and white lining. This was applied to his new King Arthur class locomotives and the "Urie N15s" were similarly painted when overhauls were due. Wheels were olive-green with black tyres. From 1929 the "E" prefix was removed and the cast numerals on the tender rear were removed and replaced with yellow transfers (e.g. 749).

In May 1938, after Bulleid's appointment as CME, No. 749 "Iseult" was trialled in bright unlined light green with yellow-painted block numerals replacing the cast numberplates. The tender was given two designs of lettering, with "SOUTHERN" on one side and the initials "SR" on the other. The Board of Directors disapproved and Bulleid repainted the locomotive in darker <a href="malachite%20green">malachite green</a> with black and white lining (this would later be applied to his Pacifics). The legend "SOUTHERN" in block-lettering remained on the tender, though the number was relocated to the cabside on one side and the smoke deflector on the other. Both were painted in a light "sunshine yellow". No. 749 was returned to Maunsell's green livery.

Several variations of the Maunsell green, Urie sage green and Bulleid <a href="malachite%20green">malachite green</a> liveries were tried with black, white/black, and yellow lining, some sporting a green panel on the smoke deflectors. However, from 1942 to 1946, during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, members of the class under overhaul were turned out in unlined-black livery as a wartime economy measure, with green-shaded sunshine yellow lettering. The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to malachite green, with yellow/black lining, and sunshine yellow lettering. Some of the class (Nos. 782 and 800, "Sir Brian" and "Sir Persant") did not receive this livery.

British Railways gave the class the power classification of 5P after nationalisation in 1948. For the first 18 months the locomotives sported a transitional livery: Southern Railway malachite green with "BRITISH RAILWAYS" on the tender in sunshine yellow lettering. As each member of the class became due for a heavy general overhaul, they were repainted in the new standard British Railways express passenger livery of <a href="Brunswick%20green">Brunswick green</a> with orange and black lining from April 1949. Initially, the British Railways "Cycling Lion" crest was located on the tender, replaced from the 1957 by the later "Ferret and Dartboard" crest.

Numbering was initially a continuation of the Southern Railway system, though an 'S' prefix was added to denote a pre-nationalisation locomotive, so that No. 448 would become No. s448. As each locomotive became due for overhaul and received its new livery, the numbering was changed to the British Railways standard numbering system, in the series 30448–30457 for the first ten and 30736–30806 for the rest.

After the poor steaming of the Urie batch was addressed, the class proved popular amongst crews, mechanically reliable and capable of high speeds. However, their heavy hammerblow at speed meant that they were prone to rough riding and instability. The two Maunsell batches with their streamlined steam passages and better draughting arrangements were superior in performance, and were a popular choice when Bulleid's locomotives were unavailable. Their use of standard parts considerably eased maintenance, and the fitting of different tender and cab sizes meant few operational restrictions for the class on mainline routes. The class gave many years of service, and were noted for their ability to "do the job". The electrification of the Eastern and Central sections and the increasing number of Bulleid Pacifics in service meant the lack of a suitable role for the class under British Railways ownership. In spite of the reduction in work, high mileages were obtained with No. 30745 "Tintagel" achieving in service.

The decision to preserve a member of the class was made in November 1960. It was first intended to preserve the King Arthur class doyen No. 453 "King Arthur", and it was stored for a time after withdrawal in 1961 pending restoration to museum condition. However, it was decided to restore the preserved locomotive to as-built condition, and the lack of a suitable Drummond "watercart" tender precluded this consideration. No. 453 was subsequently scrapped and it was decided to preserve one of the North British-built batch, <a href="LSWR%20N15%20Class%2030777%20Sir%20Lamiel">No. 30777 "Sir Lamiel"</a>, withdrawn in October 1961, instead. "Sir Lamiel" was named after a character in <a href="Thomas%20Malory">Thomas Malory</a>'s "<a href="Le%20Morte%20d%27Arthur">Le Morte d'Arthur</a>", <a href="Sir%20Lamiel">Sir Lamiel of Cardiff</a>. This locomotive was restored to Maunsell livery as No. E777, and became part of the <a href="National%20Collection">National Collection</a>. It was restored to the later British Railways livery in 2003, and No. 30777 can be seen at the <a href="Great%20Central%20Railway%20%28preserved%29">Great Central Railway</a> and on the railway network hauling mainline railtours as of 2010.

Jonathan Philip Agnew, (born 4 April 1960) is an English <a href="cricket">cricket</a> broadcaster and a former professional cricketer. He was born in <a href="Macclesfield">Macclesfield</a>, <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, and educated at <a href="Uppingham%20School">Uppingham School</a>. He is nicknamed "Aggers", and, less commonly, "Spiro" – the latter, according to "Debrett's Cricketers' Who's Who", after former US Vice President <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a>.

Agnew had a successful <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> career as a <a href="fast%20bowler">fast bowler</a> for <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a> from 1979 to 1990, returning briefly in 1992. In first-class cricket he took 666 <a href="Wickets%20taken">wickets</a> at an <a href="bowling%20average">average</a> of 29.25. Agnew won three <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a> for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>, as well as playing three <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a>s in the mid-1980s, although his entire international career lasted just under a year. In <a href="county%20cricket">county cricket</a>, Agnew's most successful seasons came toward the end of his career, after his last international match, when he had learned to <a href="swing%20bowling">swing the ball</a>. He was second- and third-leading wicket-taker in 1987 and 1988 respectively, including the achievement of <a href="100%20wickets%20in%20a%20season">100 wickets in a season</a> in 1987. He was named as one of the five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a> by "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" in 1988.

While still a player, Agnew began a career in cricket journalism and commentary. Since his retirement as a player, he has become a leading voice of cricket on radio, as the <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a> cricket correspondent and as a commentator on "<a href="Test%20Match%20Special">Test Match Special</a>". He has also contributed as a member of Australian broadcaster <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>'s <a href="ABC%20Radio%20Grandstand">"Grandstand"</a> team. Agnew's on-air "leg over" comment on "Test Match Special", made to fellow commentator <a href="Brian%20Johnston">Brian Johnston</a> in 1991, provoked giggling fits during a live broadcast and reaction from across England. The incident has been voted "the greatest sporting commentary ever" in a BBC poll; <a href="Michael%20Henderson%20%28writer%29">Michael Henderson</a>, one of Agnew's peers and rivals, has described him as "a master broadcaster ... the pick of the sports correspondents at the BBC."

Agnew was born on 4 April 1960 at West Park Hospital in <a href="Macclesfield">Macclesfield</a>, <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, to Philip and Margaret Agnew. His parents' forthcoming marriage was announced in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in 1957: Philip Agnew was described as "the only son of Mr and Mrs Norris M. Agnew of <a href="Dukenfield%20Hall">Dukenfield Hall</a>, <a href="Mobberley">Mobberley</a>, <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>" and Margaret as "youngest daughter of Mr and Mrs A.F.V. McConnell of <a href="Hampton%20Hall%2C%20Worthen">Hampton Hall</a>, <a href="Worthen">Worthen</a>, <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>". The Agnews had a second son in June 1962 and were recorded as living at "<a href="Bainton%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Bainton</a> near <a href="Stamford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Stamford</a>, Lincs"; in April 1966, a daughter, Felicity, was born and was announced as "a sister for Jonathan and Christopher". Agnew's paternal grandmother, Lady Mona Agnew, died aged 110 years and 170 days in 2010 and was on the <a href="List%20of%20British%20supercentenarians">list of the 100 longest-lived British people ever</a>.

Jonathan Agnew recalls growing up on the family farm and first becoming aware of cricket aged "eight or nine"; his father would carry a radio around and listen to "<a href="Test%20Match%20Special">Test Match Special</a>":

"The programme sparked an interest in me, in the same way it has in so many tens of thousands of children down the years, igniting a passion that lasts a lifetime."

Driven by early enjoyment of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew would go into the garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an <a href="offspin">offspin</a> action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, <a href="Mary%20Duggan">Mary Duggan</a>, who was a women's Test player for <a href="England%20women%27s%20cricket%20team">England</a> from 1948 to 1963.

From the age of eight, Agnew <a href="boarding%20school">boarded</a> at Taverham Hall School near <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>. His first cricket coach was Eileen Ryder and, according to Agnew, after "a couple of years" a professional arrived at the school: <a href="Ken%20Taylor%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201935%29">Ken Taylor</a>, a former batsman for <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> who had played three Tests for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Agnew attended <a href="Uppingham%20School">Uppingham School</a> for his secondary education, and left in 1978 with nine <a href="O-levels">O-levels</a> and two <a href="A-levels">A-levels</a> in German and English. From the age of 16 he developed his skills as a right-arm <a href="Fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a> out of school hours at <a href="Alf%20Gover">Alf Gover</a>'s cricket school whilst at <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey County Cricket Club</a>. That summer, he saw fast bowler <a href="Michael%20Holding">Michael Holding</a> take 14 <a href="Wickets%20taken">wickets</a> in the <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201976%23Fifth%20Test">1976 Oval Test match</a>, a performance of pace bowling referred to as "devastating" by cricket writer <a href="Norman%20Preston">Norman Preston</a>, which made a lasting impression on Agnew. More than 30 years later he wrote of his bowling during his schooldays:

"For an eighteen-year-old bowler I was unusually fast, and enjoyed terrorising our opponents, be they schoolboys (8 wickets for 2 runs and 7 for 11 stick in the memory) or, better still, the teachers in the annual staff match. This, I gather, used to be a friendly affair until I turned up, and I relished the chance to settle a few scores on behalf of my friends – for whom I was the equivalent of a hired assassin – as well as for myself."

He began playing for Surrey's <a href="second%20XI">second XI</a> in 1977, but Surrey made no move to sign him as a player. <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire County Cricket Club</a> did however take note of Agnew's impressive performances in local club cricket and for Uppingham School, for whom he took 37 wickets at a <a href="bowling%20average">bowling average</a> of 8 in 1977, and signed him while he was still a schoolboy in time for the <a href="1978%20English%20cricket%20season">1978 season</a>.

On his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> in August 1978, the 18-year-old Agnew bowled to <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England international</a> <a href="David%20Lloyd%20%28cricketer%29">David Lloyd</a>, an <a href="opening%20batsman">opening batsman</a> with nine <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> <a href="cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a>. Reported in "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>", Lloyd "was halfway through a forward defensive push when his <a href="stump%20%28cricket%29">off stump</a> was despatched halfway towards the Leicestershire <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a>." Agnew took one <a href="Wickets%20taken">wicket</a> in each innings of the match, and did not bat; Leicestershire won by an innings.

Agnew won a <a href="Whitbread%20Brewery">Whitbread Brewery</a> award at the end of his debut season, an achievement he ascribes to the influence of his county captain, <a href="Ray%20Illingworth">Ray Illingworth</a>: he had taken only six first-class wickets at an average of 35. Illingworth was quoted in "The Times" as saying that Agnew was "the second fastest bowler" in England in 1978, behind only <a href="Bob%20Willis">Bob Willis</a>. The award afforded him the opportunity to spend a winter in Australia developing his skills, alongside fellow winners <a href="Mike%20Gatting">Mike Gatting</a>, <a href="Wayne%20Larkins">Wayne Larkins</a> and <a href="Chris%20Tavar%C3%A9">Chris Tavaré</a>, and to be coached by former England fast bowler, <a href="Frank%20Tyson">Frank Tyson</a>. All four went on to play Test cricket. On that Australia tour, Agnew played his only youth Test, but made headlines when invited to bowl at <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201978%E2%80%9379">the touring England team</a> in the <a href="cricket%20nets">nets</a>:
"He struck the captain, <a href="Mike%20Brearley">Mike Brearley</a>, a nasty blow in the face. It was, Agnew recalls, merely a gentle delivery off two paces that flew off a wet patch; but it did not deter the headline writers. Such early publicity did him no favours, but when a bowler arrives who is young, fast and English, a quiet settling-in period to one of the more difficult apprenticeships in sport is often denied him." – "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>"

Agnew's 1979 season was disrupted by injury. The Editor's Notes of the 1980 "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" reported, under the heading "England's Promising Youngsters", that Agnew had strengthened himself over the winter by felling trees. Agnew's own account is that 1979–80 was "the worst winter of his life", although his recollection is that he spent it working as a lorry driver. He did, however, make his <a href="List%20A%20cricket">List A</a> <a href="limited%20overs%20cricket">limited overs</a> debut in 1979, playing just once, against the <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201979">Sri Lanka touring team</a> – his competitive List A debut followed in 1980, in the <a href="Benson%20%26amp%3B%20Hedges%20Cup">Benson & Hedges Cup</a> against <a href="Scotland%20national%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a>: he bowled just three overs (for five runs) and did not bat.

Agnew's career did not initially live up to his early promise. In his first six seasons as a first-class cricketer, his largest haul of wickets was 31 in 1980. The <a href="1984%20English%20cricket%20season">1984 season</a> was his breakthrough year: he played 23 first-class matches, taking 84 wickets at an average of 28.72. Playing in the warm-up game against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20cricket%20team">Cambridge University</a>, he achieved figures of 8–47 (taking 8 wickets while conceding 47 runs) from 20.4 overs and was included in the first team for the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> matches that followed. He carried that success forward into the County Championship, picking up wickets for Leicestershire including a ten wicket match haul against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> in June, and five wickets in an innings against Kent in the days leading up to <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201984%23Fifth%20Test">the fifth Test</a> against <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>. The England selectors took note and, with the West Indies leading the series 4–0, Agnew and <a href="Richard%20Ellison%20%28cricketer%29">Richard Ellison</a> were given debuts, in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to avoid the "<a href="blackwash">blackwash</a>".

"Wisden" describes how in the first innings, Agnew's accuracy was affected by debutant nerves, but an improved display in the second innings resulted in figures of 2–51. Agnew describes how <a href="Ian%20Botham">Ian Botham</a> helped him secure both wickets, catching <a href="Gordon%20Greenidge">Gordon Greenidge</a> in the <a href="slip%20fielder">slips</a>, and passing on some advice on how to dismiss <a href="Viv%20Richards">Viv Richards</a>, Botham's great friend: "Botham said: 'Right. Don't pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire <a href="David%20Constant">David Constant</a> ruled that Richards was <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">LBW</a> for 15." "Wisden" called the pair of batsmen Agnew's "first illustrious victims in Test cricket".

England's next match was <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201984">a one-off home Test</a> against <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team">Sri Lanka</a> and Agnew retained his place in the England team. At the time, Sri Lanka were regarded as the minnows of world cricket: this was only their 12th Test match and their first at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, but they dominated the match, taking a 121-run lead on first innings and declaring twice. It was a disappointment for England and, in a batsman-friendly match in which the Sri Lankans racked up 785 runs for just 14 wickets, Agnew suffered. "Wisden" described England's pacemen as ineffective; Agnew's match figures were 2–177 off 43 overs. Poor performance and a muscle injury limited him to bowling a single over on the last day; later, Agnew reflected on other negative aspects of this match: "I felt a complete outsider, not part of the set-up. I think the feeling in the dressing room was that the game had been a bit of a cock-up."

England <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20India%20and%20Sri%20Lanka%20in%201984%E2%80%9385">toured India and Sri Lanka</a> that winter. Agnew replaced the injured Paul Allott after the second Test. However, he failed to be selected for a Test match, with England's decision to field two <a href="spin%20bowling">spinners</a> (<a href="Pat%20Pocock">Pat Pocock</a> and <a href="Phil%20Edmonds">Phil Edmonds</a>) in each Test playing a part in limiting Agnew's opportunities. Agnew played just one first-class match on the tour, versus South Zone in Secunderabad, achieving match figures of seven wickets at an average of 29, but he did play in three <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a>s (ODIs), two in India and one in Australia. His debut ODI was promising, as he took 3–38 in a losing cause. However, in his remaining two ODIs, he proved very expensive, taking no further wickets and conceding more than seven runs an over in each.

Agnew began the <a href="1985%20English%20cricket%20season">1985 season</a> vying with the established England fast bowlers to get back into the Test side. Over the winter, the side had been settled, with <a href="Norman%20Cowans">Norman Cowans</a> and <a href="Chris%20Cowdrey">Chris Cowdrey</a> playing all five Tests. <a href="Neil%20Foster">Neil Foster</a> and Richard Ellison shared the third spot alongside the spinners, playing two and three Tests respectively. Cowdrey and Ellison had struggled with the ball, both averaging more than 70. However, the side was extensively remodelled for the first Test of that summer's <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201985">Ashes series</a>. Of the bowlers who had played the last Test in India, only Cowans had survived the cull and it set the tone for the series. England won the first Test, yet dropped Cowans and <a href="Peter%20Willey">Peter Willey</a>, replacing them with Phil Edmonds and Foster. After losing the second Test, and struggling with the ball in the third Test, when Australia made 539 <a href="Out%20%28cricket%29">all out</a> in their only <a href="innings">innings</a>, England decided to make further changes.

Agnew had performed consistently in county cricket through June and July, culminating in what was to be, statistically, his finest moment as a bowler. Playing against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>, he took 9–70 in the first innings. His timing was perfect and he was called up for the Fourth Test at Old Trafford to partner Ian Botham and Paul Allott in an all-Cheshire born seam attack. The match finished as a draw, and Agnew failed to take a wicket. He was relegated from an <a href="Bowling%20%28cricket%29">opening bowler</a> in the first innings, to fifth bowler in the second, in which he only bowled nine overs. He was subsequently dropped again from the side, only for Richard Ellison to cement his place with match-winning performances that helped claim the Ashes for England.

In the <a href="1987%20English%20cricket%20season">1987 season</a>, Agnew achieved the feat of <a href="100%20wickets%20in%20a%20season">100 first-class wickets in an English cricket season</a> when he took 101 wickets for his county. He was the first Leicestershire player to achieve this milestone since <a href="Jack%20Birkenshaw">Jack Birkenshaw</a> in 1968, which was the season before the county programme was greatly reduced, making the feat much less common. By this stage, he was working on local radio during the winters and he found the reassurance of the additional income and career path a major factor in his improved form. "Wisden" preferred to attribute his success to "bowling off a shorter run and ... a wicked slower ball added to his armoury". The achievement led to him being selected as one of the five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketer%20of%20the%20Year">"Wisden" Cricketers of the Year</a>.

Agnew's form remained good: he followed his 1987 feat of taking the second-most wickets in the County Championship by taking the third-most in 1988. In 1989, with two years of good form behind him and England losing 4–0 in the <a href="1989%20Ashes%20series">1989 Ashes series</a>, Agnew "came frustratingly close to the recall to the England team that I had set my heart on."

County captain and friend of Agnew, <a href="David%20Gower">David Gower</a> was England captain, and a number of fast bowlers from around the country called the telephone in the Leicestershire dressing room, to tell Gower that they were injured and unavailable for the <a href="1989%20Ashes%20series%23Sixth%20Test">Sixth Test</a>. According to Agnew's account, Gower was at a loss as to whom to call into the squad.

Agnew recalls that county colleague <a href="Peter%20Willey">Peter Willey</a> made a suggestion:

"'What about Agnew?' suggested Peter Willey ... 'He's bowling pretty well at the moment.' David's face lit up. 'Of course!' he said. 'Jonathan, you're in. Go home, get your England stuff ready, and I'll call first thing tomorrow ...' Even though I was approximately the seventeenth choice, this was still fantastic news ... After three disappointing Test appearances, this was my second chance, and the opportunity to set the record straight ... [The following day] the telephone finally rang. 'Got some bad news, I'm afraid,' David began. 'I couldn't persuade <a href="Ted%20Dexter">Ted Dexter</a> or <a href="Mickey%20Stewart">Mickey Stewart</a>, so you're not in any more. They've gone for <a href="Alan%20Igglesden">Alan Igglesden</a>. Know anything about him?' With that, David must have known his influence as England captain was over – and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test. I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which had been my main motivating force. So when the "Today" newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. I might have been only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and I could easily have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on."

Agnew formally retired from playing professional cricket at the end of the following season: Leicestershire's last match of the <a href="1990%20English%20cricket%20season">1990 Championship season</a> was his last first-class game. Aged 30, Agnew took 1–42 in <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a>'s only innings and scored 6 in his only turn to bat. In 1992, two years after retirement, Leicestershire experienced an injury crisis before their <a href="NatWest%20Trophy">NatWest Trophy</a> semi-final against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>. Agnew answered a request to assist and played, finishing the match with <a href="Bowling%20analysis">figures</a> of 12–2–31–1 (bowling twelve overs, including two maiden overs, and taking one wicket for 31 runs). Leicestershire won the match and progressed to the final, but Agnew chose not to play.

Agnew's best first-class bowling figures were 9 for 70 and he took six ten-wicket hauls in 218 matches. In the 1988 Cricketer of the Year editorial on Agnew, "Wisden" noted that "his pace comes from a whippy wrist action and co-ordination ... In the field, Agnew has at times appeared to be moving with his bootlaces tied together, but his long run-up was one of the more graceful in the game. However, it was the shortening of that run-up, and a cutting-down of pace, which led to ... achievements [late in his career]"

As a batsman, Agnew had some highs, but it was his weaker suit. His highest first-class batting score was 90, starting initially as <a href="Nightwatchman%20%28cricket%29">nightwatchman</a> in 1987 against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, at <a href="North%20Marine%20Road%20Ground%2C%20Scarborough">North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough</a>. "Wisden" commented, "Agnew hit a spectacular, career-best 90 from 68 balls, including six sixes and eight fours, and then took the first five Yorkshire wickets to fall". "Wisden" commented that Agnew was no <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>, but he could "certainly bat ... on his day he can destroy anything pitched up around off stump." The same piece noted his usual playing style, "playing hard but always with a sense of fun".

Agnew reflects on his playing career as having had two periods:
"My career could be divided up into two sections: the first being when I was an out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I probably should not have done; and the second being when I slowed down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I probably should have done. His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played less than a month apart. Cricket commentator <a href="Colin%20Bateman">Colin Bateman</a> opined, "his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire". In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a "Cricketer of the Year", "Wisden" recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew's Test career: "Asked about Agnew's omission, the chairman of selectors, <a href="Peter%20May%20%28cricketer%29">P. B. H. May</a>, expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make about someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship."

Agnew began gaining experience as a journalist in 1987, while still playing cricket, when at the invitation of <a href="John%20Rawling">John Rawling</a> he took off-season employment with <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Leicester">BBC Radio Leicester</a> as a sports producer. It was during this period that he "fell in love with radio", and following his retirement, he had a short stint as chief cricket writer of "<a href="Today%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Today</a>" newspaper. While covering the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Ashes%20series">1990–91 Ashes series</a> for "Today", he was approached by <a href="Peter%20Baxter%20%28radio%20producer%29">Peter Baxter</a> about joining "<a href="Test%20Match%20Special">Test Match Special</a>". Unhappy at certain editorial decisions that had been taken during his time with the newspaper, Agnew agreed to attend an interview after the tour.

Agnew joined Test Match Special in 1991, in time for the first Test match of the summer. He was initially a junior member of the "Test Match Special" team, learning at close quarters from figures such as <a href="Brian%20Johnston">Brian Johnston</a>, <a href="Henry%20Blofeld">Henry Blofeld</a> and <a href="Bill%20Frindall">Bill Frindall</a>. The same year, he was also appointed the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s cricket correspondent, taking over from "Test Match Special" colleague, <a href="Christopher%20Martin-Jenkins">Christopher Martin-Jenkins</a>. In 2007, when asked which sports journalist he most respected, Martin-Jenkins named Agnew, because he "combines astute journalism with apparently effortless communication skills." He has also commentated for the Australian <a href="ABC%20Radio%20%28Australia%29">ABC Radio</a> network during Ashes series in Australia.

When <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> won the broadcasting rights to television coverage of England's home Test matches in 1998, Agnew was approached by the broadcaster and offered a job on the commentary team. Agnew declined the opportunity, opting to remain BBC cricket correspondent, in part because he was a "radio man" and in part out of loyalty. The following year, England hosted the <a href="1999%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1999 Cricket World Cup</a>. The BBC had the UK television rights, but with so many specialist TV cricket presenters now at Channel 4 and therefore unavailable to the BBC, Agnew was asked to present the coverage. His recollections of the experience are that it was something of a trial, helped only by the experienced <a href="Richie%20Benaud">Richie Benaud</a> alongside him:

In addition to his writing and broadcasting work, Agnew's commentary has been recorded for several computer games, including the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Captain">International Cricket Captain</a> and <a href="Brian%20Lara%20Cricket">Brian Lara Cricket</a> series. He is a shareholder in TestMatchExtra.com Ltd, a company which runs the website of the same address and acquired "<a href="The%20Wisden%20Cricketer">The Wisden Cricketer</a>" magazine from <a href="BSkyB">BSkyB</a> in December 2010.

From 2001 to 2005, Agnew provided the voice of Flynn, the oval-shaped screen, on children's gameshow "<a href="50/50%20%28children%27s%20game%20show%29">50/50</a>".

Agnew has won many awards for his broadcasting, including two <a href="Radio%20Academy%20Awards">Sony Awards</a> for Best Reporter (1992 and 1994), and Best Radio Broadcaster of the Year (2010), an award from the <a href="Association%20of%20Sports%20Journalists">Association of Sports Journalists</a>. Agnew was made an Honorary Doctor of Arts by <a href="De%20Montfort%20University">De Montfort University</a>, <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> in November 2008, and an Honorary Doctor of Letters by <a href="Loughborough%20University">Loughborough University</a> in July 2011.

His peers in sports journalism have frequently commented on Agnew's skills as a broadcaster and writer. <a href="Michael%20Henderson%20%28writer%29">Michael Henderson</a>, in the aftermath of the <a href="Allan%20Stanford%23Cricket">Stanford cricket controversy</a>, wrote of Agnew as a "master broadcaster ... the pick of the sports correspondents at the BBC ... Agnew's is a sane, reasonable voice in a game that is going potty. Fair-minded, even-tempered, he has become one of the finest specialists the BBC has ever had. In his understated way he speaks for the game: not the people who play it."

In 2016 Agnew was a member of the BBC commentary team at the <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016 Summer Olympics</a>, covering equestrian events. He earns £150,000 – £199,999 as a BBC sports correspondent.

Agnew was appointed as a <a href="Deputy%20Lieutenant">Deputy Lieutenant</a> of Leicestershire in October 2015, and as a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting.

In 2001, Agnew was part of the BBC team that was sent to <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> to cover <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Sri%20Lanka%20in%202000-01">England's Test match series</a>. As a result of confusion and a row over broadcasting rights, the BBC team found itself barred from the <a href="Galle%20International%20Stadium">Galle International Stadium</a>, where the first Test was to take place. Agnew and <a href="Pat%20Murphy%20%28sports%20journalist%29">Pat Murphy</a> refused to be defeated and "decamped to the fort ramparts overlooking the ground and broadcast their programme from there. With both team and equipment protected from the sun by an umbrella held by Mr Agnew's driver, Simmons, it made a colourful scene." The <a href="England%20and%20Wales%20Cricket%20Board">England and Wales Cricket Board</a> (ECB) chief executive, <a href="Tim%20Lamb">Tim Lamb</a> became involved in discussions and the "Test Match Special" team were allowed to return to the ground.

"<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" called Agnew and Murphy's effort, "new heights of ingenuity". Agnew's reaction to the event was, "It's a sad day for everyone involved in English cricket. Is it really that cricket is getting so greedy that everyone who wants to come and report on the game for the good of the game is going to have to be charged for it?" However, he remained upbeat about the situation: "Actually I get rather more of a panoramic view of it from up here than I did yesterday in my commentary box. There's a little road that runs round the back of the ground. All manner of people are trundling up and down – buses, bikes and little three wheeled <a href="tuk-tuk">tuk-tuk</a>s – it's rather fun."

In 2004, the Zimbabwe government banned media from following the <a href="History%20of%20cricket%20in%20Zimbabwe%20from%201992%20to%202006%23England%202004-05">England cricket team tour of the country</a>. Agnew's reaction was combative, appearing on <a href="BBC%20Breakfast">BBC Breakfast</a> and giving his opinion that the ban presented the ECB with a chance to withdraw from the controversial tour and that they should take the opportunity.

In the summer of 2008, then England captain <a href="Michael%20Vaughan">Michael Vaughan</a> reacted testily on-air to questions by Agnew about his batting form. When Vaughan resigned shortly thereafter, <a href="Mike%20Atherton">Mike Atherton</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", commented that it had been an out-of-character outburst that was a portent of the resignation. When Atherton had himself been England captain, Agnew had led the calls for Atherton to resign over a controversy known as the <a href="Ball%20tampering%23Michael%20Atherton%20in%201994">"dirt in the pocket"</a> affair. Fellow BBC commentator <a href="Jack%20Bannister">Jack Bannister</a> felt that Agnew's comments were inappropriate, but only to the extent that he had referred to his friendship with Atherton: Bannister advised Agnew that he should continue to be honest and forthright as a reporter.

Agnew was involved in a minor controversy regarding an appearance by <a href="Lily%20Allen">Lily Allen</a> on "Test Match Special" in 2009. "The Daily Telegraph" reported that "the cricket-loving Allen struck up an instant rapport with Agnew, and the BBC received largely positive feedback for the 30-minute interview", but <a href="Will%20Buckley%20%28journalist%29">Will Buckley</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", described Agnew's "amorous ambitions" as "positioned ... firmly on the pervy side of things". Agnew was furious, noting he "gave ... Will Buckley 24 hrs to apologise for calling me a pervert, and he has declined ... As you can imagine, I have taken being called a pervert quite badly." Allen herself supported Agnew: "[I] really think this Will Buckley guy should apologise to ... [Agnew], he was nothing but kind and gentlemanly to me during our interview. I don't know 1 person that agrees with The Observer on this one." Buckley eventually apologised.

Agnew has been known to laugh at or include occasional sexual innuendo while on air. The most notable of these occurrences took place in August 1991, when Agnew was commentating with <a href="Brian%20Johnston">Brian Johnston</a>. In a review of the day, Johnston was describing how <a href="Ian%20Botham">Ian Botham</a>, while batting, had overbalanced and tried, but failed, to step over his stumps. Botham was consequently given out <a href="hit%20wicket">hit wicket</a>. Agnew's comment on this action was: "He just didn't quite get his leg over." Botham had attracted a number of headlines during his career for his sexual exploits and in <a href="British%20English">British English</a>, "<a href="wikt%3Aget%20one%27s%20leg%20over">getting one's leg over</a>" is a euphemism for having <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>.

The comment led to "Johnston, a lover of schoolboy innuendo to rival <a href="Frankie%20Howerd">Frankie Howerd</a>, erupting in a <a href="Krakatoa">Krakatoa</a> of snorts, whimpers, sneezes and, finally, uncontrollable laughter." Johnston tried to continue his summary, despite being almost unable to speak for laughing. He did manage to say "Aggers, for goodness' sake, stop it" between convulsions of mirth.

The incident was heard by thousands of commuters driving home from work, many of whom were forced to stop driving because they were laughing so much: a two-mile traffic jam at the entrance to the <a href="Dartford%20Tunnel">Dartford Tunnel</a> was reportedly caused by drivers unable to pay the toll due to laughter. Fourteen years later, in 2005, Agnew's line, "Just didn't quite get his leg over" was voted "the greatest sporting commentary of all time" by listeners to BBC Radio 5 Live. The other eight finalists included <a href="Kenneth%20Wolstenholme">Kenneth Wolstenholme</a>'s "<a href="They%20think%20it%27s%20all%20over">They think it's all over</a> – it is now!" and <a href="Ian%20Robertson%20%28rugby%20commentator%29">Ian Robertson</a>'s "This is the one. He drops for World Cup glory ... It's up! It's over! He's done it! <a href="Jonny%20Wilkinson">Jonny Wilkinson</a> is England's hero yet again". Agnew and Johnston secured 78% of the votes.

Agnew's first marriage was to Beverley in 1983; it ended in divorce in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played in the collapse of the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman <a href="Graham%20Thorpe">Graham Thorpe</a>. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five ... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away for months at a time each and every winter? ... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour ... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer." Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.

Agnew suffers from <a href="Dupuytren%27s%20contracture">Dupuytren's contracture</a>, a medical condition that affects the connective tissue in his hands. He has had numerous operations to address the progressive condition, which causes the hands to contract into a claw-like position.

During Agnew's playing career, a dispute with team-mate <a href="Phillip%20DeFreitas">Phillip DeFreitas</a> attracted media attention: when DeFreitas poured salt over Agnew's lunch, Agnew responded by throwing DeFreitas' cricket bag and kit from the dressing room balcony. Former England cricketer <a href="Derek%20Pringle">Derek Pringle</a> has written about Agnew's sense of humour, describing him as "hysterical". The pair toured Sri Lanka together on <a href="England%20Lions%20cricket%20team">England B</a>'s 1986 tour. Pringle recalls that one hot day when England were in the field, Agnew came in for lunch: "It's ****ing red hot on the field, and when you come off it's ****ing red hot in the dressing-room," Agnew screamed. "Then, what do you get for lunch, ****ing red hot curry?"

It was reported in various newspapers in 2013 that Agnew had offered to accompany Brian Dodds, his second wife’s ex-husband, to the <a href="Dignitas%20%28assisted%20dying%20organisation%29">Dignitas</a> assisted suicide clinic in <a href="Zurich">Zurich</a> after Dodds was diagnosed with <a href="motor%20neurone%20disease">motor neurone disease</a>. Dodds died in England from the disease in 2005.

Agnew has written four books:
