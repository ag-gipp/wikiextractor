André Messager

André Charles Prosper Messager (; 30 December 1853 – 24 February 1929) was a French composer, organist, pianist and conductor. His compositions include eight ballets and thirty <a href="op%C3%A9ra%20comique">opéras comiques</a>, <a href="op%C3%A9rette">opérette</a>s and other stage works, among which his ballet "<a href="Les%20Deux%20Pigeons%20%28ballet%29">Les Deux Pigeons</a>" (1886) and opéra comique "<a href="V%C3%A9ronique%20%28operetta%29">Véronique</a>" (1898) have had lasting success; "<a href="Les%20p%27tites%20Michu">Les P'tites Michu</a>" (1897) and "<a href="Monsieur%20Beaucaire%20%28opera%29">Monsieur Beaucaire</a>" (1919) were also popular internationally.

Messager took up the piano as a small child and later studied composition with, among others, <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a> and <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a>. He became a major figure in the musical life of Paris and later London, both as a conductor and a composer. Many of his Parisian works were also produced in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> and some on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>; the most successful had long runs and numerous international revivals. He wrote two operatic works in English, and his later output included <a href="Musical%20theatre%23Early%2020th%20century">musical comedies</a> for <a href="Sacha%20Guitry">Sacha Guitry</a> and <a href="Yvonne%20Printemps">Yvonne Printemps</a>.

As a conductor, Messager held prominent positions in Paris and London, at the head of the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>, the <a href="Paris%20Opera">Paris Opéra</a>, the <a href="Orchestre%20de%20la%20Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20des%20Concerts%20du%20Conservatoire">Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire</a>, and the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a>, Covent Garden. Although as a composer he is known chiefly for his light works, as a conductor he presented a wide range of operas, from <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> to <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>, and he acquired a reputation as a conductor of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>. In Paris he conducted the world premieres of <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>'s "<a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28opera%29">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>", <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet's</a> "<a href="Gris%C3%A9lidis">Grisélidis</a>" and <a href="Gustave%20Charpentier">Charpentier</a>'s "<a href="Louise%20%28opera%29">Louise</a>". At Covent Garden, he gave the British premieres of operas by Saint-Saëns and Massenet.

Messager's music became known for its melodic and orchestral invention, musical craftsmanship, and characteristically French elegance and grace. Although most of his works have been infrequently revived, historians of music consider him the last major figure in French opéra comique and opérette.

Messager was born at <a href="Montlu%C3%A7on">Montluçon</a> in central France on 30 December 1853, the son of Paul-Philippe-Émile Messager, a prosperous local tax collector, and his wife Sophie-Cornélie, "née" Lhôte de Selancy. He recalled, "You would not find any musicians among my ancestors. When very young I learned the piano; but later on my intentions to become a composer met with such opposition from my father". At the age of seven he was sent as a boarder to a <a href="Marist%20Brothers">Marist</a> school where he continued his interest in the piano.

Towards the end of the 1860s disastrous stock-market speculation brought Messager's family financial ruin and they could no longer afford to keep him at the Marist school. They dropped their objection to music as a profession, viewing a post as a church organist as a respectable and steady career. He was awarded a bursary to study at the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Niedermeyer%20de%20Paris">École Niedermeyer</a> in Paris, an academy known for its focus on church music. This was at the time of the <a href="Paris%20Commune">Paris Commune</a> (1871), and to escape the violence in the city the school was temporarily evacuated to Switzerland. Messager studied piano with Adam Lausset, organ with <a href="Cl%C3%A9ment%20Loret">Clément Loret</a>, and composition with <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Gigout">Eugène Gigout</a>, <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a> and (after leaving Niedermeyer's school) <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a>. The musicologist <a href="Jean-Michel%20Nectoux">Jean-Michel Nectoux</a> comments that after his studies Messager developed into one of the finest orchestrators of the period.

Fauré and Messager quickly moved from being master and pupil to being firm friends and occasional collaborators. In 1874 Messager succeeded Fauré as "organiste du chœur" (choir organist) at <a href="%C3%89glise%20Saint-Sulpice%2C%20Paris">Saint-Sulpice</a>, Paris, under the principal organist, <a href="Charles-Marie%20Widor">Charles-Marie Widor</a>. In 1876 he won the gold medal of the Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique with a symphony, the work being warmly received when performed by the <a href="Concerts%20Colonne">Concerts Colonne</a> at the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20du%20Ch%C3%A2telet">Théâtre du Châtelet</a> in January 1878. He won further prizes for his <a href="cantata">cantata</a>s "Don Juan et Haydée" and "Prométhée enchaîné".

In 1879 Fauré and Messager travelled to <a href="Cologne%20Opera">Cologne</a> to see <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s "<a href="Das%20Rheingold">Das Rheingold</a>" and "<a href="Die%20Walk%C3%BCre">Die Walküre</a>", and later to <a href="Bavarian%20State%20Opera">Munich</a> for the complete "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Ring</a>" cycle, "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger%20von%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg</a>" and "<a href="Tannh%C3%A4user%20%28opera%29">Tannhäuser</a>"; in 1888 they went to <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth</a> for "Die Meistersinger" and "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>". They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent "Souvenirs de Bayreuth" (c. 1888). This short, skittish piano work for four hands burlesques motifs from "The Ring". The two composers had a more serious collaboration, their "<a href="Messe%20des%20p%C3%AAcheurs%20de%20Villerville">Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville</a>" (1881).

In 1878 Messager was appointed conductor at the <a href="Folies%20Berg%C3%A8re">Folies Bergère</a>, and he began his career composing for the stage with two short ballets, "Fleur d'oranger" (1878) and "Les Vins de France" (1879). In 1880 a former manager of the Folies, M. Comy, was appointed to run the new Eden Théâtre in Brussels. At his invitation, Messager resigned from the Folies in 1880 and became conductor of the Eden. He returned to Paris in 1881 as organist of <a href="Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis">Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis</a> church, and from 1882 to 1884 he was organist and choirmaster at Ste Marie-des-<a href="Batignolles">Batignolles</a>, a small church in the north west of Paris, where his assistant was another young composer, <a href="Claude%20Terrasse">Claude Terrasse</a>.

Messager's career took a new turn in 1883 when the composer <a href="Firmin%20Bernicat">Firmin Bernicat</a> died leaving an unfinished <a href="op%C3%A9rette">opérette</a>, "<a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20les%20bas-bleus">François les bas-bleus</a>". Messager was invited to complete it; he orchestrated the entire work and composed between twelve and fifteen numbers. It was staged in November 1883 at the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20des%20Folies-Dramatiques">Théâtre des Folies-Dramatiques</a> and was an immediate critical and popular success. It was later produced in London and New York. In 1883, while deputising for Saint-Saëns as the soloist at a concert in <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a>, Messager met a young woman, Edith Clouette, whom he married in the same year. Fauré played the organ at the ceremony, and composed a mildly cynical song, "<a href="Madrigal%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Madrigal</a>", as a wedding present. There was one child of the marriage, Jean André Emile Charles (1886–1952).

In December 1883 Messager and <a href="Emmanuel%20Chabrier">Emmanuel Chabrier</a> gave the first performance of the latter's "<a href="Trois%20valses%20romantiques">Trois valses romantiques</a>" at the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20de%20Musique">Société Nationale de Musique</a>. The concert also included the premiere of the two-piano version of "<a href="Espa%C3%B1a%20%28Chabrier%29">España</a>", arranged by Messager. Messager and Chabrier were close friends until the latter's death in 1894. Both were known for their comic operas and opérettes, but Chabrier's one serious opera, "<a href="Gwendoline%20%28opera%29">Gwendoline</a>", appealed strongly to Messager, who vowed to conduct it in Paris, which he later did. He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the vocal score of the work.

Following the success of "François les bas-bleus" Messager accepted simultaneous invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an opérette for the Folies-Dramatiques. The opérette, "<a href="La%20fauvette%20du%20temple">La Fauvette du temple</a>", first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's early reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, and he was able to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891. The ballet, "<a href="Les%20Deux%20Pigeons%20%28ballet%29">Les Deux Pigeons</a>", which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police, and the production was temporarily shelved.

A month after the opening of "La Fauvette du temple" the Bouffes-Parisiens premiered Messager's opéra comique "<a href="La%20B%C3%A9arnaise">La Béarnaise</a>", with <a href="Jeanne%20Granier">Jeanne Granier</a> in the title role. It ran for three months and was successfully produced in Britain the following year with a cast including <a href="Florence%20St.%20John">Florence St. John</a> and <a href="Marie%20Tempest">Marie Tempest</a>, running for more than 200 performances. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" said of this production that it gave Messager a secure footing in London, which led to important results later in his career. A production of "La Béarnaise" in New York followed in 1887, under the title "Jacquette".

In 1886 "Les Deux Pigeons" was finally produced at the Paris Opéra and was a box office triumph. It was Messager's last popular success for four years. His attempt at a more serious opera, "<a href="Le%20bourgeois%20de%20Calais">Le Bourgeois de Calais</a>" (1888), was not well received. <a href="Richard%20Traubner">Richard Traubner</a> remarks in "Operetta: A Theatrical History" on its "boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score"; a contemporary critic wrote, "That "Le Bourgeois de Calais" will have a successful career there is not the faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering in the world could not make it an attractive piece." Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale, "<a href="Isoline%20%28opera%29">Isoline</a>" (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act opérette, "<a href="Le%20mari%20de%20la%20reine">Le Mari de la reine</a>" (1889), which failed, although Messager thought it "the best of my flops".

Messager's fortunes revived in 1890 with "<a href="La%20Basoche">La Basoche</a>", produced with much success at the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>. The critic who had pronounced so unfavourably on "Le Bourgeois de Calais" wrote of the new piece, "an exceptionally pleasing work ... a dainty piece which cannot fail to obtain widespread popularity." An English-language version was produced in London in 1891 by <a href="Richard%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a>. The theatrical newspaper "<a href="The%20Era%20%28newspaper%29">The Era</a>" said, ""The Basoche" is more than a success; it is a triumph", but the piece had only a modest London run of three months. A New York production was given in 1893 but was not a success.

Messager was a dandy and a philanderer. The musical historian <a href="D.%20Kern%20Holoman">D. Kern Holoman</a> describes him as "given to immaculately tailored suits emphasizing his thin frame, careful grooming with particular attention to his mustaches, fine jewelry, and spats ... a witty conversationalist with an inexhaustible store of anecdotes and "bons mots"" and a womaniser. In the early 1890s Edith Messager, tired of her husband's infidelities, divorced him. Shortly afterwards she became ill; her condition deteriorated, and Messager visited her daily. By the time of her death in 1892 the two had become close again, and Messager felt her loss deeply.

In 1892 Messager's career as a conductor began to advance when he was invited to conduct "Die Walküre" at <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>. As a composer the early 1890s brought him mixed fortunes. "<a href="Madame%20Chrysanth%C3%A8me%20%28opera%29">Madame Chrysanthème</a>", staged at the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20de%20la%20Renaissance">Théâtre de la Renaissance</a> in 1893, was a setting of <a href="Pierre%20Loti">Pierre Loti</a>'s story of a betrayed <a href="geisha">geisha</a>, a theme that later inspired Puccini's "<a href="Madama%20Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a>"; it was politely rather than enthusiastically received. "<a href="Mirette%20%28opera%29">Mirette</a>", produced by Carte at the <a href="Savoy%20Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a> in 1894, was Messager's first opera written expressly for the London stage and was the only original <a href="Savoy%20opera">Savoy opera</a> by a French composer. To assist him in what was for him (at the time) an unfamiliar idiom, Messager enlisted the help of the songwriter Dotie (Alice Maude) Davis (1859–1938), known professionally as <a href="Hope%20Temple">Hope Temple</a>. She became Messager's second wife in 1895. According to <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>, Messager, concluding from the reception of "La Basoche" in London that it was unwise to offer the British public anything too intelligent, decided that the new opera was going to be as commonplace as possible. It ran for 41 performances, was withdrawn and revised, and then ran for another 61 performances. Messager vetoed any production in Paris. His next opera, a serious work, "<a href="Le%20chevalier%20d%27Harmental%20%28opera%29">Le Chevalier d'Harmental</a>" (1896), was unsuccessful, and for a while he and his new wife withdrew to the English countryside near <a href="Maidenhead">Maidenhead</a>, <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>.
From 1897 Messager's career revived. He later recalled that he had received by post an unsolicited libretto:

This was the opérette "<a href="Les%20P%27tites%20Michu">Les P'tites Michu</a>", which was presented to great acclaim at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Its 1905 English adaptation in London ran for 401 performances. Soon afterwards he was appointed musical director of the Opéra-Comique, and in the commercial theatre had another outstanding success with "<a href="V%C3%A9ronique%20%28operetta%29">Véronique</a>" (1898).

In 1898 Messager's only child from his second marriage, Madeleine Hope Andrée (d. 1986) was born. From that year to 1904 Messager's work at the Opéra-Comique left him little time for composition, particularly after 1901, when he also spent May to July at the Royal Opera House in London. He turned down <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>'s offer of a collaboration, and wrote only two stage works between 1898 and 1914. His international fame as a composer nevertheless grew, with productions of "Les P'tites Michu" and "Véronique" in countries including Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and the US. Unusually for the London stage at the time, "Véronique" was given in French in 1903. An English translation was staged the following year and ran for 496 performances. Messager conducted the first nights of both productions. The English version was staged in New York the following year, running for 81 performances.

At the Opéra-Comique, Messager conducted the premieres of <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet's</a> "<a href="Gris%C3%A9lidis">Grisélidis</a>" and <a href="Gustave%20Charpentier">Charpentier</a>'s "<a href="Louise%20%28opera%29">Louise</a>", and gave the first French performances of operas as contrasted as "<a href="Hansel%20and%20Gretel%20%28opera%29">Hansel and Gretel</a>" and "<a href="Tosca">Tosca</a>". But by far the best known of his premieres was <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>'s "<a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28opera%29">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>" (1902). Messager encouraged the composer to complete the opera and worked closely with him in getting the orchestration ready for the premiere. In gratitude Debussy dedicated the work to Messager. Holoman writes, "his championing of "Pelléas et Mélisande" alone would have earned him a place in music history." Debussy regarded Messager as the ideal conductor. Before the premiere he had trusted him to "make his dream into a reality"; after it he praised him for knowing "how to awaken the inner sound world of "Pelléas" with tender delicacy". After Messager's commitments obliged him to leave Paris for London, Debussy found the performances much less satisfactory. As a conductor, Messager won praise on both sides of the English Channel. The English music critic <a href="Francis%20Toye">Francis Toye</a> wrote that, good though <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>'s conducting of "Pelléas et Mélisande" was at <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a> in Milan, Messager's was still better. The Parisian critic <a href="Pierre%20Lalo">Pierre Lalo</a> said of Messager:

From 1901 to 1907 Messager was one of the directors of the Grand Opera Syndicate, which ran the annual seasons at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House%2C%20Covent%20Garden">Royal Opera House, Covent Garden</a>, featuring the leading singers of the day, including <a href="Nellie%20Melba">Nellie Melba</a> and <a href="Enrico%20Caruso">Enrico Caruso</a>. Much of his time was spent on administration, and he had limited scope for conducting. From 1901, for two years, Messager had an affair with the Scottish soprano <a href="Mary%20Garden">Mary Garden</a>, whom he met at the Opéra-Comique and conducted when she took over the title role of "Louise". She also appeared in a revival of his "Madame Chrysanthème". His first appearance as a conductor at Covent Garden was in 1902 for the first performance of "Princess Osra" by <a href="Herbert%20Bunning">Herbert Bunning</a>. He next conducted there in 1904 in the British premiere of Saint-Saëns's "<a href="H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne%20%28opera%29">Hélène</a>", followed in 1905 by "<a href="Carmen">Carmen</a>", "<a href="Don%20Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a>", "<a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a>", the world première of <a href="Franco%20Leoni">Franco Leoni</a>'s "L'oracolo", "<a href="Orfeo%20ed%20Euridice">Orphée et Euridice</a>" and "<a href="Rom%C3%A9o%20et%20Juliette">Roméo et Juliette</a>"; in his final year, 1906, he conducted "<a href="Armide%20%28Gluck%29">Armide</a>", "Carmen", "Don Giovanni", "Faust", the British premiere of "<a href="Le%20jongleur%20de%20Notre-Dame">Le Jongleur de Notre-Dame</a>", and "Roméo et Juliette". In 1906 he also introduced to Covent Garden his ballet "Les Deux Pigeons." Despite his reputation as a Wagnerian, he yielded the baton for Wagner performances to <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a>, widely regarded as the world's foremost exponent of Wagner's music. In 1906 Messager and the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a> travelled to Paris to play a programme of English music at the Châtelet Theatre, including works by <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sullivan</a>, <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Parry</a> and <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Stanford</a>. When he left Covent Garden in 1907, the directors found it necessary to appoint two people to fill his place: Neil Forsyth as general manager and <a href="Percy%20Pitt">Percy Pitt</a> as musical director.
In 1907 Messager returned to composition. His "comédie lyrique" "<a href="Fortunio%20%28opera%29">Fortunio</a>" was presented at the Opéra-Comique with great success. In the same year he was appointed joint director of the Paris Opéra, responsible for the artistic direction, with Frederick Broussan, formerly director of the Lyons Opera, taking charge of administration. The partnership lasted until 1913, but its success was hampered by shortage of funds and internal disputes. Messager decided on a policy of making the Opéra "more genuinely French". He revived <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Rameau</a>'s "<a href="Hippolyte%20et%20Aricie">Hippolyte et Aricie</a>", for the first time in Paris since 1767, and presented unusual French repertoire including Fauré's "Pénélope". Foreign opera was not neglected; Messager gave Paris its first complete "Ring" cycle, presented a Russian season starring <a href="F%C3%A9lia%20Litvinne">Félia Litvinne</a> and <a href="Feodor%20Chaliapin">Feodor Chaliapin</a>, and conducted the French premiere of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s "<a href="Salome%20%28opera%29">Salome</a>". At the invitation of the Emperor <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II</a>, Messager and Broussan took the Opéra company to Berlin in 1908. Relations between the two co-directors were not always harmonious; after the French government refused Messager's resignation on at least one occasion, he finally announced it in November 1913, a year before his term of office was due to expire. He consented to return in January 1914 to conduct "Parsifal" – its first performance in Europe outside Bayreuth. His conducting of the work won critical praise.

On the strength of his experience as a Wagnerian, Messager was appointed conductor of the <a href="Orchestre%20de%20la%20Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20des%20Concerts%20du%20Conservatoire">Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire</a> in 1908. It was at the time, and for many years, the most prestigious symphony orchestra in France, and Messager was determined that it should enjoy the international prestige of the <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic">Vienna</a> and <a href="Berlin%20Philharmonic">Berlin Philharmonic</a> Orchestras. Alongside the main orchestral repertoire of <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> and French classics, Messager conducted major choral works by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">J. S. Bach</a>, <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>, <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a> and <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>, as well as introducing early French music such as that of <a href="Cl%C3%A9ment%20Janequin">Janequin</a>. In the 1913–14 season, he conducted a chronological cycle of Beethoven's symphonies and his "<a href="Missa%20solemnis%20%28Beethoven%29">Missa solemnis</a>", as well as <a href="Requiem%20%28Verdi%29">Verdi's "Requiem"</a>, for the Italian composer's centenary. Messager took the orchestra outside Paris to Lille, Lyon and Antwerp during these years. During the First World War he took the orchestra on tour to Argentina (1916), Switzerland (1917), and the US and Canada (1918–19), giving concerts in more than 50 cities. After their concert at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera%20House%20%2839th%20Street%29">Metropolitan Opera House</a> in October 1918, the orchestra and Messager received a prolonged ovation that was typical of their reception as the tour progressed. At the end of that tour Messager retired from his post.

Messager was criticised for performing the music of Wagner during the war, but he maintained that German music represented the noble side of the enemy nation's nature. Like Fauré, Messager refused to have anything to do with the National League for the Defence of French Music (La Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française), led by Saint-Saëns, which sought to boycott German music.

In 1914 Messager composed "Béatrice", described as a "légende lyrique", based on the 1911 play "<a href="The%20Miracle%20%28play%29">The Miracle</a>". The premiere was in <a href="Monte%20Carlo">Monte Carlo</a>. The work was performed in Paris in 1917 but was not successful. In 1915 Messager joined with other musicians in contributing compositions to "King Albert's Book" to raise money for "the relief of the suffering Belgian people"; the other composers included Debussy, <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>, <a href="Pietro%20Mascagni">Mascagni</a> and Saint-Saëns.
In 1919 Messager's operetta "<a href="Monsieur%20Beaucaire%20%28opera%29">Monsieur Beaucaire</a>" was premiered in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> prior to a long run in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>. The composer, who generally conducted British premieres of his works, was suffering from sciatica and could not even be in the audience for the first nights in either city. The work received its Paris premiere at the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20Marigny">Théâtre Marigny</a> in 1925, and it ran for 143 performances on Broadway. Later in 1919 Messager resumed the musical directorship of the Opéra-Comique for the 1919–20 season, conducting among other works the first complete performance in France of "<a href="Cos%C3%AC%20fan%20tutte">Così fan tutte</a>".

In the 1920s, Messager kept pace with the change in fashion in musical theatre, consciously absorbing the styles of musical comedy, lightening his orchestration, but maintaining a Gallic flavour, mostly avoiding American dance-rhythm influences. He collaborated with <a href="Sacha%20Guitry">Sacha Guitry</a> on the musical comedies "<a href="L%27amour%20masqu%C3%A9">L'Amour masqué</a>" (1923) and "Deburau" (1926), starring <a href="Yvonne%20Printemps">Yvonne Printemps</a>. The former was a considerable success in Paris, but in London the official censor, the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain%23Theatre%20censorship">Lord Chamberlain</a>, declared it "unfit for the English public", and banned <a href="C.%20B.%20Cochran">C. B. Cochran</a>'s planned production starring Printemps and Guitry. In Messager's late stage works his lighter touch was balanced by echoes of the nineteenth century, with hints of Fauré and, particularly, Chabrier's "<a href="L%27%C3%A9toile%20%28opera%29">L'Étoile</a>". Fauré, by 1923 too frail and deaf to go to the theatre, was lent a copy of the score of "L'Amour masqué" and wrote to Messager, "Your wit is the same as always – it never grows old – and so are your charm and very personal brand of music that always remains exquisite even amid the broadest clowning". Fauré died the following year, and Messager dedicated the music of "Deburau" to his memory.

In 1924 <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a> persuaded Messager to conduct the Paris premieres of <a href="Georges%20Auric">Auric</a>'s ballet "Les Fâcheux" and <a href="Francis%20Poulenc">Poulenc</a>'s "<a href="Les%20biches">Les Biches</a>". In 1928 Messager played a key role in establishing important updates to copyright law, though he was on the losing side of the case. He sued the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> for breach of copyright for broadcasting his works without his consent. He lost because he had assigned his British performing rights to <a href="George%20Edwardes">George Edwardes</a>, whose estate had given the BBC permission for the broadcast. The case established that as the broadcasting rights had not been specifically reserved, the Edwardes estate's rights included them.

After a short illness Messager died in Paris on 24 February 1929 aged 75. He was interred in the <a href="Passy%20Cemetery">Passy Cemetery</a> near the graves of Debussy and Fauré. His last completed work, the opérette "<a href="Coups%20de%20roulis">Coups de roulis</a>", was running in Paris when he died. A contemporary critic commented, "Its tuneful melodies show that the veteran composer had lost nothing of the qualities that made "Véronique" such a success. Throughout his life Messager remained without a peer as a composer of light music."

Messager was elected President of the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20des%20Auteurs%20et%20Compositeurs%20Dramatiques">Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques</a> in 1926, the first composer to hold this office. In the same year he was elected to the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20Beaux-Arts">Académie des Beaux-Arts</a>. In 1927 he was appointed Commander of the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>. In his native town of Montluçon, the music academy, opened in 2009, is named in his honour. In 2003, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, Messager was the subject of a large exhibition at the Musée des musiques populaires de Montluçon, recounting his biography and illustrating his works in the various genres. Among the "comité d'honneur" of the exhibition were the composer's three grandchildren, and the singers <a href="Susan%20Graham">Susan Graham</a>, <a href="Felicity%20Lott">Dame Felicity Lott</a> and <a href="Mady%20Mespl%C3%A9">Mady Mesplé</a>, the conductors <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">Sir John Eliot Gardiner</a>, <a href="John%20Nelson%20%28conductor%29">John Nelson</a> and <a href="Michel%20Plasson">Michel Plasson</a>, and the director <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Savary">Jérôme Savary</a>.

In his 1991 study of Messager, John Wagstaff writes that the composer's music is notable for its fine orchestration, easy-flowing melody, and skilfully written music, dance-like in character. Unlike his teacher Fauré, Messager enjoyed orchestrating. He said that musical ideas came to him "already clothed in the appropriate instrumental shades", and after the concentrated effort of composing his scores he found it relaxing to work on "the handling of instruments, the balancing of different sonorities, the grouping of colours and the structuring of effects". He remarked that composers who had their music orchestrated by assistants presumably did not care if their helpers lacked "that indefinable sixth sense which would indicate the right combination of sonorities to carry out the original intentions of the composer". To Messager, passages often depended for their significance or flavour on the orchestral writing alone.

<a href="Gervase%20Hughes">Gervase Hughes</a>, in a study of French opérette, comments that Messager's only technical defect was "one all too common to many composers of operetta – too close an adherence to repetitive rhythmic figures and four-bar rigidity", although such was Messager's "innate artistry that criticism on that score would be academic pedantry". One of the composer's distinguishing characteristics was a liking for <a href="chromaticism">chromaticism</a>; this appealed to a younger generation of composers. His "Eh que ne parliez-vous?", from "La Basoche", was quoted note-for-note by <a href="Francis%20Poulenc">Poulenc</a> in "<a href="Les%20Mamelles%20de%20Tir%C3%A9sias">Les Mamelles de Tirésias</a>". Although Messager greatly admired Wagner, and was a celebrated conductor of his music, he distanced himself from Wagnerian influences in his own compositions. In "Madame Chrysanthème" he made use of <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s, and included other references to Wagner, but such examples are rare in his works.

Unlike some older contemporaries such as Saint-Saëns and <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet</a>, Messager remained open to new ideas and idioms throughout his life, and his style evolved to match the spirit of the times. His biographer and former pupil Henry Février commented that from classic <a href="op%C3%A9ra%20comique">opéras comiques</a>, such as "La Basoche", Messager's later works, such as "<a href="Les%20P%27tites%20Michu">Les P'tites Michu</a>" and "Véronique", show a difference in style, "bringing an altogether fresher approach to the genre." Towards the end of his career Messager successfully moved to "comédie musical", the French form of <a href="Musical%20theatre%23Early%2020th%20century">musical comedy</a>.
Ballets apart, Messager composed thirty works for the stage; they fall into several different, or sometimes overlapping, genres; the most numerous are opéras comiques (9), opérettes (7) and comédies musicales (3). The composer remarked late in his career:

Although Messager called some of his early stage works opéras comiques they have, Gervase Hughes suggests, more in common with opérette than their composer acknowledged. Nevertheless, Messager introduced adventurous modern harmonic details in his early pieces, and strove to raise the artistic standards of opérette to that of opéra comique while retaining the essential panache of the genre. Hughes finds the first stage works uneven in quality but "<a href="La%20fauvette%20du%20temple">La Fauvette du temple</a>" (1884) to contain two fine expressive duets as well as waltzes and polkas with "an Offenbach lilt". Hughes judges the next two scores, "<a href="La%20B%C3%A9arnaise">La Béarnaise</a>" and "La Fauvette" (both 1885), less satisfying but nonetheless at least as good as anything by Messager's older contemporaries <a href="Robert%20Planquette">Planquette</a>, <a href="Gaston%20Serpette">Serpette</a> and <a href="Charles%20Lecocq">Lecocq</a>.

Wagstaff writes that the composer's most enduring work is the ballet score "<a href="Les%20Deux%20Pigeons%20%28ballet%29">Les Deux Pigeons</a>" (1886). The piece is based on the fable "<a href="The%20Two%20Pigeons">The Two Pigeons</a>" by <a href="Jean%20de%20La%20Fontaine">Jean de La Fontaine</a>. The music is best known in the five-movement suite arranged from the full score, which includes the "Entrée de tziganes". Messager revived the ballet in 1906 in London and in 1912 in Paris in a shortened, two-act version. In 1961 <a href="John%20Lanchbery">John Lanchbery</a> revised this for <a href="Frederick%20Ashton">Frederick Ashton</a>'s new version of the ballet, with a closing reconciliation scene from earlier music and a passage transcribed from "Véronique". This was first given at Covent Garden, is revived regularly by the <a href="Royal%20Ballet">Royal Ballet</a> and has been staged by such other companies as <a href="CAPAB">CAPAB</a> and <a href="Australian%20Ballet">Australian Ballet</a>.

"<a href="Isoline%20%28opera%29">Isoline</a>" (1888), a musical fairy story ("conte des fées"), is neither an opérette nor an opéra comique. Writing in 1908, Fauré called it "one of the most poetic, most expressive works that have been written in France in the last twenty years", but it made little impact. The score remained in obscurity until 1930 when <a href="Reynaldo%20Hahn">Reynaldo Hahn</a> staged the ballet section of the work at Cannes. The whole piece was revived at the Opéra-Comique in 1958; it failed again, but the ballet, unencumbered by the portentousness of the libretto, which weighs down the rest of the piece, has remained in the repertory.

The decade began well for Messager with the artistic and commercial success of "<a href="La%20Basoche">La Basoche</a>" (1890). Février in his "André Messager: Mon Maître, Mon Ami" calls it "the last of the great nineteenth-century French comic operas" ("le dernier des grands opéras-comique français du XIX siècle") and considers it of the greatest importance not only in Messager's career but in the history of French musical theatre. Hughes says it has a good claim to be the composer's masterpiece. The musicologist <a href="James%20Harding%20%28music%20writer%29">James Harding</a> rates it "the best Messager had written to date ... one of his finest works". When the work was given in London, a year after its Parisian premiere, the reviewer in "The Times" called it, "A work of great beauty and charm", although "the influence of "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger">Die Meistersinger</a>" is felt to an extent that is almost absurd both in the bright overture and again in the procession of the guild, but elsewhere the music is as original as it is charming".

With "<a href="Madame%20Chrysanth%C3%A8me%20%28opera%29">Madame Chrysanthème</a>" (1893), a four-act "lyric comedy" with no spoken dialogue, Messager reached a turning point in his development. The crux of the plot was the same as that later used by <a href="Giacomo%20Puccini">Puccini</a> for "<a href="Madama%20Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a>" (1904): a young Japanese <a href="geisha">geisha</a> wooed and then abandoned by a foreign sailor. Messager's treatment of the story was praised for its sensitivity – reviewers in the Parisian press applauded him for raising opérette to the level of "comédie lyrique" – but he was a self-critical artist, and he felt he had strayed too far in the direction of opera and away from his chosen genre. Harding suggests that the unusual seriousness of the score may be connected with the recent illness and death of Edith Messager. Both Hughes and Harding comment that Messager's score is subtler than Puccini's, but add that the almost total eclipse of "Madame Chrysanthème" by "Madama Butterfly" may be partly due to the relative effectiveness of their libretti. After this, Messager consciously simplified his style, greatly reducing the harmonic subtleties that had been characteristic of his earlier works.

The works from the middle of the decade were unsuccessful financially and artistically. "<a href="Le%20chevalier%20d%27Harmental">Le Chevalier d'Harmental</a>" (1896), classed by Hughes as Messager's first true opéra comique ("in a somewhat pretentious style") was a failure, and an unpretentious opérette in the same year, "La Fiancée en loterie", fared no better. After these disappointments Messager finished the 1890s with two considerable successes. Traubner describes "Les P'tites Michu" (1897) as "a sensational hit", and Harding calls it the best of Messager's opérettes so far (classing "Le Basoche" as opéra comique, as did its composer). The plot was not strikingly original: critics commented that its story of babies switched at birth was already very familiar from <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> operas. Traubner describes the piece as "one of those unusual works that begin well enough and gets better and better". Setting a scene in the market of <a href="Les%20Halles">Les Halles</a> was not innovative, but Messager's chorus for the marchands and marchandes was out of the ordinary, and Traubner also singles out the duet for the Michus in Act 1: "clever, lilting ... pulsating with an elegance and grace that other operetta composers have failed to obtain". He also judges the finales as outstanding, including a waltz number that in other hands would be predictable but is turned by Messager into something much more symphonic.

The final work from the decade was "Véronique". Messager described it as an opéra comique, but commentators have classed it as a mixture of opérette and opéra comique. The score contains two of the composer's best known numbers, the "Swing duet" ("Poussez, poussez l'escarpolette") and the "Donkey duet" ("De ci, de la"). When the work was revived at the <a href="the%20Proms">Proms</a> in London in the 1960s, the music critic of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" commented, "Charming as it can prove in the theatre, the music alone is a little thin, with none of the piquancy that – thanks perhaps to Gilbert – redeems Messager's famous English contemporary Sullivan ... but "Véronique" has plenty of pretty things". It became and has remained the composer's most performed musical theatre piece.

Messager's work running opera houses in Paris and London limited his composing between "Véronique" and the period after the First World War. "<a href="Fortunio%20%28opera%29">Fortunio</a>" (1907) was a rare example in his oeuvre of a <a href="sung-through">sung-through</a> opera. Eight decades later the critic <a href="Edward%20Greenfield">Edward Greenfield</a> described it as "a long-buried jewel of a piece ... an improbable cross between musical comedy and "Tristan und Isolde"". From 1919 onwards Messager composed no more opéras comiques. Among his post-war stage works, "<a href="Monsieur%20Beaucaire%20%28opera%29">Monsieur Beaucaire</a>", a "romantic operetta" (1919), was his second work to an English libretto. French critics were inclined to look down on "Messager's English operetta" as over-sweet and sentimental to suit Anglo-Saxon tastes. Harding comments that the composer was successful in his attempt to produce an English flavour: one number is "pure <a href="Edward%20German">Edward German</a>" and there is much pastiche throughout the score. Despite the critics the piece ran well not only in Britain and the US, but also in France, with more than 300 performances in Paris and a long life in French provincial theatres.

Of Messager's 1920s comédies musicales the best known is "<a href="L%27amour%20masqu%C3%A9">L'Amour masqué</a>" (1923). The <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20%C3%89douard%20VII">Théâtre Édouard VII</a> where it was premiered had a small orchestra pit, and Messager developed a new style of orchestration to deliver his desired musical effects with a small number of players. Harding comments that the piece was up-to-date enough to include a <a href="tango">tango</a>, "a beautifully written example with luscious harmonies that by contrast show up the threadbare nature of most other efforts of the time".

Messager wrote songs for solo voice with piano throughout his career. Like Fauré, he was fond of the poetry of <a href="Paul%20Armand%20Silvestre">Armand Sylvestre</a>, and from "La Chanson des cerises" in 1882 to the cycle "Amour d'hiver" in 1911 he set thirteen of Sylvestre's poems. Others whose verse he set ranged widely, from <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> to <a href="Frederic%20Weatherly">Frederic Weatherly</a> (author of among other things "<a href="Danny%20Boy">Danny Boy</a>").

In his old age Messager said that he would have liked to write more concert works, but had never had the opportunity. The Symphony in A, written when he was 22, is on the normal classical plan with <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> in the first and last movements, a songlike theme in the <a href="Tempo%23Basic%20tempo%20markings">adagio</a> and a <a href="scherzo">scherzo</a> third movement. Looking back he described it as "très classique". In notes to a 1992 recording of the piece, Xavier Deletang comments that although the influence of <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a> and possibly <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a> may be discernible, the work reveals a mastery of instrumentation and a quintessentially French flavour, particularly in the wind parts. The two main subjects of the Allegro "con moto" first movement are strongly contrasted, with the opening string theme followed by a chorale-like theme for the winds.

When Messager was elected to membership of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1926 the influential musical journal "<a href="Le%20M%C3%A9nestrel">Le Ménestrel</a>" remarked that this conferred on his chosen genre – opérette – official status and recognition; but his fame as a composer of light music has tended to obscure his considerable standing in contemporary serious musical circles. It was said of him that he had "seen all, heard all, and remembered all". The leading composers of the time valued his friendship and advice. Fauré called him "familiar with everything, knowing it all, fascinated by anything new". Messager's younger colleague, the composer Reynaldo Hahn, wrote, "I do believe that no musician has ever loved music as much as André Messager did. In any case, it would be impossible to have a greater musical curiosity than he did, up to the end of his life, too." Like Fauré, Messager wrote musical criticism for "Le Figaro" and other publications in the first decades of the 20th century. Unlike Fauré, who was known for his kindly reviews, Messager was frequently severe. His views carried weight: some of his criticisms were reported in the international press.

In 1908 Fauré wrote of Messager, "There are not many examples in the history of music of an artist with such a complete education, of such profound knowledge, who consents to apply his gifts to forms regarded, nobody knows why, as secondary". "<a href="Baker%27s%20Biographical%20Dictionary%20of%20Musicians">Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians</a>" says of Messager, "His style may be described as enlightened eclecticism; his music was characteristically French, and more specifically Parisian, in its elegance and gaiety." In his book "Composers of Operetta", Hughes comments that Messager combined "a flow of spontaneous melody worthy of Offenbach with a flair for economic workmanship at least the equal of Lecocq's" and in much of his music "a measure of Massenet's fluent grace, Saint-Saëns's aristocratic elegance, even Fauré's refined subtlety". He observes that Messager spanned an entire era: "Auber, <a href="Gioacchino%20Rossini">Rossini</a> and <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Meyerbeer</a> were still alive when he began his studies, yet he survived the First World War and witnessed the rise and decline of "<a href="les%20Six">les Six</a>". ... For forty years he carried aloft the torch kindled by <a href="Adolphe%20Adam">Adolphe Adam</a> in 1834; after his death it soon flickered out".

The wide range of Messager's musical sympathies was noted by "Le Menéstral", which said that he "has served Wagner, Debussy, Fauré, Ravel and <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> when their works were still struggling for recognition". He was widely admired as a conductor. He avoided extravagant gesturing on the podium; Harding records, "His manner was precise and undemonstrative. The baton flicked neatly here and there in a way that meant little to the audience behind him but conveyed volumes to the orchestra". The music critic <a href="Pierre%20Lalo">Pierre Lalo</a> wrote that under Messager's direction, "Parsifal", without losing any of its grandeur, "assumed a French clarity, and a sobriety, nobility and order ... even the most famous Bayreuth conductors have not always been able to do this." Not everyone shared Lalo's view; some audience members equated undemonstrativeness with dullness: Reynaldo Hahn commented, "[Messager] is not a master of the theatre ["chef du théâtre"], being too exclusively musical; he sets too much store by detail without feeling the spirit of the public behind him, and does not understand the variable musical flow that makes one hold one's breath, sigh and wait." Nevertheless, Hahn admired Messager as an orchestral conductor:

In 1918 Messager conducted recordings in New York, with the <a href="Orchestre%20de%20la%20Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20des%20Concerts%20du%20Conservatoire">Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire</a>, of "Les Chasseresses" and "Cortège de Bacchus" from "<a href="Sylvia%20%28ballet%29">Sylvia</a>" by <a href="L%C3%A9o%20Delibes">Delibes</a>, Sérénade and Mules from "Impressions d'Italie" by Charpentier, the Bacchanale from "Samson et Dalila" and the Prelude to "<a href="Le%20D%C3%A9luge%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Le Déluge</a>", both by Saint-Saëns, and 4½-minute extracts from "<a href="Capriccio%20Espagnol">Capriccio espagnol</a>" by <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</a> and "Le Rouet d'Omphale" by Saint-Saëns. In Wagstaff's 1991 study of Messager, the list of recordings of the composer's music runs to 40 pages; 24 of his works are represented in the list of recordings up to that date.

Complete recordings exist of several of Messager's stage works. There are three complete sets of "Véronique" – a 1953 mono recording for the Société française du son conducted by <a href="Pierre%20Dervaux">Pierre Dervaux</a>, a 1969 stereo <a href="EMI">EMI</a> recording conducted by <a href="Jean-Claude%20Hartemann">Jean-Claude Hartemann</a>, and a 1998 recording sung in English, conducted by J. Lynn Thompson. Other complete sets include "L'Amour masqué" (1970; conductor, Raymond Legrand), "La Basoche" (1960; <a href="Tony%20Aubin">Tony Aubin</a>), "Coups de roulis" (1963; Marcel Cariven), "Fortunio" (1987; <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a>), "Isoline" (1947; <a href="Louis%20Beydts">Louis Beydts</a>), "Monsieur Beaucaire" (1958; <a href="Jules%20Gressier">Jules Gressier</a>), and "<a href="Passionn%C3%A9ment">Passionnément</a>" (1964; Jean-Paul Kreder).

Singers who have recorded individual numbers by Messager include role creators such as <a href="Jean%20P%C3%A9rier">Jean Périer</a> ("Véronique"), <a href="Lucien%20Fug%C3%A8re">Lucien Fugère</a> ("La Basoche"), Pierre Darmant and Yvonne Printemps ("L'Amour masqué"), Koval ("Passionnément"), Marcelle Denya ("Coups de roulis"), and <a href="Maggie%20Teyte">Maggie Teyte</a> ("Monsieur Beaucaire"), as well as other contemporaries – <a href="Aino%20Ackt%C3%A9">Aino Ackté</a>, <a href="Emma%20Eames">Emma Eames</a>, and <a href="John%20McCormack%20%28tenor%29">John McCormack</a> – whose recordings have been reissued on compact disc. Singers of the next generation who recorded Messager numbers included <a href="Georges%20Thill">Georges Thill</a> and <a href="Ninon%20Vallin">Ninon Vallin</a>. More recent examples include <a href="Mady%20Mespl%C3%A9">Mady Mesplé</a>, <a href="Susan%20Graham">Susan Graham</a>, and <a href="Felicity%20Lott">Felicity Lott</a>.

Of Messager's non-operatic works, his "Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville", written jointly with Fauré, has been recorded by, among others, <a href="Harmonia%20Mundi">Harmonia Mundi</a>, conducted by <a href="Philippe%20Herreweghe">Philippe Herreweghe</a> (1989). Messager's other collaboration with Fauré, the Wagner send-up "Souvenirs de Bayreuth", has been recorded by piano duettists including <a href="Kathryn%20Stott">Kathryn Stott</a> and <a href="Martin%20Roscoe">Martin Roscoe</a> (1995, Hyperion), and, in an orchestral arrangement, by the orchestra of the <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth Festival</a>. A suite from "Les Deux Pigeons" has been recorded several times, for example by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, conducted by <a href="Hugo%20Rignold">Hugo Rignold</a> (1948) and by <a href="Charles%20Mackerras">Charles Mackerras</a> (1958); in 1993 Decca recorded the complete score with the Orchestra of <a href="Welsh%20National%20Opera">Welsh National Opera</a> conducted by <a href="Richard%20Bonynge">Richard Bonynge</a>. His ballet-pantomime "Scaramouche" was recorded by the <a href="Toulon%20Opera">Toulon Opera</a> orchestra under Guillaume Tourniaire (2018). The Symphony in A has been recorded by the Orchestre Symphonique du Mans, conducted by José-André Gendille (2001).

Red-billed quelea

The red-billed quelea (; "Quelea quelea"), also known as the red-billed weaver or red-billed dioch, is a small—approximately long and weighing —migratory, sparrow-like <a href="bird">bird</a> of the weaver family, <a href="Ploceidae">Ploceidae</a>, native to <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>. It was named by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in 1758, who considered it a <a href="bunting%20%28bird%29">bunting</a>, but <a href="Ludwig%20Reichenbach">Ludwig Reichenbach</a> assigned it in 1850 to the new genus "Quelea". Three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised, with "Quelea quelea quelea" occurring roughly from Senegal to Chad, "Q. q. aethiopica" from Sudan to Somalia and Tanzania, and "Q. q. lathamii" from Gabon to Mozambique and South Africa. Non-breeding birds have light underparts, striped brown upper parts, yellow-edged <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s and a reddish bill. Breeding females attain a yellowish bill. Breeding males have a black (or rarely white) facial mask, surrounded by a purplish, pinkish, rusty or yellowish wash on the head and breast. The species avoids forests, deserts and colder areas such as those at high altitude and in southern South Africa. It constructs oval roofed nests woven from strips of grass hanging from thorny branches, sugar cane or reeds. It breeds in very large colonies.

It feeds primarily on seeds of annual grasses, but also causes extensive damage to cereal crops. Therefore, it is sometimes called "Africa's feathered locust". The usual pest-control measures are spraying <a href="avicide">avicide</a>s or detonating fire-bombs in the enormous colonies during the night. Extensive control measures have been largely unsuccessful in limiting the quelea population. When food runs out, the species migrates to locations of recent rainfall and plentiful grass seed; hence it exploits its food source very efficiently. It is regarded as the most numerous undomesticated bird on earth, with the total post-breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1.5 billion individuals. It feeds in huge flocks of millions of individuals, with birds that run out of food at the rear flying over the entire group to a fresh feeding zone at the front, creating an image of a rolling cloud. The <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> of red-billed quelea is <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> according to the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

The red-billed quelea was one of the many <a href="Aves%20in%20the%2010th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">birds described</a> originally by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in the landmark 1758 <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". Classifying it in the <a href="Bunting%20%28bird%29">bunting</a> genus "<a href="Emberiza">Emberiza</a>", he gave it the <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a> of "Emberiza quelea". He incorrectly mentioned that it originated in India, probably because ships from the East Indies picked up birds when visiting the African coast during their return voyage to Europe. It is likely that he had seen a draft of "Ornithologia, sive Synopsis methodica sistens avium divisionem in ordines, sectiones, genera, species, ipsarumque varietates", a book written by <a href="Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson">Mathurin Jacques Brisson</a> that was to be published in 1760, and which contained a black and white drawing of the species. The erroneous <a href="Type%20%28biology%29%23type%20locality">type locality</a> of India was corrected to Africa in the 12th edition of "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" of 1766, and Brisson was <a href="Citation">cited</a>. Brisson mentions that the bird originates from Senegal, where it had been collected by <a href="Michel%20Adanson">Michel Adanson</a> during his 1748-1752 expedition. He called the bird "Moineau a bec rouge du Senegal" in French and "Passer senegalensis erythrorynchos" in Latin, both meaning "red-billed Senegalese sparrow". Also in 1766, <a href="George%20Edwards%20%28naturalist%29">George Edwards</a> illustrated the species in colour, based on a live male specimen owned by a Mrs Clayton in Surrey. He called it the "Brazilian sparrow", despite being unsure whether it came from <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> or <a href="Angola">Angola</a>. In 1850, <a href="Ludwig%20Reichenbach">Ludwig Reichenbach</a> thought the species was not a <a href="Bunting%20%28bird%29">true bunting</a>, but rather a weaver, and created the genus name "Quelea", as well as the <a href="Combinatio%20nova">new combination</a> "Q. quelea". The white-faced <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">morph</a> was described as a separate species, "Q. russii".

Three subspecies are recognised. In the field, these are distinguished by differences in male breeding plumage.

Formerly, two other subspecies have been described. "Q. quelea spoliator" was described by <a href="Phillip%20Clancey">Phillip Clancey</a> in 1960 on the basis of more greyish nonbreeding plumage of populations of wetter habitats of northeastern South Africa, Swaziland and southern Mozambique. However, further analysis indicated no clear distinction in plumage between it and "Q. quelea lathamii", with no evidence of genetic isolation. Hence it is not recognised as distinct. "Q. quelea intermedia", described by <a href="Anton%20Reichenow">Anton Reichenow</a> in 1886 from east Africa, is regarded a <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of subspecies "aethiopica".

Linnaeus himself did not explain the name "quelea". "Quelea quelea" is locally called "kwelea domo-jekundu" in <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>, "enzunge" in <a href="Kwangali%20language">Kwangali</a>, "chimokoto" in <a href="Shona%20language">Shona</a>, "inyonyane" in <a href="Swazi%20language">Siswati</a>, "thaha" in <a href="Sotho%20language">Sesotho</a> and "ndzheyana" in the <a href="Tsonga%20language">Tsonga language</a>. M.W. Jeffreys suggested that the term came from medieval Latin "qualea", meaning "quail", linking the prodigious numbers of queleas to the hordes of quail that fed the Israelites during <a href="the%20Exodus">the Exodus</a> from Egypt.

The subspecies "lathamii" is probably named in honor of the ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a>.
The name of the subspecies "aethiopica" refers to Ethiopia, and its <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type</a> was collected in the neighbouring <a href="Sennar%20%28state%29">Sennar province</a> in today's Sudan.

"Red-billed quelea" has been designated the official name by the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a> (IOC). Other names in English include black-faced dioch, cardinal, common dioch, Latham's weaver-bird, pink-billed weaver, quelea finch, quelea weaver, red-billed dioch, red-billed weaver, Russ' weaver, South-African dioch, Sudan dioch and Uganda dioch.

Based on recent <a href="DNA%20phenotyping">DNA analysis</a>, the red-billed quelea is the <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> of a clade that contains both other remaining species of the genus "<a href="Quelea">Quelea</a>", namely the <a href="cardinal%20quelea">cardinal quelea</a> ("Q. cardinalis") and the <a href="red-headed%20quelea">red-headed quelea</a> ("Q. erythrops"). The genus belongs to the group of true weavers (subfamily Ploceinae), and is most closely related to the fodies ("<a href="Foudia">Foudia</a>"), a genus of six or seven species that occur on the <a href="List%20of%20islands%20in%20the%20Indian%20Ocean%23Western%20Indian%20Ocean">islands of the western Indian Ocean</a>. These two genera are in turn the sister clade to the Asian species of the genus "<a href="Ploceus">Ploceus</a>". The following tree represents current insight of the relationships between the species of "Quelea", and their closest relatives.
<a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">Interbreeding</a> between red-billed and red-headed queleas has been observed in captivity.

The red-billed quelea is a small sparrow-like bird, approximately long and weighing , with a heavy, cone-shaped bill, which is red (in females outside the breeding season and males) or orange to yellow (females during the breeding season).

Over 75% of males have a black facial "mask", comprising a black forehead, cheeks, <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a> and higher parts of the throat. Occasionally males have a white mask. The mask is surrounded by a variable band of yellow, rusty, pink or purple. White masks are sometimes bordered by black. This colouring may only reach the lower throat or extend along the belly, with the rest of the underparts light brown or whitish with some dark stripes. The upperparts have light and dark brown longitudinal stripes, particularly at midlength, and are paler on the rump. The tail and upper wing are dark brown. The <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s are edged greenish or yellow. The eye has a narrow naked red ring and a brown <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a>. The legs are orangey in colour. The bill is bright raspberry red. Outside the breeding season, the male lacks bright colours; it has a grey-brown head with dark streaks, whitish chin and throat, and a faint light stripe above the eyes. At this time, the bill becomes pink or dull red and the legs turn flesh-coloured.

The females resemble the males in non-breeding plumage, but have a yellow or orangey bill and eye-ring during the breeding season. At other times, the female bill is pink or dull red.

Newborns have white bills and are almost naked with some wisps of <a href="Down%20feather">down</a> on the top of the head and the shoulders. The eyes open during the fourth day, at the same time as the first feathers appear. Older nestlings have a horn-coloured bill with a hint of lavender, though it turns orange-purple before the post-juvenile moult. Young birds change feathers two to three months after hatching, after which the plumage resembles that of non-breeding adults, although the head is grey, the cheeks whitish, and wing <a href="Covert%20feather">coverts</a> and flight feathers have buff margins. At an age of about five months they <a href="Moulting">moult</a> again and their plumage starts to look like that of breeding adults, with a pinkish-purple bill.

Different subspecies are distinguished by different colour patterns of the male breeding plumage. In the typical subspecies, "Q. quelea quelea", breeding males have a buff crown, nape and underparts and the black mask extends high up the forehead. In " Q. quelea lathamii" the mask also extends high up the forehead, but the underparts are mainly white. In "Q. quelea aethiopica" the mask does not extend far above the bill, and the underparts may have a pink wash. There is much variability within subspecies, and some birds cannot be ascribed to a subspecies based on outward appearance alone. Because of interbreeding, specimens intermediate between subspecies may occur where the ranges of the subspecies overlap, such as at Lake Chad.

The female <a href="pin-tailed%20whydah">pin-tailed whydah</a> could be mistaken for the red-billed quelea in non-breeding plumage, since both are sparrow-like birds with conical red-coloured bills, but the whydah has a whitish brow between a black stripe through the eye and a black stripe above.

Flying flocks make a distinct sound due to the many wing beats. After arriving at the roost or nest site, birds keep moving around and make a lot of noise for about half an hour before settling in. Both males and females call. The male sings in short bursts, starting with some chatter, followed by a warbling "tweedle-toodle-tweedle".

The red-billed quelea is mostly found in tropical and subtropical areas with a seasonal <a href="semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid climate</a>, resulting in dry thornbush grassland, including the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>, and its distribution covers most of sub-Saharan Africa. It avoids forests, however, including <a href="miombo%20woodland">miombo woodland</a>s and <a href="rain%20forest">rain forest</a>s such as those in central Africa, and is generally absent from western parts of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and arid coastal regions of Namibia and Angola. It was introduced to the island of <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> in 2000. Occasionally, it can be found as high as above sea-level, but mostly resides below . It visits agricultural areas, where it feeds on cereal crops, although it is thought to prefer seeds of wild annual grasses. It needs to drink daily and can only be found within about distance of the nearest body of water. It is found in wet habitats, congregating at the shores of waterbodies, such as <a href="Lake%20Ngami">Lake Ngami</a>, during flooding. It needs shrubs, reeds or trees to nest and <a href="Bird%23Resting%20and%20roosting">roost</a>.

Red-billed queleas migrate seasonally over long distances in anticipation of the availability of their main natural food source, seeds of annual grasses. The presence of these grass seeds is the result of the beginning of rains weeks earlier, and the rainfall varies in a seasonal geographic pattern. The temporarily wet areas do not form a single zone that periodically moves back and forth across the entirety of Sub-Saharan Africa, but rather consist of five or six regions, within which the wet areas "move" or "jump". Red-billed quelea populations thus migrate between the temporarily wet areas within each of these five to six geographical regions. Each of the subspecies, as distinguished by different male breeding plumage, is confined to one or more of these geographical regions.

In Nigeria, the nominate subspecies generally travels southwards during the start of the rains in the north during June and July, when the grass seed germinates, and is no longer eaten by the queleas. When they reach the <a href="Benoue%20River">Benoue River</a> valley, for instance, the rainy season has already passed and the grass has produced new seeds. After about six weeks, the birds migrate northwards to find a suitable breeding area, nurture a generation, and then repeat this sequence moving further north. Some populations may also move northwards when the rains have started, to eat the remaining ungerminated seeds. In Senegal migration is probably between the southeast and the northwest.

In eastern Africa, the subspecies "aethiopica" is thought to consist of two sub-populations. One moves from Central Tanzania to southern Somalia, to return to breed in Tanzania in February and March, followed by successive migrations to breed ever further north, the season's last usually occurring in central Kenya during May. The second group moves from northern and central Sudan and central Ethiopia in May and June, to breed in southern Sudan, South Sudan, southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya, moving back north from August to October.

In southern Africa, the total population of the subspecies "Q. quelea lathamii" in October converges on the <a href="Zambezian%20Highveld">Zimbabwean Highveld</a>. In November, part of the population migrates to the northwest to northwestern Angola, while the remainder migrates to the southeast to southern Mozambique and eastern South-Africa, but no proof has been found that these migration cohorts are genetically or morphologically divergent.

The red-billed quelea is regarded as the most numerous undomesticated bird on earth, with the total post-breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1½ billion individuals. The species is <a href="Generalist%20and%20specialist%20species">specialised</a> on feeding on seeds of annual grass species, which may be ripe, or still green, but have not germinated yet. Since the availability of these seeds varies with time and space, occurring in particular weeks after the local off-set of rains, queleas migrate as a <a href="Behavioral%20ecology">strategy</a> to ensure year-round food availability. The consumption of a lot of food with a <a href="Food%20energy">high energy content</a> is needed for the queleas to gain enough fat to allow migration to new feeding areas. When breeding, it selects areas such as <a href="Veld">lowveld</a> with thorny or spiny vegetation—typically "Acacia" species—below elevation. While foraging for food, they may fly each day and return to the roosting or nesting site in the evening. Small groups of red-billed queleas often mix with different weaver birds ("<a href="Ploceus">Ploceus</a>") and bishops ("<a href="Euplectes">Euplectes</a>"), and in western Africa they may join the <a href="Sudan%20golden%20sparrow">Sudan golden sparrow</a> ("Passer luteus") and various <a href="Estrildidae">estrildids</a>. Red-billed queleas may also roost together with weavers, estrildids and barn swallows. Their life expectancy is two to three years in the wild, but one captive bird lived for eighteen years.

The red-billed quelea needs of precipitation to breed, with nest building usually commencing four to nine weeks after the onset of the rains. Nests are usually built in stands of thorny trees such as umbrella thorn acacia ("<a href="Vachellia%20tortilis">Vachellia tortilis</a>"), blackthorn ("<a href="Senegalia%20mellifera">Senegalia mellifera</a>") and sicklebush ("<a href="Dichrostachys%20cinerea">Dichrostachys cinerea</a>"), but sometimes in <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a> fields or reeds. Colonies can consist of millions of nests, in densities of 30,000 per ha (12,000 per acre). Over 6000 nests in a single tree have been counted. At <a href="Malilangwe">Malilangwe</a> in Zimbabwe one colony was long and wide. In southern Africa, suitable branches are stripped of leaves a few days in advance of the offset of nest construction. The male starts the nest by creating a ring of grass by twining strips around both branches of a hanging forked twig, and from there bridging the gaps in the circle his beak can reach, having one foot on each of the branchlets, using the same footholds and the same orientation throughout the building process. Two parallel stems of reeds or sugar cane can also be used to attach the nest from. They use both their bills and feet in adding the initial knots needed. As soon as the ring is finished the male displays, trying to attract a female, after which the nest may be completed in two days. The nest chamber is created in front of the ring. The entrance may be constructed after the egg laying has started, while the male works from the outside. A finished nest looks like a small oval or globular ball of grass, around 18 cm (7 in) high and 16 cm (6 in) wide, with a 2.5 cm (1 in) wide entrance high up one side, sheltered by a shallow awning. About six to seven hundred fresh, green grass strips are used for each nest. This species may nest several times per year when conditions are favourable.

In the breeding season, males are diversely coloured. These differences in <a href="plumage">plumage</a> do not signal <a href="Fitness%20%28biology%29">condition</a>, probably serving instead for the recognition of individual birds. However, the intensity of the red on the bills is regarded an indicator of the animal's quality and social dominance. Red-billed quelea males mate with one female only within one breeding cycle. There are usually three eggs in each clutch (though the full range is one to five) of approximately long and in diameter. The eggs are light bluish or greenish in colour, sometimes with some dark spots. Some clutches contain six eggs, but large clutches may be the result of other females dumping an egg in a stranger's nest. Both sexes share the <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">incubation</a> of the eggs during the day, but the female alone does so during the cool night, and feeds during the day when air temperatures are high enough to sustain the development of the embryo. The breeding cycle of the red-billed quelea is one of the shortest known in any bird. Incubation takes nine or ten days. After the chicks hatch, they are fed for some days with <a href="protein">protein</a>-rich insects. Later the nestlings mainly get seeds. The young birds fledge after about two weeks in the nest. They are sexually mature in one year.

Flocks of red-billed queleas usually feed on the ground, with birds in the rear constantly leap-frogging those in the front to exploit the next strip of fallen seeds. This behaviour creates the impression of a rolling cloud, and enables efficient exploitation of the available food. The birds also take seeds from the grass ears directly. They prefer grains of in size. Red-billed queleas feed mainly on seeds from a wide range of species, including annual grasses of the genera "<a href="Echinochloa">Echinochloa</a>", "<a href="Panicum">Panicum</a>", "<a href="Setaria">Setaria</a>", "<a href="Sorghum">Sorghum</a>", "<a href="Tetrapogon">Tetrapogon</a>" and "<a href="Urochloa">Urochloa</a>". One survey at <a href="Lake%20Chad">Lake Chad</a> showed that two thirds of the seeds eaten belonged to only three species: African wild rice ("<a href="Oryza%20barthii">Oryza barthii</a>"), "<a href="Sorghum%20purpureosericeum">Sorghum purpureosericeum</a>" and jungle rice ("<a href="Echinochloa%20colona">Echinochloa colona</a>"). When the supply of these seeds runs out, seeds of <a href="cereals">cereals</a> such as <a href="barley">barley</a> ("Hordeum disticum"), <a href="teff">teff</a> ("Eragrostis tef"), <a href="Sorghum%20bicolor">sorghum</a> ("Sorghum bicolor"), <a href="manna">manna</a> ("Setaria italica"), <a href="millet">millet</a> ("Panicum miliaceum"), <a href="rice">rice</a> ("Oryza sativa"), <a href="wheat">wheat</a> ("Triticum"), <a href="oats">oats</a> ("Avena aestiva"), as well as <a href="buckwheat">buckwheat</a> ("Phagopyrum esculentum") and <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a> ("Helianthus annuus") are eaten on a large scale. Red-billed queleas have also been observed feeding on crushed corn from cattle <a href="feedlot">feedlot</a>s, but entire maize kernels are too big for them to swallow. A single bird may eat about in seeds each day. As much as half of the diet of nestlings consists of insects, such as grasshoppers, ants, beetles, bugs, caterpillars, flies and termites, as well as snails and spiders. Insects are generally eaten during the breeding season, though winged termites are eaten at other times. Breeding females consume snail-shell fragments and calcareous grit, presumably to enable egg-shell formation. One colony in Namibia, of an estimated five million adults and five million chicks, was calculated to consume roughly of insects and of grass seeds during its breeding cycle. At sunrise they form flocks that co-operate to find food. After a successful search, they settle to feed. In the heat of the day, they rest in the shade, preferably near water, and preen. Birds seem to prefer drinking at least twice a day. In the evening, they once again fly off in search of food.

Natural enemies of the red-billed quelea include other birds, snakes, warthogs, squirrels, <a href="galago">galago</a>s, monkeys, <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>s, <a href="Genet%20%28animal%29">genets</a>, <a href="civet">civet</a>s, foxes, jackals, hyaenas, cats, lions and leopards. Bird species preying on queleas included <a href="lanner%20falcon">lanner falcon</a>, <a href="tawny%20eagle">tawny eagle</a> and <a href="marabou%20stork">marabou stork</a>. The <a href="diederik%20cuckoo">diederik cuckoo</a> is a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a> that probably lays eggs in nests of queleas. Some predators, such as snakes, raid nests and eat eggs and chicks. <a href="Nile%20crocodile">Nile crocodile</a>s sometimes attack drinking queleas, and an individual in Ethiopia hit birds out of the vegetation on the bank into the water with its tail, subsequently eating them. Queleas drinking at a waterhole were grabbed from below by <a href="African%20helmeted%20turtle">African helmeted turtle</a>s in <a href="Etosha">Etosha</a>. Among the invertebrates that kill and eat youngsters are the <a href="Acanthoplus%20discoidalis">armoured bush cricket</a> ("Acanthoplus discoidalis") and the scorpion "<a href="Cheloctonus%20jonesii">Cheloctonus jonesii</a>". Internal parasites found in queleas include "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus</a>" and "<a href="Plasmodium">Plasmodium</a>".

The red-billed quelea is caught and eaten in many parts of Africa. Around <a href="Lake%20Chad">Lake Chad</a>, three traditional methods are used to catch red-billed queleas. Trappers belonging to the <a href="Hadjerai">Hadjerai</a> tribe use triangular hand-held nets, which are both selective and efficient. Each team of six trappers caught about twenty thousand birds each night. An estimated five to ten million queleas are trapped near <a href="N%27Djamena">N'Djamena</a> each year, representing a market value of approximately US$37,500–75,000. Between 13 June and 21 August 1994 alone, 1.2 million queleas were caught. Birds were taken from roosts in the trees during the moonless period each night. The feathers were plucked and the carcasses fried the following morning, dried in the sun, and transported to the city to be sold on the market. The <a href="Sara%20people">Sara people</a> use standing fishing nets with a very fine mesh, while <a href="Masa%20people">Masa</a> and <a href="Musgum%20people">Musgum</a> fishermen cast nets over groups of birds. The impact of hunting on the quelea population (about 200 million individuals in the Lake Chad Basin) is deemed insignificant. Woven traps made from star grass ("<a href="Cynodon">Cynodon</a> nlemfuensis") are used to catch hundreds of these birds daily in the <a href="Kondoa%20District">Kondoa District</a>, Tanzania.

<a href="Guano">Guano</a> is collected from under large roosts in Nigeria and used as a fertiliser. Tourists like to watch the large flocks of queleas, such as during visits of the <a href="Kruger%20National%20Park">Kruger National Park</a>. The birds themselves eat pest insects such as <a href="migratory%20locust">migratory locust</a>s, and the moth species "<a href="Helicoverpa%20armigera">Helicoverpa armigera</a>" and "<a href="Spodoptera%20exempta">Spodoptera exempta</a>". The animal's large distribution and population resulted in a <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> listed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

The red-billed quelea is sometimes <a href="Aviculture">kept and bred in captivity</a> by hobbyists. It thrives if kept in large and high cages, with space to fly to minimise the risk of obesity. A sociable bird, the red-billed quelea tolerates mixed-species aviaries. Keeping many individuals mimics its natural occurrence in large flocks. This species withstands frosts, but requires shelter from rain and wind. Affixing hanging branches, such as hawthorn, in the cage facilitates nesting. Adults are typically given a diet of tropical seeds enriched with grass seeds, augmented by living insects such as <a href="mealworm">mealworm</a>s, spiders, or boiled shredded egg during the breeding season. Fine stone grit and calcium sources, such as shell grit and <a href="cuttlebone">cuttlebone</a>, provide nutrients as well. If provided with material like fresh grass or <a href="Coir">coconut fibre</a> they can be bred.

Sometimes called "Africa's feathered locust", the red-billed quelea is considered a serious agricultural pest in <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>. In particular, they eat wheat in the dry season, rice in the early rainy season, and sorghum/millet in the rainy season. An individual red-billed quelea eats around of grain in a day, hence a flock of 2 million individuals—not an unusual size—can consume of grain in a day, or in a month. Their wide range, enormous population and fecundity make control difficult.

Traditional methods to protect crops are mainly used in <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence farming</a>. When the crop is vulnerable, people go into the fields, making noise, utilising a range of techniques from yelling to banging tins. Small stones or bits of dry mud are aimed at the birds using <a href="catapult">catapult</a>s. One person can protect about one hectare (2½ acre) but this method is highly labour-intensive because the birds are active from dawn to dusk, and crops may need protection for an entire month. <a href="Scarecrow">Scarecrow</a>s are also effective, though only if moved every two days to avoid the birds getting used to them. In large-scale farms growing <a href="cash%20crops">cash crops</a>, <a href="firecracker">firecracker</a>s, exploders, or other automated noisemaking devices are used, firing as often as every five minutes during daylight hours.

The governments of Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe have regularly made attempts to lessen quelea populations. The most common method to kill members of problematic flocks was by spraying the <a href="organophosphate">organophosphate</a> <a href="avicide">avicide</a> <a href="fenthion">fenthion</a> from the air on breeding colonies and roosts. In Botswana and Zimbabwe, spraying was also executed from ground vehicles and manually. Kenya and South Africa regularly used fire-bombs. Attempts during the 1950s and '60s to eradicate populations, at least regionally, failed. Consequently, management is at present directed at removing those congregations that are likely to attack vulnerable fields.

Monnow Bridge

Monnow Bridge ( ), in <a href="Monmouth">Monmouth</a>, Wales, is the only remaining <a href="medieval%20fortification">fortified</a> river bridge in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> with its <a href="gate%20tower">gate tower</a> standing on the bridge. Such <a href="bridge%20tower">bridge tower</a>s were common across Europe from <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> times, but many were destroyed due to urban expansion, diminishing defensive requirements and the increasing demands of traffic and trade. The historical and architectural importance of the bridge and its rarity are reflected in its status as a <a href="Scheduled%20Monument">Scheduled Monument</a> and a <a href="Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>. The bridge crosses the <a href="River%20Monnow">River Monnow</a> ("Afon Mynwy") above its confluence with the <a href="River%20Wye">River Wye</a>.

Monmouth had been a significant border settlement since the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman occupation of Britain</a>, when it was the site of the fort of <a href="Blestium">Blestium</a>. The River Wye may have been bridged at this time but the Monnow, being easily <a href="ford%20%28crossing%29">fordable</a>, appears not to have had a crossing until after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a>. According to the local tradition, construction of Monnow Bridge began in 1272 to replace a 12th-century <a href="Anglo-Normans">Norman</a> timber bridge. Through the <a href="Wales%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">medieval era</a>, the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, and the <a href="Newport%20Rising">Chartist uprising</a>, the bridge played a significant, if ineffectual, role in defending Monmouth. It also served as a <a href="Prison%23Middle%20Ages%20to%20the%2017th%20century">gaol</a>, a <a href="ammunition">munitions</a> store, a lodge, an <a href="billboard">advertising hoarding</a>, a focus for celebrations and, most significantly, as a <a href="toll%20house">toll gate</a>. Much of the medieval development of Monmouth was funded by the <a href="Taxation%20in%20medieval%20England">taxes</a> and tolls the borough was entitled to raise through <a href="Royal%20Charter">Royal Charter</a>. The tolls were collected through control of the points of entry to the town, including the gatehouse on Monnow Bridge.

Built predominantly of <a href="Old%20Red%20Sandstone">Old Red Sandstone</a>, the bridge was the subject of significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular subject for artists; <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">Turner</a>, <a href="Henry%20Gastineau">Gastineau</a> and <a href="John%20Sell%20Cotman">Cotman</a> produced sketches of the bridge and gate. In the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, the construction of a new road crossing to the south enabled the <a href="Footbridge">pedestrianisation</a> of the bridge.

Monmouth was a significant settlement in Roman Britain, as the border fort of <a href="Blestium">Blestium</a> and as an important centre for <a href="ferrous%20metallurgy">ironworking</a>. It is possible the Romans bridged the River Wye during their occupation, but the Monnow appears not to have had a crossing until after the Norman invasion. The Norman lord <a href="William%20FitzOsbern%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">William FitzOsbern</a> built a castle near the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of the two rivers in around 1070. The following two centuries saw the establishment of the <a href="Monmouth%20Priory">Benedictine Priory</a> and the development of the town as a defensive location on the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh Marches</a>.

The original bridge over the Monnow at Monmouth was constructed of wood in the mid-12th century. In 1988, work on <a href="flood%20control">flood defences</a> revealed remains of the wooden bridge directly under the existing one, and <a href="dendrochronology">dendrochronological analysis</a> indicated that its timber came from trees felled between 1123 and 1169. An early account in the "<a href="Flores%20Historiarum">Flores Historiarum</a>" by <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a> may indicate that the wooden bridge and the nearby <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Thomas%20the%20Martyr%2C%20Monmouth">Church of St Thomas the Martyr</a> were damaged by fire in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monmouth%20%281233%29">Battle of Monmouth</a> in 1233, fought between supporters of <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> and the forces of <a href="Richard%20Marshal%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Richard Marshal, Earl of Pembroke</a>. Both the site of the battle and the specific bridge involved are debated—the local historian <a href="Keith%20Kissack">Keith Kissack</a> argued that the battle was fought on <a href="Vauxhall%20Fields%2C%20Monmouth">Vauxhall Fields</a>, below <a href="Monmouth%20Castle">Monmouth Castle</a> and some way from Monnow Bridge, while other modern historians continue to place the battle at <a href="Overmonnow">Overmonnow</a>.

The stone bridge was completed in the late 13th century. It was traditionally thought to have been built in 1272, though this date has no supporting documentary evidence. The historian <a href="William%20Coxe%20%28historian%29">William Coxe</a> incorrectly described the bridge as pre-dating the <a href="Norman%20Conquest">Norman Conquest</a> and recorded that "it commanded the passage of the Monnow and was a barrier against the Welsh". In 1804, the Monmouth antiquarian <a href="Charles%20Heath%20%28Monmouth%29">Charles Heath</a> wrote that the bridge's "foundation is so ancient that neither history or tradition afford any light respecting the date of its erection". Heath drew directly from "The Antiquities of England and Wales", an earlier guide by <a href="Francis%20Grose">Francis Grose</a>, published in 1773. The archaeologist Martin Cook notes the significance of the date 1270 as the start of a period that saw increased bridge-building, due to the rapid growth of international trade. The civil engineer Edwyn Jervoise suggested that the absence of an evidential record was due to the destruction of the archives of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Duke of Beaufort</a> at <a href="Raglan%20Castle">Raglan Castle</a> in the 17th century. This is unlikely, as the gatehouse did not come into the possession of the duke's family, <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Beaufort">the Somersets</a>, until the 19th century.

The <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a>, called Monnow Gate, which gives Monnow Bridge its now unique appearance, was added at the end of the 13th or start of the 14th centuries, twenty-five to thirty years after the bridge itself was built. The siting of the gatehouse mid-channel is relatively unusual; the archaeologist David Harrison notes the more common arrangement was for the gate to be situated on the roadway at one end of the bridge. In 1297, <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a> provided a <a href="murage">murage</a> grant in favour of Monmouth in response to a request from his nephew, <a href="Henry%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Henry of Lancaster</a>. A murage was a medieval tax, granted specifically to allow for the raising of funds to construct or repair town walls. The grant allowed the townspeople to build the town walls and gates, including the construction of the gatehouse. By 1315, work was incomplete or required repair, as the original authority was renewed on 1 June of that year. At that time, the bridge would have been much narrower than now, with all traffic passing beneath a single arch. The arch was protected by a <a href="portcullis">portcullis</a>, whose associated grooves are still visible. The prominent arched <a href="machicolation">machicolation</a>s, defensive apertures through which stones or other material could be dropped on attackers, were added at an unknown date in the medieval period, possibly in the late 14th century. The gate formed part of <a href="Monmouth%20town%20walls%20and%20defences">the town's defensive walls</a>. The cartographer <a href="John%20Speed">John Speed</a>'s map of 1610 shows walls only on the northern side of the town, which lies unprotected by either the Monnow or the <a href="River%20Wye">Wye</a>, but the archaeologist Ian Soulsby suggests it is "inconceivable" that Monnow Gate, and another gate shown by Speed leading out onto Chippenham Mead, stood alone.
As well as its defensive role, the gatehouse served as a barrier to allow for the collection of tolls from those attending markets. Tolls were authorised in the <a href="Patent%20Rolls">Patent Rolls</a> of 1297 and 1315 and in subsequent town charters. Kissack gives details of the wide variety of items on which <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s were levied in his reproduction of the charter of 1297. These included "five fat hogs, (a) horse-load of honey and a thousand (roofing) nails". In 1447 <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a> granted the town a <a href="Charter">Charter of Incorporation</a> which enabled further development.

Historians have debated whether defence or revenue collection was the gatehouse's primary purpose. The Victorian antiquarian <a href="Mary%20Ellen%20Bagnall-Oakeley">Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley</a>, who wrote the first history of the bridge and gate in 1902, described the gatehouse as "a little fortress complete in itself, though of course, useless in time of war". Her account contended that the "tower was not in any way connected with the fortification walls of the town" and that the gatehouse was erected solely "for the purpose of taking tolls". Kissack follows her argument, noting that the gatehouse was ineffective in defensive terms, as the Monnow could easily be crossed on foot upstream. More recent commentators disagree; Soulsby considered the bridge to have a clear defensive purpose, and Michael Rowlands, author of the most recent history of the bridge and gatehouse, argued that the bridge and gatehouse met the dual aims of defensive protection and the collection of tolls.

Neither Monmouth nor its castle were attacked in the <a href="Glynd%C5%B5r%20Rising">rebellion</a> of <a href="Owain%20Glynd%C5%B5r">Owain Glyndŵr</a> between 1400 and 1415, although nearby <a href="Abergavenny">Abergavenny</a> and <a href="Grosmont%2C%20Monmouthshire">Grosmont</a> were burned down in the uprising. The unrest of the period had a negative impact on the development of the town. But the bridge continued its important function as a toll-gate. <a href="Philip%20Jones%20%28MP%29">Philip Jones</a>, <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Monmouth%20Boroughs">Monmouth Boroughs</a> in 1589, bequeathed an annual sum of about £120, the rent from his lands and houses at 'Bayliepitte', to the mayor and bailiffs of Monmouth on condition that the borough exempt those people passing through the gate or coming into Monmouth with cattle from paying tolls on <a href="fair">fair days</a>.

In the 16th century, the antiquarian <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a> described the bridge in one of his Itineraries: "From Monk's Gate the wall extends Westwards to the river Monnow. In the wall are four gates: Monk's Gate, East Gate and Wye Gate ... and Monnow Gate which is above the bridge crossing the river Monnow." A visual depiction of the bridge and gate is included in John Speed's work "The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain", published in 1611. His map of Monmouthshire includes an inset map of the town that shows the Monnow Bridge and Gate as well as a similar gatehouse on the Wye Bridge.
In the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, the town changed hands several times, and in 1645 the bridge was seized by <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> soldiers from <a href="Raglan%20Castle">Raglan</a> in a failed attempt to retake the town from the <a href="Roundheads">Parliamentarian</a> forces under Colonel Kyrle. Kissack describes the engagement as "the most resolute Royalist attack made (on) Monmouth", which saw eight of Kyrle's opponents killed and five captured. By 1705, the bridge and gatehouse required maintenance: the original <a href="battlement">battlement</a>s were replaced with solid walls, and the building was refitted to form a two-storey dwelling house with timber and <a href="lath">lath</a> extensions projecting over the river. The house was then leased to a resident gatekeeper, responsible for repairing and maintaining the building. Part of the gatehouse remained in use as a <a href="village%20lock-up">lock-up</a>. Such multiple uses were not uncommon; the archaeologist C. J. Bond recorded that "gates often included chambers which could be used for lock-ups, chapels or meeting rooms". Both the bridge and the gatehouse were again repaired between 1771 and 1775. The bill for repairs included the cost of 100 gallons of ale for the workmen employed. Trade continued to be central to the importance of the bridge. The Monmouthshire writer and artist <a href="Fred%20Hando">Fred Hando</a> records that, on a single Saturday in the early 18th century, "500 horses each carrying five bushels of corn entered by way of the Monnow gate".

In 1804, Charles Heath recorded, "The interior has nothing worthy of attention and the only purpose to which it is employed is an occasional guardhouse, or <a href="gunpowder%20magazine">powder room</a>, for the military, when stationed at Monmouth." The gatehouse had by this point been abandoned as a dwelling. The lean-to extensions, including the guardhouse, were demolished around 1815. In 1819, a pedestrian passageway was driven through the building on the upstream side to help relieve the flow of traffic across the bridge. Before 1830, the gatehouse was owned by Monmouth Corporation, and subsequently <a href="Monmouthshire%20County%20Council">the County Council</a>, as inheritors of the medieval burgesses. In a lengthy transaction, begun that year but not concluded until 1835, ownership was formally transferred to the <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Duke of Beaufort</a> as part of a property exchange. The gatehouse roof was reconstructed in 1832, with deeper <a href="eaves">eaves</a> and four decorative <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s on each side. A second passageway was added on the downstream side of the arch in 1845. Since then, the structure has remained essentially unchanged, save for periodic maintenance and repair.

In 1839, at the time of the <a href="Newport%20Rising">Newport Rising</a>, the gatehouse was <a href="garrison">garrison</a>ed as the authorities feared a <a href="Chartism">Chartist</a> attack on Monmouth. Later guidebooks suggest that the three <a href="arrowslit">loopholes</a> visible on the tower were opened up at this time "for <a href="musket">musket</a>ry in anticipation of the advance of the Chartists", but Rowlands shows that the apertures are visible in illustrations of the gatehouse long before 1839.

The gatehouse was the scene of annual battles, or "muntlings", between rival gangs from "Up-Town" – the main town of Monmouth – and <a href="Overmonnow">Overmonnow</a> or "Cappers' Town", so called because it was the traditional home of those who made <a href="Monmouth%20cap">Monmouth cap</a>s. Until the confrontations were banned in 1858, youths from both sides of the bridge would gather for these occasions on 1 and 29 May, armed with <a href="besom">besom</a>s or "muntles" reinforced with stones. The bridge was also used as an unofficial advertising hoarding and as a focus for significant local and national celebrations. In 1891, it was decorated with flags and lights to commemorate the coming of age of <a href="John%20Rolls%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Llangattock">John Maclean Rolls</a>, eldest son of Monmouthshire grandee <a href="John%20Rolls%2C%201st%20Baron%20Llangattock">Lord Llangattock</a>.

From 1889 to 1902, an extensive programme of <a href="architectural%20conservation">conservation</a> was carried out on the bridge and gate, directed by <a href="Monmouthshire%20County%20Council">Monmouthshire County Council</a>, which retained responsibility for maintenance. This began with the prevention of the potential collapse of the gatehouse by the insertion of metal <a href="tie%20rod">tie rod</a>s to hold the two faces of the tower together; the four round plates at the ends of these two rods can still be seen. In 1892, conservation work began on the <a href="arch%20bridge">arches</a> and <a href="pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a> of the bridge following the discovery that riverbed erosion had seriously undermined the piers. Maintenance was carried out on the gatehouse exterior from the mid-1890s to 1897. <a href="Rain%20gutter">Roof guttering</a> and <a href="downpipe">downpipe</a>s were added, badly eroded stone was replaced with squared blocks of <a href="Old%20Red%20Sandstone">Old Red Sandstone</a>, and the <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a> arrowslit on the left-hand side of the west elevation of the gatehouse was restored to make it symmetrical. Concluding the 1889–1902 renovations, improvements were made to the interior of the gatehouse, and it was opened to the public in 1902.

In 1900, ownership of the gatehouse was transferred from <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%209th%20Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort</a> to Monmouthshire County Council as part of the disposal of the entirety of the Somersets' land holdings in Monmouthshire. The gift is recorded on a brass plaque attached to the gatehouse. The local antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley wrote the first history of the bridge and gatehouse, "Monnow Bridge Tower", which appeared in 1903. In April 1893, the first <a href="street%20light">street light</a> had been erected on the bridge by the town council. In the late 1920s, the top portion of this light was replaced by twin electric lamps. In the 1960s, the lamps were removed completely, and since 1991 the bridge has been <a href="floodlight">floodlit</a>.

In 1963, <a href="Fred%20Hando">Fred Hando</a>, who recorded points of interest and history around Monmouthshire in a series of articles for the "<a href="South%20Wales%20Argus">South Wales Argus</a>" between the 1920s and the 1960s, wrote a description of the gatehouse, referencing the small museum then located in the upstairs room. Hando mentions the "beautifully executed" copies of the <a href="patent%20roll">patent roll</a>s issued by <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a> in 1296-7 and by <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward II</a> in 1315 which recorded the items on which tolls could be levied to fund the fortifications for Monmouth.

In the 20th century, the greater volume of traffic using the <a href="humpback%20bridge">humpbacked</a> bridge, which had poor visibility and narrow approach roads, led to a rise in accidents and an increase in bypass proposals. The desire of local authorities to clear carriageways of obstructions to traffic led to the demolition of many similar bridge towers from as early as the 18th century. The bridge and gate were formally protected as an <a href="Ancient%20Monument">Ancient Monument</a> in 1923, and proposals for a new road bridge began to be made about the same time. The new <a href="A40%20road">A40</a>, built in 1965–1966, relieved the town of much through traffic, and a town centre plan, prepared by the <a href="Monmouth%20%28district%29">District Council</a> in 1981, again proposed a new bridge. Repairs had to be undertaken in 1982 following a collision on 18 May in which a double-decker bus struck the bridge, resulting in its closure for a month. Damage to the bridge and gate through accidents continued, and in the early 1990s, two drivers were prosecuted after crossing the bridge with vehicles significantly exceeding the weight and height limits.

In 1999, the engineers <a href="Ove%20Arup">Ove Arup and Partners</a> undertook a feasibility study for a bridge downstream from the Monnow bridge, but the scheme was not progressed at that time. Both the County and Town Councils remained committed to the construction of a new crossing to support the economic development of the town, and in 2003 local authority funding of £1.3M was secured and construction commenced. The new bridge opened on 15 March 2004 for local traffic, allowing the old bridge to become pedestrianised. The closure to traffic also enabled a significant repair programme to be undertaken, in part funded by the <a href="Welsh%20Government">Welsh Government</a> and the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>. After further conservation and repair, the gatehouse was formally re-opened in 2014, allowing public access on one day per week.

<a href="William%20Gilpin%20%28priest%29">William Gilpin</a>, in his "Observations on the River Wye, and Several Parts of South Wales, etc. Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty; made in the Summer of the Year 1770", published in 1782, generated considerable interest in the natural and man-made attractions of South Wales and heralded the development of the <a href="Wye%20Tour">Wye Tour</a> as an alternative to the <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a>. As a consequence, Monnow Bridge and Gatehouse became a popular subject for artists. A late 18th-century watercolour by <a href="Michael%20Angelo%20Rooker">Michael Angelo Rooker</a> is now in the <a href="Monmouth%20Museum">Monmouth Museum</a>. The noted architectural watercolourist <a href="Samuel%20Prout">Samuel Prout</a> painted the bridge in a study dated "before 1814", now held at the <a href="Yale%20Center%20for%20British%20Art">Yale Center for British Art</a> in Connecticut. In 1795, <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a> sketched the bridge and gatehouse during one of his annual summer sketching tours.

The watercolourist and etcher <a href="John%20Sell%20Cotman">John Sell Cotman</a> sketched the bridge in the early 19th century, his drawing showing the overhanging accommodation and guardhouse that were later removed. <a href="Joshua%20Cristall">Joshua Cristall</a> produced a similar pencil sketch in 1803. <a href="Henry%20Gastineau">Henry Gastineau</a> drew the bridge in about 1819. Due to a printing error that confused his drawing of the bridge with one of the tower at Raglan Castle on the opposite page of the printed collection, Gastineau's image often appears with the title "Gate and Bridge, Ragland". The artist of the American West <a href="Thomas%20Moran">Thomas Moran</a> produced an undated pencil drawing of the bridge which is printed in his "Field Sketches". A depiction of the bridge in <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> by <a href="Charles%20Eamer%20Kempe">Charles Eamer Kempe</a> can be seen in the "Memorial of the Boer War" window in <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Priory%20Church%2C%20Monmouth">St Mary's Priory Church</a> in Monmouth.

The bridge is in length and wide. The gatehouse stands high above the bridge deck. It has three arches standing on piers. The two piers that stand on the bed of the Monnow form <a href="starling%20%28structure%29">cutwaters</a>. The undersides of the arches are ribbed for reinforcement. The bridge is constructed of seven types of stone, predominantly <a href="Old%20Red%20Sandstone">Old Red Sandstone</a>, all quarried within of Monmouth. The two passageways through the gate are 19th-century insertions. Prior to their construction, the main gateway was the sole means of entry and egress. This opening was defended by a <a href="portcullis">portcullis</a>. The gatehouse is elliptical, and its western and eastern elevations show considerable differences. The western front has three <a href="machicolation">machicolation</a>s over the gate with <a href="murder-hole">murder holes</a> inset. The historians Oliver Creighton and Richard Higham note their "fine architectural detailing". The dating of the machicolations is uncertain, but comparison with similar, dated, examples, such as those at <a href="Cooling%20Castle">Cooling Castle</a> in Kent, suggests a construction period in the 14th century. They cannot be original to the gate, as their positioning would have obstructed the portcullis. The eastern front is less decorated and displays evidence of more substantial reconstruction. It has a centrally placed round-headed window. The pedestrian arches through the bridge also differ in design, the northern being pointed and the southern having a flat "<a href="Caernarvon%20Castle">Caernarvon</a>" head.

Internally, the gate has a single room and a <a href="garderobe">garderobe</a>. The original internal access was by way of a stone spiral staircase, but this was subsequently destroyed and a wooden replacement was inserted. The room in the tower measures long and wide and has an attic and an 18th-century roof. The roof was reconstructed in 1832. From the upper room, the machine-cut rafters are visible. Drawings from the 18th and 19th centuries show a chimney in the roof, but the presence of a fireplace in the tower room is not mentioned in the available sources. The medieval roof was flat, with a <a href="battlement">castellated</a> parapet and a <a href="Chemin%20de%20ronde">wall-walk</a>.

In 1996, the bridge was included on a list of potential World Heritage Bridges by the <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> advisory body, the <a href="International%20Council%20on%20Monuments%20and%20Sites">International Council on Monuments and Sites</a>. The criteria for World Heritage status required that the bridge be of "outstanding universal value" and illustrate "a significant stage in bridge engineering or technological developments".
The bridge is one of only two surviving fortified bridges in the United Kingdom, the other being in <a href="Warkworth%2C%20Northumberland">Warkworth, Northumberland</a>. There, the gatehouse stands on land at one end of the bridge, rather than on the bridge itself, and is described by the archaeologist John Steane as "less impressive" than the "superb" Monnow Gate. A recent (2016) appreciation by the historian Richard Hayman describes the Monnow Bridge as "arguably the finest surviving medieval bridge in Britain". Such <a href="bridge%20tower">bridge tower</a>s were common across mainland Europe and, to a lesser extent, in Great Britain from medieval times. British examples included the <a href="St%20George%27s%20Bridge">Mardol Gate</a> in <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> and <a href="River%20Frome%2C%20Bristol">Froome Bridge</a> in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>. Continental examples include the <a href="Fr%C3%ADas%2C%20Province%20of%20Burgos">Frias Bridge</a>, near <a href="Burgos">Burgos</a> in Spain, and the <a href="Pont%20Valentr%C3%A9">Pont Valentré</a>, in <a href="Cahors">Cahors</a>, France. But urban expansion, the lessening of defensive requirements, and the substantial increases in traffic and trade from the 18th century onward led to the destruction of many of what was once a common bridge type. The rarity of Monnow Bridge and Gate is reflected in its status as a potential <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>, a <a href="Scheduled%20Monument">Scheduled Monument</a>, and a <a href="Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>; its listing describing it as "an outstanding medieval fortified bridge, now unique in Britain".

A. E. J. Collins

Arthur Edward Jeune "James" Collins (18 August 1885 – 11 November 1914), typically now known by his initials A. E. J. Collins, was an English <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er and <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">soldier</a>. He held, for 116 years, the record of highest score in cricket: as a 13-year-old schoolboy, he scored 628 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> over four afternoons in June 1899. Collins's record-making <a href="innings">innings</a> drew a large crowd and increasing media interest; spectators at the <a href="Clifton%20College">Old Cliftonian</a> match being played nearby were drawn away to watch the junior school <a href="house%20system">house</a> cricket match in which Collins was playing. Despite this achievement, Collins never played <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>. Collins's 628 not out stood as the record score till January 2016 when an <a href="India">India</a>n boy, <a href="Pranav%20Dhanawade">Pranav Dhanawade</a>, scored 1009 in a school game.

Collins joined the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> in 1902 and studied at the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich">Royal Military Academy, Woolwich</a>, before becoming an <a href="officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>. He served in France during the First World War, where he was <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a> in 1914 during the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">First Battle of Ypres</a>. Collins had been mentioned in despatches and also represented the Royal Military Academy at cricket and <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a>.

Collins was born in <a href="Hazaribagh">Hazaribagh</a>, India, to Arthur Herbert Collins, a judge in the <a href="Indian%20Civil%20Service">Indian Civil Service</a>, and Mrs Esther Ida Collins. It had been thought that both of his parents had died by the time he began his education at <a href="Clifton%20College">Clifton College</a>, Bristol, where he held a scholarship. However, the 1901 census shows that Arthur's mother was actually still alive.

He joined Clifton College in September 1897, becoming a member of Clark's <a href="house%20system">House</a>, although he later moved to North Town House. Clifton had an excellent reputation for sport. <a href="W.G.%20Grace">W.G. Grace</a> scored 13 first-class centuries on the Close (Clifton's first XI ground), and he sent his sons to the school. Collins played half-back for the <a href="rugby%20union">rugby</a> XV, and was also in the cricket XI. He won a <a href="bronze%20medal">bronze medal</a> for <a href="boxing">boxing</a> at the <a href="public%20school%20%28UK%29">public schools</a> tournament in <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a> in 1901.

<a href="Tim%20Rice">Tim Rice</a>, in a 9 June 1999 article for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a>" to celebrate the centenary of the score, entitled "On the seventh day AEJ Collins rested", described him thus:

In 1899, as a 13-year-old schoolboy, Collins scored what was then the highest ever recorded cricket score of 628 not out. This feat took place during a junior school house cricket match between Clarke's House and North Town House. Such matches were timeless, played to a finish however long they took. The match was played on an outfield off Guthrie Road, Bristol, now named "Collins Piece". The ground had both a poor surface and a very unusual shape: it was very short (only long), with a wall only away forming the <a href="boundary%20%28cricket%29">boundary</a> on one side, while the other side was a gentle slope falling away towards the school <a href="sanatorium">sanatorium</a> in the distance. The pitch occupied the central of the narrow field, with the boundary only behind each set of stumps. Hits to the long boundary, down the slope, had to be all-run, but the three short boundaries only counted for two runs.

The match commenced on Thursday, 22 June, to take advantage of two half-day holidays while the college team played their annual match against Old Cliftonians nearby. Collins, a right-handed <a href="batsman">batsman</a>, won the toss for Clarke's House and chose to bat first. Collins hit his first stroke at around 3.30 pm. By the close of play at 6 pm, he had scored 200 runs, having been dropped on 50, 100 and 140.

School lessons allowed another two-and-a-half hours' play on Friday, 23 June, and by then news of an exceptional innings had gone round the school. So brilliant was his play that even the crowd watching an Old Cliftonian match being played nearby lost its interest and a large crowd watched Collins's phenomenal performance. Collins's innings almost ended at 400 when an easy <a href="Caught%20%28cricket%29">catch</a> was dropped by the youngest player on the field, 11-year-old Victor Fuller-Eberle, but at around 5.30 pm, after batting for around five hours, rapturous applause broke out when he passed <a href="Andrew%20Stoddart">Andrew Stoddart</a>'s world-record score of 485. At the end of the second day, he remained unbeaten on 509 and the team on 680 for 8. His innings was reported as a world record in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" newspaper on Saturday 24 June; the paper, however, gave Collins's score by the close of play on Friday as 501, his age as 14 and mis-reported his name as "A. E. "G." Collins".

The match resumed in the lunch hour on Monday, 26 June, at 12:30 pm, with a large crowd. By the end of play, Collins had been dropped again, on 556, to reach 598, but another wicket had fallen, and Collins was running out of partners. On Tuesday, 27 June, the school authorities extended the hours available for play in an attempt to finish the match. The crowds grew and media interest escalated, as "The Times" again reported on the match on Tuesday, and the disruption to school life was considerable. Collins hit out, with his approach being described as "downright reckless". He was dropped twice more, on 605 and 619. After just 25 minutes' play, Collins lost his final partner, Thomas Redfern, caught by Victor Fuller-Eberle at <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">point</a> for 13, with Collins's score on 628. Collins had played less than seven hours' cricket, <a href="carrying%20his%20bat">carrying his bat</a> through his side's innings. He had scored 1 six, 4 fives, 31 fours, 33 threes, 146 twos and 87 singles. "The Times" once again ran a report, giving the final figures for Collins's innings in its Wednesday edition of 28 June—once again, however, they misspelled his third initial.

North Town House, demoralised, were bowled out for 87 in 90 minutes on Tuesday. The match resumed on Wednesday 28 June, when North Town's second innings went even worse, making 61 in just over an hour, so Clarke House won by an innings and 688 runs. Collins showed ability as an <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>, with his right-arm medium pace <a href="bowling%20%28cricket%29">bowling</a> taking 11 <a href="wicket">wicket</a>s for 63 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a>.

The scorebook hangs in the pavilion at Clifton to this day. The scorers faced a difficult task in accurately recording the innings. One of them, Edward Peglar, is said to have remarked that Collins's score was "628, plus or minus twenty shall we say". The other scorer for the match was J. W. Hall, whose father in 1868 had batted with <a href="Edward%20Tylecote">Edward Tylecote</a>, who later played <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a> for <a href="English%20cricket%20team">England</a> and whose name is on a poem kept with <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> urn. Tylecote had earlier set a world-record score of 404 not out in 1868, also at Clifton. Hall later wrote that "The bowling probably deserved all the lordly contempt with which Collins treated it, sending a considerable number of pulls full pitch over the <a href="fives">fives</a> courts into the swimming baths to the danger of the occupants."

Collins became public property for a long while after the match, forever associated with his great score. "Today all men speak of him", wrote one newspaper, "… he has a reputation as great as the most advertised soap: he will be immortalised." After leaving school, he never wanted to be reminded of his famous innings; nevertheless, he has been remembered well beyond his own lifetime.

Within two years, 31-year-old Australian Test cricketer <a href="Charles%20Eady">Charles Eady</a> came close to breaking the record, when he made 566 for Break-o'-Day against Wellington in <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a> in less than eight hours spread over three weeks in March 1902. This remained, for over a century, the closest challenge to Collins's record: his score was finally beaten in January 2016 by <a href="Pranav%20Dhanawade">Pranav Dhanawade</a>, a 15-year-old Indian boy who scored 1,009 not out from 327 balls for KC Gandhi School against Arya Gurukul School in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. Only five other players, <a href="Prithvi%20Shaw">Prithvi Shaw</a> (546), <a href="Dadabhoy%20Havewala">Dadabhoy Havewala</a> (515), JC Sharp (505 not out), <a href="Malhotra%20Chamanlal">Malhotra Chamanlal</a> (502 not out), and <a href="Brian%20Lara">Brian Lara</a> (501 not out) have ever scored more than 500 runs in one innings in any form of cricket. Lara is the only person to have achieved a score of over 500 runs in <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>.

Collins chose to follow an army career, passing his entrance exams to the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich">Royal Military Academy, Woolwich</a>, in September 1901 and representing the Royal Military Academy at both football and rugby as well as cricket, scoring a century in a match against the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>. He joined the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> the following year, being commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> on 21 December 1904. Despite the limitations on his sport that the military service caused, he played several matches for Old Cliftonians, his regiment, and the army, remaining a free-hitting batsman. He played at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> in 1913 for <a href="Royal%20Engineers%20Cricket%20Club">Royal Engineers Cricket Club</a> against <a href="Royal%20Artillery%20Cricket%20Club">Royal Artillery Cricket Club</a>, scoring 58 and 36 runs in the two innings, but he never played <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>. He also joined <a href="Clifton%20Rugby%20Football%20Club">Clifton Rugby Football Club</a> in February 1905, but never rose above the 2nd XV. He served with the 2nd Sappers and Miners in India, and was promoted to <a href="First%20Lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on 23 June 1907.

Collins married Ethel Slater in the spring of 1914 and was sent to France when the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> broke out later that year. He was killed in action on 11 November 1914 at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">First Battle of Ypres</a>, while serving as a <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a> with the 5th Field Company, Royal Engineers, at the age of 29. He was signalling for more men to protect the flank of his trench when he was wounded; he was dragged back into the trench by Sapper Farnfield (23900) but he died an hour later. The 5th Field Company carried out the burials of its Company on 12 November. Due to the continual fighting over this area for the next four years what remained of his grave and remains were never found, but his name is recorded at the <a href="Menin%20Gate">Menin Gate</a> Memorial in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>. Before his death, he had been <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>. His younger brother Herbert (a lieutenant in the 24th Battalion of the <a href="Manchester%20Regiment">Manchester Regiment</a> and also an old Cliftonian) was killed in action on 11 February 1917, aged 27. Collins's wife, Ethel, lived as a widow for over fifty years, dying on 1 September 1966 in <a href="Haslemere">Haslemere</a>.

Verbascum thapsus

Verbascum thapsus, the great mullein or common mullein, is a species of <a href="Verbascum">mullein</a> native to Europe, northern Africa, and Asia, and introduced in the Americas and Australia.

It is a hairy <a href="biennial%20plant">biennial plant</a> that can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows from a large <a href="Rosette%20%28botany%29">rosette</a> of leaves. It grows in a wide variety of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the <a href="soil%20seed%20bank">soil seed bank</a>. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively <a href="invasive%20species">invasive</a>, since its seeds require open ground to <a href="germination">germinate</a>. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive <a href="Tillage">tilling</a>. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.

It is widely used for herbal remedies, with well-established <a href="emollient">emollient</a> and <a href="astringent">astringent</a> properties. Mullein remedies are especially recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in <a href="topical">topical</a> applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant has also been used to make <a href="dye">dye</a>s and <a href="torch">torch</a>es.

"V. thapsus" is a <a href="dicotyledon">dicotyledon</a>ous plant that produces a <a href="rosette%20%28botany%29">rosette</a> of leaves in its first year of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50 cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2 m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5 m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense <a href="raceme">spike</a> of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped <a href="trichome">trichome</a>s. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' <a href="chromosome%20number">chromosome number</a> is 2n = 36.

On flowering plants, the leaves are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a>, with much variation in leaf shape between the upper and lower leaves on the stem, ranging from <a href="leaf%20shape">oblong to oblanceolate</a>, and reaching sizes up to 50 cm long and 14 cm across (19 inches long and 5 inches wide). They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2–2.5 cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow <a href="taproot">taproot</a>.
Flowers are pentamerous with (usually) five <a href="stamen">stamen</a>, a five-lobed <a href="calyx%20tube">calyx tube</a> and a five-petalled <a href="Corolla%20%28flower%29">corolla</a>, the latter bright yellow and an wide. The flowers are almost <a href="Sessility%20%28botany%29">sessile</a>, with very short <a href="pedicel%20%28botany%29">pedicels</a> (2 mm, 0.08 in). The five stamens are of two types, with the three upper stamens being shorter, their filaments covered by yellow or whitish hairs, and having smaller <a href="anther">anther</a>s, while the lower two stamens have <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23glabrous">glabrous</a> filaments and larger anthers. The plant produces small, ovoid (6 mm, 0.24 in) <a href="capsule%20%28fruit%29">capsules</a> that split open by way of two valves, each capsule containing large numbers of minute, brown <a href="seed">seed</a>s less than 1 mm (0.04 in) in size, marked with longitudinal ridges. A white-flowered form, "V. thapsus" f. "candicans", is known to occur. Flowering lasts up to three months from early to late summer (June to August in northern Europe), with flowering starting at the bottom of the spike and progressing irregularly upward; each flower opens for part of a day and only a few open at the same time around the stem.

For the purpose of <a href="botanical%20nomenclature">botanical nomenclature</a>, "Verbascum thapsus" was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his 1753 '. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "thapsus" had been first used by <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> (as , ') for an unspecified herb from the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek</a> settlement of <a href="Thapsos">Thapsos</a>, near modern <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a>, <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, though it is often assimilated to the ancient <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>n city of <a href="Thapsus">Thapsus</a>.

At the time, no <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> was specified, as the practice only arose later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original material) was designated, it was assigned to specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only "V. thapsus" specimen. The species had previously been designated as <a href="type%20species">type species</a> for "<a href="Verbascum">Verbascum</a>". European plants exhibit considerable <a href="phenotype">phenotypical</a> variation, which has led to the plant acquiring many <a href="synonymy">synonyms</a> over the years. Introduced American populations show much less variation.

The taxonomy of "Verbascum" has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, with the exception of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, "V. thapsus" is placed in section "Bothrospermae" subsect. "Fasciculata" (or sect. "Verbascum" subsect. "Verbascum" depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as "<a href="Verbascum%20nigrum">Verbascum nigrum</a>" (black or dark mullein), "<a href="Verbascum%20lychnitis">Verbascum lychnitis</a>" (white mullein) and "<a href="Verbascum%20sinuatum">Verbascum sinuatum</a>" (wavy-leaved mullein).

There are three usually recognized <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>:
In all subspecies but the type, the lower stamens are also hairy. In subsp. "crassifolium", the hairiness is less dense and often absent from the upper part of the anthers, while lower leaves are hardly decurrent and have longer petioles. In subsp. "giganteum", the hairs are densely white tomentose, and lower leaves strongly decurrent. Subsp. "crassifolium" also differs from the type in having slightly larger flowers, which measure 15–30 mm wide, whereas in the type they are 12–20 mm in diameter. Both subsp. "giganteum" and subsp. "crassifolium" were originally described as species. Due to its morphological variation, "V. thapsus" has had a great many subspecies described. A recent revision led its author to maintain "V. giganteum" but sink "V. crassifolium" into synonymy.

The plant is also parent to several hybrids ("see table"). Of these, the most common is "V." × "semialbum" Chaub. (× "V. nigrum"). All occur in Eurasia, and three, "V." × "kerneri" Fritsch, "V." × "pterocaulon" Franch. and "V." × "thapsi" L. (<a href="Synonymy">syn.</a> "V." × "spurium" W.D.J.Koch), have also been reported in North America.

"V. thapsus" is known by a variety of names. European reference books call it "great mullein". In North America, "common mullein" is used while western United States residents commonly refer to mullein as "cowboy toilet paper".

In the 19th century it had well over 40 different common names in English alone. Some of the more whimsical ones included "hig candlewick", "indian rag weed", "bullicks lungwort", "Adams-rod", "hare's-beard" and "ice-leaf". Vernacular names include innumerable references to the plant's hairiness: "woolly mullein", "velvet mullein" or "blanket mullein", "beggar's blanket", "Moses' blanket", "poor man's blanket", "Our Lady's blanket" or "old man's blanket", and "feltwort", and so on ("flannel" is another common generic name). "Mullein" itself derives from the French word for "soft".

Some names refer to the plant's size and shape: "shepherd's club(s)" or "staff", "<a href="Aaron%27s%20Rod">Aaron's Rod</a>" (a name it shares with a number of other plants with tall, yellow inflorescences), and a plethora of other "X's staff" and "X's rod". The name "velvet dock" or "mullein dock" is also recorded, where "dock" is a British name applied to any broad-leaved plant.

"Verbascum thapsus" has a wide native range including <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, northern <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, from the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> east to western <a href="China">China</a>, north to the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, and south to the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>. In northern Europe, it grows from sea level up to 1,850 m altitude, while in China it grows at 1,400–3,200 m altitude.

It has been introduced throughout the temperate world, and is <a href="naturalisation%20%28biology%29">established</a> as a <a href="weed">weed</a> in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, tropical Asia, <a href="La%20R%C3%A9union">La Réunion</a>, <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> and <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. It has also been reported in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>.

In the United States it was imported very early in the 18th century and cultivated for its medicinal and <a href="piscicide">piscicide</a> properties. By 1818, it had begun spreading so much that <a href="Amos%20Eaton">Amos Eaton</a> thought it was a native plant. In 1839 it was already reported in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> and in 1876, in <a href="California">California</a>. It is now found commonly in all the states. In <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, it is most common in the <a href="Maritime%20Provinces">Maritime Provinces</a> as well as southern <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, with scattered populations in between.

Great mullein most frequently grows as a colonist of bare and disturbed soil, usually on sandy or chalky ones. It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, although it can grow in a variety of habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. This ability to grow in a wide range of habitats has been linked to strong <a href="Phenotype%23Phenotypic%20variation">phenotype variation</a> rather than <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a> capacities.

Great mullein is a biennial and generally requires <a href="vernalization">winter dormancy</a> before it can flower. This dormancy is linked to <a href="starch">starch</a> degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and <a href="gibberellin">gibberellin</a> application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10 °C and 40 °C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or very close to the soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.

Seeds germinate in spring and summer. Those that germinate in autumn produce plants that overwinter if they are large enough, while rosettes less than across die in winter. After flowering the entire plant usually dies at the end of its second year, but some individuals, especially in the northern parts of the range, require a longer growth period and flower in their third year. Under better growing conditions, some individuals flower in the first year. Triennial individuals have been found to produce fewer seeds than biennial and annual ones. While year of flowering and size are linked to the environment, most other characteristics appear to be genetic.

A given flower is open only for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are <a href="reproduction%23Autogamy">self-fecundating</a> and <a href="Dichogamy">protogynous</a> (with female parts maturing first), and will self-pollinate if they have not been <a href="pollination">pollinated</a> by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. "V. thapsus"' flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include <a href="Halictidae">halictid</a> bees and <a href="hoverfly">hoverflies</a>. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.
The seeds maintain their germinative powers for decades, up to a hundred years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the <a href="soil%20seed%20bank">soil seed bank</a> for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after <a href="forest%20fire">forest fire</a>s long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by a long period of dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. <a href="biological%20dispersal">Seed dispersion</a> requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.

<a href="Megachilidae">Megachilid</a> bees of the genus "<a href="Anthidium">Anthidium</a>" use the hair (amongst that of various woolly plants) in making their <a href="nest">nest</a>s. The seeds are generally too small for birds to feed on, although the <a href="American%20goldfinch">American goldfinch</a> has been reported to consume them. Other bird species have been reported to consume the leaves (<a href="Hawaiian%20goose">Hawaiian goose</a>) or flowers (<a href="palila">palila</a>), or to use the plant as a source when <a href="foraging">foraging</a> for insects (<a href="white-headed%20woodpecker">white-headed woodpecker</a>).

Seed of Verbascum thapsus has been recorded from part of the <a href="Cromer">Cromer</a> Forest Bead series and at <a href="West%20Wittering">West Wittering</a> in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> from some parts of the <a href="Ipswichian%20interglacial">Ipswichian interglacial</a> layers.

Because it cannot compete with established plants, great mullein is no longer considered a serious agricultural weed and is easily crowded out in cultivation, except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with, such as <a href="California">California</a>n semi-desertic areas of the eastern <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a>. In such ecological contexts, it crowds out native herbs and grasses; its tendency to appear after <a href="forest%20fire">forest fire</a>s also disturbs the normal <a href="ecological%20succession">ecological succession</a>. Although not an agricultural threat, its presence can be very difficult to completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in <a href="overgrazing">overgrazed</a> pastures. The species is legally listed as a <a href="noxious%20weed">noxious weed</a> in the American state of <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> (Class C) and Hawaii, and the Australian state of <a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia">Victoria</a> (regionally prohibited in the <a href="West%20Gippsland">West Gippsland</a> region, and regionally controlled in several others).

Despite not being an agricultural weed in itself, it <a href="Host%20%28biology%29">hosts</a> a number of insects and <a href="disease">disease</a>s, including both <a href="pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a> and <a href="beneficial%20insects">beneficial insects</a>. It is also a potential reservoir of the <a href="cucumber%20mosaic%20virus">cucumber mosaic virus</a>, "<a href="Erysiphum%20cichoraceum">Erysiphum cichoraceum</a>" (the cucurbit <a href="powdery%20mildew">powdery mildew</a>) and <a href="Texas%20root%20rot">Texas root rot</a>. A study found "V. thapsus" hosts insects from 29 different <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>. Most of the pests found were <a href="western%20flower%20thrips">western flower thrips</a> ("Frankliniella occidentalis"), "<a href="Lygus">Lygus</a>" species such as the <a href="tarnished%20plant%20bug">tarnished plant bug</a> ("L. lineolaris"), and various spider mites from the family <a href="Tetranychidae">Tetranychidae</a>. These make the plant a potential reservoir for <a href="overwintering">overwintering</a> pests.

Other insects commonly found on great mullein feed exclusively on "Verbascum" species in general or "V. thapsus" in particular. They include mullein thrips ("<a href="Haplothrips">Haplothrips</a> verbasci"), "<a href="Gymnaetron%20tetrum">Gymnaetron tetrum</a>" (whose larva consume the seeds) and the <a href="mullein%20moth">mullein moth</a> ("Cucullia verbasci"). Useful insects are also hosted by great mullein, including predatory mites of the genera "<a href="Galendromus">Galendromus</a>", "<a href="Typhlodromus">Typhlodromus</a>" and "<a href="Amblyseius">Amblyseius</a>", the <a href="minute%20pirate%20bug">minute pirate bug</a> "Orius tristicolor" and the <a href="mullein%20plant%20bug">mullein plant bug</a> ("Campylomma verbasci"). The plant's ability to host both pests and beneficials makes it potentially useful to maintain stable populations of insects used for biological control in other cultures, like "Campylomma verbasci" and "<a href="Dicyphus%20hesperus">Dicyphus hesperus</a>" (<a href="Miridae">Miridae</a>), a predator of <a href="whitefly">whiteflies</a>. A number of pest <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> species, including the <a href="stalk%20borer">stalk borer</a> ("Papaipema nebris") and <a href="gray%20hairstreak">gray hairstreak</a> ("Strymon melinus"), also use "V. thapsus" as a host plant.

Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via mechanical means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably followed by sowing of native plants. Animals rarely <a href="grazing">graze</a> it because of its irritating hairs, and liquid <a href="herbicide">herbicide</a>s require <a href="surfactant">surfactant</a>s to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the <a href="lotus%20effect">lotus effect</a>. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for <a href="seedling">seedling</a>s to occupy. "G. tetrum" and "Cucullia verbasci" usually have little effect on "V. thapsus" populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include <a href="glyphosate">glyphosate</a>, <a href="triclopyr">triclopyr</a> and <a href="sulfurometuron-methyl">sulfurometuron-methyl</a>. Ground herbicides, like <a href="tebuthiuron">tebuthiuron</a>, are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.

Great mullein has been used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and breathing ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an <a href="astringent">astringent</a> and <a href="emollient">emollient</a>, as it contains <a href="mucilage">mucilage</a>, several <a href="saponin">saponin</a>s, <a href="coumarin">coumarin</a> and <a href="glycoside">glycoside</a>s. <a href="Dioscorides">Dioscorides</a> recommended it for diseases of the <a href="lung">lung</a> and it is now widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included <a href="dye">dye</a>ing and making <a href="torch">torch</a>es.

<a href="Pedanius%20Dioscorides">Dioscorides</a> first recommended the plant 2000 years ago, for pulmonary diseases. Leaves were smoked to attempt to treat pulmonary ailments, a tradition that in America was rapidly transmitted to <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> peoples. The <a href="Zuni%20people">Zuni people</a>, however, use the plant in <a href="poultice">poultice</a>s of powdered root applied to <a href="Ulcer%20%28dermatology%29">sore</a>s, <a href="rash">rash</a>es and skin infections. An infusion of the root is also used to treat <a href="athlete%27s%20foot">athlete's foot</a>. All preparations meant to be drunk have to be finely filtered to eliminate the irritating hairs.

Oil from the flowers was used against <a href="catarrh">catarrh</a>s, <a href="colic">colic</a>s and, in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="earache">earache</a>s, <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a>, <a href="eczema">eczema</a> and other external conditions. Topical application of various "V. thapsus"-based preparations was recommended for the treatment of <a href="wart">wart</a>s, <a href="boil">boil</a>s, <a href="carbuncle">carbuncle</a>s, hemorrhoids, and <a href="chilblain">chilblain</a>s, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great mullein contains <a href="glycyrrhizin">glycyrrhizin</a> compounds with <a href="bactericide">bactericide</a> and potential anti-<a href="tumor">tumor</a>al action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German <a href="Commission%20E">Commission E</a> sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the <a href="National%20Formulary">National Formulary</a> in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain <a href="rotenone">rotenone</a>, although quantities are unknown.

Like many ancient medicinal plants (<a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> describes it in his "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Naturalis Historia</a>"), great mullein was linked to <a href="witch">witch</a>es, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off <a href="curse">curse</a>s and <a href="evil%20spirit">evil spirit</a>s. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and have been widely used as <a href="piscicide">piscicide</a> for <a href="fishing">fishing</a>.

The flowers provide dyes of bright yellow or green, and have been used for <a href="hair%20dye">hair dye</a>.

Gas tungsten arc welding

Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), also known as tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an <a href="arc%20welding">arc welding</a> process that uses a non-consumable <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> <a href="electrode">electrode</a> to produce the <a href="welding">weld</a>. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an <a href="inert%20gas">inert</a> <a href="shielding%20gas">shielding gas</a> (<a href="argon">argon</a> or <a href="helium">helium</a>), and a <a href="filler%20metal">filler metal</a> is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A <a href="Current%20source">constant-current</a> <a href="welding%20power%20supply">welding power supply</a> produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a>.

GTAW is most commonly used to weld thin sections of <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> and <a href="non-ferrous%20metals">non-ferrous metals</a> such as <a href="aluminum">aluminum</a>, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, and <a href="copper">copper</a> alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as <a href="shielded%20metal%20arc%20welding">shielded metal arc welding</a> and <a href="gas%20metal%20arc%20welding">gas metal arc welding</a>, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, <a href="plasma%20arc%20welding">plasma arc welding</a>, uses a slightly different welding torch to create a more focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.

After the discovery of the short pulsed <a href="electric%20arc">electric arc</a> in 1800 by <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a> and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by <a href="Vasily%20Vladimirovich%20Petrov">Vasily Petrov</a>, arc welding developed slowly. <a href="C.%20L.%20Coffin">C. L. Coffin</a> had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air, resulting in porous, <a href="dross">dross</a>-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used in the beginning of the 1930s. A few years later, a <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a>, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.

Russell Meredith of Northrop Aircraft perfected the process in 1941. Meredith named the process Heliarc because it used a tungsten electrode arc and helium as a shielding gas, but it is often referred to as tungsten inert gas welding (TIG). The American Welding Society's official term is gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). <a href="Linde%20Air%20Products">Linde Air Products</a> developed a wide range of air-cooled and water-cooled torches, gas lenses to improve shielding, and other accessories that increased the use of the process. Initially, the electrode overheated quickly and, despite tungsten's high <a href="Melting%20point">melting temperature</a>, particles of tungsten were transferred to the weld. To address this problem, the polarity of the electrode was changed from positive to negative, but the change made it unsuitable for welding many non-ferrous materials. Finally, the development of <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a> units made it possible to stabilize the arc and produce high quality aluminum and magnesium welds.

Developments continued during the following decades. Linde developed water-cooled torches that helped prevent overheating when welding with high currents. During the 1950s, as the process continued to gain popularity, some users turned to <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> as an alternative to the more expensive welding atmospheres consisting of argon and <a href="helium">helium</a>, but this proved unacceptable for welding aluminum and magnesium because it reduced weld quality, so it is rarely used with GTAW today. The use of any shielding gas containing an oxygen compound, such as carbon dioxide, quickly contaminates the tungsten electrode, making it unsuitable for the TIG process.
In 1953, a new process based on GTAW was developed, called plasma arc welding. It affords greater control and improves weld quality by using a nozzle to focus the electric arc, but is largely limited to automated systems, whereas GTAW remains primarily a manual, hand-held method. Development within the GTAW process has continued as well, and today a number of variations exist. Among the most popular are the pulsed-current, manual programmed, hot-wire, dabber, and increased penetration GTAW methods.

Manual gas tungsten arc welding is a relatively difficult welding method, due to the coordination required by the welder. Similar to torch welding, GTAW normally requires two hands, since most applications require that the welder manually feed a filler metal into the weld area with one hand while manipulating the welding torch in the other. Maintaining a short arc length, while preventing contact between the electrode and the workpiece, is also important.

To strike the welding arc, a high frequency generator (similar to a <a href="Tesla%20coil">Tesla coil</a>) provides an <a href="electric%20spark">electric spark</a>. This spark is a conductive path for the welding current through the shielding gas and allows the arc to be initiated while the electrode and the workpiece are separated, typically about apart. 

Once the arc is struck, the welder moves the torch in a small circle to create a welding pool, the size of which depends on the size of the electrode and the amount of current. While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator then moves the torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as it is needed.

Welders often develop a technique of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is withdrawn from the weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain some distance from the arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks at the end of the weld.

<a href="Welder">Welder</a>s wear <a href="protective%20clothing">protective clothing</a>, including light and thin <a href="leather">leather</a> <a href="glove">glove</a>s and protective long sleeve shirts with high collars, to avoid exposure to strong <a href="ultraviolet%20light">ultraviolet light</a>. Due to the absence of smoke in GTAW, the electric arc light is not covered by fumes and particulate matter as in stick welding or <a href="shielded%20metal%20arc%20welding">shielded metal arc welding</a>, and thus is a great deal brighter, subjecting operators to strong ultraviolet light. The welding arc has a different range and strength of UV light wavelengths from sunlight, but the welder is very close to the source and the light intensity is very strong. Potential arc light damage includes accidental flashes to the eye or <a href="arc%20eye">arc eye</a> and skin damage similar to strong <a href="sunburn">sunburn</a>. Operators wear opaque helmets with dark eye lenses and full head and neck coverage to prevent this exposure to UV light. Modern helmets often feature a <a href="liquid%20crystal">liquid crystal</a>-type face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to the bright light of the struck arc. Transparent welding curtains, made of a <a href="polyvinyl%20chloride">polyvinyl chloride</a> plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.

Welders are also often exposed to dangerous gases and <a href="particulate">particulate</a> matter. While the process doesn't produce smoke, the brightness of the arc in GTAW can break down surrounding air to form <a href="ozone">ozone</a> and nitric oxides. The ozone and nitric oxides react with lung tissue and moisture to create nitric acid and ozone burn. Ozone and nitric oxide levels are moderate, but exposure duration, repeated exposure, and the quality and quantity of fume extraction, and air change in the room must be monitored. Welders who do not work safely can contract emphysema and oedema of the lungs, which can lead to early death. Similarly, the heat from the arc can cause poisonous fumes to form from cleaning and degreasing materials. Cleaning operations using these agents should not be performed near the site of welding, and proper ventilation is necessary to protect the welder.

While the aerospace industry is one of the primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used in a number of other areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as that used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing <a href="spent%20nuclear%20fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a> canisters before burial.

Gas tungsten arc welding, because it affords greater control over the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first <a href="grit%20blasting">grit blasting</a> the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.

The level of heat input also affects weld quality. Low heat input, caused by low welding current or high welding speed, can limit penetration and cause the weld bead to lift away from the surface being welded. If there is too much heat input, however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increases. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in a weld with pinholes, which is weaker than a typical weld.

If the amount of current used exceeds the capability of the electrode, tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with <a href="radiography">radiography</a> and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.

The equipment required for the gas tungsten arc welding operation includes a welding torch utilizing a non-consumable tungsten electrode, a constant-current welding power supply, and a shielding gas source.

GTAW welding torches are designed for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200 <a href="Ampere">A</a>), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600 A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.

The internal metal parts of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or <a href="brass">brass</a> so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held firmly in the center of the torch with an appropriately sized <a href="collet">collet</a>, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.

The size of the welding torch nozzle depends on the amount of shielded area desired. The size of the gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of <a href="alumina">alumina</a> or a ceramic material, but <a href="fused%20quartz">fused quartz</a>, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.

Gas tungsten arc welding uses a constant current power source, meaning that the current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of GTAW are manual or semiautomatic, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult.

The preferred polarity of the GTAW system depends largely on the type of metal being welded. Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) is often employed when welding <a href="steel">steel</a>s, <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, <a href="titanium">titanium</a>, and other metals. It can also be used in automatic GTAW of aluminum or magnesium when helium is used as a shielding gas. The negatively charged electrode generates heat by emitting electrons, which travel across the arc, causing thermal ionization of the shielding gas and increasing the temperature of the base material. The ionized shielding gas flows toward the electrode, not the base material, and this can allow oxides to build on the surface of the weld. Direct current with a positively charged electrode (DCEP) is less common, and is used primarily for shallow welds since less heat is generated in the base material. Instead of flowing from the electrode to the base material, as in DCEN, electrons go the other direction, causing the electrode to reach very high temperatures. To help it maintain its shape and prevent softening, a larger electrode is often used. As the electrons flow toward the electrode, ionized shielding gas flows back toward the base material, cleaning the weld by removing oxides and other impurities and thereby improving its quality and appearance.

Alternating current, commonly used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents by making the electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them more control over the amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of <a href="rectification%20%28electricity%29">rectification</a>, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a <a href="square%20wave">square wave</a> power supply can be used, as can high-frequency to encourage arc stability.

The electrode used in GTAW is made of tungsten or a tungsten alloy, because tungsten has the highest melting temperature among pure metals, at . As a result, the electrode is not consumed during welding, though some erosion (called burn-off) can occur. Electrodes can have either a clean finish or a ground finish—clean finish electrodes have been chemically cleaned, while ground finish electrodes have been ground to a uniform size and have a polished surface, making them optimal for heat conduction. The diameter of the electrode can vary between , and their length can range from .

A number of tungsten alloys have been standardized by the <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> and the American Welding Society in ISO 6848 and AWS A5.12, respectively, for use in GTAW electrodes, and are summarized in the adjacent table.

Filler metals are also used in nearly all applications of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made of a variety of materials. In most cases, the filler metal in the form of a rod is added to the weld pool manually, but some applications call for an automatically fed filler metal, which often is stored on spools or coils.

As with other welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, <a href="shielding%20gas">shielding gas</a>es are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal <a href="embrittlement">embrittlement</a> if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.

The selection of a shielding gas depends on several factors, including the type of material being welded, joint design, and desired final weld appearance. Argon is the most commonly used shielding gas for GTAW, since it helps prevent defects due to a varying arc length. When used with alternating current, argon shielding results in high weld quality and good appearance. Another common shielding gas, helium, is most often used to increase the weld penetration in a joint, to increase the welding speed, and to weld metals with high heat conductivity, such as copper and aluminum. A significant disadvantage is the difficulty of striking an arc with helium gas, and the decreased weld quality associated with a varying arc length.

Argon-helium mixtures are also frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase control of the heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed and quality of the AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-<a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the <a href="austenite">austenite</a> in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.

Gas tungsten arc welding is most commonly used to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, but it can be applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.

Aluminum and magnesium are most often welded using alternating current, but the use of direct current is also possible, depending on the properties desired. Before welding, the work area should be cleaned and may be preheated to for aluminum or to a maximum of for thick magnesium workpieces to improve penetration and increase travel speed. AC current can provide a self-cleaning effect, removing the thin, refractory aluminum oxide (<a href="sapphire">sapphire</a>) layer that forms on aluminum metal within minutes of exposure to air. This oxide layer must be removed for welding to occur. When alternating current is used, pure tungsten electrodes or zirconiated tungsten electrodes are preferred over thoriated electrodes, as the latter are more likely to "spit" electrode particles across the welding arc into the weld. Blunt electrode tips are preferred, and pure argon shielding gas should be employed for thin workpieces. Introducing helium allows for greater penetration in thicker workpieces, but can make arc starting difficult.

Direct current of either polarity, positive or negative, can be used to weld aluminum and magnesium as well. Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) allows for high penetration. Argon is commonly used as a shielding gas for DCEN welding of aluminum. Shielding gases with high helium contents are often used for higher penetration in thicker materials. Thoriated electrodes are suitable for use in DCEN welding of aluminum. Direct current with a positively charged electrode (DCEP) is used primarily for shallow welds, especially those with a joint thickness of less than . A thoriated tungsten electrode is commonly used, along with a pure argon shielding gas.

For GTAW of <a href="plain-carbon%20steel">carbon</a> and stainless steels, the selection of a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of <a href="martensite">martensite</a> in the <a href="heat-affected%20zone">heat-affected zone</a>. <a href="Tool%20steel">Tool steel</a>s should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. <a href="Austenitic%20stainless%20steel">Austenitic stainless steel</a>s do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.

Welding dissimilar metals often introduces new difficulties to GTAW welding, because most materials do not easily fuse to form a strong bond. However, welds of dissimilar materials have numerous applications in manufacturing, repair work, and the prevention of <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> and <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a>. In some joints, a compatible filler metal is chosen to help form the bond, and this filler metal can be the same as one of the base materials (for example, using a stainless steel filler metal with stainless steel and carbon steel as base materials), or a different metal (such as the use of a nickel filler metal for joining steel and <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a>). Very different materials may be coated or "buttered" with a material compatible with a particular filler metal, and then welded. In addition, GTAW can be used in <a href="Cladding%20%28metalworking%29">cladding</a> or overlaying dissimilar materials.

When welding dissimilar metals, the joint must have an accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care should be taken to avoid melting excessive base material. Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input. The filler metal should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.

In the pulsed-current mode, the welding current rapidly alternates between two levels. The higher current state is known as the pulse current, while the lower current level is called the background current. During the period of pulse current, the weld area is heated and fusion occurs. Upon dropping to the background current, the weld area is allowed to cool and solidify. Pulsed-current GTAW has a number of advantages, including lower heat input and consequently a reduction in distortion and warpage in thin workpieces. In addition, it allows for greater control of the weld pool, and can increase weld penetration, welding speed, and quality. A similar method, manual programmed GTAW, allows the operator to program a specific rate and magnitude of current variations, making it useful for specialized applications.

The <a href="TIP%20TIG">dabber</a> variation is used to precisely place weld metal on thin edges. The automatic process replicates the motions of manual welding by feeding a cold or hot filler wire into the weld area and dabbing (or oscillating) it into the welding arc. It can be used in conjunction with pulsed current, and is used to weld a variety of alloys, including titanium, nickel, and tool steels. Common applications include rebuilding seals in <a href="jet%20engines">jet engines</a> and building up saw blades, <a href="milling%20cutter">milling cutter</a>s, <a href="drill%20bit">drill bit</a>s, and mower blades.

In Our Time (short story collection)

In Our Time is <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s first collection of <a href="short%20story">short stories</a>, published in <a href="1925%20in%20literature">1925</a> by <a href="Boni%20%26amp%3B%20Liveright">Boni & Liveright</a>, New York. Its title is derived from the English "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>", "Give peace in our time, O Lord". The collection's publication history was complex. It began with six prose <a href="vignette%20%28literature%29">vignettes</a> commissioned by <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> for a 1923 edition of "<a href="The%20Little%20Review">The Little Review</a>"; Hemingway added twelve more and in 1924 compiled the in our time edition (with a lower-case title), which was printed in Paris. To these were added fourteen short stories for the 1925 edition, including "<a href="Indian%20Camp">Indian Camp</a>" and "<a href="Big%20Two-Hearted%20River">Big Two-Hearted River</a>", two of his best-known <a href="Nick%20Adams%20%28character%29">Nick Adams</a> stories. He composed "<a href="On%20the%20Quai%20at%20Smyrna">On the Quai at Smyrna</a>" for the 1930 edition.

The stories' themes – of alienation, loss, grief, separation – continue the work Hemingway began with the vignettes, which include descriptions of acts of war, <a href="bullfighting">bullfighting</a> and current events. The collection is known for its spare language and oblique depiction of emotion, through a style known as Hemingway's "theory of omission" (<a href="Iceberg%20Theory">Iceberg Theory</a>). According to his biographer Michael Reynolds, among Hemingway's <a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>, "none is more confusing ... for its several parts – biographical, literary, editorial, and bibliographical – contain so many contradictions that any analysis will be flawed."

Hemingway's writing style attracted attention, with literary critic <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a> saying it was "of the first distinction"; the 1925 edition of "In Our Time" is considered one of Hemingway's early masterpieces.

Hemingway was 19 years old when in 1918, shortly after he was posted to the <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Italian Front</a> as a <a href="International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement">Red Cross</a> ambulance driver, he sustained a severe wound from <a href="mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> fire. For the next six months, he recuperated in a <a href="Milan">Milan</a> hospital, where he fell in love with nurse <a href="Agnes%20von%20Kurowsky">Agnes von Kurowsky</a>. Shortly after his return to the US, she informed him that she was engaged to an Italian officer. Soon after, he turned to journalism.

A few months after marrying <a href="Hadley%20Richardson">Hadley Richardson</a> in 1921, he was posted to Paris as international correspondent for the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>", reporting on the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919%E2%80%931922%29">Greco-Turkish War</a> and sporting events in Spain and Germany. In Paris he befriended <a href="Gertrude%20Stein">Gertrude Stein</a>, <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>, and <a href="John%20Dos%20Passos">John Dos Passos</a>, establishing a particularly strong friendship with Pound. Pound's influence extended to promoting the young author, placing six of Hemingway's poems in the magazine "<a href="Poetry%20%28magazine%29">Poetry</a>". In August he asked Hemingway to contribute a small volume to the <a href="literary%20modernism">modernist</a> series he was editing, and <a href="Bill%20Bird">Bill Bird</a> was publishing for his <a href="Three%20Mountains%20Press">Three Mountains Press</a>, which Pound envisioned as the "Inquest into the state of the modern English language". Pound's commission turned Hemingway's attention toward fiction, and had profound consequences on his development as a writer.
On December 2, 1922, nearly all of Hemingway's early writing – his <a href="juvenilia">juvenilia</a> and apprentice fiction, including the duplicates – was lost. He had been sent on assignment to cover the <a href="Conference%20of%20Lausanne">Conference of Lausanne</a>, leaving Hadley, who was sick with a cold, behind in Paris. In <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a> he spent days covering the conference, and the evenings drinking with <a href="Lincoln%20Steffens">Lincoln Steffens</a>. Before setting off to meet him in Switzerland, thinking he would want to show his work to Steffens, Hadley packed all his manuscripts into a valise which was subsequently stolen at <a href="Paris-Gare%20de%20Lyon">Gare de Lyon</a> train station. Although angry and upset, Hemingway went with Hadley to Chamby (<a href="Montreux">Montreux</a>) to ski, and apparently did not post a reward for the recovery of the valise. An early story, "<a href="Up%20in%20Michigan">Up in Michigan</a>", survived the loss because Gertrude Stein had told him it was unprintable (in part because of a seduction scene), and he had stuffed it in a drawer.

A month later in a letter to Pound, he mentioned that "You, naturally, would say, "Good" etc. But don't say it to me. I ain't reached that mood." In his reply, Pound pointed out that Hemingway had only lost "the "time" it will ... take you to rewrite the parts you can remember ... If the middle, i.e., "FORM", of the story is right then one ought to be able to reassemble it from memory ... If the thing wobbles and won't reform ... then it never "wd." have been "right"." Critics are uncertain whether he took Pound's advice and re-created existing stories or whether everything he wrote after the loss of the suitcase was new.

In February 1923, Hemingway and Hadley visited Italy; in <a href="Rapallo">Rapallo</a> they met Pound, who almost certainly commissioned the prose pieces for the literary magazine "<a href="The%20Little%20Review">The Little Review</a>" during their visit. Still upset at the loss of his work, Hemingway had not written since the previous December, but he slowly wrote six new paragraphs, submitting them for the March deadline. Hemingway scholar Milton Cohen says at that point Hemingway knew the pieces for "The Little Review" would "govern the remainder of the book that Pound had commissioned."

The six prose pieces ranged from 75 to 187 words and were about war and bullfighting. The battle scenes came from the experiences of Hemingway's friend <a href="Eric%20Dorman-Smith">Chink Dorman-Smith</a> who was at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mons">Battle of Mons</a>; the matador story originated from another friend, Mike Strater. Hemingway himself witnessed the events which inspired the story about the Greco-Turkish War. The last of the series was taken from news of the execution of six Greek cabinet ministers during the <a href="Trial%20of%20the%20Six">Trial of the Six</a>.

The "Little Review"'s "Exiles" edition, scheduled to be published in the spring, was finally released in October 1923, leading with Hemingway's work. It featured pieces from modernists such as Gertrude Stein, <a href="George%20Antheil">George Antheil</a>, <a href="E.%20E.%20Cummings">E. E. Cummings</a> and <a href="Jean%20Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a>. Hemingway's vignettes were titled "In Our Time", suggesting a cohesive set.

In June 1923, Hemingway took Hadley, with <a href="Robert%20McAlmon">Robert McAlmon</a> and Bird, to Spain where he found a new passion with his first visits to the bullfights. During the summer he wrote five new vignettes (chapters 12–16), all about bullfighting, finishing the last two on his return to Paris in August. That summer he also honed new narrative techniques in chapters 7–11. In August he reported to Pound that he was about to begin the last two pieces (chapters 17 and 18), implemented revisions that Pound suggested, and sent the manuscript to Bill Bird. Then he left Paris with Hadley (who was pregnant with their first child) for Toronto, where he was living when Bird finished producing the book.

The pieces he submitted to Bird were at first untitled (Pound called the submission "Blank"); later the title "in our time" – from the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" – was chosen. Bird printed the volume on a hand-press with handmade paper, telling Hemingway, "I'm going to pull something really fancy with your book". The book contained eighteen vignettes and only thirty-one pages; each one was laid out with plenty of white space, highlighting the brevity of the prose. According to Cohen, the "visual suddenness intensifies its narrative abruptness, heightens the shock of violence, and the chillingly matter-of-fact tone". The book's presentation was intended as unconventional, with its use of lowercase throughout and lack of quotation marks. When challenged by American editors over the use of lowercase in the titles, Hemingway admitted that it could be seen as "silly and affected".

Bird designed the distinctive <a href="dust%20jacket">dust jacket</a> – a collage of newspaper articles in four languages – to highlight that the vignettes carried a sense of journalism or news. The frontispiece is a <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> portrait of the author, which during the printing process bled through to the next page, ruining more than half the print run so that only 170 of the 300 copies printed were deemed suitable to sell. The rest were sent to reviewers and friends.

A year later Hemingway was back in Paris, where he wrote some of his best short stories and told Scott Fitzgerald that, of the new material, "<a href="Indian%20Camp">Indian Camp</a>" and "<a href="Big%20Two-Hearted%20River">Big Two-Hearted River</a>" were superior. Over the next six months, one of his most productive periods according to critic Jackson Benson, he wrote eight short stories. The stories were combined with the earlier vignettes and sent to <a href="Boni%20%26amp%3B%20Liveright">Boni & Liveright</a> in New York toward the end of the year. In March he was in <a href="Schruns">Schruns</a>, Austria when the acceptance cable and $100 advance arrived, with a request to option his next two books. Directly afterward, he received a letter from <a href="Maxwell%20Perkins">Max Perkins</a> of <a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Scribner's</a>, who had read Bird's Paris edition and thought it lacked commercial appeal, and queried whether the young writer had stories to offer to bolster the collection. In his reply, Hemingway explained that he had already entered a contract with Boni & Liveright. When he received the contract for the book, Boni & Liveright requested that "Up in Michigan" be dropped for fear it might be censored; in response Hemingway wrote "<a href="The%20Battler">The Battler</a>" to replace the earlier story.

The 1925 New York edition contained the fourteen short stories with the vignettes interwoven as "interchapters". Boni & Liveright published the book on October 5, 1925, with a print-run of 1335 copies, costing $2 each, which saw four reprints. The firm designed a "modish" dust jacket, similar to the Paris edition, and elicited endorsements from Ford Madox Ford, <a href="Gilbert%20Seldes">Gilbert Seldes</a>, John Dos Passos, and <a href="Donald%20Ogden%20Stewart">Donald Ogden Stewart</a>. Boni & Liveright claimed American copyright for the works published in France.

Hemingway was disappointed with the publisher's marketing efforts, and that December he complained to Boni & Liveright about their handling of the book, citing a lack of advertising, claiming they could have had "20,000 in sales" and that he should have requested a $1000 advance. He later broke his contract with the firm, signing with Max Perkins at Scribner's the following year. Scribner's bought the rights from Boni & Liveright, releasing the second American edition on October 24, 1930, which saw one reprint. The Scribner's edition included an introduction by <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a> and Hemingway's "Introduction by the Author", which was renamed as "<a href="On%20the%20Quai%20at%20Smyrna">On the Quai at Smyrna</a>" in the 1938 publication of "<a href="The%20Fifth%20Column%20and%20the%20First%20Forty-Nine%20Stories">The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories</a>". When "In Our Time" was re-issued in 1955, "On the Quai at Smyrna" replaced "Indian Camp" as the first story.

The 1924 "in our time" collection consists of eighteen vignettes. Five center on World War I (Chapters 1, 4, 5, 7, 8), and six on bullfighting (Chapters 2 and 12 to 16); the others center around news stories. Chapter 10 is the longest; it details a soldier's affair with a <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> nurse, and is based on Hemingway's relationship with Agnes von Kurowsky. The piece about a robbery and murder in Kansas City originated in a newspaper story Hemingway covered as a cub reporter at "<a href="The%20Kansas%20City%20Star">The Kansas City Star</a>"; it is followed by the story of the public hanging of the Chicago mobster <a href="Sam%20Cardinelli">Sam Cardinelli</a>. The last, ""L'Envoi"", is about the <a href="Constantine%20I%20of%20Greece">King of Greece</a> and <a href="Sophia%20of%20Prussia">Sophia of Prussia</a> giving an interview in the palace garden <a href="11%20September%201922%20Revolution">during the Revolution</a>.

The 1925 New York edition begins with the short stories "Indian Camp" and "<a href="The%20Doctor%20and%20the%20Doctor%27s%20Wife">The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife</a>". The two are linked thematically; they are set in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> and introduce <a href="Nick%20Adams%20%28character%29">Nick Adams</a>. Nick witnesses an emergency <a href="caesarean%20section">caesarean section</a> and a suicide in the first; the tension between his parents in the second. The next story, "<a href="The%20End%20of%20Something">The End of Something</a>", is also set in Michigan, and details Nick's break-up with his girlfriend; "<a href="The%20Three-Day%20Blow">The Three-Day Blow</a>" follows, where Nick and a friend get drunk. "<a href="The%20Battler">The Battler</a>" is about Nick's chance encounter with a prize-fighter. "<a href="A%20Very%20Short%20Story">A Very Short Story</a>", which was the longest vignette in the previous edition, comes next and is followed by "<a href="Soldier%27s%20Home">Soldier's Home</a>", set in Oklahoma, and "<a href="The%20Revolutionist">The Revolutionist</a>", set in Italy. The next three are set in Europe and detail unhappy marriages: "<a href="Mr.%20and%20Mrs.%20Elliot">Mr. and Mrs. Elliot</a>", "<a href="Cat%20in%20the%20Rain">Cat in the Rain</a>" and "<a href="Out%20of%20Season%20%28short%20story%29">Out of Season</a>". They are placed before Nick's reappearance in "<a href="Cross%20Country%20Snow">Cross Country Snow</a>", which takes place in Switzerland. The penultimate "<a href="My%20Old%20Man%20%28short%20story%29">My Old Man</a>" concerns horse-racing in Italy and Paris, and the volume ends with the two-part Nick Adams story "Big Two-Hearted River", set in Michigan. The vignettes were re-ordered and placed between the short stories as interchapters.

Whether the collection has a unified structure has been a source of debate among Hemingway critics. According to Reynolds the collection should be "read as a predictable step in any young author's career" and the pieces considered as "discrete units". Yet he admits that Hemingway's remarks, and the complexity of the structure, suggests the stories and vignettes were meant to be an interconnected whole. In a letter to Pound in August 1923, Hemingway told him he had finished the full set of eighteen vignettes, saying of them, "When they are read together, they all hook up ... The bulls start, then reappear, then finish off. The war starts clear and noble just like it did ... gets close and blurred and finished with the feller who goes home and gets clap." He went on to say of "in our time" that "it has form all right". On October 18, 1924, he wrote to Edmund Wilson, "Finished the book of 14 stories with a chapter of 'In Our Time' between each story – that is the way they are meant to go – to give the picture of the whole before examining it in detail".

Benson notes that all the fiction Hemingway had produced was included in the collection, that the connection between stories and vignettes is tenuous at best, and that Pound had an influence in editing the final product. Benson calls the work a "prose poem of terror", where looking for connections is meaningless. Conversely, Linda Wagner-Martin suggests the unrelenting tone of horror and somber mood unify the separate pieces. One of its early reviewers, <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>, referred to it as a "<a href="fragmentary%20novel">fragmentary novel</a>".
Hemingway scholar Wendolyn Tetlow says that from its inception the collection was written with a rhythmic and lyrical unity reminiscent of Pound's "<a href="Hugh%20Selwyn%20Mauberley">Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</a>" and <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a>'s "<a href="The%20Waste%20Land">The Waste Land</a>". The carefully crafted sequence continues in the 1925 edition, beginning with the first five Nick Adams stories, which are about violence and doom, empty relationships and characters lacking self-awareness. The first two stories, "Indian Camp" and "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife", can be read as an exercise in <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>, where feelings of loss, anger, and evil are ignored and repressed. "The End of Something" and "The Three-Day Blow" also form a pair; in the first Nick breaks up with his girlfriend, in the second he gets drunk and denies the relationship has ended, convincing himself that it will all work out. This state of denial continues in "The Battler", the fifth story; when faced with violence Nick will not recognize that he is in danger. "A Very Short Story", about betrayal, and wounding, ends the sequence according to Tetlow, who suggests these are stories in which Hemingway writes about the "most bitter feelings of loss and disillusionment". The characters face loss with inner strength, stoicism and a sense of acceptance; they build strength in the stories that come after, gaining self-awareness as they accept the futility and pain of life. The collection ends with "Big Two-Hearted River", in which Nick finds tranquility, perhaps even happiness, in solitude. Wagner-Martin notes that "it is this essential tranquility that in retrospect heightens the tension and sorrow of the preceding pieces."

Another Hemingway scholar, Jim Berloon, disagrees with Tetlow, writing that its only unity consists of similarities in tone and style and the recurrence of the Nick Adams character. Although the first vignettes share a common thread about the war, each is distinctly framed, weakening any structural unity that might have existed. He blames the war, saying that it was too hard for Hemingway to write about it cohesively, that it was "too large, terrible, and mentally overwhelming to grasp in its entirety". Instead, he says, Hemingway wrote fragments, "discrete glimpses into hell ... like the wreckage of battle lit up from a shell burst at night." The structure apparent in the 1924 collection of vignettes is lost in the later edition because the short stories seem to bear little if any relationship to the interchapters, shattering the carefully constructed order. The sense of discordance is intensified because the action is about unnamed men and soldiers, only referred to with pronouns, and unspecified woundings. The characters are transformed through circumstances and settings, where danger exists overtly, on the battlefield, or, in one case, by a chance sexual encounter in a Chicago taxi.

Critic E. R. Hageman notes the 1924 "in our time" vignettes are linked chronologically, spanning ten years from 1914 to 1923, and the choices were deliberate. World War I and the aftermath were ""the" experience of his generation, the experience that dumped his peers and his elders into graves, shell-holes, hospitals, and onto gallows. These were 'in our time', Hemingway is saying, and he remarks the significant and the insignificant."

The stories contain themes Hemingway was to revisit over the course of his career. He wrote about initiation rites, early love, marriage problems, disappointment in family life and the importance of male comradeship. The collection conjures a world of violence and war, suffering, executions; it is a world stripped of romance, where even "the hero of the bullfight chapter pukes". Hemingway's early-20th century is a time "out of season", where war, death, and tangled, unfulfilling relationships reign. <a href="Social%20alienation">Alienation</a> in the modern world is particularly evident in "Out of Season", which bears similarities to Eliot's "The Waste Land". Eliot's "Waste Land" motif exists throughout much of Hemingway's early fiction, but is most notable in this collection, "<a href="The%20Sun%20Also%20Rises">The Sun Also Rises</a>" (1926), and "<a href="A%20Farewell%20to%20Arms">A Farewell to Arms</a>" (1929). He borrowed Eliot's device of using imagery to evoke feeling. Benson attributes similarities between Hemingway and Eliot to Pound, who edited both.

Motifs and themes reappear, the most obvious being the juxtaposition of life and death. There are some recurring images such as water and darkness – places of safety. Benson notes how, after reading the first few vignettes and stories, readers "realize we are in hell." Hemingway conjures a world where "the weak are pitilessly exploited by the strong, and ... all functions of life ... promise only pain."

Hemingway's semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams is "vital to Hemingway's career", writes Mellow, and generally his character reflects Hemingway's experiences. Nick, who features in eight of the stories, is an <a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a>, a means for Hemingway to express his own experiences, from the first story '"Indian Camp" which features Nick as a child. According to critic Howard Hannum, the trauma of birth and suicide Hemingway paints in "Indian Camp" rendered a <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a> that gave Hemingway a unified framework for the Nick Adams stories. It is followed by "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife", which Mellows says is written with a sense of "hostility and resignation", and sheds a rare light on Hemingway's childhood. In the story, 12-year-old Nick hides from his angry and violent father; the mother, a <a href="Christian%20Science">Christian Scientist</a>, is distanced, withdrawn in her bedroom, reading "<a href="Science%20and%20Health%20with%20Key%20to%20the%20Scriptures">Science and Health</a>".

"Big Two-Hearted River", the concluding and climactic piece, details Nick's return from war. In it Nick knows he has left his needs behind; Debra Moddelmog highlights how all of the Nick storylines, and most of the others in the collection, are about a "flight from pain". She believes that Gertrude Stein's definition of the <a href="Lost%20Generation">Lost Generation</a> applies to "In Our Time" as much, if not more so, as to "The Sun Also Rises"; that "Nick seems to believe that the things most worth having and caring about – life, love, ideals, companions, peace, freedom – will be lost sooner or later, and he is not sure how to cope with this assurance, except through irony, bitterness, and, sometimes, wishful thinking." In the last story he learns to come to terms with the loss of his friends, and acknowledges "all the loss he has experienced in the last few years and, equally important, the loss he has come to expect."

Biographer Mellow believes that "In Our Time" is Hemingway's most experimental book, particularly with its unusual narrative form. The vignettes have no traditional sense of narrative; they begin in the middle. Shifting points-of-view and narrative perspectives disguise autobiographical details.

Pound taught Hemingway to write sparingly. Pound wrote to him that "anything put on top of the subject is BAD ... The subject is always interesting enough without blankets." Hemingway would write in "<a href="A%20Moveable%20Feast">A Moveable Feast</a>" (published posthumously in 1964), "If I started to write elaborately, like someone presenting or introducing something, I found that I could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written." "In Our Time" was written during the author's experimentation phase, his first attempts towards a minimalist style. The prose in "Indian Camp" and "Big Two-Hearted River" is sharper and more abstract than in other stories, and by employing simple sentences and diction – techniques he learned writing for newspapers – the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality, explains Benson. The tightly compressed sentence structure emulates and reflects Pound's <a href="imagism">imagist</a> style, bringing to prose narrative the stripped-down style Pound famously established in 1913 with poems such as "<a href="In%20a%20Station%20of%20the%20Metro">In a Station of the Metro</a>". Thomas Strychacz compares Hemingway's prose to Pound's poetry, writing, "Hemingway's terse, tight-lipped, tightly wound fragments are equally extraordinary in their dramatic intensity."

The taut style is apparent from the first vignette, in which a brigade of drunken soldiers march to <a href="Champagne%20%28wine%20region%29">Champagne</a>. With supreme understatement he alludes to the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Champagne">Second Battle of Champagne</a>, an offensive lasting from September to December 25, 1915, in which 120,000 French troops were killed in the first three weeks:

The vignette opening with the words "We were in a garden at Mons" is equally understated; the narrator writes, "The first German I saw climbed up over the garden wall. We waited till he got one leg over then potted him. He ... looked awfully surprised". The description repeats images, is dispassionate and warps logic, according to Strychacz.

These set the model for <a href="flash%20fiction">flash fiction</a> – fiction that is condensed without unnecessary descriptive detail. In "A Moveable Feast" Hemingway wrote that "Out of Season", written in 1924, was the first story where he applied the theory of omission, known as his <a href="Iceberg%20Theory">Iceberg Theory</a>. He explained that the stories in which he left out the most important parts, such as not writing about the war in "Big Two-Hearted River", are the best of his early fiction. As <a href="Carlos%20Baker">Carlos Baker</a> describes the technique, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Hemingway wrote in the preface to "<a href="Death%20in%20the%20Afternoon">Death in the Afternoon</a>", a writer may choose what to include and what to omit from a story.

Hemingway's writing style attracted attention after the release of the Parisian edition of "in our time" in 1924. Edmund Wilson described the writing as "of the first destinction", writing that the bullfight scenes were like <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a> paintings, that the author "had almost invented a form of his own", and it had "more artistic dignity than any written by an American about the period of the war."

The 1925 edition of "In Our Time" is considered one of Hemingway's masterpieces. Reviewers and critics noticed, and the collection received positive reviews on its publication. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described the language as "fibrous and athletic, colloquial and fresh, hard and clean, his very prose seems to have an organic being of its own". A reviewer for "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" wrote, "Ernest Hemingway is somebody; a new honest un-'literary' transcriber of life – a Writer." Reviewing if for "<a href="The%20Bookman%20%28New%20York%29">The Bookman</a>", F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote Hemingway was an "augury" of the age and that the Nick Adams stories were "temperamentally new" in American fiction.

His parents, however, described the book as "filth", disturbed by the passage in "A Very Short Story" which tells of a soldier contracting <a href="gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a> after a sexual encounter with a sales girl in a taxicab. Bird sent five copies to them which were promptly returned, eliciting a letter from Hemingway, who complained, "I wonder what was the matter, whether the pictures were too accurate and the attitude toward life not sufficiently distorted to please who ever bought the book or what?"

"In Our Time" was ignored and forgotten by literary critics for decades. Benson attributes the neglect to various factors. "<a href="The%20Sun%20Also%20Rises">The Sun Also Rises</a>", published the next year, is considered the more important book followed fairly rapidly by the popular "<a href="A%20Farewell%20to%20Arms">A Farewell to Arms</a>" two years after in 1928; critics' general assumption seemed to be that Hemingway's talent lay in writing prose rather than "sophisticated, complex design"; and "In Our Time" stories were combined with subsequent collections in the publication of "<a href="The%20Fifth%20Column%20and%20the%20First%20Forty-Nine%20Stories">The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories</a>" in 1938, drawing the critics' attention away from the book as an entity, toward the individual stories. In 1962, when Scribner's released the paperback edition of "In Our Time", it began to be taught in American universities, and by the end of the decade, the first critical study of the collection appeared. Benson describes the collection as the author's first "major achievement"; Wagner-Martin as "his most striking work, both in terms of personal involvement and technical innovation."

True at First Light

True at First Light is a book by American novelist <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> about his 1953–54 East African <a href="safari">safari</a> with his fourth wife <a href="Mary%20Hemingway">Mary</a>, released posthumously in his centennial year in 1999. The book received mostly negative or lukewarm reviews from the popular press and sparked a literary controversy regarding how, and whether, an author's work should be reworked and published after his death. Unlike critics in the popular press, Hemingway scholars generally consider "True at First Light" to be complex and a worthy addition to his <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a> of later fiction.

In a two-day period in January 1954, Hemingway and Mary were in two plane crashes in the African bush. He was reported dead by the international press, arriving in <a href="Entebbe">Entebbe</a> to face questions from reporters. The severity of his injuries was not completely known until he returned to Europe months later. Hemingway spent much of the next two years in <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, recuperating and writing the manuscript of what he called 'the Africa book', which remained unfinished at the time of his suicide in July, 1961. In the 1970s, Mary donated it along with his other manuscripts to the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Library">John F. Kennedy Library</a>. The manuscript was released to Hemingway's son <a href="Patrick%20Hemingway">Patrick</a> in the mid-1990s. Patrick edited the work to half its original length to strengthen the underlying storyline and emphasize the fictional aspects. The result is a blend of <a href="memoir">memoir</a> and fiction.

In the book, Hemingway explores conflict within a marriage, the conflict between the European and native cultures in Africa, and the fear a writer feels when his work becomes impossible. The book includes descriptions of his earlier friendships with other writers and digressive ruminations on the nature of writing.

Hemingway went on <a href="safari">safari</a> to Africa in 1933 with his second wife <a href="Pauline%20Pfeiffer">Pauline</a> and always intended to return. That visit inspired Hemingway's "<a href="The%20Snows%20of%20Kilimanjaro%20%28short%20story%29">Snows of Kilimanjaro</a>" published in "<a href="The%20Green%20Hills%20of%20Africa">The Green Hills of Africa</a>", well-known parts of the Hemingway canon. Two decades later in 1953, having finished writing" <a href="The%20Old%20Man%20and%20the%20Sea">The Old Man and the Sea</a>", he planned a trip to Africa to visit his son <a href="Patrick%20Hemingway">Patrick</a> who lived in <a href="Tanganyika">Tanganyika</a>. When "<a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">Look</a>" magazine offered to send him to Africa, paying $15,000 for expenses, $10,000 for rights to a 3500 word piece about the trip, and <a href="Earl%20Theisen">Earl Theisen</a> as official photographer to go with him, he quickly accepted. Hemingway and <a href="Mary%20Hemingway">Mary</a> left Cuba in June, traveling first to Europe to make arrangements and leaving from Venice to Tanganyika a few months later. They arrived in August, and Hemingway was thrilled to be deputized as an honorary ranger, writing in a letter, "due to emergency (<a href="Mau%20Mau">Mau Mau</a> rebellion) been acting game ranger". <a href="Philip%20Percival">Philip Percival</a>, Hemingway's safari guide in 1933, joined the couple for the four-month expedition; they traveled from the banks of the <a href="Salengai">Salengai</a>, where Earl Theisen photographed Hemingway with a herd of elephants, to the <a href="Kimana%20Swamp">Kimana Swamp</a>, the <a href="Rift%20Valley%20Province">Rift Valley</a> and then on to visit Patrick in central Tanganyika. After visiting Patrick at his farm, they settled for two months on the north slopes of <a href="Mt.%20Kilimanjaro">Mt. Kilimanjaro</a>. During this period Percival left their camp to return to his farm, leaving Hemingway as <a href="game%20warden">game warden</a> with local scouts reporting to him. Hemingway was proud to be a game warden and believed a book would come of the experience.
On January 21 Hemingway chartered a sightseeing flight of the <a href="Congo%20Basin">Congo Basin</a> as a late Christmas present to Mary; two days later, on their way to photograph <a href="Murchison%20Falls">Murchison Falls</a> from the air, the plane hit an abandoned utility pole and crashed, with the passengers sustaining minor injuries. That night they camped in the bush waiting for a response to their distress call. The crash site was seen by a passing airliner that reported no survivors, and the news of Hemingway's death was telegraphed around the world. The next day they were found and picked up by a <a href="Bush%20flying">bush pilot</a>, but his <a href="de%20Havilland">de Havilland</a> caught fire during take-off, crashed and exploded, which left Hemingway with a concussion, scalp wound, double-vision, intermittent hearing in his left ear, a crushed vertebra, ruptured liver, spleen and kidney, and burns. The explosion burned their passports, "thirty rolls of exposed film, three pairs of Ernest's bifocals, all of their money, and their $15,000 letter of credit." The group traveled to <a href="Entebbe">Entebbe</a> by road, where journalists from around the world had gathered to report his death. On January 26 Hemingway briefed and joked with the reporters, and spent the next few weeks in <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a> recuperating and reading his obituaries. During his recuperation Hemingway immediately prepared the piece for "Look". The magazine paid him an additional $20,000 for an exclusive about the plane crashes. Biographer Michael Reynolds writes that the piece, "ran for twenty magazine pages spread out over two issues", with the first issue bearing a publication date of 26 January.

In spite of his injuries, Hemingway joined Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing trip in February, but he was irascible and difficult to get along with. When a bushfire broke out, Hemingway fell into the fire while helping extinguish the flames, burning himself on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm. Months later in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, Hemingway was diagnosed with two cracked <a href="Intervertebral%20disc">discs</a>, a kidney and liver rupture, a <a href="dislocated%20shoulder">dislocated shoulder</a> and a broken skull.

As soon as Hemingway returned to <a href="Finca%20Vig%C3%ADa">Finca Vigía</a> in Cuba, he began work on a book about the safari, wanting to write while it was still vivid in his memory. He quickly wrote 10,000 words, despite his pain (eventually the manuscript grew to about 800 pages). In September 1954, Hemingway wrote in a letter, "At present I work at about 1/2 the capacity I should but everything is better all the time." However, three months later in late December he wrote in a letter: "This has been sort of a rough year ... We call this 'black-ass' and one should never have it. But I get tired of pain sometimes, even if that is an ignoble feeling."

Almost a year later in October 1955, he declared: "Am passed 650 pages in the book. Am trying to write now like a good sorcer's (sic) apprentice ... always start to write as an apprentice. By the end of the book you are a master but if you commence as master in writing anyway, you end as a bloody bore." Two months later, Hemingway was bedridden with kidney disease. By January 1956, he acknowledged, in a letter written on the second anniversary of the accidents, he was having trouble remembering the trip. In 1956, Hemingway agreed to work on the filming of "<a href="The%20Old%20Man%20and%20the%20Sea%20%281958%20film%29">The Old Man and the Sea</a>" and abandoned work on the Africa book. He wrote to his editor, "I found it impossible to resume writing on the Africa book." Hemingway put the manuscript in a safe-deposit box in Havana, although after the 1959 <a href="Cuban%20revolution">Cuban revolution</a> he feared the manuscript lost.

The book is set in mid-20th century <a href="Kenya%20Colony">Kenya Colony</a> during the <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Mau-Mau</a> rebellion. In his introduction to "True at First Light", Patrick Hemingway describes the <a href="Kikuyu%20people">Kikuyu</a> and <a href="Kamba%20people">Kamba</a> tribes at the time of the Mau-Mau rebellion. He explains that if the Kamba had joined the rebellion, Ernest and Mary Hemingway "would have then stood a good chance of being hacked to death in their beds as they slept by the very servants they so trusted and thought they understood." The book takes place in December while the narrator, Ernest, and his wife, Mary, are in a safari camp in the Kenyan highlands on the flank of Mt. Kilimanjaro, where they find themselves temporarily at risk when a group of Mau-Mau rebels escape from jail.
The blend of travel memoir and fiction opens with the white hunter Philip Percival leaving the safari group to visit his farm, handing control of the camp to Ernest, who is worried about being attacked and robbed, because there are guns, alcohol, and food in the camp. Deputized as an assistant game warden, he makes daily rounds in the <a href="game%20reserve">game reserve</a>, and maintains communication with the local tribes. He is accompanied by two African game scouts, Chungo and Arap Meina and, for a period, the district game warden G.C (Gin Crazed). Other camp members include Keiti, who runs the camp, the safari cook, Mbebia, and two stewards, Nguili and Msembi.

For six months Mary has been tracking a large black-maned lion, determined to finish the hunt by Christmas. In subsequent chapters, Ernest worries that Mary is unable to kill the lion for various reasons: she is too short to see the prey in the tall grass; she misses her shots with other game; and he thinks she is too soft-hearted to kill the animal. During this period, Ernest becomes entranced with Debba, a woman from a local village, whom the others jokingly refer to as his second wife. From her and the villagers he wants to learn tribal practices and customs.

When Mary's lion is finally killed at the book's halfway mark, the local "shamba" (village) gathers for a "ngoma" (dance). Because she has dysentery, Mary leaves for Nairobi to see a doctor; while she is gone Ernest kills a leopard, after which the men have a protracted "ngoma". When Mary returns from Nairobi, she asks Ernest for an airborne sightseeing tour of the Congo Basin as a Christmas present.

Ernest describes his close relationships with the local men; indulges in memories of previous relationships with writers such as <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, and <a href="D.H.%20Lawrence">D.H. Lawrence</a>; and satirizes the role of organized religion. Subjects as diverse as the smell of the pine woods in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, the nature of <a href="Parisian%20caf%C3%A9">Parisian café</a>s, and the quality of <a href="Georges%20Simenon">Simenon</a>'s writing are treated with <a href="stream%20of%20consciousness%20%28narrative%20mode%29">stream of consciousness</a> digressions.

The back of the book includes a section titled "Cast of Characters", a <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a> <a href="glossary">glossary</a>, and the editor's acknowledgments.

The ownership of Hemingway's manuscripts is complicated. Two books have been published from the African book manuscript: "True at First Light", edited by Patrick Hemingway, and "<a href="Under%20Kilimanjaro">Under Kilimanjaro</a>", edited by scholars Robert Lewis and <a href="Robert%20E.%20Fleming">Robert Fleming</a>. In 1965 Mary Hemingway established the Hemingway Foundation, and in the 1970s she donated her husband's papers to the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Library">John F. Kennedy Library</a>. A group of Hemingway scholars met in 1980 to assess the donated papers when they formed the Hemingway Society, "committed to supporting and fostering Hemingway scholarship". After Mary Hemingway's 1986 death, Hemingway's sons <a href="John%20Hemingway">John</a> and Patrick asked the Hemingway Society to take on the duties of the Hemingway Foundation; in 1997 the Hemingway Estate and the Hemingway Society/Foundation agreed to a two-part publishing plan for the African book. An abridged trade publication of "True at First Light" was to be published in 1999, to be edited by Patrick Hemingway; the Hemingway Foundation would then oversee the reworking of the entire text, to be published as "Under Kilimanjaro". Of "Under Kilimanjaro", the editors claim "this book deserves as complete and faithful a publication as possible without editorial distortion, speculation, or textually unsupported attempts at improvement".

In the early 1970s, portions of the manuscript had been serialized in "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" and anthologized. Mary Hemingway approved the segments published by "Sports Illustrated": segments described by Patrick Hemingway as a "straight account of a shooting safari". In a 1999 talk presented at the annual Oak Park Hemingway Society dinner, Patrick Hemingway admitted ownership of Ernest Hemingway's manuscripts had "a rather tortuous history". Access to the Africa manuscript—and to other Hemingway material—required a lawsuit and an eventual agreement with the Hemingway Society.

<a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Scribner's</a> requested a book of fewer than 100,000 words. Patrick Hemingway worked for two years with the 200,000-word manuscript—initially converting to an electronic format, and then editing out superfluous material. He strengthened the storyline, and eliminated long descriptive passages with disparaging remarks about family members and living persons. He explains the manuscript was a draft lacking "ordinary housekeeping chores" such as character names. The cuts made, he said, maintained the integrity of the story and "the reader is not deprived of the essential quality of the book".

"True at First Light" was published on July 7, 1999 with a print run of 200,000. For the publicity campaign, Patrick Hemingway appeared on the "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">Today Show</a>" on the day of publication. The book became the main selection for the <a href="Book%20of%20the%20Month%20Club">Book of the Month Club</a> (BOMC), was serialized in the "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">New Yorker</a>", and rights were sold for translations to Danish, French, German, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish. A <a href="Audiobook">sound recording</a> was released in 2007.

In "The New York Times" James Woods described "True at First Light" as a travel journal that became a "fanciful memoir" and then a novel of sorts. Patrick Hemingway believed adamantly the manuscript was more than a journal. He emphasized the storyline because, as he explains, "the essential quality of the book is an action with a love interest". He tightened the hunting scenes, and to honor his father's statement to the reader that "where I go, you go" he emphasized the mid-20th century Africa scenes and "the real relation between people ... on that continent". Although he fictionalized the storyline, Patrick Hemingway said of the characters, "I knew every single one ... very well indeed". Hemingway scholar Robert Fleming (who reworked the manuscript as "Under Kilimanjaro") considers Patrick Hemingway's editing essentially to be correct because he believes the work shows evidence of an author unable to "turn off the mechanism that produces fiction". The marital conflict is where Fleming believes the book took "a metafictional turn". The published book is marketed as fiction.

Fleming considers "True at First Light" similar to Hemingway's "<a href="Green%20Hills%20of%20Africa">Green Hills of Africa</a>" and "<a href="A%20Moveable%20Feast">A Moveable Feast</a>"—a book that presents a primary topic as a backdrop interspersed with internal dialogue. Unlike the other two books, "True at First Light" is without a preface "indicating the intentions of the author or dictating how he intended to have the book read". Fleming thinks Hemingway regarded "Green Hills of Africa" as experimental and "A Moveable Feast" as fiction. Rose Marie Burwell, author of "Hemingway: The Postwar Years and the Posthumous Novels", believes Hemingway enjoyed writing the "strange combination of memoir and fiction". She thinks in the fictional aspects of "True at First Light" he is free to imagine a second wife and to jettison his Protestant background.

Hemingway is "most definitely on vacation" in "True at First Light" writes Fleming; and Burwell sees an author who is willingly and happily enjoying a vacation, behaving childishly, blissfully unaware of the effect his behavior has on the members of camp. The impression is of a man seeking to delve into cultural conflicts in Africa, which takes a fictional turn in the Debba storyline. Mary is characterized as a nag whereas the character of the writer is presented as "placid, mature, and loving", immersing himself in native culture.

Burwell and Fleming say the book's subtext is about aging, as symbolized by the writer's attraction to the younger fertile woman, and Hemingway used fertility imagery to symbolize "the aging writer's anxiety about his ability to write". The images of the old elephant symbolize the aging and unproductive writer, and Burwell approves Patrick Hemingway's decision to retain those pieces of the manuscript. Hemingway scholar Hilary Justice writes the work shows an emphasis on "the writer not writing", which for Hemingway would have been a fate worse than aging. Thus, she says, "True at First Light" invokes a paradox with "an aging writer for whom writing is becoming increasingly difficult in the moment of writing about the not-writing author". Writing, for Hemingway, had always been difficult. He revised his work endlessly and stuck to the practice of writing "one true sentence" and stopping each writing session when he still had more to write. Tom Jenks, editor of an earlier posthumously published book "<a href="The%20Garden%20of%20Eden">The Garden of Eden</a>", says Hemingway shows the worst of his writing in "True at First Light": presenting himself as a "self-pitying, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing" persona in a book that is no more than a mass of fragmentary material. Jenks thinks Hemingway is simply aimlessly writing and the plot lacks the tension notable in his earliest works such as" <a href="The%20Sun%20Also%20Rises">The Sun Also Rises</a>". However, he thinks Hemingway had good material to work with and some skeletal thematic structures show promise.

"True at First Light" shows the nature of mid-20th century conflict in Africa. <a href="Scramble%20for%20Africa">Colonialism</a> and <a href="British%20Empire">imperialism</a> pressured African tribes and wildlife. Hemingway shows an awareness of the political future and turmoil in Africa according to Patrick Hemingway, who, although he lived in <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> (formerly Tanganyika) for decades, was surprised at the degree of perception apparent in his father's mid-century writing about Africa. Hemingway scholar Anders Hallengren notes the thematic similarities in Hemingway's posthumous fiction, particularly in the final books. The genesis of "True at First Light" was an African insurrection, also symbolically depicted in "The Garden of Eden": "The conviction and purposefulness of the Maji-Maji in "The Garden of Eden", corresponds to the Kenyan Mau-Mau context of the novel "True at First Light" ". Writing for "The Hemingway Review", Robert Gajdusek says the clash of cultures is "massively active" in the book, with Hemingway exploring tribal practices; Christianity and Islam are juxtaposed against native religions; and the Mary/Debba triangle is symbolic of the white "Memsahib and the native girl".

Similar to his first African book, "Green Hills of Africa", Hemingway embeds in "True at First Light" digressions and ruminations about the nature of writing, with particular attention to <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a> and <a href="D.H.%20Lawrence">D.H. Lawrence</a>. Patrick Hemingway explains his father was interested in D.H. Lawrence's belief that each region of the world "should have its own religion"—apparent when the male character invents his own religion. Mary's intent to decorate a tree for Christmas mystified the native camp members, and Hemingway seemed to realize that Africa was a place without an influential and established religion—a place where religion could be redefined.

Although it was listed on <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"The New York Times" Best Seller list</a>, the book received poor reviews from the popular press, although better reviews from Hemingway scholars. In a pre-publication review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Ralph Blumenthal said that "True at First Light" was not as good as Hemingway's earlier <a href="Biography%20in%20literature">autobiographical fiction</a>, and he questioned whether Hemingway would have wanted his "reputation and last printed words entrusted solely to any editor, even a son". Blumenthal wondered about the autobiographical aspects of the work: the relationship between Hemingway and Debba; the background of the "Look" magazine photoshoot; the safari itself; and the subsequent plane accidents. In the 1999 "The New York Times" review, James Wood claimed Hemingway knew "True at First Light" was not a novel though the editors billed it as one. He believes Hemingway's later work became a parody of the earlier work. "True at First Light" represents the worst of Hemingway's work according to a review in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>".

<a href="Christopher%20Ondaatje">Christopher Ondaatje</a> writes in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" that the existence of a Hemingway industry tends to overshadow his posthumous work. He considers Hemingway's African stories to be among his best although the posthumous work about Africa has been disregarded or overlooked. In her piece for "<a href="Nation">Nation</a>", <a href="Brenda%20Wineapple">Brenda Wineapple</a> describes the book as "poignant but not particularly good". However, she points out that it "reminds us of Hemingway's writing at its most touching, acute and beautiful best". The review in "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" is much the same saying the "old Hemingway magic flashes sporadically, like lightning, but not often enough".

Hemingway scholars think the work is more complicated and important than a cursory read suggests. With the publication of "True at First Light" critics saw a more humane and empathetic Hemingway, and began to shift their emphasis away from the image of the "white man with a gun." Robert Fleming considers "True at First Light" to be part of the Hemingway canon declaring, "This is a more complicated book than it appears to be, and Hemingway deserves far more credit for it than the reviewers of the popular press have given it. Serious critics dealing with the late works would be advised not to ignore it". Gadjusek praises the prose style, which he says is a new direction in Hemingway's writing; he also believes, despite the editing, the book is cohesive and whole with well-ordered themes. Burwell considers the edits to the manuscript generally well-done, though she laments losses that she thinks contribute to some of the subtexts in the book. Biographer Kenneth Lynn criticized Hemingway's sons for editing the manuscript but of Hemingway he says the "memoirist is being totally, indeed helplessly honest," and Gray concedes the publication of the book "underscores Hemingway's courage as a writer". Despite what he considers poor workmanship in the book, Wood considers Hemingway even at his worst a compelling writer and he says the literary estate should be left alone to save the literary influence.

Many reviewers and writers were critical of the manner in which Patrick Hemingway edited the work. Paul Gray titled his review of the book "Where's Papa?", answering with the opening sentence, "He's hard to find in his fifth posthumous work", pointing directly to Patrick Hemingway's editing of the manuscript. Lynn thinks Hemingway would have been "outraged by his sons' refusal to honor his judgment that the manuscript was unworthy of publication" and was outraged that "Patrick Hemingway declares that his two brothers, Jack and Gregory, share his belief that 'this job was worth doing' ". Burwell also wonders whether Hemingway wanted the Africa book published, pointing to his statement, "I think maybe it would be better to wait until I'm dead to publish it", although she concedes that works by <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Chaucer</a>, <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, and <a href="Franz%20Kafka">Kafka</a> were unfinished and published posthumously. During the final two decades of his life, Hemingway had published two novels but since his death, works continue to be published. Writing in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" in 1998, <a href="Joan%20Didion">Joan Didion</a> was extremely critical of the Hemingway family and estate for commercializing and profiting from his reputation and writing rather than protecting his legacy. "The publication of unfinished work is a denial of the idea that the role of the writer in his or her work is to make it", she wrote, adding that "True at First Light" should not have been "molded" and published.

"True at First Light" was published in Hemingway's centennial year, to a marketing campaign that attracted criticism. Hemingway's sons licensed the family name and released that year items such as <a href="Thomasville%20Furniture%20Industries">Thomasville</a> furniture with labels showing the Hemingway lifestyle—"the Pamplona Sofa and the Kilimanjaro Bed"—and the <a href="Hemingway%20Ltd.">Hemingway Ltd.</a> brand, which Lynn describes as "tastefully chosen fishing rods, safari clothes, and (surely the ultimate triumph of greed over taste) shotguns".

Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)

Thomas Percy ( – 8 November 1605) was a member of the group of provincial English <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a>s who planned the failed <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605. A tall, physically impressive man, little is known of his early life beyond his <a href="matriculation">matriculation</a> in 1579 at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, and his marriage in 1591 to Martha Wright. In 1596 his second cousin once removed, <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland</a>, appointed him constable of <a href="Alnwick%20Castle">Alnwick Castle</a> and made him responsible for the Percy family's northern estates. He served the earl in the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> in about 1600–1601, and in the years before 1603 was his intermediary in a series of confidential communications with <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">King James VI of Scotland</a>.

Following James's accession to the English throne in 1603, Percy became disenchanted with the new king, who he supposed had reneged on his promises of toleration for English Catholics. His meeting in June 1603 with <a href="Robert%20Catesby">Robert Catesby</a>, a religious zealot similarly unimpressed with the new royal dynasty, led the following year to his joining Catesby's conspiracy to kill the king and his ministers by blowing up the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> with <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a>. Percy helped fund the group and secured the leases to certain properties in London, one of which was the <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a> directly beneath the House of Lords, in which the gunpowder was finally placed. The conspirators also planned to instigate an uprising in the <a href="English%20Midlands">Midlands</a> and to simultaneously kidnap James's daughter, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Princess Elizabeth</a>. Percy was to remain in London and secure the capture of her brother, <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Henry</a>.

When the plot was exposed early on 5 November 1605, Percy immediately fled to the Midlands, catching up with some of the other conspirators "en route" to <a href="Dunchurch">Dunchurch</a> in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>. Their flight ended on the border of <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>, at <a href="Holbeche%20House">Holbeche House</a>, where they were besieged early on 8 November by the pursuing <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Worcestershire">Sheriff of Worcester</a> and his men. Percy was reportedly killed by the same musketball as Catesby, and was buried nearby. His body was later exhumed, and his head exhibited outside Parliament.

In his youth Percy was reportedly "very wild more than ordinary, and much given to fighting", although his excesses were tempered somewhat by his conversion to Catholicism. He may have abandoned his first wife for another woman, and was for a time imprisoned for killing a man during a border skirmish. His membership of the plot proved extremely damaging to his patron, the Earl of Northumberland, who although uninvolved was imprisoned in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> until 1621.

Thomas Percy was the younger of two sons born to Edward Percy of <a href="Beverley">Beverley</a> and his wife Elizabeth (née Waterton). His father was a son of Jocelyn/Josceline Percy (died 1532), whose father was <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland</a>. He was born around 1560 and <a href="matriculation">matriculated</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> as a member of <a href="Peterhouse%2C%20Cambridge">Peterhouse</a> in 1579. Little is known of his early life. He may have been a <a href="papist">papist</a> before he was at some point received into the Catholic Church, and he may have sailed with <a href="George%20Clifford%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Cumberland">George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland</a>, in 1589. In 1591 he married Martha Wright, daughter of Ursula Wright (a convicted <a href="recusant">recusant</a>) and sister to <a href="Christopher%20Wright%20%28plotter%29">Christopher</a> and <a href="John%20Wright%20%28Gunpowder%20Plot%29">John Wright</a> (both later involved in the <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>). Claims by several authors that Percy may have left Martha "mean and poor" for an unidentified woman in Warwickshire are disputed, but the two were at least estranged. In 1605 Martha and her daughter were living on an annuity funded by the Catholic <a href="William%20Parker%2C%204th%20Baron%20Monteagle">William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle</a>. Thomas and Martha's son, Robert, married Emma Mead at <a href="Wiveliscombe">Wiveliscombe</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> on 22 October 1615.

Percy was a tall, physically impressive man, "of serious expression but with an attractive manner", although by his forties he was prematurely greying. He appears to have had some complaint with his clothing; author Alan Haynes describes this as a skin disorder so acute that "he could not endure any shirt but of the finest holland or cambric", although author and historian <a href="Antonia%20Fraser">Antonia Fraser</a> has written of his propensity to sweat so much that he changed his shirt twice a day.
Thomas was the great-grandson of <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland</a>, and the second cousin once removed of the 4th Earl's descendent, <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland</a>. Despite not being a close relative, in 1595 the 9th earl made him responsible for collecting rents from his northern estates, and the following year appointed him constable of <a href="Alnwick%20Castle">Alnwick Castle</a>. Thomas exercised his authority in a manner which gave some cause for complaint, not least from an officer he replaced, and contemporary reports of his dealings with the earl's tenants include claims of mismanagement and bribery. During a border skirmish he killed James Burne, a Scot, for which he was imprisoned at a London gaol, but his release was secured by the intervention of <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex</a>. Thomas subsequently aided Essex in a conspiracy against the Scottish warden of the middle <a href="March%20%28territory%29">marches</a>, although unlike several others who later joined the Gunpowder Plot, he was not a member of the earl's failed <a href="Essex%20Rebellion">rebellion</a> of 1601.

Percy has been variously described as a belligerent and eccentric man, with "surges of wild energy subsiding into sloth". The <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priest <a href="John%20Gerard%20%28Jesuit%29">Father John Gerard</a> wrote that in his youth Percy had "been very wild more than ordinary, and much given to fighting", while the Jesuit <a href="Oswald%20Tesimond">Oswald Tesimond</a> thought he had been "rather wild and given to the gay life, a man who relied much on his sword and personal courage." According to both men, Percy's conversion to Catholicism was a calming influence, but biographer Mark Nicholls, who calls Percy "a pugnacious character", says that this was only true to a point. His excesses did not prevent him from joining Northumberland during his command in the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>, held from 1600–1601, for which he was rewarded with £200. The earl also appointed Percy his receiver of rents in Cumberland and Northumberland, in 1603. Henry Percy was considered a supporter of the Catholic cause, and on several occasions before 1603, suspecting that <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> did not have long to live, he entrusted Thomas with the delivery of secret correspondence to and from her probable successor, <a href="King%20James%20VI%20of%20Scotland">King James VI of Scotland</a>. Northumberland's uncle had been executed for his involvement in the <a href="Rising%20of%20the%20North">Rising of the North</a>, a plot to replace Elizabeth with James's mother, <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. He planned to make up for his family's disgrace by building a strong relationship with James, but also wished to counter the influence of <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury</a>, whose father (it was rumoured) James believed had been responsible for Mary's death.

Exactly what assurances James gave Percy are unknown. Tesimond wrote that he made "very generous promises to favour Catholics actively", and "he would admit them to every kind of honour and office", but the consensus among historians is that what promises James did make were oral, rather than written. Fraser posits that the Scottish king probably intended to allow Catholics to worship privately, which if true was a much more reserved view than that subsequently announced by Percy, who told his fellow Catholics that the king had promised to protect their religion. Considering the "quaintness" of James's spoken English there may have been some misunderstanding on both sides. In his surviving correspondence with Northumberland, the king writes only that neither would "quiet" Catholics be disturbed, nor would those that deserved recognition "through their good service" be overlooked. This mixing of signals was to have lasting consequences.

Percy became the fifth member of the <a href="Gunpowder%20plot">Gunpowder plot</a> on Sunday 20 May 1604. Almost a year earlier, he had called at <a href="Robert%20Catesby">Robert Catesby</a>'s home at Ashby St Ledgers, and complained bitterly about James, who since succeeding Elizabeth had done little to fulfil his expectations. He had threatened to kill the new king with his own hands, but was asked by Catesby to restrain himself, and told "I am thinking of a most sure way and I will soon let thee know what it is." Thus Percy found himself at the Duck and Drake inn near the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a> in London, along with Catesby and his cousin <a href="Thomas%20Wintour">Thomas Wintour</a>, John Wright and <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>. His first words at the meeting were "Shall we always, gentlemen, talk and never do anything?" All five later swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book, and then celebrated Mass in another room with Father Gerard, who was ignorant of their pact.

While the plotters did not then have a detailed plan, Percy's appointment on 9 June as a <a href="Honourable%20Corps%20of%20Gentlemen-at-Arms">Gentleman Pensioner</a> gave him a reason to establish a London base. Through Northumberland's agents, <a href="Dudley%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Dorchester">Dudley Carleton</a> and John Hippesley, he subleased a house in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> from Henry Ferrers, a tenant of John Whynniard, and installed Fawkes there as his servant, "John Johnson". On 25 March 1605 Percy also obtained the lease for the undercroft directly underneath the first-floor House of Lords. It was into this room that the plotters moved 36 barrels of gunpowder from Catesby's lodgings on the opposite side of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. The plan was that during the State Opening of Parliament, at which the king and his ministers would be present, the plotters would blow up the House of Lords, killing all those within it. James's daughter, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Princess Elizabeth</a>, would be captured during a <a href="English%20Midlands">Midlands</a> uprising, and installed as a titular queen.

Percy spent that Autumn collecting Northumberland's rents, while Catesby continued to enlist support. By October 1605, he had 12 Catholic men assigned to his cause and was at work on the remaining details. Several conspirators expressed disquiet over the safety of fellow Catholics who might be caught in the planned explosion. Percy's concern was for his patron, Northumberland, who it seems might have been made <a href="Lord%20Protector">Lord Protector</a> if the plot had succeeded. <a href="William%20Parker%2C%204th%20Baron%20Monteagle">Lord Monteagle</a>'s name was also mentioned, by a worried <a href="Francis%20Tresham">Francis Tresham</a>. The fate of Elizabeth's brother, <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Henry</a>, was uncertain; although the plotters presumed that he would die with his father, they decided that if he did not attend Parliament, Percy should kidnap him.

On Saturday 26 October, at his house in <a href="Hoxton">Hoxton</a>, Monteagle received an anonymous letter that warned him to stay away from Parliament. Uncertain of its meaning, he delivered it to <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury</a>. Cecil was already aware of certain stirrings, although he did not then know the exact nature of the plot or who exactly was involved. Instead of informing the king immediately, he decided to wait and watch what happened. Catesby's reaction to news of the letter's existence was somewhat different; he and Wintour suspected Francis Tresham was its author and the two went to confront him. Tresham managed to convince them of his innocence, all the while urging them to abandon the plot. Percy reacted to the news by declaring that he was ready to "abide the uttermost trial". He may have visited the infant <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Prince Charles</a> on 1 November, indicating perhaps that some rearrangement of the plan was being considered. The deposition of a servant claimed that Percy visited the prince's lodgings and "made many enquiries as to the way into his chamber", although the statement came too late for Percy to comment on it.

Percy visited Northumberland at <a href="Syon%20House">Syon House</a>, west of London, on 4 November. Fraser suggests that his visit was a "fishing expedition", to find out what, if anything, Northumberland had heard about the letter. This "expedition" later proved disastrous for the earl, who claimed that there was nothing treasonable about their conversation, and that Percy had merely asked him "whether he would command any service" before leaving. Percy then went to another of Northumberland's properties, <a href="Essex%20House%20%28London%29">Essex House</a> in London, and spoke with his nephew, Josceline. Later that evening he met with Wintour, John Wright and <a href="Robert%20Keyes">Robert Keyes</a>, and assured them that all was well. He then travelled to his lodgings along <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn%20Road">Gray's Inn Road</a>, where he left orders for his horses to be made ready for an early departure the next morning.

By then, the king knew about the letter. James felt that it hinted at "some strategem of fire and powder", perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, <a href="Henry%20Stuart%2C%20Lord%20Darnley">Lord Darnley</a>, in 1567. The following day, the Privy Council told him that they had decided to undertake a search of Parliament, "both above and below". The first, headed by <a href="Thomas%20Howard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Suffolk">Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk</a>, was made on 4 November. In the undercroft beneath the House of Lords he noticed a tall man who appeared to be a servant, and a large pile of faggots—far too large to serve the small house Percy had subleased from Henry Ferrers. The house's owner, John Whynniard, told the search party that its tenancy was held by Percy. Monteagle, present during the search, immediately told Suffolk that he suspected Percy was the letter's author. The king ordered a second, more thorough search to be made, and at about midnight, Fawkes was discovered guarding the gunpowder, and was immediately arrested.

As Fawkes identified himself as John Johnson, servant to Thomas Percy, it was Percy's name which appeared on the government's first arrest warrant. It described him as a "tall, florid man, with a broad beard—'the head more white then the beard'—and stooping shoulders, being also 'long footed, small legged'". The celebrated astrologer <a href="Simon%20Forman">Simon Forman</a> was employed to divine his whereabouts, a rider was sent to look for him in northern England, and a search was made of Essex House. All of this was in vain, however, as Percy had been warned of Fawkes's capture and had fled for the Midlands with <a href="Christopher%20Wright%20%28plotter%29">Christopher Wright</a>, telling a servant as he went, "I am undone." The two men met Catesby and the others (who had left for the Midlands uprising) and continued on to <a href="Dunchurch">Dunchurch</a>, at one point throwing their cloaks off to increase their speed. A relative of <a href="Lieutenant%20of%20the%20Tower%20of%20London">Lieutenant of the Tower of London</a> <a href="William%20Wade%20%28English%20politician%29">William Waad</a> encountered Percy leaving London, which led to Waad writing the following letter to Salisbury on 5 November:

Accompanied by some of his fellow conspirators, Percy's flight ended at about 10:00 pm on 7 November, at <a href="Holbeche%20House">Holbeche House</a> on the <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> county boundary. He was unharmed by a gunpowder accident that injured Catesby and a few of the others, but those who remained resolved to wait for the arrival of government forces, who were only hours behind. Thus at 11:00 am the following morning the house was besieged by the <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Worcestershire">Sheriff of Worcester</a>, Richard Walsh, and his company of 200 men. In the ensuing firefight, Percy and Catesby were reportedly killed by the same musket ball, fired by a John Streete of Worcester. News of the battle soon reached London, rendering superfluous a government proclamation made on the same day and which offered a rich reward for his capture. The survivors were taken into custody and the dead buried near Holbeche, but on the orders of the <a href="Henry%20Howard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northampton">Earl of Northampton</a>, the bodies of Percy and Catesby were exhumed and their heads displayed on spikes at "the side of the Parliament House".

With Thomas dead, there was nobody who could either implicate or clear Henry Percy of any involvement in the plot. His failure to ensure that Thomas took the <a href="Oath%20of%20Supremacy">Oath of Supremacy</a> upon his appointment as a Gentleman Pensioner, and their meeting on 4 November, constituted damning evidence, and the Privy Council also suspected that had the plot succeeded, he would have been Princess Elizabeth's protector. With insufficient evidence to convict him he was charged with contempt, fined £30,000 and stripped of all public offices. He remained in the Tower until 1621.

The Body (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)

"The Body" is the sixteenth episode of the <a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28season%205%29">fifth season</a> of the supernatural drama television series "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>". The episode was written and directed by series creator <a href="Joss%20Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> and originally aired on <a href="The%20WB%20Television%20Network">the WB network</a> in the United States on February 27, 2001. In the series, <a href="Buffy%20Summers">Buffy Summers</a> is a teenager chosen by mystical forces and endowed with superhuman powers to defeat <a href="vampire%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">vampires</a>, demons, and other evils in the fictional town of <a href="Sunnydale">Sunnydale</a>. She is supported in her struggles by a close circle of friends and family, nicknamed the <a href="Scooby%20Gang%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Scooby Gang</a>. In "The Body", Buffy is powerless as she comes upon her lifeless mother, who has died of a <a href="brain%20aneurysm">brain aneurysm</a>.

Although Buffy and her friends deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of <a href="Joyce%20Summers">Joyce Summers</a>, the divorced mother of Buffy and her sister <a href="Dawn%20Summers">Dawn</a> and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means to each of them and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the <a href="Slayer%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Slayer</a> without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the "Buffy" series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.

"The Body" aired to wide acclaim, and has since been ranked by several critics as one of the greatest episodes of television ever broadcast.

Buffy (<a href="Sarah%20Michelle%20Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>) is assisted from season one by her close friends, who collectively refer to themselves as the <a href="Scooby%20Gang%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Scooby Gang</a>: <a href="Xander%20Harris">Xander Harris</a> (<a href="Nicholas%20Brendon">Nicholas Brendon</a>), whose primary strength is his devotion to Buffy, and <a href="Willow%20Rosenberg">Willow Rosenberg</a> (<a href="Alyson%20Hannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a>), who begins dabbling in witchcraft and grows progressively more powerful. They are mentored by <a href="Rupert%20Giles">Rupert Giles</a> (<a href="Anthony%20Stewart%20Head">Anthony Stewart Head</a>), Buffy's "<a href="Watcher%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Watcher</a>", and joined by Xander's girlfriend <a href="Anya%20Jenkins">Anya Jenkins</a> (<a href="Emma%20Caulfield">Emma Caulfield</a>), who was a <a href="vengeance%20demon">vengeance demon</a> until her powers were taken away. Anya is often at a loss to know how to communicate with humans, and her speech is frequently abrupt. In the fourth season, Willow became romantically involved with <a href="Tara%20Maclay">Tara Maclay</a> (<a href="Amber%20Benson">Amber Benson</a>), also a witch.

Each season of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (often simplified as "Buffy") presents an overall theme episodes tie into. <a href="Roz%20Kaveney">Roz Kaveney</a> identifies family and belonging as the overall theme of the fifth season. Buffy's mother <a href="Joyce%20Summers">Joyce</a> (<a href="Kristine%20Sutherland">Kristine Sutherland</a>) begins experiencing headaches at the beginning of the season, once collapsing and requiring hospitalization. She subsequently has a brain tumor removed. She has been recovering well. In the <a href="I%20Was%20Made%20to%20Love%20You">previous episode</a>, she receives flowers from a male suitor, which Buffy finds at the end of that episode. The fifth season also introduces <a href="Dawn%20Summers">Dawn</a> (<a href="Michelle%20Trachtenberg">Michelle Trachtenberg</a>), Buffy's 14-year-old sister. Each season has a primary antagonist called the <a href="Big%20Bad">Big Bad</a>; in the fifth season this takes the form of a powerful goddess named <a href="Glory%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Glory</a> (<a href="Clare%20Kramer">Clare Kramer</a>).

Beginning where the <a href="I%20Was%20Made%20to%20Love%20You">previous episode</a> left off, Buffy arrives home and sees the flowers sent from Joyce's suitor. She calls out to her mother and hears no answer. Buffy sees Joyce lying lifeless on the sofa, staring at the ceiling.

In a <a href="flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a> to a Christmas dinner where all the Scoobies are present, having a typical lighthearted conversation as Joyce and Buffy discuss a pie that drops on the floor. The scene snaps back to Buffy in the living room, shaking Joyce and screaming at her. She calls for an ambulance and attempts <a href="Cardiopulmonary%20resuscitation">CPR</a>, accidentally snapping a rib in the process, but to no avail. Buffy calls Giles. The paramedics arrive and work on Joyce and she revives, the paramedics declare it a miracle in the ambulance, and Joyce, Buffy, and Dawn rejoice in the hospital. Revealed to be a fantasy of Buffy's, the scene snaps back to the living room, where the paramedics continue to work on Joyce until they stop and tell Buffy that Joyce is dead. They leave, and Buffy goes into the hall and vomits. Giles arrives and Buffy tells him not to move the body, shocking herself by using that word.

At school, Dawn is crying in the bathroom upset that a girl called her a freak. In art class she talks with a boy as they sketch, and the two share a moment of understanding about being troubled. Buffy arrives and pulls Dawn out of class into the hall. Through the windows of the art room, the class watches Buffy tell her that Joyce has had an accident. The rest of the conversation is muffled. Dawn collapses in the hall, sobbing.

In Willow's dormitory room, Tara tries to help Willow find a shirt to wear. Xander and Anya arrive and double-park. Willow panics, rejecting shirt after shirt, not knowing how to appear for Buffy and Dawn. She asks why her clothes are stupid and she is childish, weeping until Tara kisses and calms her. Anya asks Xander what she is supposed to do; he cannot answer. Willow changes her shirt again and Xander expresses his desire to find Glory and exact justice, then complains about Joyce's negligent doctors. Anya asks if they will see the body, then if the body will be cut open, and Willow responds angrily. Anya tearfully says she does not understand how to behave, or why Joyce cannot go back into her own body, unable to understand human death, she states that it is all "stupid and mortal", and no one will tell her why things are happening. Xander puts his fist through the wall, making him bleed but feel oddly better. As the group leaves to visit Buffy at the hospital, Xander gets a parking ticket.

In the waiting room outside the morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce died of an aneurysm suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother died when she was 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek.

From the start of writing the "Buffy" series, Joss Whedon asserted that it would never have a "<a href="very%20special%20episode">very special episode</a>" as in contemporary series "<a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%2090210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a>", "<a href="The%20Wonder%20Years">The Wonder Years</a>", or "<a href="Party%20of%20Five">Party of Five</a>", where the core cast of characters addresses a single issue (AIDS, drug abuse, or alcoholism, for example) and resolve all the problems at the end. Whedon was not interested in finding a life-affirming lesson for "The Body". Rather, he wanted to capture the isolation and boredom involved in the minutes and hours after finding a loved one has died, what he termed "the black ashes in your mouth numbness of death". He did not intend to resolve any religious or existential questions about the end of life, but wanted to examine the process in which a person becomes a mere body. Whedon's mother, a teacher, also died of a cerebral aneurysm, and he drew on his own experiences, and those of friends and other writers, in constructing the episode. He tried to achieve an "unlovely physicality" in "The Body" to portray the upsetting minutiae involved in attempting to comprehend what is incomprehensible.

Small details became significant: to protect her dignity Buffy pulls the hem of Joyce's skirt down after it rode up when she attempted CPR; the camera focuses on a breeze through wind chimes while Buffy vomits; to emphasize Buffy's isolation, the scene has no exterior <a href="establishing%20shot">establishing shot</a>s of the house.

The opening sequence of "The Body" was also the closing scene of the previous episode, "<a href="I%20Was%20Made%20to%20Love%20You">I Was Made to Love You</a>"; this is the only episode in the series that was first aired without a "Previously on "Buffy"" lead-in. The Christmas dinner scene was used both to contrast the stark reality of the rest of the episode, and to avoid having the credits appear over the beginning scenes where Buffy is trying to revive her mother.

The episode is presented in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar (Buffy). Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move through the house and calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, "We're not supposed to move the body!" Both Gellar and Trachtenberg (Dawn) were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, "you try to separate it as best you can and at the same time it adds that extra layer". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar "at a fever pitch", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure.

Kristine Sutherland (Joyce) was informed during the third season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended to spend time in Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of "The Body" was strange and tense because she had been a regular character through the series and she was suddenly playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, but getting into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies.

The most difficult scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession about what to wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences when he was at a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying that she was able to be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene.

Whedon's rejection of the "very special episode" format impelled him to address the physicality of Willow and Tara's relationship within "The Body". Before this episode, they had held hands and danced on screen, but they had not kissed. A genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as the "<a href="lesbian%20kiss%20episode">lesbian kiss episode</a>" in the 1990s, where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored. Whedon set out to acknowledge Willow's and Tara's affection without making it the primary focus of the show. For attempting this, he received resistance from the airing network, <a href="The%20WB%20Television%20Network">the WB</a>. Whedon informed them that the kiss between Willow and Tara was "not negotiable". According to Whedon, the conversation about the kiss was approached by the network executives, who were concerned with the number of gay relationships on the network. Whedon countered that the kiss was "true to character" and said he would quit the show if the network forbade it. It was the only time during the series he threatened to do so.

When Willow and Tara first met in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the relationship to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For the rest of the season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in "The Body", saying "They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props when it came to the [characters' first] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy." Stephen Tropiano in "Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV" writes that this approach was "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: "Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world". Tropiano calls it "A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do."

Audiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon expected to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence was similar to a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers "the heart of the experience" and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the "whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality of dealing with the crisis. Whedon used another long <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a> from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.

In Nikki Stafford's analysis, the reactions of Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Willow, Anya, and Tara represent stages of <a href="Elisabeth%20K%C3%BCbler-Ross">Elisabeth Kübler-Ross</a>' <a href="K%C3%BCbler-Ross%20model">five stages of grief</a> in different parts. Joss Whedon stated on the DVD commentary how surprised he was at the response from viewers who wrote to say that the episode allowed them to accept the death of a close family member, even if they had not acknowledged it for months or years. Joyce's death was the first by natural causes in the series.

In "The Psychology of Joss Whedon", two academic psychologists identify the source of Buffy's strength as her mother, paired with Giles' mentorship. Joyce did not know all along that Buffy was a Slayer and had difficulty accepting what her daughter was called to do. She was nonetheless always attentive and available when Buffy's confidence was shaken, and both Joyce's and Giles' devotion to her "gave her the self-assurance to wield her power to its full potential". Joyce served as a parent figure to all of Buffy's friends, whose home lives were often unstable or unloving, thus making her death more poignant to all of them. Willow mentions her parents several times throughout the series, but her father is never seen. Her mother is portrayed only once in "<a href="Gingerbread%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Gingerbread</a>", at first as an academic so preoccupied with her career that she is unable to communicate with Willow, and then—with Joyce—under the spell of a demon and in the throes of <a href="moral%20panic">moral panic</a>, attempting to burn her own daughter at the stake for being involved in witchcraft. Xander's parents are described by him and those who have been to his house as alcoholic and verbally abusive. Even Anya, severely wanting in social graces, has lost someone she admires and trusts. Giles also grieves for the loss of a friend and—in <a href="Band%20Candy">one episode</a> when the adults fall under a spell making them retreat into an adolescent state—a lover. Lorna Jowett in "Sex and the Slayer" writes that Joyce represents stability and normality. For the Scoobies, her death destroys the illusion that normal life is trouble-free; it is just as challenging as encountering supernatural forces.

Finding her mother's body, Buffy at first denies what she sees, to the point of imagining alternate realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she might have been able to do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.

The episode also emphasizes another theme of the season: Buffy's response to forces that she cannot fight. Throughout the season she encounters the much more powerful goddess <a href="Glory%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Glory</a>, but Joyce's death leaves her feeling the most helpless. In Joyce's death there is no evil force to combat; she simply dies, and Buffy, with all her power, is ill-equipped to grasp the enormity of her situation. In her shock, Buffy retreats to a childlike state of confusion, calling to her mother when she does not answer: "Mom? ... Mom? ... Mommy?" Emma Caulfield was also given the direction for her voice to rise to a childlike pitch at the end of her speech to give the same effect. According to "Buffy" scholar Rhonda Wilcox, the themes of maturation and facing adult responsibilities begin with the departure of Buffy's boyfriend <a href="Riley%20Finn">Riley Finn</a> six episodes before, and crystallize in the preceding episode in which Buffy realizes she does not need a boyfriend to be fulfilled. At the end of that episode she is confronted with Joyce's death, which is fully explored in "The Body". Facing responsibilities became the major theme of the sixth season. One critic writes, "Drastic as it was, killing off Joyce was the logical way to bring Buffy and Dawn closer together, sever Buffy's last ties to girlhood and emphasize Buffy's inability to accept the limits of her power, a recurring theme this season."

Whedon uses several disorienting effects to heighten the reality of the situations in the episode to the point that they seem surreal. The long opening shot of Buffy coming home and finding Joyce was filmed with one hand-held camera in constant movement as she walks through the house to the phone and back to her mother again. The buttons on Buffy's phone are abnormally large, an effect that Whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died. Buffy is so bewildered by the paramedic telling her that Joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to understand what he is saying. The camera uses her perspective and only the bottom part of the paramedic's face is in view. Instead of a normal "over-the-shoulder" view, Buffy is shot at the same height as the paramedic's shoulder, barely squeezed into the frame as if to portray her, according to Whedon, as trapped by reality. Kristine Sutherland stated that the script was "amazing", specifically at capturing the detachment: "It's not something you can process. I mean mortality is just not part of your vocabulary when you're that age."

In the hospital, as Buffy listens to the doctor confirm how Joyce died, the doctor says something, but the words "I have to lie to you to make you feel better" are spoken discordantly, as though, according to cinema scholar Katy Stevens, Buffy "constructs what she believes to be an unmentionable truth—her culpability in her mother's death". In the same scene, Dawn is shot with a hand-held camera that drifts, giving her a slightly unreal moment as she struggles to believe, unlike what Buffy already knows, that her mother's body is down the hall on a steel table. The scene with Buffy and Tara sitting in the waiting room was noted by Rhonda Wilcox for its reality in showing Gellar as ragged and distinctly unglamorous, particularly because she had been presented in a specific way to attract male viewers and was a spokeswoman for <a href="Maybelline">Maybelline</a> while "Buffy" aired. Buffy sits with circles under her eyes, unflattering hair, and slumped posture next to Tara, who had been criticized for being too heavy, despite her body type being more typical of women her age.

Foremost of the disorienting effects, to critics and scholars, is Whedon's use of sound and silence. While Buffy performs CPR, she cracks one of Joyce's ribs with a startling snap. After Buffy vomits on the floor, she stands in the back doorway listening to life carrying on: children playing, someone practicing a trumpet, and birds singing. Long pauses between dialogue create gaps that turn awkward as the characters try to think of what to say, made especially notable in a series famous for its rapid banter. The transition between the Christmas dinner scene and the living room scene is abrupt, and the sound of Buffy and Joyce shouting because they dropped a pie on the floor carries over into the silence of Joyce's lifeless face and Buffy standing alone in the living room. This effect is also used when shifting between Buffy's alternate version of her mother being "good as new" in the hospital and the paramedics trying to revive her. In the car on the way to Willow's dormitory, Anya is shot by a camera mounted on the front bumper, separated from the audience by the windshield. Xander, driving, faces the other way; neither of them speak and only the sound of the car can be heard. Joyce Millman at Salon.com writes of the sound issues, "The effect was almost Bergmanesque in its starkness. The spooky stillness and the long, spacey pauses in conversation as characters struggled to articulate their feelings exaggerated the sense of time elongating and standing still."

Katy Stevens notes that the dialogue in "The Body" was recorded with microphones very close to the actors, making variations in their voices—cracks, rises, and whispers—more prominent to the audience, to close the distance between the actors and the viewer. Conversely, the scene in which Dawn is told of Joyce's death was shot through a large classroom window, muffling Dawn's emotional reaction, to isolate Buffy and Dawn from the class and the audience. Several moments of silence follow this scene. Whedon shot the conversation up close several times, filming over-the-shoulder and reaction shots, but eventually went with a more distanced point of view. Michelle Trachtenberg later said of this effect, "obviously you know in the end result there was no sound and I thought that was actually one of the most brilliant ideas [he's] ever had because it allows everyone to sort of attach their own emotional plug into whatever might have happened in your life. I think it allowed the audience to really connect with Dawn for the first time."

Presenting the episode without music was Whedon's way of denying the audience any comfort, forcing them to discern their own meanings from the characters' actions and words. As two musicologists write about this absence, "Without music's acoustic balm, all our empathetic attention is on the characters and their state of bewilderment ... Music would provide a conceptualization and a catharsis ... but a catharsis at this point would in some measure trivialize the loss." Television critic Gareth McLean writes that this decision is "a move that makes it more courageous than, for instance, "ER". There were no soaring strings or plaintive piano to trigger an emotional response. Instead the soundtrack took in the ambient noises of wind chimes, doors squeaking, footsteps on carpets. Conversations were stilted and awkward, but the spaces in between always mattered."

Critics praised the episode, and have continued to count it as one of the finest episodes of television ever broadcast. David Bianculli in the "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">New York Daily News</a>" commends the acting abilities of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Michelle Trachtenberg, Alyson Hannigan, and Amber Benson. "The Body", according to Bianculli is "<a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a>-worthy ... It also will haunt you—but not in the normal way associated with this still-evolving, still-achieving series." Television critic Alesia Redding and editor Joe Vince of the "<a href="South%20Bend%20Tribune">South Bend Tribune</a>" write, "I was riveted by this show ... This isn't just one of the best "Buffy" episodes of all time. It's one of the best episodes of TV of all time." Redding adds, "If you watch this incredible episode and don't recognize it as great TV, you're hopeless ... A 'fantasy' show delivers the most stark and realistic take on death I've ever seen, deftly depicting how a loved one who dies suddenly becomes 'the body'." 

Gareth McLean in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" rejects the notion that "Buffy" is similar to other "schmaltzy American teen show(s)" like "<a href="Dawson%27s%20Creek">Dawson's Creek</a>": "This episode was a brave, honest and wrenching portrayal of death and loss. The way this was handled by Joss Whedon ... was ingenious. Time slowed down and the feeling of numbness was palpable as Buffy and her gang tried to come to terms with Joyce's death." McLean especially appreciated the small details of Buffy protecting Joyce's dignity and the confusion shown by the characters. He concludes, "Joyce may be dead but long live "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"." Joe Gross in the "<a href="Austin%20American-Statesman">Austin American-Statesman</a>" calls the episode "devastatingly calm" and states that "the entire cast and crew should have received some sort of Emmy for 'The Body.

At <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a>, Joyce Millman writes, "there hasn't been a finer hour of drama on TV this year than ... 'The Body' ... You have to hand it to the writers; Joyce's demise came as a complete surprise. In that instant, Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if "Buffy" gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't remember the last time I saw a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss." Andrew Gilstrap at <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> declares it "possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none ... It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one." Gilstrap went on to say the series did not again address death and grief of this magnitude until, in another shocking turn of events, Tara dies of a stray gunshot in the sixth season. Jerry McCormick in "<a href="The%20San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">The San Diego Union-Tribune</a>" agrees, rating Joyce's death as having the same emotional impact as Tara's in "<a href="Seeing%20Red%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Seeing Red</a>", both of which he listed as the saddest in the series.

Kira Schlechter in "<a href="The%20Patriot-News">The Patriot-News</a>" declares "The Body" "one of the finest episodes of any series ever", stating that the silence and novel cinematography are "remarkable and the writing is brilliant". Buffy and Dawn's conversation at her school, Schlechter says, is "positively wrenching". When the series ended in 2003, Amy Antangelo in the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" and Siona LaFrance of the "<a href="The%20Times-Picayune">New Orleans Times-Picayune</a>" both rated the best "Buffy" episodes giving "The Body" equal billing at the top with "<a href="Hush%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Hush</a>" and "<a href="Once%20More%2C%20with%20Feeling%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Once More, with Feeling</a>", LaFrance designating the episode an "instant classic". Jonathan Last in "<a href="The%20Weekly%20Standard">The Weekly Standard</a>" lists "The Body" eighth out of the ten best "Buffy" episodes, writing that it is "the series' most difficult episode because it's real—and not real in the way "ER" or "The Practice" or "Law & Order", all hyper-versions of reality, are real. At some point, most of us will experience a day like Buffy has in 'The Body' and we sense that the writers have gotten nearly every detail of that day—right down to the absence of a musical score—right." In the <a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">A.V. Club</a>, Noel Murray also finds small details compelling, such as the camera's focus on the paper towel Buffy uses to cover the vomit on the carpet. He does, however, write that some of the shots "come off a little gimmicky, but the ones that work are so effective that it seems petty to complain that Whedon overdoes it at times. (Besides, different moments are likely to move different people.)"

In addition to praising Gellar's often under-appreciated acting, "Buffy" scholar <a href="Ian%20Shuttleworth">Ian Shuttleworth</a> comments on the cast and the nuanced numbness and confusion of the characters, paired with the moments of silence in the episode: "It is simply one of the finest pieces of television drama, and the single finest depiction of bereavement in any medium, that I have ever seen." Nikki Stafford, author of "Bite Me! The Unofficial Guide to Buffy the Vampire Slayer", calls "The Body" "an absolute masterpiece", explaining that it is "hands down the single most terrifying, heart-breaking, painful, and amazing hour of television I have ever seen". She praises the entire cast equally, but highlights Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, and Emma Caulfield. Stafford also praised Kristine Sutherland—as did Whedon—for having to lie motionless with her eyes open for hours upon hours over eight days of filming.

In 2015, Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV looked back at the episode fourteen years later. Upon reviewing the episode, he called it "one of the best hours of television" he had ever seen and went on to say "I don't think any other supernatural show has ever had a more beautiful episode than "The Body"".

When the episode was originally broadcast in the United States on <a href="The%20WB%20Television%20Network">the WB</a> network on February 27, 2001, it received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 3.5 and a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Ratings/share%20and%20total%20viewers">share</a> of 5, and was watched by 6 million viewers. The episode placed fifth in its timeslot, and 82nd among broadcast television for the week of February 26 – March 4, 2001. It was the most watched program on the WB that night, and the second most watched program that week, trailing "<a href="7th%20Heaven%20%28TV%20series%29">7th Heaven</a>". This was a slight increase from a 3.4 rating and 87th position achieved by the <a href="I%20Was%20Made%20to%20Love%20You">previous episode</a>. The episode was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> on October 28, 2002 in <a href="DVD%20region%20code%232">Region 2</a>, and December 9, 2003 in <a href="DVD%20region%20code%231">Region 1</a>.
Although the episode received positive reviews, it was not nominated for any Emmy awards. Rhonda Wilcox attributes this to the Emmys being a "bastion of conservative popular taste", automatically rejecting television shows in the fantasy/science fiction genres. The script was nominated for a <a href="Nebula%20Award%20for%20Best%20Script">Nebula Award</a>, given for excellence in science fiction/fantasy writing.

Startling Stories

Startling Stories was an American <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>, published from 1939 to 1955 by publisher <a href="Ned%20Pines">Ned Pines</a>' <a href="Thrilling%20Publications">Standard Magazines</a>. It was initially edited by <a href="Mort%20Weisinger">Mort Weisinger</a>, who was also the editor of "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Thrilling Wonder Stories</a>", Standard's other science fiction title. "Startling" ran a lead novel in every issue; the first was "<a href="The%20Black%20Flame%20%28novel%29">The Black Flame</a>" by <a href="Stanley%20G.%20Weinbaum">Stanley G. Weinbaum</a>. When Standard Magazines acquired "Thrilling Wonder" in 1936, it also gained the rights to stories published in that magazine's predecessor, "Wonder Stories", and selections from this early material were reprinted in "Startling" as "Hall of Fame" stories. Under Weisinger the magazine focused on younger readers and, when Weisinger was replaced by <a href="Oscar%20J.%20Friend">Oscar J. Friend</a> in 1941, the magazine became even more juvenile in focus, with clichéd cover art and letters answered by a "Sergeant Saturn". Friend was replaced by <a href="Sam%20Merwin%2C%20Jr.">Sam Merwin, Jr.</a> in 1945, and Merwin was able to improve the quality of the fiction substantially, publishing <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s "<a href="Against%20the%20Fall%20of%20Night">Against the Fall of Night</a>", and several other well-received stories.

Much of "Startling"s cover art was painted by <a href="Earle%20K.%20Bergey">Earle K. Bergey</a>, who became strongly associated with the magazine, painting almost every cover between 1940 and 1952. He was known for equipping his heroines with brass bras and implausible costumes, and the public image of science fiction in his day was partly created by his work for "Startling" and other magazines. Merwin left in 1951, and <a href="Samuel%20Mines">Samuel Mines</a> took over; the standard remained fairly high but competition from new and better-paying markets such as "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>" and "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>" impaired Mines' ability to acquire quality material. In mid-1952, Standard attempted to change "Startling"s image by adopting a more sober title typeface and reducing the sensationalism of the covers, but by 1955 the pulp magazine market was collapsing. "Startling" absorbed its two companion magazines, "Thrilling Wonder" and "<a href="Fantastic%20Story%20Magazine">Fantastic Story Magazine</a>", in early 1955, but by the end of that year it too ceased publication.

Ron Hanna of Wild Cat Books revived "Startling Stories" in 2007. Wild Cat Books folded in 2013. A statement of the closure is still posted on the Facebook page All Pulp dated March 12, 2013 (as of January 29, 2019).

Although science fiction had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. By the end of the 1930s the field was booming. Standard Magazines, a pulp publishing company owned by <a href="Ned%20Pines">Ned Pines</a>, acquired its first science fiction magazine, "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Thrilling Wonder Stories</a>", from Gernsback in 1936. <a href="Mort%20Weisinger">Mort Weisinger</a>, the editor of "Thrilling Wonder", printed an editorial in February 1938 asking readers for suggestions for a companion magazine. Response was positive, and the new magazine, titled "Startling Stories", was duly launched, with a first issue (pulp-sized, rather than <a href="bedsheet">bedsheet-sized</a>, as many readers had requested), dated January 1939. Initial pay rates were half a cent per word, lower than the leading magazines of the day.

"Startling" was launched on a bimonthly schedule, alternating months with "Thrilling Wonder Stories", though in 1940 "Thrilling" moved to a monthly schedule that lasted for over a year. The first editor was <a href="Mort%20Weisinger">Mort Weisinger</a>, who had been an active fan in the early 1930s and had joined Standard Magazines in 1935, editing "Thrilling Wonder" from 1936. Weisinger left in 1941 to take a new post as editor of "<a href="Superman%20%28comic%20book%29">Superman</a>", and was replaced by <a href="Oscar%20Jerome%20Friend">Oscar J. Friend</a>, who was an established writer of pulp fiction, though his experience was in western fiction rather than sf. During Friend's tenure "Startling" slipped from bimonthly to quarterly publication. Friend lasted for a little over two years, and was replaced by <a href="Sam%20Merwin%2C%20Jr.">Sam Merwin, Jr.</a>, as of the Winter 1945 issue.

Merwin succeeded in making "Startling" popular and successful, and the bimonthly schedule was resumed in 1947. At the start of 1952 "Startling" switched to a monthly schedule; this was unusual in that "Startling" was notionally junior to "Thrilling Wonder", its sister magazine, which remained bimonthly. Merwin left shortly before this switch, in order to spend more time on his own writing. He was replaced by Samuel Mines, who had worked with Standard's Western magazines, though he was a science fiction aficionado.

<a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a>, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, partially as a result of the success of paperbacks. Standard continued with "Startling" and "Thrilling", but the end came only a few years later. In 1954, <a href="Fredric%20Wertham">Fredric Wertham</a> published "<a href="Seduction%20of%20the%20Innocent">Seduction of the Innocent</a>", a book in which he asserted that comics were inciting children to violence. A subsequent <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> subcommittee hearing led to a backlash against comics, and the publishers dropped titles in response. The financial impact spread to pulp magazines, since often a publisher would publish both. A 1955 strike by American News Corporation, the main distributor in the U.S., meant that magazines remained in warehouses and never made it to the newsstands; the unsold copies represented a significant financial blow and contributed to publishers' decisions to cancel magazines. "Startling" was one of the casualties. The schedule had already returned from monthly to bimonthly in 1953, and it became a quarterly in early 1954. "Thrilling Wonder" published its last issue in early 1955, and was then merged with "Startling", as was "<a href="Fantastic%20Story%20Magazine">Fantastic Story Magazine</a>", another companion publication, but the combined magazine lasted only three more issues. Mines left the magazine at the end of 1954; he was succeeded for two issues by Theron Raines, who was followed by Herbert D. Kastle for the last two. The final issue was dated Fall 1955.

From the beginning, every issue of "Startling" contained a complete novel, along with one or two short stories; long stories did not appear since the publisher's policy was to avoid serials. When Standard Magazines had bought "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Wonder Stories</a>" in 1936, they had also acquired rights to reprint the stories that had appeared in it and in its predecessor magazines, "Air Wonder Stories" and "Science Wonder Stories", and so "Startling" also included a "Hall of Fame" reprint from one of these magazines in every issue. The first lead novel was "<a href="The%20Black%20Flame%20%28novel%29">The Black Flame</a>", a revised version of "Dawn of Flame", a story by <a href="Stanley%20G.%20Weinbaum">Stanley Weinbaum</a> that had previously appeared only in an edition limited to 250 copies. There was also a tribute to Weinbaum, written by <a href="Otto%20Binder">Otto Binder</a>; Weinbaum had died in 1935 and was well regarded, so even though the story was not one of his best, it was excellent publicity for the magazine. Otto and his brother, Earl, also contributed a story, "Science Island", under their joint pseudonym <a href="Eando%20Binder">Eando Binder</a>. The "Hall of Fame" reprint was D.D. Sharp's "The Eternal Man", from 1929. Other features included a pictorial article on Albert Einstein, and a set of biographical sketches of scientists, titled "Thrills in Science". The letter column was called "The Ether Vibrates", and there was a regular <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a> review column, providing contact information so that readers could obtain the fanzines directly. Initially the stories for the "Hall of Fame" were chosen by the editor, but soon Weisinger recruited well-known <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fans</a> to make the choices.

"Startling" was popular, and soon "became one of the core science fiction magazines", according to science fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>. The target audience was younger readers, and the lead novels were often <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a>s by well-known pulp writers such as <a href="Edmond%20Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a> and <a href="Manly%20Wade%20Wellman">Manly Wade Wellman</a>. In addition to space opera, some more fantastical fiction began to appear, contributed by writers such as <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a>. These early <a href="science%20fantasy">science fantasy</a> stories were popular with the readers, and contrasted with the <a href="hard%20science%20fiction">hard science fiction</a> that <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a> was pioneering at "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Astounding</a>".

Weisinger set out to please the younger readers, and when Friend became editor in 1941, he went further in this direction, giving the magazine a strongly juvenile flavor. For example, Friend introduced "Sergeant Saturn", a character (originally from "Thrilling Wonder Stories") who answered readers' letters and appeared in other features in the magazine. Many subscribers found the approach irritating.

The interior artwork was initially done by <a href="Hans%20Waldemar%20Wessolowski">Hans Wessolowski</a> (more usually known as "Wesso"), Mark Marchioni and <a href="Alex%20Schomburg">Alex Schomburg</a>, and occasionally <a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a>. The initial cover art was mostly painted by <a href="Howard%20Brown%20%28artist%29">Howard Brown</a>, but when <a href="Earle%20K.%20Bergey">Earle K. Bergey</a> began to paint covers for "Startling" in 1940, soon after its launch, Bergey quickly became identified with the magazine; between 1940 and 1952 (the year of Bergey's death) he painted the great majority of covers. Bergey's covers were visually striking: in the words of science fiction editor and critic Malcolm Edwards, they typically featured "a rugged hero, a desperate heroine (in either a metallic bikini or a dangerous state of "déshabillé") and a hideous alien menace". The brass bra motif came to be associated with Bergey, and his covers did much to create the image of science fiction as it was perceived by the general public.

When Merwin became editor in 1945 he brought changes, but artist Earle K. Bergey retained the creative freedom he had come to expect given his relationship with Standard. Some argue that Bergey's covers became more realistic, and Merwin managed to improve the interiors of "Startling" to the point of being a serious rival to "Astounding", acknowledged leader of the field. Critics' opinions vary on the relative quality of the magazines of this era; Malcolm Edwards regards "Startling" as second only to "Astounding", but Ashley considers "Thrilling Wonder" to be "Astounding"s closest challenger in the late 1940s. Merwin's discoveries included <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>, whose first story, "The World Thinker", appeared in the Summer 1945 issue. He also regularly published work by Henry Kuttner and <a href="C.%20L.%20Moore">C.L. Moore</a>, who wrote both under Kuttner's name and as "Keith Hammond": in a four-year period from 1946 to 1949 the writing team of Kuttner and Moore had seven novels published in "Startling", mostly <a href="science%20fantasy">science fantasy</a>, a subgenre not common at that time. Notable novels that appeared in the late 1940s include <a href="Fredric%20Brown">Fredric Brown</a>'s "What Mad Universe" and <a href="Charles%20L.%20Harness">Charles L. Harness</a>'s "Flight Into Yesterday", later published in book form as "The Paradox Men". <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20City%20and%20the%20Stars">The City and the Stars</a>" first saw print in "Startling" in abbreviated form, in the November 1948 issue, under the title "Against the Fall of Night".

One novel that did not appear in "Startling" was <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s "<a href="Pebble%20in%20the%20Sky">Pebble in the Sky</a>", which Merwin had commissioned from Asimov in the early summer of 1947. After the unusual step of allowing the editor to twice read the work-in-progress and receiving nothing but approval, Asimov delivered a completed draft in September. This time, Merwin asked for revisions: <a href="Leo%20Margulies">Leo Margulies</a>, Merwin's boss, had decided that "Startling" needed to focus more on action and adventure in the style of "Amazing", and less on cerebral stories in the style of "Astounding". Asimov, "for the first and only time of [his] life...openly lost [his] temper with an editor", stalked out of the room with his manuscript and never submitted anything to Merwin again, though he later expressed a softening of feeling and admitted Merwin had been within his rights.

Another title in the Standard Magazines stable was "<a href="Captain%20Future">Captain Future</a>", which had been launched a year after "Startling", and featured the adventures of the superhero after whom the magazine was named. When it folded with its Spring 1944 issue, the series of novels was continued for some time in the pages of "Startling"; over the next six years ten more "Captain Future" novels appeared, with the last one, "Birthplace of Creation", printed in the May 1951 issue.

Merwin's successor, Mines, also published some excellent work, though increased competition in the early 1950s from "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy</a>" and "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>" did lead to some dilution of quality, and "Startling"s rates—one to two cents per word—could not compete with the leading magazines. However, "Startling"s editorial policy was more eclectic: it did not limit itself to one kind of story, but printed everything from melodramatic space opera to sociological sf, and Mines had a reputation as having "the most catholic tastes and the fewest inhibitions" of any of the science fiction magazine editors. In late 1952, Mines published <a href="Philip%20Jos%C3%A9%20Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a>'s "The Lovers", a taboo-breaking story about aliens who can reproduce only by mating with humans. Illustrated with an eye-popping cover by Bergey, Farmer's ground-breaking story integrated sex into the plot without being prurient, and was widely praised. Farmer, partly as a consequence, went on to win a <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> as "Most Promising New Writer". New authors first published by Mines include <a href="Frank%20Herbert">Frank Herbert</a>, who debuted with "Looking for Something?" in April 1952, and <a href="Robert%20F.%20Young">Robert F. Young</a>, whose first story, "The Black Deep Thou Wingest", appeared in June 1953. The artwork was also high quality; Virgil Finlay's interior illustrations were "unparalleled", according to science fiction historian Robert Ewald. Other well-known artists who contributed interior work included Alex Schomburg and <a href="Frank%20Kelly%20Freas">Kelly Freas</a>.

"Startling"s instantly recognizable title logo was redolent of the magazine's pulp roots, and in early 1952 Mines decided to replace it with a more staid typeface. The covers became more sober, with spaceships replacing the women in brass bras. With the Spring 1955 issue, at the start of its final year, "Startling" dropped its long-standing policy of printing a novel in every issue, but only three issues later it ceased publication.

The editorial succession at "Startling" was as follows:

"Startling" was a pulp-sized magazine for all of its 99 issues. It initially was 132 pages, and was priced at 15 cents. The page count was reduced to 116 pages with the Summer 1944 issue and then increased to 148 pages with the March 1948 issue, at which time the price went up to 20 cents. The price increased again, to 25 cents, in November 1948, and the page count increased again to 180 pages. This higher page count did not last; it was reduced to 164 in March 1949 and then again to 148 pages in July 1951. The October 1953 issue saw the page count drop again, to 132, and a year later the Fall 1954 issue cut the page count to 116. The magazine remained at 116 pages and a price of 25 cents for the rest of its existence.

The original bimonthly schedule continued until the March 1943 issue, which was followed by June 1943 and then Fall 1943. This inaugurated a quarterly schedule that ran until Fall 1946, except that an additional issue, dated March, was inserted between the Winter 1946 and Spring 1946 issues. The next issue, January 1947, began another bimonthly sequence, which ran without interruption until November 1951. With the following issue, January 1952, "Startling" switched to a monthly schedule, which lasted until the June 1953 issue which was followed by August and October 1953 and then January 1954. The next issue was Spring 1954, and the magazine stayed on a quarterly schedule from then until the last issue, Fall 1955.

There was a British reprint edition from Pembertons between 1949 and 1954. These were heavily cut, with sometimes only one or two stories and usually only 64 pages, though the October and December 1952 issues both had 80 pages. It was published irregularly; initially once or twice a year, and then more or less bimonthly beginning in mid-1952. The issues were numbered from 1 to 18. Three different Canadian reprint editions also appeared for a total of 21 or 22 issues (sources differ on the correct number). Six quarterly issues appeared from Summer 1945 through Fall 1946 from Publication Enterprises, Ltd.; then another three bimonthly issues appeared, from May to September 1948, from <a href="Thrilling%20Publications">Pines Publications</a>. Finally 12 more bimonthly issues appeared from March 1949 to January 1951, from Better Publications of Canada. All these issues were almost identical to the American versions, although they are half an inch taller. A Mexican magazine, "Enigmas", ran for 16 issues from August 1955 to May 1958; it included many reprints, primarily from "Startling" and from "Fantastic Story Magazine".

Two anthologies of stories from "Startling" have been published. In 1949 Merlin Press brought out "From Off This World", edited by Leo Margulies and Oscar Friend, which included stories that had appeared in the "Hall of Fame" reprint section of the magazine. Then in 1954 Samuel Mines edited "The Best from Startling Stories", published by Henry Holt; despite the title, the stories were reprinted from both "Startling" and its sister magazine, "Thrilling Wonder Stories". The anthology was reprinted twice in the UK under different titles; as "Startling Stories" in 1954, published by Cassell, and then in 1956 as a Science Fiction Book Club edition titled "Moment in Time". <a href="P.%20Schuyler%20Miller">P. Schuyler Miller</a> praised it as "an excellent collection by anyone's standards."

Great Lakes Storm of 1913

The Great Lakes Storm of 1913, historically referred to as the "Big Blow," the "Freshwater Fury," or the "White Hurricane," was a <a href="blizzard">blizzard</a> with <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>-force winds that devastated the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Basin">Great Lakes Basin</a> in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a> and the province of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> from November 7 through November 10, 1913. The storm was most powerful on November 9, battering and overturning ships on four of the five <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, particularly <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a>. Deceptive lulls in the storm and the slow pace of weather reports contributed to the storm's destructiveness.

The deadliest and most destructive <a href="natural%20disaster">natural disaster</a> to hit the lakes in recorded history, the Great Lakes Storm killed more than 250 people, destroyed 19 ships, and stranded 19 others. The financial loss in vessels alone was nearly <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US</a> $5 million (or about $ in today's dollars). This included about $1 million at current value in lost cargo totalling about 68,300 <a href="tonnage">tons</a>, such as coal, iron ore, and grain.

The storm, an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a>, originated as the convergence of two major <a href="Weather%20front">storm fronts</a>, fueled by the lakes' relatively warm waters—a seasonal process called a "November <a href="gale">gale</a>". It produced 90 mph (145 km/h) wind gusts, <a href="ocean%20surface%20wave">waves</a> over 35 feet (11 m) high, and <a href="whiteout%20%28weather%29">whiteout</a> <a href="snowsquall">snowsquall</a>s. Analysis of the storm and its impact on humans, engineering structures, and the landscape led to better forecasting and faster responses to storm warnings, stronger construction (especially of marine vessels), and improved preparedness.

The immense volume of water in the five Great Lakes holds heat that allows the lakes to remain relatively warm for much later into the year and postpones the Arctic spread in the region. During the autumn months, two major weather tracks converge over the area. Cold, dry air moves south/southeast from the province of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> and northern <a href="Canada">Canada</a>; warm, moist air moves north/northeast from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, along the <a href="leeward">lee</a> of the central <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. The collision of these masses forms large storm systems in the middle of the North American continent, including the Great Lakes. When the cold air from these storms moves over the lakes, it is warmed by the waters below and picks up a spin. As the <a href="cyclone">cyclonic</a> system continues over the lakes, its power is intensified by the <a href="jet%20stream">jet stream</a> above and the warm waters below.

The result is commonly referred to as a "November gale" or "<a href="Witch%20of%20November">November witch</a>." Such a storm can maintain hurricane-force wind gusts, produce waves over 50 feet (15 m) high, and dump several inches of rain or feet of snow. Fuelled by the warm lake water, these powerful storms may remain over the Great Lakes for days. Intense winds ravage the lakes and surrounding shores, severely eroding and flooding the shorelines.

November gales have been a <a href="Great%20Storms%20of%20the%20North%20American%20Great%20Lakes">bane of the Great Lakes</a>, with at least 25 killer storms striking the region since 1847. During the <a href="Great%20Storms%20of%20the%20North%20American%20Great%20Lakes%23The%201905%20Blow%20.281905.29">Big Blow of 1905</a>, 27 wooden vessels were lost. During a November gale in 1975, the giant <a href="ore">ore</a> bulk carrier <a href="SS%20Edmund%20Fitzgerald">SS "Edmund Fitzgerald"</a> sank suddenly with all hands, without a <a href="distress%20signal">distress signal</a>.

The storm was first noticed on Thursday, November 6, on the western side of <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>, moving rapidly toward northern <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>. The <a href="Weather%20forecasting">weather forecast</a> in "<a href="The%20Detroit%20News">The Detroit News</a>" called for "moderate to brisk" winds for the Great Lakes, with occasional rains Thursday night or Friday for the upper lakes (except on southern <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a>), and fair to unsettled conditions for the lower lakes.

Around midnight, the <a href="steamboat">steamer</a> "Cornell", while 50 miles (80 km) west of <a href="Whitefish%20Point">Whitefish Point</a> in Lake Superior, ran into a sudden northerly gale and was badly damaged. This gale lasted until late November 10, almost forcing "Cornell" ashore.

On Friday, the weather forecast in the "Port Huron Times-Herald" of <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron, Michigan</a>, described the storm as "moderately severe." By then, the storm was centered over the upper <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi Valley</a> and had caused moderate to brisk southerly winds with warmer weather over the lakes. The forecast predicted increased winds and falling temperatures over the next 24 hours.

At 10:00 a.m., <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">Coast Guard</a> stations and <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) Weather Bureau offices at Lake Superior ports raised white <a href="maritime%20flags">pennants</a> above square red flags with black centers, indicating a storm warning with northwesterly winds. By late afternoon, the storm signal flags were replaced with a vertical sequence of red, white, and red lanterns, indicating that a hurricane with winds over 74 mph (119 km/h) was coming. (The word "hurricane" here does not refer to a <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>, but to Force 12 winds on the <a href="Beaufort%20scale">Beaufort scale</a>.) The winds on Lake Superior had already reached 50 mph (80 km/h), and an accompanying blizzard was moving toward Lake Huron.

By Saturday, the storm's status had been upgraded to "<a href="Severe%20weather">severe</a>". The storm was centered over eastern Lake Superior, covering the entire lake <a href="drainage%20basin">basin</a>. The weather forecast of the "Port Huron Times-Herald" stated that southerly winds had remained "moderate to brisk". Northwesterly winds had reached gale strength on northern Lake Michigan and western Lake Superior, with winds of up to 60 mph (97 km/h) at <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth, Minnesota</a>.

A false lull in the storm (a "<a href="sucker%20hole">sucker hole</a>") allowed traffic to begin flowing again, both down the <a href="St.%20Marys%20River%20%28Michigan-Ontario%29">St. Marys River</a> and up <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a>, and the <a href="Detroit%20River">Detroit</a> and <a href="St.%20Clair%20River">St. Clair</a> rivers, into Lake Huron. Gale wind flags were raised at more than a hundred ports, but were ignored by many ship captains. <a href="Lake%20freighter">Long ships</a> traveled all that day through the <a href="St.%20Marys%20River%20%28Michigan-Ontario%29">St. Marys River</a>, all night through the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a>, and early Sunday morning up the Detroit and St. Clair rivers.

By noon on Sunday, weather conditions on lower Lake Huron were close to normal for a November gale. <a href="Barometric%20pressure">Barometric pressure</a>s in some areas began to rise, bringing hope of an end to the storm. The <a href="low%20pressure%20area">low pressure area</a> that had moved across Lake Superior was moving northeast, away from the lakes.

The Weather Bureau had issued the first of its twice-daily reports at approximately 8:00 a.m.; it did not send another report to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> until 8:00 p.m. This proved to be a serious problem: the storm would have the better part of a day to build up hurricane forces before the Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C., would have detailed information.

Along southeastern <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a>, near the city of <a href="Erie%2C%20Pennsylvania">Erie, Pennsylvania</a>, a southern low-pressure area was moving toward the lake. This low had formed overnight, so was absent from Friday's weather map. It had been traveling northward and began moving northwestward after passing over Washington, D.C.

The intense <a href="clockwise%20and%20counterclockwise">counterclockwise</a> rotation of the low was made apparent by the changing wind directions around its center. In <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>, morning northwest winds had shifted to northeast by noon and were blowing southeast by 5:00 p.m., with the fastest gusts, 80 mph (130 km/h), occurring between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. Just 180 miles (290 km) to the southwest, in Cleveland, winds remained northwest during the day, shifting to the west by 5:00 p.m., and maintaining speeds of more than 50 mph (80 km/h). The fastest gust in Cleveland, 79 mph (127 km/h), occurred at 4:40 p.m. There was a dramatic drop in <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> at Buffalo, from 29.52 <a href="Pressure">inHg</a> (999.7 <a href="hPa">hPa</a>) at 8:00 a.m. to 28.77 inHg (974.3 hPa) at 8:00 p.m.

The rotating low continued along its northward path into the evening, bringing its counterclockwise winds in phase with the northwesterly winds already hitting Lakes Superior and Huron. This resulted in an explosive increase in northerly wind speeds and swirling snow. Ships on Lake Huron that were south of <a href="Alpena%2C%20Michigan">Alpena, Michigan</a>—especially around <a href="Harbor%20Beach%2C%20Michigan">Harbor Beach</a> and <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a> in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> and <a href="Goderich%2C%20Ontario">Goderich</a> and <a href="Sarnia%2C%20Ontario">Sarnia</a> in Ontario—were battered with massive waves moving southward toward St. Clair River.

Some ships had sought shelter along the coast in Michigan or along the Goderich to Point Edward coast but few survived the powerful north winds. Three of the larger ships were found upside down, indicative of extremely high winds and tall waves.

From 8:00 p.m. to midnight, the storm became what modern <a href="meteorology">meteorologists</a> call a "<a href="weather%20bomb">weather bomb</a>". Sustained hurricane-speed winds of more than 70 mph (110 km/h) ravaged the four western lakes. The worst damage was done on Lake Huron as numerous ships scrambled for shelter along its southern end. Gusts of 90 mph (140 km/h) were reported off Harbor Beach, Michigan. The lake's shape allowed northerly winds to increase unchecked, because of the lower surface friction of water compared to land, and the wind following the lake's long axis.

In retrospect, weather forecasters of the time did not have enough data or understanding of atmospheric <a href="dynamics%20%28mechanics%29">dynamics</a> to predict or comprehend the events of Sunday, November 9. <a href="Weather%20front">Frontal</a> mechanisms, referred to then as "<a href="squall">squall</a> lines", were not yet understood. Surface observations were collected only twice daily at stations around the country, and by the time these data were collected and hand-drawn maps created, the information lagged actual weather conditions by hours.

On Monday morning, the storm had moved northeast of <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London, Ontario</a>, dragging <a href="lake%20effect%20snow">lake effect blizzards</a> in its wake. An additional 17 inches (43 cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the streets with snowdrifts 6 feet (2 m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take shelter and wait for things to clear.

By Tuesday, the storm was rapidly moving across eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, it lost strength quickly. This also meant less snowfall, both because of the fast motion of the storm and the lack of lake effect snow. All shipping was halted on Monday and part of Tuesday along the <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20River">St. Lawrence River</a> around <a href="Montreal%2C%20Quebec">Montreal, Quebec</a>.

Historically, storms of such magnitude and with such high wind velocities have not lasted more than four or five hours. The Great Lakes storm, however, raged for more than 16 hours, with an average speed of 60 mph (100 km/h), and frequent bursts of more than 70 mph (110 km/h). It crippled traffic on the lakes and throughout the Great Lakes basin region.

Along the shoreline, blizzards shut down traffic and communication, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. A 22-inch (56 cm) snowfall in Cleveland, Ohio, put stores out of business for two days. There were four-foot (122 cm) <a href="snowdrift">snowdrift</a>s around Lake Huron. Power was out for several days across Michigan and Ontario, cutting off telephone and <a href="telegraphy">telegraph</a> communications. A recently completed US$100,000 <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> <a href="Breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a>, intended to protect the <a href="Lincoln%20Park%2C%20Chicago">Lincoln Park</a> basin from storms, was swept away in a few hours. The <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a> harbor lost its entire south breakwater and much of the surrounding South Park area that had been recently renovated.

After the final blizzards hit Cleveland, the city was paralyzed under feet of ice and snow and was without power for days. Telephone poles had been broken, and power cables lay in tangled masses. The November 11 "<a href="The%20Plain%20Dealer">Plain Dealer</a>" described the aftermath:

William H. Alexander, Cleveland's chief weather forecaster, observed:

The greatest damage was done on the lakes. Major <a href="shipwreck">shipwreck</a>s occurred on all but Lake Ontario, with most happening on southern and western Lake Huron. Lake masters recounted that waves reached at least 35 feet (11 m) in height. Being shorter in length than waves ordinarily formed by gales, they occurred in rapid succession, with three waves frequently striking in succession. Masters also stated that the wind often blew in directions opposite to the waves below. This was the result of the storm's cyclonic motion, a phenomenon rarely seen on the Great Lakes.

In the late afternoon of November 10, an unknown vessel was spotted floating upside-down in about of water on the eastern coast of Michigan, within sight of <a href="Huronia%20Beach">Huronia Beach</a> and the mouth of the St. Clair River. Determining the identity of this "mystery ship" became of regional interest, resulting in daily front-page newspaper articles. The ship eventually sank, and it was not until early Saturday morning, November 15, that it was finally identified as the "Charles S. Price". (This was the first time in Great Lakes history that a fully loaded ore carrier had been capsized.) The front page of that day's "Port Huron Times-Herald" extra edition read, "BOAT IS PRICE — DIVER IS BAKER — SECRET KNOWN". Milton Smith, an assistant engineer who decided at the last moment not to join his crew on premonition of disaster, aided in identifying any bodies that were found.

The final tally of financial loss included <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>2,332,000 for vessels totally lost, $830,900 for vessels that became constructive total losses, $620,000 for vessels stranded but returned to service, and approximately $1,000,000 in lost cargoes. This figure did not include financial losses in coastal cities.

The storm had several long-term consequences. Complaints against the USDA Weather Bureau of alleged unpreparedness resulted in increased efforts to achieve more accurate <a href="weather%20forecasting">weather forecasting</a> and faster realization and communication of proper storm warnings. Criticism of the shipping companies and shipbuilders led to a series of conferences with insurers and mariners to seek safer designs for vessels. This resulted in the construction of ships with greater stability and more longitudinal strength. Immediately following the blizzard of Cleveland, Ohio, the city began a campaign to move all utility cables underground, in tubes beneath major streets. The project took half a decade.

The following list includes ships that sank during the storm, killing their entire crews. It does not include the three victims from the freighter "William Nottingham", who volunteered to leave the ship on a <a href="Lifeboat%20%28shipboard%29">lifeboat</a> in search of assistance. While the boat was being lowered into the water, a breaking wave smashed it into the side of the ship. The men disappeared into the near-freezing waters below. The following shipwreck casualties have been documented:


Of the twelve ships that sank in the storm, twohave never been found: "Leafield" and "James Carruthers". The most recent discovery is "Hydrus", which was located in the summer of 2015. The last wreck found previous to "Hydrus" was "Henry B. Smith" in 2013. Among the ships debris cast up by the storm was of wreckage from the steamer "J.Q.Jones" lost in November 1906 and wreckage of the fish tug "Searchlight" Lost in April 1907 .

Still Reigning

Still Reigning is a live performance <a href="DVD">DVD</a> by the <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> band <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>, released in 2004 through <a href="American%20Recordings%20%28US%29">American Recordings</a>. Filmed at the <a href="Augusta%20Civic%20Center">Augusta Civic Center</a> on July 11, 2004, the performance showcases Slayer's 1986 album, "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>", played in its entirety with the four original band members on a set resembling their 1986 "Reign in Pain" tour. "Still Reigning" was voted "best live DVD" by the readers of "<a href="Revolver%20%28magazine%29">Revolver</a>" magazine, and received <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">gold certification</a> in 2005.

The DVD is notable for the finale, which features Slayer covered in stage blood while performing the song "<a href="Raining%20Blood">Raining Blood</a>", leading to a demanding mixing process plagued by production and technical difficulties. The DVD's producer <a href="Kevin%20Shirley">Kevin Shirley</a> spent hours replacing <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a> and drum hits one-by-one. He publicly aired financial disagreements he had with the band and criticized the quality of the recording, and as a result was allegedly subjected to threats and insults from people associated with the band.

"Reign in Blood" was released in 1986 and was Slayer's first album to enter the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>—at 94— and their first to be awarded <a href="RIAA%20certification">gold certification</a>. Music critics praised the album; "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" described it as the "heaviest album of all time", while Steve Huey of <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> wrote that the album was a "stone-cold classic". The positive reception led to the band's European agent John Jackson, to suggest that the band play "Reign in Blood" in its entirety on the Jägermeister tour of 2003 and 2004, under the tour banner "Still Reigning". Original drummer <a href="Dave%20Lombardo">Dave Lombardo</a>, who recorded drums on the album, re-joined the band in 2001, after departing in 1991. This influenced the band's decision to play the album in its entirety, as they had the original members and all members regard the album as a high-point in their career. The band was going to enter the recording studio to record their next album ("<a href="Christ%20Illusion">Christ Illusion</a>"). However, the band's producer <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> insisted the band not enter the recording studio due to problems between himself and the band's record label, <a href="American%20Recordings%20%28US%29">American Recordings</a>. The band's manager suggested they record a performance of one of the Jägermeister shows and release it on a DVD — the band agreed.

The final track of the DVD, "<a href="Raining%20Blood">Raining Blood</a>", culminates with the band drenched by stage blood. Guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a> came up with the idea of the blood two years after "Reign in Blood"'s release, but the band lacked the funding to do so. The beginning of the film "<a href="Blade%20%28film%29">Blade</a>" (released in 1998) features a "bloodbath" with <a href="vampires">vampires</a> dancing in a club with blood coming from the roof via a sprinkler system. The scene revived Jeff Hanneman and guitarist <a href="Kerry%20King">Kerry King</a>'s interest, and since the band released a DVD the previous year — "<a href="War%20at%20the%20Warfield">War at the Warfield</a>" — they decided to add something different for the new DVD — raining blood. King asserted that since Lombardo was not on the previous DVD, this one was going to be important. Due to the short length of the DVD, director <a href="Dean%20Karr">Dean Karr</a> chose an additional bonus six songs from the same show as he thought certain members excelled in the performances.

"Still Reigning" was recorded at the Augusta Civic Center in <a href="Augusta%2C%20Maine">Augusta, Maine</a> on July 11, 2004, prior to the 2004 <a href="Ozzfest">Ozzfest</a>. A ten-man camera crew under the direction of Dean Karr was on hand to document the show, backstage action, and exclusive interviews inside the band's tour bus. The interview, "Slayer: In their own words", is a seventeen-minute piece which features the band talking about their early years, influences, writing lyrics, Lombardo's return, and the band's eventual retirement. At one point Lombardo rejected the possibility of a future "good-bye tour" for Slayer, and states if the band realize they have "lost a step" they will "call it a day".

The stage was converted to resemble the band's 1986 "Reign in Pain" tour, which featured the Slayer eagle and inverted crosses as part of the lighting rig. The stage was modified to absorb the "blood" and have it recirculate back down upon the band, which allowed for easier clean-up and lowered the chance of injury by slipping. The DVD was recorded in 1.85:1 video, which caused macro blocking errors such as <a href="aliasing">aliasing</a> and a murky stage when fully lit, and the audio featured English <a href="Dolby%20Digital">Dolby Digital</a> 5.1 and 2.0 stereo, with no <a href="subtitles">subtitles</a>.
<a href="Kevin%20Shirley">Kevin Shirley</a>, who has worked with the bands <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a> and <a href="Dream%20Theater">Dream Theater</a>, produced the DVD. He issued a statement describing the demanding mixing process which took place at his New York Studio: "It's OK — some places it rocks hard, and others are a bit sloppy, but I'm sure they won't use the whole concert. It was tough to mix." The following day Shirley apologized for his "unprofessional comment" towards the band, and altered his post on his <a href="personal%20website">personal website</a> to read: "The rest of the week I finished mixing a live Slayer set for a DVD, in stereo and surround, and it's great — it rocks hard, but it was tough to mix."

On September 30, 2006, Shirley issued a further statement claiming he had not been paid for his work, and had received threats and insults from people associated with the band: "I've just mixed a really wonderful band with one of the worst sounding recordings ever. It's kinda disgraceful that they won't spend anything on a decent recording! I won't say who, because last time I commented on a sloppy recording (on this page), they refused to pay me and I got all manner of threats and insults from people associated with the band, so I'd best be quiet!"

The stage blood caused technical difficulties as it soaked the microphone, guitars, and cymbals, which according to Shirley sounded like "coffee mugs being tapped with a spoon". A review of the DVD observed that "If it wasn't for guitarist Jeff Hanneman being out of position and missing all of the blood, the guitar might have sounded pretty bad." Hanneman missed the initial downpour due to a technical problem with his guitar, and was deluged by a light shower when coming back on-stage.
Shirley replaced thousands of cymbal and drum hits with those used on previous recordings; the process took several days to complete. After recording the DVD, the band used a sprinkler system with diluted water rather than a bucket with blood that was like <a href="tar">tar</a> when recording the DVD. King later remarked, "My guitar didn’t like it, that was the last time I played it," and he donated it to the <a href="Hard%20Rock%20Cafe">Hard Rock Cafe</a> after the show. Vocalist <a href="Tom%20Araya">Tom Araya</a> felt the same and admitted; "It was messy. I couldn't play because the initial dump at the beginning of the song got all over me. I couldn't hold my pick. I was slapping my bass trying to get sound out of it."

"Still Reigning" debuted on the <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard" DVD</a> chart at number seven — selling 9,813 copies. It became the band's second DVD to receive gold certification on July 20, 2005, after "War at the Warfield", which received gold certification a year earlier for sales in excess of 50,000. The readers of <a href="Revolver%20%28magazine%29">"Revolver" magazine</a> voted it "best live DVD" in 2005, making it the second consecutive year the band topped the category.

Slayer received a positive reception when performing at the Augusta Civic Center. On finishing half the <a href="set%20list">set list</a>, the band briefly left the stage and returned to play the 28-minute album, "Reign in Blood" as an encore. On the final song, "Raining Blood" the lights were turned off and Slayer members were deluged by two buckets of stage blood. According to King, the crowd went quiet for a few seconds until they realized the blood was part of the show. King thought Araya looked like a psychotic mass murderer, which contributed to the crowd's reaction. Following the two large drops, stage blood mixed with water was used so it looked like it was "raining blood".

Andy Patrizio of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> awarded the DVD six out of ten commenting, "<a href="Tom%20Araya">Tom Araya</a> lost his piercing shriek that opens '<a href="Angel%20of%20Death%20%28Slayer%20song%29">Angel of Death</a>' and the end of 'Necrophobic'", praising Lombardo's return by saying the drummer "...hasn't lost a step at all. With barely any breathing time between songs, the underground drum legend shows that an impending 40th birthday (next month) isn't going to slow him down." Patrizio stated the production was not of the highest caliber, as the rapid "<a href="MTV">MTV</a>-style" cuts were distracting, as was the switch from black and white to color shots. Patrizio ended the review with the comment, "This is what you get for letting <a href="Uwe%20Boll">Uwe Boll</a> direct your music video", Boll being a heavily criticized <a href="film%20director">film director</a>.

Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver

Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is an <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Crystal%20Dynamics">Crystal Dynamics</a> and published by <a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a>. It was released for the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> in 1999 and for the <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> in 2000. As the second game in the "<a href="Legacy%20of%20Kain">Legacy of Kain</a>" series, "Soul Reaver" is the sequel to "". "Soul Reaver" was followed by three games, one of which, "<a href="Soul%20Reaver%202">Soul Reaver 2</a>", is a direct sequel.

Taking place 1500 years after the events of "Blood Omen", "Soul Reaver" chronicles the journey of the <a href="vampire">vampire</a>-turned-<a href="Wraith%20%28entity%29">wraith</a> <a href="Raziel%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">Raziel</a>, lieutenant to the vampire lord <a href="Kain%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">Kain</a>. Raziel is killed by Kain, but is revived by <a href="Elder%20God%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">The Elder God</a> to become his "soul reaver" and to exact revenge. Raziel shares this title with Kain's sword, the Soul Reaver, which he acquires during the game.

Crystal Dynamics began development of the game in 1997, but a deteriorating relationship with <a href="Silicon%20Knights">Silicon Knights</a>, who had developed "Blood Omen", created legal problems. This and other delays forced material originally planned for "Soul Reaver" to be instead released with later games of the series. "Soul Reaver" was generally well received by critics and praised for its intriguing gothic story and high-quality graphics. However, the game was criticized for simple and repetitive gameplay and an unsatisfying climax.

The player controls Raziel, a disfigured and ghostly vampire. The game is normally shown from a third-person perspective behind Raziel, but players can rotate the viewpoint around him. <a href="Gameplay">Gameplay</a> relies largely on shifting between the material and spectral <a href="Plane%20%28esoterism%29">planes</a> of existence to progress through areas. Although interaction with objects is limited in the spectral realm, this can be advantageous, because Raziel can phase through otherwise impassable gates there, and water is insubstantial, allowing him to walk on lakebeds; however, blocks, doors, and switches can be manipulated only in the physical realm. Many puzzles are based on the differences between the two realms; for example, platforms and environment features in one realm may change form to open new paths in the other. <a href="Puzzle%20platformer">Block puzzles</a> are also common and require the rotation, flipping, and moving of large blocks to progress, often with a time limit and while avoiding enemies.
Combat in "Soul Reaver" is a <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> system, involving the use of <a href="Combo%20%28video%20games%29">combinations</a> of various different attacks before a finishing move. Raziel's enemies are grouped into humans, spectral creatures, and most commonly, vampires. Human enemies include peasants, <a href="vampire%20hunter">vampire hunter</a>s and vampire worshippers. In the spectral realm, players fight minor enemies called Sluagh and the souls of dead vampires who have become wraiths. Each brood of vampire enemies has unique powers reminiscent of their clan leader. Human and spectral enemies can be killed with Raziel's claws or any weapon, but vampires must be bludgeoned into a stunned state and then destroyed by <a href="impalement">impaling</a> them, lighting them on fire, or tossing them into a hazard such as sunlight or water. When killed, enemies leave behind souls that replenish Raziel's health, which automatically decreases in the material realm and increases in the spectral. Possession of the Soul Reaver sword stops automatic degeneration of health in the physical realm, but Raziel loses the sword instantly if he sustains damage and can regain it only by restoring his health to full.

At first, Raziel can jump, glide using his torn wings, move blocks, and pick up and throw objects and enemies. Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can alternatively use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb walls in the material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.
He also gains the ability to constrict objects and enemies with a band of energy, although this feature was one of the few abilities not to feature in future games. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire bolts of <a href="psychokinesis">telekinetic</a> energy, which cause little damage by themselves but can knock enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. <a href="Baptism">Baptism</a> in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical <a href="glyph">glyph</a>s that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously. These glyphs typically involve vampire weaknesses such as sunlight, fire, water, or sound, as well as additions such as telekinetic force (available well before the normal telekinesis becomes available) and the causing of earthquakes to temporarily stun enemies. Glyphs are acquired through finding glyph altars, specific locations in Nosgoth where the skills can be learned, and solving a puzzle before being granted the magical ability. However, Raziel begins the game with access to the 'Shift' glyph, granting the ability to shift between the material and spectral planes, with no glyph altar necessary.

"Soul Reaver" takes place within the fictional world of Nosgoth, where the health of the land is tied to the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, and each pillar in turn is represented by a guardian. Before the events of "Soul Reaver", the guardians became corrupt, and, after Kain killed eight of them, he discovered he was the final one. Refusing to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars, he doomed Nosgoth to eternal decay and proceeded to raise his vampire lieutenants, including Raziel, to besiege the land. By the time of "Soul Reaver"s introduction, the vampires are now the land's dominant species and <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>s, the humans have been decimated, and the vampire tribes have each claimed a region of Nosgoth and turned their attention to internal matters. Unknown to the vampires, beneath Nosgoth lurks The Elder God, an ancient and powerful entity. The Elder God controls the <a href="Rota%20Fortunae">Wheel of Fate</a>, a cycle of <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of souls that circle the Wheel in a loop of <a href="predestination">predestination</a>; however, because vampires are <a href="Immortality">immortal</a>, their souls do not spin with the Wheel, causing the land to decay as the Wheel stalls. By the time that Raziel is revived centuries after the game's opening cinematic, Nosgoth is on the brink of collapse, little more than a wasteland wracked with cataclysms and earthquakes.

The protagonist of "Soul Reaver" is the vampire-turned-wraith <a href="Raziel%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">Raziel</a>, whom <a href="Kain%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">Kain</a> casts to death at the beginning of the game. Although Kain is the protagonist of the previous game, "", he is the primary antagonist and final <a href="Boss%20%28video%20game%29">boss</a> of "Soul Reaver". The Elder God resurrects and assists Raziel, explains the game's controls, and describes previous events in the story. <a href="Ariel%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">Ariel</a>, who preceded Kain as the guardian of the Pillar of Balance, appears as a spirit and offers Raziel advice on occasion. During his quest, Raziel meets his brothers—<a href="Melchiah">Melchiah</a>, <a href="Zephon">Zephon</a>, <a href="Rahab%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">Rahab</a> and <a href="Dumah%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">Dumah</a>—who serve as the game's bosses. Each has developed different powers that Raziel partially gains by killing them and devouring their souls. A fifth brother, <a href="Turel">Turel</a>, was omitted due to time constraints on development.

As the game begins, Raziel approaches Kain's throne and extends newly grown wings. In an act of seeming jealousy, Kain tears the bones from Raziel's wings and has him thrown into the Lake of the Dead, a large natural <a href="whirlpool">whirlpool</a>; however, Raziel is resurrected as a wraith by The Elder God to become his "soul reaver" and kill Kain, thus restoring Nosgoth. With The Elder God's guidance, Raziel adapts to his new form and returns to Nosgoth. Infiltrating a Necropolis inhabited by the Melchahim vampires, Raziel finds his brother Melchiah, who has devolved into a beast unable to sustain his own flesh. After Raziel kills Melchiah and absorbs his soul, he confronts Kain among the ruined Pillars of Nosgoth in the Sanctuary of the Clans. Kain does not appear surprised to see Raziel, apparently having even been expecting him, and implies that he has destroyed Raziel's vampire clan, which only enrages Raziel even further. When Raziel begins to criticize him, Kain simply launches a tirade against him before noting what has become of the empire and engaging him in combat. Kain quickly overpowers Raziel and attempts to strike him down with the Soul Reaver, a powerful sword that absorbs its victims' souls; however, the Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and Kain escapes, strangely satisfied. Raziel enters the spectral realm to find the blade's soul-devouring spectral form, which binds itself to him. After this, Raziel meets <a href="Ariel%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">Ariel</a>, who restores his strength, and learns of Zephon's location from The Elder God.

Raziel ventures into a large <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a> once inhabited by the humans and finds the Zephonim clan. After ascending into the cathedral's spires, he finds that Zephon is now a large insect like creature whose body has merged into the cathedral spire in which he dwells. Raziel kills Zephon and uses the gained power to infiltrate an ancient <a href="crypt">crypt</a>. There, Raziel discovers coffins for members of the Sarafan, a fanatical order of <a href="vampire%20hunter">vampire hunter</a>s killed centuries before Kain's rule. To Raziel's horror, he finds the crypt was designated for him and his brothers; as cruel irony, Kain revived the Sarafan to serve him as his vampire sons. Raziel ventures through a secret passage under the crypt and finds a flooded abbey inhabited by the Rahabim clan, whose members have mutated into amphibians; its leader, Rahab, has become a <a href="merman">merman</a>. Raziel tells Rahab what he has learned about their human pasts, but Rahab is unmoved, claiming that Kain "saved" them, and attacks. Raziel defeats Rahab and absorbs his soul, then crosses the Lake of the Dead to the abandoned fortress of his brother Dumah. The Elder God explains that the Dumahim vampires were scattered following an invasion of human hunters. Raziel eventually finds Dumah shackled to his throne with his heart pierced. Raziel revives Dumah and leads him into a giant furnace, burning him alive and absorbing his soul.

Afterward, Raziel discovers the Oracle's Cave, where <a href="Moebius%20%28Legacy%20of%20Kain%29">Moebius the Time Streamer</a> once hid the Chronoplast, a magical <a href="time%20travel">time machine</a>. Raziel traverses the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered over what he has learned, and Kain says his actions are justified due to his being subject to <a href="destiny">destiny</a>, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to be when the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of "<a href="Soul%20Reaver%202">Soul Reaver 2</a>".

"Soul Reaver" entered development alongside "<a href="Blood%20Omen%202">Blood Omen 2</a>" in 1997 and focused on puzzle solving instead of "Blood Omen 2"s action. During design, the development team created larger areas that could be explored more thoroughly as Raziel acquired new powers, avoiding the "shallow[ness]" of "Blood Omen"s layout. Crystal Dynamics based "Soul Reaver" on Silicon Knights' research of vampire mythology for "Blood Omen". Other aspects of the game, such as the idea of a fallen vampire who devoured souls, were inspired by the epic poem "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>". The staff aimed to develop gameplay similar to "<a href="Tomb%20Raider">Tomb Raider</a>" and used an upgraded version of "<a href="Gex%203">Gex 3</a>"s <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> to generate the <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> game world. According to Richard Lemarchand, they also aimed to combine gameplay with storytelling in a similar manner to "". Amy Hennig, the game's director, likened the technological advance from "Blood Omen" to "Soul Reaver" to the evolution of "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>" series from the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo</a> to the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>—bringing the franchise into <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> while maintaining a similar style.

Before "Soul Reaver"s release, the relationship between Silicon Knights and Crystal Dynamics dissolved. Because their research was used, Silicon Knights filed an <a href="injunction">injunction</a> to stop further promotion of the game. Other delays pushed the release date from October 1998 to August 1999.

These delays forced Crystal Dynamics to cut significant game material, including additional powers for Raziel, a third battle with Kain, and an expanded Glyph system which would have given elemental powers to the Soul Reaver. In an interview, series director <a href="Amy%20Hennig">Amy Hennig</a> stated that the development team split the original, much larger plans in two after realizing that they had "over-designed the game", given the constraints on time and data. This decision explains "Soul Reaver"s <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> ending and the appearance of originally planned material in later games. Despite the split, Hennig explained that the team left unused components—such as extra power-ups and enemies—in "Soul Reaver"s game engine to avoid unforeseen glitches that might have arisen from their removal.

<a href="Kurt%20Harland">Kurt Harland</a> composed most of the music for "Soul Reaver"; Jim Hedges handled the remaining audio. Harland remarked that, under Amy Hennig's direction, he programmed music to <a href="Dynamic%20music">change</a> based on the current gameplay situation—for example, combat or swimming. This variation was accomplished through a custom <a href="Musical%20Instrument%20Digital%20Interface">Musical Instrument Digital Interface</a> (MIDI) driver, which altered music based on signals from the game engine. Each vampire tribe had corresponding music; one tribe of vampires was associated with a slow, thumping theme to convey a sense of working machinery. To further fit the music to the environment, the sound team consulted level designers regarding layout and appearance. Music from both "Soul Reaver" and "Soul Reaver 2" was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001.

For the game's voice acting, Raziel was voiced by <a href="Michael%20Bell%20%28actor%29">Michael Bell</a>, and <a href="Tony%20Jay">Tony Jay</a>, who had provided the voice of Mortanius and other characters in "Blood Omen", voiced The Elder God. <a href="Anna%20Gunn">Anna Gunn</a>, <a href="Simon%20Templeman">Simon Templeman</a> and <a href="Richard%20Doyle%20%28actor%29">Richard Doyle</a> reprised their roles from "Blood Omen" as Ariel, Kain and Moebius. Bell, Templeman and Jay also provided the voices of Melchiah, Dumah and Zephon, respectively, and <a href="Neil%20Ross">Neil Ross</a>, who voiced Malek the Paladin and King Ottmar in "Blood Omen", voiced Rahab.

"Soul Reaver" was showcased at the 1998 <a href="E3%20%28Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%29">E3</a>, where attendees were given free demo discs. Over time, further demo disks were released, including one bundled with "<a href="Official%20U.S.%20PlayStation%20Magazine">Official PlayStation Magazine</a>". "Soul Reaver" was released for the PC and Sony PlayStation in 1999 and for the Dreamcast version in 2000. The Dreamcast version used a much higher <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a> than did the PlayStation or PC version, and the Dreamcast port had further graphical enhancements. A Japanese release for the game was planned, but canceled. In 2000, "Soul Reaver" was added to Sony's "Greatest Hits" list, and the combined, global sales of its PlayStation, Dreamcast and computer versions surpassed 1.4 million units by late 2001. Sony later re-released the game for <a href="Digital%20distribution">digital download</a> on the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> in 2009.

<a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a>, the game's publisher, spent US$4,000,000 on a pre-release advertising campaign, which included magazine articles, television ads, and a <a href="tie-in">tie-in</a> comic book published by <a href="Top%20Cow%20Productions">Top Cow Productions</a>. Because such films like "<a href="Stir%20of%20Echoes">Stir of Echoes</a>", "<a href="The%20Sixth%20Sense">The Sixth Sense</a>", "<a href="The%20Blair%20Witch%20Project">The Blair Witch Project</a>" and "<a href="The%20Mummy%20%281999%20film%29">The Mummy</a>" had premiered earlier in 1999, "Soul Reaver"s release was considered "ideally timed" for a horror-oriented game. The lack of load times was a key marketing point praised by several reviewers. After release, Eidos and BBI partnered to release <a href="action%20figure">action figure</a>s of Raziel and Kain.

"Soul Reaver"s dark and gothic atmosphere was generally well-received, and several publications praised the game's <a href="cut%20scene">cut scene</a>s. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s reviewer called it "such an ambitious game - and one that achieves nearly everything it sets out to do - that few games come close to it", and praised the soundtrack for blending with the atmosphere unobtrusively. The Dreamcast port was cited as "perhaps one of the best looking console games ever made". "<a href="Next%20Generation%20Magazine">Next Generation Magazine</a>" echoed this, stating that, "even if you own the PlayStation version, you may want to rent this anyway", but expressed disappointment that no new features were added to the Dreamcast port. <a href="Allgame">AllGame's</a> reviewer called the cut scenes "seamless", and their frequency neither too high nor too low. The game's storyline was praised by "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" as being "grim and interesting". "Soul Reaver"s voice acting was also highly praised; <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> ranked this aspect of the game in its list of top ten "Best Voice Acting in Games". GameSpot also considered the atmosphere as rich as that of "Blood Omen", yet less dramatically overstated, and considered the graphics "among the best that have ever been on the PlayStation."

"<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" praised the aspect of shifting between realms, particularly the visual effects involved. Similarly, "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" described the transition between realms as a "complex and inspired piece of design", noting that it makes players think on different levels and consider "each room as two rooms, the answer to a puzzle possibly existing in either." However, the magazine criticized the save system for occasionally forcing players to replay large sections of the game to get to new areas. IGN stated that acquiring and learning the powers of Raziel's brothers constituted part of the fun, and that Raziel's moves were well animated and articulated. Finding minimal difficulty in using camera controls, GameSpot likened them to those of "<a href="Banjo-Kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>" and stated that players would want to adjust the camera deliberately to watch Raziel's movements. Presenting differences between Soul Reaver and the <a href="Tomb%20Raider">"Tomb Raider" series</a>, AllGame stated that the game's puzzles would challenge "all but the most experienced gamers", while "Game Informer" considered the puzzles "difficult-to-the-point-of-insanity". "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" enjoyed the devouring of souls.

Website reviewers deemed "Soul Reaver"s gameplay too non-linear and its objectives too unclear. GameSpot criticized the warp system for using confusing symbols that did little or nothing to indicate the warp's destination, and weighed the fun of impaling vampires with the Soul Reaver against the lack of challenge presented by bosses and most enemies. "Next Generation Magazine" considered the game challenging due to "difficult puzzles and lack of a map", requiring the player to backtrack. "<a href="The%20Tampa%20Tribune">The Tampa Tribune</a>" also criticized the camera controls, though noted that the "auto-facing" feature made the difficulties negligible. "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" criticized the PC port of the game for "chunky" graphics and bad camera controls, stating "it feels too much like a PlayStation release ported hurriedly on to the PC". "Computer Gaming World" similarly felt that the limitations of the PlayStation carried over in the PC port, rendering the latter's visuals "mind-numbingly boring". The publication praised the <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>-based story for engaging players, but was disappointed that "it peters out in an unsatisfying climax". "Game Informer" stated, "Even after years in development, "Soul Reaver" doesn't feel finished. It feels rushed." <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> ranked "Soul Reaver" second on its "Top 5 Games That Ended Halfway Through", stating "it's pretty clear that the plot would have been a lot different if the money hadn't inconveniently run out." <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> placed "Soul Reaver" at #4 on a 2007 list of the top seven video game apocalypses, regarding the post-apocalyptic Nosgoth as "one of the most fascinating wastelands we've ever explored".

At the time of the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>, Knowle was a rural area assessed at a taxable value of two <a href="Weregild">geld</a> units. Knowle West remained rural in character until the 1930s, when a <a href="council%20house">council housing</a> estate was developed to provide homes for people displaced by <a href="slum%20clearance">slum clearance</a> in the centre of the city.

Famous former residents include the musician <a href="Tricky%20%28musician%29">Tricky</a>, the boxer <a href="Dixie%20Brown">Dixie Brown</a> and late 1950s <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> band <a href="The%20Eagles%20%28UK%20band%29">the Eagles</a>. There are five schools and four churches in Knowle West, as well as a number of open spaces, community centres, youth clubs and shopping facilities. Community organisations include the Knowle West Media Centre, the Residents' Planning Group and the Knowle West Health Association. There are no major employers in Knowle West but there are many small local enterprises and larger businesses on nearby trading estates. The closure of the <a href="Imperial%20Tobacco">Imperial Tobacco</a> factory at nearby <a href="Hartcliffe">Hartcliffe</a> in 1990 caused a large number of job losses. Just under a third of the residents are classed as economically inactive and the area is one of the most economically deprived in Bristol. Knowle West has relatively high indices of crime and drug use, but community efforts to combat this have had some success.

There is evidence of late <a href="British%20Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> and <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> settlement at Inns Court and Filwood Park, which lie within Knowle West. In 1086, the area that is now Knowle West was assessed by the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday survey</a> as part of <a href="Knowle%2C%20Bristol">Knowle</a> in the <a href="hundred%20%28county%20subdivision%29">hundred</a> of <a href="Hartcliffe%20%28hundred%29">Hartcliffe</a>. The survey shows Knowle as being under the lordship of <a href="Eadnoth%20the%20Constable">Eadnoth the Constable</a> who had 30 holdings in <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> and <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> before the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest</a>. After the conquest, Knowle became part of the holdings of <a href="Osbern%20Giffard">Osbern Giffard</a>, who was lord, or tenant in chief, of holdings throughout <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, Wiltshire and Somerset. The Domesday Book shows Knowle as having eleven households, three <a href="Carucate">ploughland</a>s, one <a href="Cob%20%28horse%29">cob</a> (small horse), eight cattle, twenty five pigs, a meadow of , pasture of and a woodland area of by . For taxation purposes, the whole was assessed at two <a href="Danegeld%23Norman%20era">geld</a> units. Filwood Park, in the southern part of the area was part of the parish of <a href="Whitchurch%2C%20Bristol">Whitchurch</a> until incorporated into Bristol in 1930. In <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> times Filwood Chase was part of the <a href="royal%20forest">royal hunting estate</a> known as <a href="Kingswood%2C%20South%20Gloucestershire%23Royal%20Forest">Kingswood Forest</a>, which encompassed a large area around Bristol.

Inns Court and Filwood farms have <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> origins. The surviving parts of Inns Court, originally Inyn's Court, are now part of the former <a href="Holy%20Cross%20Inns%20Court%20Vicarage">Holy Cross Inns Court Vicarage</a> and the staircase turret is now a <a href="listed%20building">Grade II* listed building</a>. The building is in a state of bad repair and is on the "at risk" register. An <a href="Isolation%20%28health%20care%29">isolation hospital</a> was built at Nover's Hill in 1892, eventually superseded by a new hospital at Ham Green, near <a href="Pill%2C%20Somerset">Pill</a>, which opened in 1927. The site is now occupied by the Knowle DGE (DGE standing for Discovery, Guidance and Enjoyment) Special School. In the 1920s, the area was still rural in nature, mostly agricultural and allotment land, including Filwood Farm, Inns Court Farm and Hengrove House. The old field boundaries influenced the subsequent development.

Knowle West was built in the 1930s as a <a href="council%20house">council housing</a> estate. It was constructed on <a href="Garden%20city%20movement">garden city</a> principles, with large gardens and "an abundance of fresh air and daylight." The aim of the development was to provide new homes for those who needed to be relocated as a result of clearance of inner-city slums in Bristol and "to provide healthier living conditions for large families on low incomes.

A new wave of development commenced in the 1960s at Inns Court, occasioned by the need for more homes following the further clearance of inner city areas which had been devastated by the <a href="Bristol%20Blitz">Bristol Blitz</a>. <a href="Prefabricated%20home">Prefabricated home</a>s, which had been erected since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> at Filwood Park were demolished in the 1960s. Subsequently, new homes were built on the <a href="Radburn%20principle">Radburn principle</a>s. "Common features were grouped houses arranged around a cul-de sac street layout thus the street layout broke away from the conventional street grid pattern", but this style of development is now considered to be a failure, due to the lack of "a safe and well-overlooked environment." The layout of housing built around short <a href="cul-de-sac">cul-de-sac</a>s "has resulted in a physical environment that contributes to isolation rather than facilitating community interaction", according to a 2009 city council report on the area. By 2008, around 45 per cent of the 4,475 homes were owner occupied. Plans were announced in 2010 for demolition of 1,000 homes in Inns Court. Local residents were opposed to this, and following their campaign, the council withdrew the plans and met with residents to discuss plans for redeveloping Filwood Broadway with new shops and a supermarket.

Modern Knowle West has an area of approximately , located on a plateau about above sea level, south of the centre of Bristol, between the districts of Knowle on the east, Whitchurch Park and Hengrove to the south, Hartcliffe and Bishopsworth to the west and Bedminster and Windmill Hill to the north. There is steeply sloping land to the north and west, which together with Pigeonhouse Brook, a tributary of the <a href="River%20Malago">River Malago</a>, creates a natural barrier to adjacent areas. The underlying bedrock is of the <a href="Lias%20Group">Lias Group</a>, a mixture of mudstones, marine limestones, sandstones and clays. The Bedminster Great coal seam lies some below the area, but it is considered unlikely that coal was mined underneath Knowle West.

The local council <a href="Filwood%20%28ward%29">Filwood</a> ward is roughly coterminous with Knowle West, but two small areas of the estate lie in the neighbouring Knowle ward. Definitions of the area of Knowle West vary, with some residents in the eastern fringes preferring to identify with Knowle.

The boxer <a href="Dixie%20Brown">Dixie Brown</a> lived in Knowle West from the 1930s until the 1950s and was a regular at the Venture Inn, a <a href="public%20house">public house</a> in Melvin Square. He was frequently visited by black American troops during World War II. 

<a href="The%20Eagles%20%28UK%20band%29">The Eagles</a> were a rock and roll band who formed in the late 1950s at the Eagle House youth club and featured in the 1962 film "<a href="Some%20People%20%28film%29">Some People</a>".

The musician <a href="Tricky%20%28musician%29">Tricky</a> was a member of <a href="The%20Wild%20Bunch%20%28sound%20system%29">the Wild Bunch</a> sound system and a contributor to <a href="Massive%20Attack">Massive Attack</a>'s first two albums. Born in 1968, Tricky grew up in Knowle West in the 1970s and 1980s and was educated at Merrywood School. He named his 2008 album "<a href="Knowle%20West%20Boy">Knowle West Boy</a>", in tribute to the area's influence on him and his music.

There are three primary schools in Knowle West; Greenfield Primary School, Oasis Academy Connaught, and the School of Christ the King. In addition there is Knowle DGE Special School (formerly the Florence Brown Community Special School), which serves pupils of all ages who have learning difficulties or social and emotional behaviour difficulties. There is also a nursery, Knowle West Children's Centre.· Secondary school students are educated in adjacent areas, following the closure of Merrywood School in 2000, after a critical report by <a href="Ofsted">Ofsted</a> in 1997. The nearest secondary schools are <a href="Oasis%20Academy%20John%20Williams">Oasis Academy John Williams</a> in <a href="Hengrove">Hengrove</a>, St Bernadette Catholic Secondary School in <a href="Brislington">Brislington</a>, Bridge Learning Campus in <a href="Hartcliffe">Hartcliffe</a> and <a href="Bedminster%20Down%20Secondary%20School">Bedminster Down Secondary School</a>. Ongoing adult education is provided at the Park Centre and nearby Bedminster and Marksbury Road libraries.

There is a <a href="National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29">National Health Service</a> walk-in centre for treating minor injuries on the Knowle West Health Park site. Doctors may be consulted at the adjacent GP walk-in centre and there are <a href="general%20practitioner">general practitioner</a> (GP) led health centres nearby in Knowle, Bedminster and Hartcliffe. Dentistry is provided at practices in <a href="Bishopsworth">Bishopsworth</a>, <a href="Knowle%2C%20Bristol">Knowle</a> and <a href="Bedminster%2C%20Bristol">Bedminster</a>. The nearest hospital is <a href="Bristol%20Royal%20Infirmary">Bristol Royal Infirmary</a> in Bristol city centre. <a href="South%20Bristol%20Community%20Hospital">South Bristol Community Hospital</a> in nearby <a href="Hengrove">Hengrove</a> opened in March 2012.

There are a number of community activities, including a community website, knowlewest.co.uk, showing the latest events and news in the area. A community newsletter called "The Knowledge" is produced by Community In Partnership (CIP), facilitated by the Knowle West Media Centre. The Knowle West Future planning forum was established in 2013 to work on a regeneration plan, based on the positive attributes of the estate.

The Knowle West Media Centre won a <a href="Queen%27s%20Award%20for%20Services%20in%20the%20Community">Queen's Award for Services in the Community</a> in 2006 and the Knowle West Health Association won a <a href="Queen%27s%20Award%20for%20Voluntary%20Service">Queen's Award for Voluntary Service</a> in 2010.

Community enterprises include Re:work, who run construction, gardening, and furniture renovation projects, including their store on Filwood Broadway. They work with volunteers and support young people in skills development. Knowle West Health Park includes a GP service, a healthy living centre (which includes a studio with activities such as keep fit and dance activities), children's park, outdoor sports facilities, and a one-mile walk. Nearby nature walks include the Northern Slopes, including Novers Common, Glyn Vale/Kingswear and Wedmore Vale.

Local amenities include The Park Opportunity Centre, which offers a number of courses and programmes. The area has local shopping facilities, cafés and community centres and youth clubs such as Filwood Community Centre, Eagle House, Broadplain House, Novers Park,The Mede and KWMC (Knowle West Media Centre).

Knowle West is served by four council supported bus services, which connect the area to Totterdown, Broadmead, Hotwells, Bedminster and Brislington. In addition <a href="First%20West%20of%20England">First West of England</a> run two services, which connect with Withywood, the city centre and Hengrove. The nearest railway station is at <a href="Parson%20Street%20railway%20station">Parson Street</a> in Bedminster.

Journey times from Knowle West to the city centre have been identified as hampering employment opportunities for residents and proposals for a Greater Bristol Bus Network and a rapid transit scheme have noted the need to provide better connectivity for the area. A journey from Filwood Park to the city centre takes around 50 minutes and from Inns Court to Broadmead takes over 30 minutes. Proposed extensions to the <a href="A4174%20road%23Future%20plans">A4174 ring road</a>, which would pass along the southern part of Knowle West, have been claimed to reduce delays across the Greater Bristol area by 6%, and lead to a 9% increase in public transport use. The plans were approved by the <a href="Department%20for%20Transport">Department for Transport</a> in December 2011.

The population estimate for Filwood ward, as of 2008, was 11,787. There were 3,007 under 15 years old and 1,651 were of pensionable age. 7,316 were Christian, 2,925 had no religion and there were small numbers of Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh residents. 96.2 per cent were described as white and 3.8 per cent as being of black minority ethnicity.

Even in 2011, the Filwood ward was still an area with a relatively small amount of ethnic minorities, with 85.8 per cent of the 12,267 residents being White British.

There are a number of small community enterprises in the area, but most of those in work need to drive to other parts of Bristol. The Bristol City Council "Baseline Briefing" notes that employment opportunities for those without a car are limited There is a retail park on the former Imperial Tobacco factory site in Hartcliffe, which has plans for further development. In addition, South Bristol Business Park was built on the former Filwood playing fields in the early 21st century. It was reported that 2,300 residents had local employment in 2008 and 3,264 were classed as economically inactive; that is to say they were not employed and not actively seeking employment. 71 per cent of jobs were in service industries. 213 residents were claiming unemployment benefits.

Six out of eight areas in Knowle West are ranked as being economically deprived. The closure of the <a href="Imperial%20Tobacco">Imperial Tobacco</a> factory at nearby <a href="Hartcliffe">Hartcliffe</a> in 1990 meant the loss of 5,000 jobs and an estimated further 20,000 jobs in service and supporting industries throughout South Bristol. A <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> report noted that this had a seriously negative effect on the area as many people in Knowle West and neighbouring areas lost the opportunity for "manual and semi-skilled employment". "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" in 1995 noted high drug use and associated crime and reported on the establishment of Knowle West Against Drugs, led by local parents concerned about these problems. In 2006, "<a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a>" said "Knowle West has more than its share of social problems. The highest number of kids in care of any council ward in Bristol. The lowest number of young people with any qualifications (under half). A major petty crime problem, drug addiction, and add to that people are fed up with bad housing." "Shawnie", a 2006 novel by social worker Ed Trewavas, written from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl living in Knowle West, documents some of the deprivation he encountered in his work. One of the novel's characters "describes Knowle West ... as a 'shit hole' populated by 'yokels, cider-heads, junkies, dole-scammers, slappers and failed wide boys, all interbreeding and nicking their cruddy possessions off of each other in some giant, dismal rota.'"

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" in 2007 reported "Fed up with the media's view of their community as a hub for drug use, crime and antisocial behaviour, the residents of one of Britain's most notorious housing estates decided to fight back." The article noted that projects such as Knowle West Media were having a positive impact, "Those kids coming out of the media centre aren't the criminals and layabouts everyone expects from Knowle West; they're film-makers, photographers and designers." According to police statistics the levels of crime and <a href="anti-social%20behaviour">anti-social behaviour</a> (ASB) in Knowle West are above average for England and Wales, with 241 crimes and ASB incidents reported in June 2011. A 2007 report for the <a href="Community%20Foundation%20Network">Community Foundation Network</a>, looking at the work of voluntary sector groups, found that three quarters of the <a href="super%20output%20areas">super output areas</a> in Filwood ward are amongst the 10% most deprived in England. The report also found a strong sense of community within the area with "a history of community activity".

Since 2015, the two Bristol City councillors for Filwood ward have been <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> members. The <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">MP</a> for the <a href="Bristol%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Bristol South constituency</a>, since 2015, is <a href="Karin%20Smyth">Karin Smyth</a>, of the Labour Party. Prior to that, the constituency was represented from 1987 by <a href="Dawn%20Primarolo">Dawn Primarolo</a>, now the Right Honourable the Baroness Primarolo. Filwood is represented in the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> by the six <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">MEPs</a> of the <a href="South%20West%20England%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">South West England constituency</a>.

Open spaces include Glyn Vale Open Space, part of the Northern Slopes; Filwood Playing Fields and Filwood Park; Airport Road Open Space; Inns Court Open Space, which all are proposed <a href="Site%20of%20Nature%20Conservation%20Interest">Sites of Nature Conservation Interest</a> (SNCI), with areas of grassland, scrub and broad-leaved woodland. There are also three children's playgrounds and a few small open spaces, mostly grassed areas between buildings or at road junctions. There are of natural open space and of what is described by the city council as "informal open space", such as wide road verges, roundabouts and playing fields, in Knowle West. The average number of bird species per garden is two and 41 per cent of residents reported frogs in gardens or allotments. Proposals for development of open spaces were made in 2009 by Bristol City Council and opposed by residents. On the Northern Slopes, tree species recorded include <a href="hazel">hazel</a>, <a href="blackthorn">blackthorn</a>, <a href="alder">alder</a>, and <a href="Crataegus">hawthorn</a>; bird life includes <a href="European%20robin">robin</a>s, <a href="Common%20blackbird">blackbird</a>s, <a href="Common%20chiffchaff">chiffchaff</a>s, <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>s, <a href="starling">starling</a>s, and <a href="Thrush%20%28bird%29">thrush</a>es; wildflowers include <a href="Primula%20veris">cowslips</a>, <a href="Primula%20veris">primroses</a>, <a href="Eupatorium%20cannabinum">agrinomy</a>, and <a href="knapweed">knapweed</a>; and mammals include rabbits and foxes as well as <a href="pipistrelle">pipistrelle</a> and <a href="noctule">noctule</a> bats.

Great Eastern Highway

Great Eastern Highway is a road that links the <a href="Western%20Australian">Western Australian</a> capital of <a href="Perth">Perth</a> with the city of <a href="Kalgoorlie">Kalgoorlie</a>. A key route for road vehicles accessing the eastern <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Wheatbelt</a> and the <a href="Goldfields-Esperance">Goldfields</a>, it is the western portion of the main road link between Perth and the <a href="eastern%20states%20of%20Australia">eastern states of Australia</a>. The highway forms the majority of <a href="List%20of%20road%20routes%20in%20Western%20Australia%2394">National Highway 94</a>, although the alignment through the Perth suburbs of Guildford and Midland, and the eastern section between <a href="Coolgardie%2C%20Western%20Australia">Coolgardie</a> and Kalgoorlie are not included. Various segments form parts of other <a href="List%20of%20road%20routes%20in%20Western%20Australia">road routes</a>, including <a href="Highway%201%20%28Western%20Australia%29">National Route 1</a>, Alternative National Route 94, and State Route 51.

There are numerous intersections in Perth with other highways and main roads, including <a href="Canning%20Highway">Canning</a>, <a href="Albany%20Highway">Albany</a>, <a href="Tonkin%20Highway">Tonkin</a> and <a href="Roe%20Highway">Roe Highway</a>s, and <a href="Graham%20Farmer%20Freeway">Graham Farmer Freeway</a>. There are also two rural highways that spur off Great Eastern Highway. <a href="Great%20Southern%20Highway">Great Southern Highway</a> begins near Perth's eastern metropolitan boundary, linking towns such as <a href="York%2C%20Western%20Australia">York</a>, <a href="Brookton%2C%20Western%20Australia">Brookton</a>, <a href="Narrogin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Narrogin</a>, and <a href="Katanning%2C%20Western%20Australia">Katanning</a>. Near the eastern end of the highway, Coolgardie is the starting point of <a href="Coolgardie%E2%80%93Esperance%20Highway">Coolgardie–Esperance Highway</a>, connecting to the interstate route <a href="Eyre%20Highway">Eyre Highway</a> at Norseman, as well as the coastal town of <a href="Esperance%2C%20Western%20Australia">Esperance</a>.

The highway was created in the 1930s from an existing system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields. Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the <a href="Swan%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Swan River</a> (modern-day <a href="Guildford%20Road">Guildford Road</a>), it was actually used for the road through Belmont, south of the river. This section was constructed in 1867 using <a href="convict%20labour">convict labour</a>, with the road base made from sections of tree trunks. Over the years the road has been upgraded, with the whole highway <a href="Chipseal">sealed</a> by 1953, segments reconstructed and widened, <a href="dual%20carriageway">dual carriageway</a>s created in Perth and Kalgoorlie, and <a href="Interchange%20%28road%29">grade separated interchanges</a> built at major intersections. <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Highway%20Bypass">Great Eastern Highway Bypass</a> in Perth's eastern suburbs opened in 1988, allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites, and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam. A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway's current ascent of the <a href="Darling%20Scarp">Darling Scarp</a> has been identified. The planned route is a <a href="controlled-access%20highway">controlled-access highway</a> along <a href="Toodyay%20Road">Toodyay Road</a> to <a href="Gidgegannup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Gidgegannup</a>, and then across to <a href="Wundowie%2C%20Western%20Australia">Wundowie</a> via a new alignment. Though planning began in the 1970s, , construction of this route has not been scheduled, and it is not considered a priority.

Great Eastern Highway commences at <a href="The%20Causeway">The Causeway</a>, a river crossing that connects to <a href="Perth%20%28suburb%29">Perth's central business district</a>. Travelling north-east through the city to <a href="Greenmount%20Hill">Greenmount Hill</a>, and following a steep climb, the highway heads east through Western Australia's <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Wheatbelt</a> to <a href="Kalgoorlie">Kalgoorlie</a>, in the state's <a href="Goldfields-Esperance">Goldfields</a>. Within Perth, the highway is a six-lane <a href="dual%20carriageway">dual carriageway</a> from The Causeway to <a href="Tonkin%20Highway">Tonkin Highway</a> near <a href="Perth%20Airport">Perth Airport</a>. It travels as a four lane single carriageway to <a href="Midland%2C%20Western%20Australia">Midland</a>, with the second carriageway reappearing after <a href="Roe%20Highway">Roe Highway</a>, and continuing all the way to <a href="The%20Lakes%2C%20Western%20Australia">The Lakes</a> at Perth's eastern fringe. The remainder of the highway is a two-lane single carriageway until Kalgoorlie, where a dual carriageway exists. The speed limit is from The Causeway to Midland, near the bottom of Greenmount Hill, and from Greenmount to <a href="Sawyers%20Valley%2C%20Western%20Australia">Sawyers Valley</a>. From the eastern edge of Perth it is generally , but with lower limits for sections near the towns the highway encounters en route to Kalgoorlie.
The highway runs mostly parallel to the <a href="Goldfields%20Water%20Supply%20Scheme">Mundaring to Kalgoorlie water pipeline</a>, which supplies the Goldfields with water from <a href="Mundaring%20Weir">Mundaring Weir</a> in the eastern part of Perth. The <a href="Golden%20Pipeline%20Heritage%20Trail">Golden Pipeline Heritage Trail</a> is a tourist drive alongside the pipeline, with large sections of the trail following Great Eastern Highway.
Various <a href="List%20of%20road%20routes%20in%20Western%20Australia">road routes</a> are allocated to sections of Great Eastern Highway, with some overlap between some of the routes. It is mostly signed as National Highway 94, except for the section between <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Highway%20Bypass">Great Eastern Highway Bypass</a> and Roe Highway, and the final from <a href="Coolgardie%2C%20Western%20Australia">Coolgardie</a> to Kalgoorlie. It is also signed as National Route 1 between The Causeway and Morrison Road in Midland, State Route 51 between Johnson Street in Guildford and Roe Highway, Tourist Drive 203 between Terrace Road in <a href="Guildford%2C%20Western%20Australia">Guildford</a> and Morrison Road, Midland, and Alternate National Route 94 east of Coolgardie.

Main Roads Western Australia <a href="Traffic%20count">monitors traffic volume</a> across the state's road network, including various locations along Great Eastern Highway. In 2008/09, the busiest section was east of the <a href="Graham%20Farmer%20Freeway">Graham Farmer Freeway</a> interchange, averaging 60,760 vehicles per weekday. The lowest volume was an average of 850 vehicles per day near Ryans Find Road, partway between <a href="Southern%20Cross%2C%20Western%20Australia">Southern Cross</a> and Coolgardie; however, this point also received the largest proportion of heavy vehicles, at 40.2% of all traffic. , Great Eastern Highway between <a href="Mundaring%2C%20Western%20Australia">Mundaring</a> and <a href="Northam%2C%20Western%20Australia">Northam</a> is the state's worst section of <a href="National%20Highway%20%28Australia%29">National Highway</a>, in terms of road safety. Casualty crash rates had decreased since 2007, although the <a href="Royal%20Automobile%20Club%20of%20Western%20Australia">Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia</a> (RAC) still considered it a risky section of road needing close attention from road authorities. In 2013, Great Eastern Highway remained as a road of particular concern, with the Australian Automobile Association giving 67% of the highway a low one- or two-star rating (out of five), and 77% of the route between The Lakes and Northam a one-star safety rating.

Great Eastern Highway begins at a <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">grade separated interchange</a> between the south-eastern end of The Causeway, north-eastern end of <a href="Canning%20Highway">Canning Highway</a>, and north-western ends of Shepperton Road and <a href="Albany%20Highway">Albany Highway</a>. It proceeds in a north-easterly direction between local parks for , south of the <a href="Crown%20Perth">Crown Perth</a> entertainment complex in . After passing under the <a href="Armadale/Thornlie%20railway%20line">Armadale/Thornlie railway line</a>, there is a <a href="diamond%20interchange">diamond interchange</a> with Graham Farmer Freeway to the north-west and <a href="Orrong%20Road">Orrong Road</a> to the south-east, with an additional south-westbound to north-westbound looped ramp. The highway continues north-east, parallel to the <a href="Swan%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Swan River</a>, through the residential and commercial areas of <a href="Rivervale%2C%20Western%20Australia">Rivervale</a>, , , and . There are many at-grade intersections and driveway access crossovers in these high density suburbs. Major intersections are controlled by traffic lights, while many others are <a href="left-in/left-out">left-in/left-out</a>. After , Great Eastern Highway interchanges with Tonkin Highway, which connects to Perth's north-eastern and south-eastern suburbs, and <a href="Brearley%20Avenue">Brearley Avenue</a>, which provides access to Perth Airport's domestic terminals.
The road travels for another along the border between Ascot and Redcliffe, before reaching a traffic light controlled <a href="fork%20%28intersection%29">fork</a> with Great Eastern Highway Bypass. The main traffic flow continues east on the bypass to Roe Highway, while the Great Eastern Highway runs north-east through for , separating a narrow residential area along the Swan River from industrial development in the rest of the suburb. The highway crosses the <a href="Helena%20River">Helena River</a> via a two-lane bridge, and continues north into the historic townsite of Guildford, named as Johnson Street. After , Johnson Street terminates at a T junction, just south of the <a href="Midland%20railway%20line">Midland railway line</a>. The highway turns east onto James Street, which after has a sharp 90 degree turn to the north, continuing as East Street for . Following a level crossing of the railway, and an adjacent set of traffic lights at Terrace Road, the name Great Eastern Highway is resumed.

The highway continues north-east for to Midland. Throughout Midland and the adjacent suburb of , it is at the centre of a <a href="commercial%20area">commercial area</a>, with two shopping centres located alongside the highway, and retail businesses fronting both sides of the road. As Great Eastern Highway enters Midland, traffic splits into a pair of one-way roads. Eastbound traffic continues on Great Eastern Highway, while westbound traffic travels along Victoria Street. The split ends after , and a further takes the highway to an interchange with Roe Highway, meeting up with traffic that bypassed the Guildford and Midland areas.

Great Eastern Highway is notorious for Greenmount Hill, where the highway encounters a steep slope with a 7% <a href="Grade%20%28slope%29">gradient</a> on Perth's eastern outskirts. The highway rises from the <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a> to the <a href="Darling%20Scarp">Darling Scarp</a> to the north of Greenmount Hill, though it is commonly described as travelling "up Greenmount". The historic hill, with significant Aboriginal and European heritage sites, has been a well-known landmark since the 1830s, and featured on an 1846 survey of the <a href="York%20Road%2C%20Western%20Australia">York Road</a>. Part of this original eastern route remains as a separate road, now known as Old York Road. The highway diverges from this original route at a point east of Roe Highway, bypassing residential properties that line the old road. The two routes meet again at the top of the main climb of the hill, after .

From the sudden rise of Greenmount Hill through to Sawyers Valley, Great Eastern Highway has a series of rising and falling sections over rolling terrain. Along the way, the route follows the southern edge of <a href="John%20Forrest%20National%20Park">John Forrest National Park</a> for , passing to the north of the suburb of . Beyond the national park, the highway continues to be lined by native trees and patches of remaining forest. It continues east for between the low-density, rural residential areas of <a href="Hovea%2C%20Western%20Australia">Hovea</a>, <a href="Mahogany%20Creek%2C%20Western%20Australia">Mahogany Creek</a>, and <a href="Parkerville%2C%20Western%20Australia">Parkerville</a>, before entering the Mundaring town centre. Continuing its journey east, the route leaves Mundaring and travels briefly through the north-eastern corner of <a href="Beelu%20National%20Park">Beelu National Park</a> before coming to the rural community of Sawyers Valley, east of Mundaring.

Beyond Sawyers Valley, Great Eastern Highway travels in a north-easterly direction, alongside and later within the northernmost part of the <a href="Jarrahdale%20State%20Forest">Jarrahdale State Forest</a>. After , the highway reaches the Old Northam Road turnoff, which offers an alternative route through . The highway route bypasses the development by continuing east for to The Lakes, where it curves around to the north to meet <a href="Great%20Southern%20Highway">Great Southern Highway</a>, at the edge of the <a href="Perth%20Metropolitan%20Region">Perth Metropolitan Region</a>.

Great Eastern Highway continues past The Lakes in a northerly direction, reduced to a single carriageway with one lane in each direction. later, the highway encounters the north-eastern end of Old Northam Road, and subsequently winds its way through a <a href="reverse%20curve">reverse curve</a>. It travels in between <a href="Acacia%20Prison">Acacia Prison</a> and <a href="Wooroloo%20Prison%20Farm">Wooroloo Prison Farm</a> and then alongside <a href="Wooroloo%20Brook">Wooroloo Brook</a>, for , before crossing the waterway. The highway then heads in a north-easterly direction, passing to the south of , through , and reaching after . Another takes Great Eastern Highway to Mitchell Avenue, the turnoff for Northam, and part of the highway's former route through the town. The highway takes an curve around the northern edge of Northam, meeting up with the eastern section of the former alignment, known as Yilgarn Avenue. This section of highway, also known as the Northam Bypass, intersects three other roads at grade separated interchanges: <a href="Northam%E2%80%93Toodyay%20Road">Northam–Toodyay Road</a>, Irishtown Road, and <a href="Northam%E2%80%93Pithara%20Road">Northam–Pithara Road</a>. Each interchange consists of a flyover bridge for the highway, and a single two-way ramp that connects to each road at a T junction.
The highway heads east through the Wheatbelt as the region's main east-west route. The road passes by agricultural land and remnant <a href="native%20plant">native vegetation</a>, intermittently encountering small settlements and towns such as <a href="Meckering%2C%20Western%20Australia">Meckering</a>, <a href="Cunderdin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Cunderdin</a>, <a href="Kellerberrin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kellerberrin</a>, and <a href="Merredin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Merredin</a>. Great Eastern Highway enters Southern Cross out from Northam, near the edge of the Wheatbelt. The landscape changes to low shrubland, with few signs of human activity other than the highway itself, and the mostly parallel water pipeline and power line. The road continues eastwards in this fashion over a vast distance of before reaching the town of Coolgardie. beyond the townsite, traffic bound for <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> turns south onto <a href="Coolgardie%E2%80%93Esperance%20Highway">Coolgardie–Esperance Highway</a>, following the National Highway 94 route. Great Eastern Highway, now signposted as <a href="List%20of%20road%20routes%20in%20Western%20Australia%23A94">Alternate National Route 94</a>, turns north-east, travelling through another of scrubland to the outskirts of Kalgoorlie. The road continues its journey eastward within the grid of Kalgoorlie's road system, initially passing by the industrial district of West Kalgoorlie. After , the highway once more becomes a dual carriageway, and travels past residential neighbourhoods. Following , the highway takes on the name <a href="Hannan%20Street%2C%20Kalgoorlie">Hannan Street</a>, and continues for through to downtown Kalgoorlie, terminating at <a href="Goldfields%20Highway">Goldfields Highway</a> on Kalgoorlie's eastern edge. Alternate Route 94 turns south, back towards the National Highway route.

A road along what is now Great Eastern Highway has existed since the <a href="convict%20era%20of%20Western%20Australia">convict era of Western Australia</a>. The original road is thought to have been constructed in 1867, using <a href="convict%20labour">convict labour</a>, with a road base made of <a href="jarrah">jarrah</a> tree trunks cut into disc shapes. The use of wooden discs as a road base had been proposed by Western Australian Governor <a href="John%20Hampton">John Hampton</a>, leading them to be known as "Hampton's Cheeses". The discs were approximately thick and as large as in diameter, and the gaps between pieces would have been filled with soil or lime. The same type of road is known to have existed along <a href="Stirling%20Highway">Stirling Highway</a>, <a href="Guildford%20Road">Guildford Road</a>, Albany Highway and <a href="Wanneroo%20Road">Wanneroo Road</a> in the 1860s, and would have prevented horses and carts from getting bogged in wet weather. Evidence of this original road was found in Belmont in 1948 when widening works uncovered jarrah discs. During upgrade works in 2012, more discs were discovered beneath the existing asphalt, over a stretch.

The name Great Eastern Highway was coined by the <a href="Perth%20Road%20Board">Perth Road Board</a> in December 1933. It was suggested for the Perth to Guildford road on the north side of the Swan River (now known as Guildford Road), as an alternative to the <a href="Bassendean%20Road%20Board">Bassendean Road Board</a>'s proposal, Perth Road. In February 1934, the Bassendean Road Board agreed to the name, as Perth Road would be too general, and the road was considered the main artery serving eastern districts, all the way through to Kalgoorlie. Other local governments in the area considered the issue over the next few months. The <a href="Bayswater%20Road%20Board">Bayswater Road Board</a> and <a href="Greenmount%20Road%20Board">Greenmount Road Board</a> were in favour of the idea, but <a href="Guildford%20Road%20Board">Guildford Road Board</a> was opposed, as several local road names would be lost. Greenmount, and public advertising, thereafter referred to the road as Great Eastern Highway, and the council wrote to the <a href="Main%20Roads%20Western%20Australia">Main Roads Department</a>, requesting the name change be <a href="gazette">gazette</a>d. This prompted Main Roads to write to other local governments, advising of the request and soliciting their views. The <a href="Mundaring%20Road%20Board">Mundaring Road Board</a> and <a href="Kellerberrin%20Road%20Board">Kellerberrin Road Board</a> were supportive, while the <a href="Kalgoorlie%20Road%20Board">Kalgoorlie Road Board</a> suggested Great Eastern Goldfields Highway. The <a href="Kalgoorlie%20Municipal%20Council">Kalgoorlie Municipal Council</a> agreed that the road should be known as a highway, but thought the name was inadequate for a road that only connected Midland Junction with Coolgardie. The <a href="Midland%20Junction%20Municipal%20Council">Midland Junction Municipal Council</a> opposed the renaming, citing "sentimental and practical reasons for the continuance of the use of the old name".

In August 1934, the Bassendean Road Board applied to the Lands Department to change the portion of the Perth–Guildford road within its district to Great Eastern Highway. The department refused the request, reasoning that most traffic bound for Midland used The Causeway and travelled on the south side of the Swan River, and that therefore the Perth–Guildford road should not be part of the main highway. Despite this setback, the Perth Road Board organised a local government conference to consider renaming the road from Perth to Guildford. The issue was considered important, as losing the name to the south side of the river would divert traffic away from the old established centres to the north. The straightening of dangerous bends and the replacement of an old bridge between Bassendean and Guildford were also to be considered. The conference, held on 7 September 1934, was attended by representatives of the Perth, Bayswater, Bassendean, and Guildford road boards, and the Midland Junction Council. Guildford and Midland Junction were still opposed to the renaming, but the others were supportive. Motions that passed included submitting a rename proposal to the state government, urging the government to construct a new bridge at Bassendean, and approaching the government to have the road declared a main road.

In November 1934, the state government Land Council contacted the local governments on the south side of the Swan River, asking them to rename the roads that make up the Causeway–Midland route as Great Eastern Highway. Both the <a href="Perth%20City%20Council">Perth City Council</a> and <a href="Belmont%20Park%20Road%20Board">Belmont Park Road Board</a> agreed to the request. This created a "peculiar situation", as described by the RAC, with roads both north and south of the Swan River proposed to be renamed as Great Eastern Highway. Despite the name change not being official, some residents along the road through Belmont started describing their properties as located on Great Eastern Highway.

Another conference of the local governments north of the river was held in December 1934. They decided to continue to pursue renaming the Perth–Guildford road to Great Eastern Highway, and having it gazetted as a main road. A letter from the Commissioner of Main Roads had stated that the road through Belmont was considered the principal highway to the eastern states. He therefore recommended that if the name Great Eastern Highway were to be applied west of Midland Junction, it should be to that road, as the road through Bassendean was not considered a main road. Traffic counts collected by the Bassendean Road Board, however, showed that the north of river route, through Bassendean, carried more traffic in both directions than the southern route, through Belmont – 54% compared to 46%. The northern route was also shorter by about , and considered by the local governments to be the "natural entrance to the city", only crossing the Swan River once and not again at the Causeway.

On 8 January 1935, representatives from the local governments north of the river urged Minister for Lands, <a href="Michael%20Troy%20%28politician%29">Michael Troy</a>, to rename the Perth–Guildford road through those areas as Great Eastern Highway. Despite the route being shorter and carrying more traffic, he refused. He said that it was not gazetted as main road, and a previous decision to rename the road through Belmont as Great Eastern Highway was made after considering the facts, and at the request of the Main Roads Board. There was resentment and an objection over the name being "pinched" from the Perth Road Board. The minister disregarded the objection. He advised the representatives to see the Minister for Works to get the road declared a main road, and then approach him with a new name. This resolved Great Eastern Highway's route, with the local governments north of the river pursuing other names such as Main Highway.
On 14 April 1938, the name Great Eastern Highway was gazetted, in accordance with section 10 of the Land Act, 1933–1937. It replaced the names previously used along the route: Ascot Road, Guildford Road, York Road, Guildford–Northam Road, Toodyay–Northam Road, Mitchell Avenue, Throsell Road, Sermon Road, Dreyer Road, Goldfields Road, Kalgoorlie Road, Woodward Street, and Coolgardie Road.

By 1950, the highway had been <a href="Chipseal">sealed</a> from Perth to Southern Cross, and from a few miles west of Coolgardie to Kalgoorlie. Traffic in the Goldfields was light, with an average daily traffic of 44 vehicles between Southern Cross and Coolgardie, and 33 from Coolgardie to Kalgoorlie. The road was completely sealed by 1953. Between 1954 and 1956, sections of the highway between Perth and Southern Cross were improved. The works included increasing the seal width along of the road, reconstructing of road, and resealing . Precast concrete structures were used to replace two old, narrow wooden bridges.

In the 1950s, <a href="roundabout">roundabout</a>s were constructed at each end of The Causeway, to improve the flow of traffic on the bridges and the distribution of traffic back into the road network. The roundabout at the eastern end, connecting with Great Eastern Highway, opened in 1952. In 1973 construction began on upgrading that intersection to a grade-separated <a href="partial%20cloverleaf%20interchange">partial cloverleaf interchange</a>. The interchange opened on 8 March 1974, having cost <a href="Australian%20dollar">AUS$</a>1.3 million.
A major accident occurred at the intersection with Roe Highway on 30 December 1993. A truck lost control coming down Greenmount Hill and rolled over at the intersection, after crashing into six vehicles on the hill and another 14 at the intersection. One woman was killed, and another 12 people were injured, including four with serious injuries. It was Western Australia's worst accident that year, according to police, with the aftermath described by a witness as "like a battlefield". This accident led to the construction of a <a href="truck%20arrester%20bed">truck arrester bed</a> near the bottom of the hill. It has been used in emergencies several times since.

In 1994, the federal government approved a $43.9 million project to upgrade substandard sections of Great Eastern Highway between Northam and Southern Cross. That portion of the highway was one of the oldest sections of the National Highway in Western Australia. The road was susceptible to failure due to poor drainage and frequent flooding.
Further works in the 1990s saw a <a href="dual%20carriageway">second carriageway</a> constructed from Mundaring to Sawyers Valley, and then extended to The Lakes at the edge of Perth. A dual carriageway was also constructed in Kalgoorlie, and a long overtaking lane was built near Clackline.

More recent works have improved sections of the highway in Perth. Great Eastern Highway's intersection with Roe Highway was upgraded to a grade separated interchange. The design is a diamond interchange, with free-flowing traffic on Roe Highway, and an additional looped ramp for northbound to eastbound traffic movements. Construction of the $101.5 million project began in late 2010, and the interchange was officially opened to traffic on 9 June 2012.
Another project undertaken was the widening of the highway through the suburbs of Rivervale, Belmont and Redcliffe – between Kooyong Road, just north-east of the Graham Farmer Freeway interchange, and Tonkin Highway. Work commenced in June 2011, and was completed in February 2013, nine months earlier than scheduled. Prime Minister <a href="Julia%20Gillard">Julia Gillard</a> opened the upgraded highway on 28 March 2013, participating in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The $280 million upgrade included construction of a median strip, widening the road to three lanes in each direction, bus priority lanes at several traffic light controlled intersections, and bicycle lanes. The upgrade was expected to reduce congestion along the highway, which had been one of Perth's worst accident spots in 2011/12. However, the accidents were usually not serious, and roadworks were considered a "major contributing factor". In October 2013, the project was recognised with the Civil Contractors Federation National Earth Award for Excellence.

Great Eastern Highway Bypass, together with Roe Highway, provides a limited-access bypass of Guildford and Midland town sites. The bypass branches off the original highway alignment at South Guildford, proceeds around the northern edge of Perth Airport, and then heads east through . At the eastern end of Great Eastern Highway Bypass, traffic returns to the main highway by heading north on Roe Highway for .
Plans for a major highway along a similar alignment date back to <a href="Gordon%20Stephenson">Gordon Stephenson</a> and <a href="Alistair%20Hepburn">Alistair Hepburn</a>'s 1955 "Plan for the Metropolitan Region", which was the precursor of Perth's <a href="Metropolitan%20Region%20Scheme">Metropolitan Region Scheme</a>. The road was constructed in the late 1980s, and was known as the Redcliffe–Bushmead Highway during construction. Great Eastern Highway Bypass was opened on 14 May 1988, after 21 months of construction, and at a cost of $10 million.

Planning for a bypass around Northam began in the 1960s. The original route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns with the amount of traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the <a href="Avon%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Avon River</a>. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.

A bypass of Clackline was also constructed, realigning of Great Eastern Highway north of the town. Works began in January 2007, and were completed in February 2008. The project also involved constructing overtaking lanes between Clackline and Bakers Hill, upgrading intersections in Clackline, and constructing a pedestrian underpass for a heritage trail. Clackline Brook was realigned through a large box culvert, allowing a safer crossing than the narrow <a href="Clackline%20Bridge">Clackline Bridge</a> on the original alignment. The bypass was originally allocated $2.4 million of funding in 2006, but by January 2007 it was expected to cost almost $11 million. The final project value was $9.2 million. Issues and challenges in the project's design and construction included extensive rock protection requirements for the Clackline Brook culvert, drilling and blasting close to the existing highway, and protecting heritage and environmentally sensitive areas. The Clackline community welcomed the bypass, but there were concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost. The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the <a href="Heritage%20Council%20of%20Western%20Australia">Heritage Council of Western Australia</a>'s Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008.

There are long-term plans to bypass Great Eastern Highway's current ascent of the Darling Scarp. Planning for a new major road network in Perth's eastern corridor began in the 1970s. Early planning efforts between 1978 and 1981 for a new highway reservation from Mundaring to Wooroloo encountered community opposition, and the <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Authority%20of%20Western%20Australia">Environmental Protection Authority</a> (EPA) requested a more detailed environmental assessment. In 1985, a study into the primary east-west traffic routes in the area was commissioned by the Main Roads Department, Metropolitan Region Planning Authority, <a href="Shire%20of%20Mundaring">Shire of Mundaring</a>, and <a href="Shire%20of%20Swan">Shire of Swan</a>. It recommended a new alignment, known as the "Orange Route", be selected for the Perth to Adelaide National Highway. Alternative routes were identified using other colours as codenames. The new national highway would travel north-east along <a href="Toodyay%20Road">Toodyay Road</a> from Roe Highway to beyond , and then deviate east via the proposed Orange Route to meet Great Eastern Highway near Wundowie. The ultimate design of the highway included grade-separated interchanges for all of the roads that it intersects. The Orange Route received environmental approval on 22 November 1989. Detailed planning for the Clackline to Wooroloo section of the Orange Route was to begin in 1998. , construction of the Orange Route is not a priority for Main Roads. The project was not in the forward works program, there was no indication of the expected starting date, and a <a href="cost%E2%80%93benefit%20analysis">cost–benefit analysis</a> had not been performed recently. Plans are still in development, but the federal government is responsible for financing the project.

You Only Move Twice

"You Only Move Twice" is the second episode of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki> <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%208%29">eighth season</a>. It first aired on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox network</a> in the United States on November 3, 1996. The episode, based on a story idea by <a href="Greg%20Daniels">Greg Daniels</a>, has three major concepts: the family moves to a new town; Homer gets a friendly, sympathetic boss; and that boss, unbeknownst to Homer, is a <a href="supervillain">supervillain</a>. Bart, Lisa, and Marge each have individual secondary storylines. It was directed by <a href="Mike%20B.%20Anderson">Mike B. Anderson</a> and written by <a href="John%20Swartzwelder">John Swartzwelder</a>.

The episode title is a reference to the <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> film "<a href="You%20Only%20Live%20Twice%20%28film%29">You Only Live Twice</a>", and many elements of the episode parody the <a href="James%20Bond%20%28film%20series%29">Bond films</a>, with a character modeled after Bond making a brief appearance. Setting the second and third acts in a new town, Cypress Creek, required the animators to create entirely new layouts and background designs. <a href="Albert%20Brooks">Albert Brooks</a>, in his fourth appearance on "The Simpsons", guest stars as the voice of <a href="List%20of%20one-time%20characters%20from%20The%20Simpsons%23Season%208">Hank Scorpio</a>, who is one of the most popular one-time characters in the entire series. The episode was very well received by critics. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> named "You Only Move Twice" the best episode of the eighth season and Albert Brooks as one of the best guest stars in the history of the show.

On his way to work <a href="Waylon%20Smithers">Waylon Smithers</a> is offered a job at the Globex Corporation. When he refuses, the offer is passed down to <a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer</a>, the next-longest-employed individual at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He accepts the job and informs his family that the new job pays better and provides free health-care for the family, but involves moving to Cypress Creek. Homer tells Marge that by accepting a new higher paying job, he is one step closer to his dream of one day owning the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>. The Simpson family initially opposes the move, but after they watch a promotional video about the <a href="planned%20community">planned community</a>, they agree that it is much better than <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a>. After looking at the mortgage and deciding that <a href="Negative%20equity">selling the house won't cover it</a>, they abandon their house and leave town.

Shortly after the family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, who is very amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer a tour of the company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the employees in the nuclear division. Homer gets an instant liking to his new boss when Scorpio becomes the first person who does not ridicule Homer when he tells him about his dream of owning the Dallas Cowboys. Meanwhile, <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart</a> starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of <a href="Springfield%20Elementary%20School">Springfield Elementary</a>. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read <a href="Cursive">cursive writing</a>, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. <a href="Lisa%20Simpson">Lisa</a> goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. <a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge</a> tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.

Despite his success, Homer notices that his team members are starting to get overworked. He decides that the solution is to get them <a href="hammock">hammock</a>s and visits Scorpio to ask where he can purchase some. Scorpio begins to tell Homer of "the Hammock district", but he is interrupted by some urgent business. It turns out that Scorpio is a criminal mastermind formulating a plot to take over the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a> with a doomsday device, as he turns to a screen and threatens the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> by declaring that he has got hold of the doomsday device and that they have 72 hours to meet his demand of gold. To prove his intent, he blows up the <a href="Queensboro%20Bridge">59th Street Bridge</a>. Despite being in the same room, Homer appears oblivious to Scorpio's nefarious plan as he was looking outside the window.

Later, Scorpio has managed to capture a secret agent named Mr. Bont. Scorpio intends to have Bont killed with a laser, but Bont uses a coin to free himself from his restraints before attempting to flee. However, Homer, who is unaware of events, easily knocks him down, allowing Scorpio's soldiers to shoot the agent. A proud Scorpio happily thanks Homer for a job well done and tells him his house will get an extra floor. At dinner, Homer proudly tells of his successes at work, but discovers that his family hates Cypress Creek and want to go back to Springfield. At first, Homer is opposed to this, saying that he has been doing a great job for the first time in his life, but nobody else is happy. Dejected, Homer decides to visit Scorpio back at Globex Headquarters. His visit coincides with an assault by the <a href="U.S.%20military">U.S. military</a>, but Homer still remains oblivious to what is taking place. He finds Scorpio, explains the situation, and asks what to do. Scorpio initially tells Homer to abandon his family and continue working for him. After much debate he finally advises Homer that he should do what is best for his family.

The next day, the family returns to Springfield, as Scorpio succeeds in his plot and seizes control of the East Coast. Homer, who previously confided to Scorpio his dream of owning the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, expresses disappointment when he instead discovers the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> practicing ineptly on his front lawn as a present from his former boss. He reads a letter from Scorpio thanking him for his hard work and wishing that owning the Denver Broncos will eventually lead to Homer owning the Dallas Cowboys. Marge tells Homer that the Denver Broncos is a good football team while Homer sighs and tells Marge that she doesn't understand football at all.

The original concept for the episode came from a story idea by <a href="Greg%20Daniels">Greg Daniels</a>, and the writing staff came up with three major concepts. The first involves the Simpson family moving out of Springfield, which the writers initially hoped would fool the audience into thinking it was a permanent move. As a result, they tried to work in as many characters as they could during the first act of the episode to make it seem that the family really was leaving. The second involved Homer getting a new job for an employee-friendly boss in contrast to the tyrannical <a href="Mr.%20Burns">Mr. Burns</a>. The third was that Homer's new boss would be a supervillain resembling <a href="Ernst%20Stavro%20Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a>. This element was meant to be in the background and Homer would be ignorant to it.

The writers sought to give every family member their own story. The writing staff spent some time arguing over whether to include in the episode the depressing idea of Marge becoming an alcoholic. There was originally another involving <a href="Grampa%20Simpson">Grampa Simpson</a>, wherein he is left behind in Springfield and receives recorded greeting phone calls. The plot went on for four sequences, all of which were cut from the episode for time constraints but later included in the DVD release. Cypress Creek was called "Emerald Caverns" during most of production, but the name was changed because the writers felt that "Cypress Creek" had more of a "Silicon Valley" feel.

The show's writers did not worry too much about perfecting Scorpio's lines because they knew Brooks would rewrite or ad lib new ones. Entire parts of Scorpio's dialogue, such as his hammock speech, are Brooks's lines and not the writers'. <a href="Dan%20Castellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a> described how, after he prepared something for Homer to say in response to Brooks's new Scorpio lines, Brooks would deliver totally different lines in the next take. Josh Weinstein said Homer's reactions are exactly like someone talking to Albert Brooks. In all, his recordings amounted to over two hours in length. Brooks voiced the character Russ Cargill in "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Movie">The Simpsons Movie</a>" and for "about a week", he was to reprise the role of Scorpio, but the staff felt that creating a new character was a better idea.

The animators needed to design completely new sets for the episode. <a href="Christian%20Roman">Christian Roman</a>, John Reiss, and Mike Anderson storyboarded the episode. In the original <a href="storyboard%23Animatics">animatic</a>, <a href="Santa%27s%20Little%20Helper">Santa's Little Helper</a> and <a href="Snowball%20%28The%20Simpsons%29%23Snowball%20II">Snowball II</a> were not present, so the animators went back and added them, even though they are not a part of the story. It is a common misconception that Scorpio's design was modeled after <a href="Richard%20Branson">Richard Branson</a>, which it was not. The final design, which underwent an overhaul, was hailed by the writers as "the perfect madman". All of the students in Bart's remedial class were initially given hair modeled on <a href="Ralph%20Wiggum">Ralph Wiggum</a>'s, but the staff felt that the children looked "kinda troubled", so their designs were altered.

The man whom Homer tackles, Mr. Bont, was initially supposed to just be <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a>, but Fox, concerned about a lawsuit, would not let them use it. The writers went with "Bont" because they felt it was the most similar name that they could legally use.

The final scene at Globex contains several references to <a href="Action%20film">action</a> and "<a href="James%20Bond%20%28film%20series%29">James Bond</a>" films. The episode title and many references are from the Bond film "<a href="You%20Only%20Live%20Twice%20%28film%29">You Only Live Twice</a>", as well as an allusion to "<a href="A%20View%20to%20a%20Kill">A View to a Kill</a>". A character modeled after <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a>'s Bond is tackled by Homer and killed after a parody of the laser scene from "<a href="Goldfinger%20%28film%29">Goldfinger</a>". Miss Goodthighs from the 1967 James Bond parody "<a href="Casino%20Royale%20%281967%20film%29">Casino Royale</a>" makes an appearance in the episode and can be seen attacking a character modeled after <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> general <a href="Norman%20Schwarzkopf%2C%20Jr.">Norman Schwarzkopf</a>.

The sign at the elementary school displays "<nowiki>http://www.studynet.edu</nowiki>". Weinstein called it "one of the show's most obviously dated jokes" because the idea of a school having its own website was almost a novelty in 1996.

The song at the end of the show, written by <a href="Ken%20Keeler">Ken Keeler</a>, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler originally wrote it to be three seconds longer and sound more like the "Goldfinger" theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by <a href="Shirley%20Bassey">Shirley Bassey</a>, who sang several Bond themes, but they could not get her to record the part.

In its original broadcast, "You Only Move Twice" finished 50th in ratings for the week of October 28 – November 3, 1996, with a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 8.5, equivalent to approximately 8.2 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>".

Hank Scorpio is arguably the most popular <a href="Albert%20Brooks">Albert Brooks</a>-voiced character. In 2006, Albert Brooks was named the best "The Simpsons" guest star by <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, who cited Scorpio as his best role. "The Phoenix.com" compiled their own list, also placing Brooks in the first position. In his book "<a href="Planet%20Simpson">Planet Simpson</a>", author <a href="Chris%20Turner%20%28author%29">Chris Turner</a> says Brooks is second only to <a href="Phil%20Hartman">Phil Hartman</a> among "The Simpsons" guest stars and that "Brooks brings hilarious satirical seamlessness to Scorpio's paradoxical nature". He also writes that the delivery of Scorpio's final line seals Brooks's place in "The Simpsons" history. The Simpson family's new street address, 15201 Maple Systems Road, is writer <a href="Ken%20Keeler">Ken Keeler</a>'s favorite street name in the show.

IGN also named the episode the best of the eighth season, saying the episode "is a wonderful example of slowly building up the comedy it's impossible to fathom this one not being very high up on any list of the best "Simpsons" episodes of all time." Robert Canning gave the episode a "Masterful" score of ten out of ten, saying the episode "may well be the greatest "Simpsons" episode of all time". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide", called it "a tremendous episode" saying it had "some really good moments, most of them involving Bart, Lisa, and Marge's loathing for Cypress Creek. The remedial kids are fab (especially Warren) and Lisa's second chipmunk encounter is inspired. Scorpio is a good character, especially his <a href="Christopher%20Walken">Christopher Walken</a>-esque killing spree." They also stated that the owl grabbing the chipmunk during Lisa's trip to the forest is one of the all-time greatest sight gags in the show's history. Chris Turner also said that the remedial boy Gordy's line may be "the broadest parody of a Canadian accent in the history of American pop culture". <a href="Ben%20Rayner">Ben Rayner</a> of the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" included "You Only Move Twice" on his list of the best episodes of "The Simpsons". In his review of The Complete Eighth Season DVD set, Raul Burriel described it as one of the "most clever episodes the series has ever given us".

Disneyland Railroad

The Disneyland Railroad (DRR), formerly known as the Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad, is a 3-foot () <a href="narrow-gauge%20railway">narrow-gauge</a> <a href="heritage%20railway">heritage railroad</a> and attraction in the <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> theme park of the <a href="Disneyland%20Resort">Disneyland Resort</a> in <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim, California</a>, in the United States. Its route is long and encircles the majority of the park, with <a href="train%20station">train station</a>s in four different park areas. The rail line, which was constructed by <a href="Retlaw%20Enterprises">WED Enterprises</a>, operates with two steam locomotives built by WED and three historic steam locomotives originally built by <a href="Baldwin%20Locomotive%20Works">Baldwin Locomotive Works</a>. The ride takes roughly 18 minutes to complete a round trip on its <a href="main%20line%20%28railway%29">main line</a> when three trains are running, and 20 minutes when four trains are running. Two to four trains can be in operation at any time, three on average.

The attraction was conceived by <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>, who drew inspiration from the ridable miniature <a href="Carolwood%20Pacific%20Railroad">Carolwood Pacific Railroad</a> built in his backyard. The Disneyland Railroad opened to the public at Disneyland's grand opening on July 17, 1955. Since that time, multiple alterations have been made to its route, including the addition of two large <a href="diorama">diorama</a>s in the late 1950s and mid-1960s. Several changes have been made to its <a href="rolling%20stock">rolling stock</a>, including the conversion of one of its train cars into a <a href="parlor%20car">parlor car</a> in the mid-1970s, and the switch from <a href="diesel%20fuel">diesel oil</a> to <a href="biodiesel">biodiesel</a> to fuel its locomotives in the late 2000s.

The railroad has been consistently billed as one of Disneyland's top attractions, requiring a C ticket to ride when A, B, and C tickets were introduced in 1955, a D ticket to ride when those were introduced in 1956, and an <a href="E%20ticket">E ticket</a> to ride when those were introduced in 1959. The use of E tickets stood until a pay-one-price admission system was introduced in 1982. With an estimated 6.6 million passengers each year, the DRR has become one of the world's most popular steam-powered railroads.

<a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>, the creator of the concepts for Disneyland and the Disneyland Railroad, always had a strong <a href="railfan">fondness for trains</a>. As a young boy, he wanted to become a <a href="railroad%20engineer">train engineer</a> like his father's cousin, Mike Martin, who told him stories about his experiences driving main-line trains on the <a href="Atchison%2C%20Topeka%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway">Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway</a>. As a teenager, he obtained a <a href="newspaper%20hawker%23News%20butcher">news butcher</a> job on the <a href="Missouri%20Pacific%20Railroad">Missouri Pacific Railway</a>, selling various products to train passengers, including newspapers, candy, and cigars. Many years later, after co-founding <a href="the%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">the Walt Disney Company</a> with his older brother <a href="Roy%20O.%20Disney">Roy O. Disney</a>, he started playing <a href="polo">polo</a>. Fractured <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e and other injuries led him to abandon the sport on the advice of his doctor, who recommended a calmer recreational activity. Starting in late 1947, he developed an interest in <a href="rail%20transport%20modelling">model trains</a> after purchasing several <a href="Lionel%20Corporation">Lionel</a> train sets.

By 1948, Walt Disney's interest in model trains was evolving into an interest in larger, <a href="ridable%20miniature%20railway">ridable miniature trains</a> after observing the trains and <a href="backyard%20railroad">backyard railroad</a> layouts of several hobbyists, including Disney animator <a href="Ollie%20Johnston">Ollie Johnston</a>. In 1949, after purchasing of vacant land in the <a href="Holmby%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Holmby Hills</a> neighborhood of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, he started construction on a new residence for himself and his family, and on the elaborate gauge ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad behind it. The railroad featured a set of freight cars pulled by the "Lilly Belle", a 1:8-<a href="rail%20transport%20modelling%20scales">scale</a> <a href="live%20steam">live steam</a> locomotive named after Disney's wife <a href="Lillian%20Disney">Lillian</a> and built by the Walt Disney Studios' <a href="machine%20shop">machine shop</a> team led by <a href="Roger%20E.%20Broggie">Roger E. Broggie</a>. The locomotive's design, chosen by Walt Disney after seeing a smaller locomotive model with the same design at the home of rail historian <a href="Gerald%20M.%20Best">Gerald M. Best</a>, was based directly on copies of the <a href="blueprint">blueprint</a>s for the Central Pacific No. 173, a steam locomotive rebuilt by the <a href="Central%20Pacific%20Railroad">Central Pacific Railroad</a> in 1872. The "Lilly Belle" first ran on the Carolwood Pacific Railroad on May 7, 1950. Walt Disney's backyard railroad attracted visitors interested in riding his miniature steam train, and on weekends, when the railroad was operating, he allowed them to do so, even allowing some to become "guest engineers" and drive the train. In early 1953, after a visitor drove the "Lilly Belle" too fast along a curve, causing it to <a href="derailment">derail</a> and injure a five-year-old girl, Walt Disney, fearing the possibility of future accidents, closed down the Carolwood Pacific Railroad and placed the locomotive in storage.

Prior to the incident that closed his railroad, Walt Disney consulted with Roger Broggie about the concept of including his ridable miniature train in a potential tour of <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Studios%20%28Burbank%29">Walt Disney Studios</a> in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a>, north of Downtown Los Angeles. Broggie, believing that there would be limited visitor capacity for the attraction, recommended to Disney that he make the train bigger in scale. The idea of a studio tour was eventually replaced by the idea of an <a href="amusement%20park">amusement park</a> named "Disneyland" across the street from the studio, and in one of its first design concepts at that proposed location, a miniature steam train ride was included, as well as a larger, narrow-gauge steam railroad attraction. During this time, Disney proposed that the narrow-gauge Crystal Springs & Southwestern Railroad, which the nearby <a href="Travel%20Town%20Museum">Travel Town Museum</a> in <a href="Griffith%20Park">Griffith Park</a> planned to build, be extended to run through Disneyland. Planned construction of the <a href="Ventura%20Freeway">Ventura Freeway</a> across land between the two sites, and rejection by the Burbank City Council of a new amusement park in their city, led Disney to look for a different location to build the park and its narrow-gauge railroad.

By 1953, of orchard land in Anaheim in <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20California">Orange County</a>, southeast of Downtown Los Angeles, were chosen as the location for the planned Disneyland park, and on August 8, Walt Disney drew the triangular route for the future Disneyland Railroad (DRR) on the park's site plan. After financing for Disneyland was secured and all of the parcels of land at the Anaheim site were purchased, construction of the park and its railroad began in August 1954. In order to cut costs, a sponsorship deal was arranged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF), and when it was finalized on March 29, 1955, the DRR was officially named "Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad". The DRR was known by that name until September 30, 1974, when the AT&SF Railway's sponsorship ended.

Prior to the start of construction of the DRR, in the hope of saving money by buying already-existing trains for the attraction, Walt Disney tried to buy a set of gauge ridable miniature locomotives from <a href="William%20%26quot%3BBilly%26quot%3B%20Jones">William "Billy" Jones</a>, but after Jones declined his offer, Disney decided that he wanted the railroad's rolling stock to be bigger and made from scratch. For this task, Disney again turned to Roger Broggie, who was confident that he and the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop team could use the design for Disney's 1:8-scale miniature "Lilly Belle" locomotive and enlarge it to build the DRR's locomotives. The exact size of the rolling stock for the new railroad was determined after Disney saw a set of narrow-gauge <a href="Oahu%20Railway%20and%20Land%20Company">Oahu Railway and Land Company</a> passenger cars that had recently arrived at the Travel Town Museum, whose dimensions Disney found to be favorable. The scale of the design for the DRR's passenger cars, based on the narrow-gauge passenger cars at the Travel Town Museum, was <a href="real%20versus%20nominal%20value">nominally</a> 5:8-scale when compared to the size of rolling stock. The same scale was also chosen for the steam locomotives planned for the DRR, and when its locomotives and passenger cars were completed and paired with its narrow-gauge track, the railroad had nearly identical proportions to those of a conventional standard gauge railroad.

Through WED Enterprises, a legally separate entity from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney retained personal ownership of the DRR and financed the creation of two trains to run on it in time for Disneyland's opening day. The names of both trains contained the word "Retlaw", which is "Walter" spelled backwards. The first train, referred to by Disneyland employees as "Retlaw 1", would be pulled by the No. 2 locomotive, which was given a turn-of-the-20th century appearance with a straight <a href="chimney%20%28locomotive%29">smokestack</a> (typical of coal-burning locomotives), a circular <a href="headlamp">headlamp</a>, and a small <a href="pilot%20%28locomotive%29">cowcatcher</a>. The No. 2 locomotive would pull six 1890s-style passenger cars designed by <a href="Bob%20Gurr">Bob Gurr</a>, consisting of a <a href="combine%20car">combine car</a>, four coaches, and an <a href="observation%20car">observation coach</a>. The second train, referred to by Disneyland employees as "Retlaw 2", would be pulled by the No. 1 locomotive, which was given a late-19th century appearance with a <a href="spark%20arrestor">spark-arresting</a> diamond smokestack (typical of wood-burning locomotives), a rectangular headlamp, and a large cowcatcher. The No. 1 locomotive would pull six freight cars consisting of three cattle cars, two <a href="gondola%20%28rail%29">gondolas</a>, and a <a href="caboose">caboose</a>. Walt Disney Studios built the train cars and most of the parts for the locomotives; Dixon Boiler Works built the <a href="fire-tube%20boiler%23Locomotive%20boiler">locomotive boilers</a>, and Wilmington Iron Works built the <a href="locomotive%20frame">locomotive frame</a>s. Both locomotives were designed to run on diesel oil to generate steam. Final assembly of the locomotives and their <a href="tender%20%28rail%29">tenders</a> took place at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new <a href="motive%20power%20depot">roundhouse</a>, which was built in one week by a construction crew directed by Park Construction Administrator <a href="Joe%20Fowler">Joe Fowler</a>, a former <a href="United%20States%20Navy">US Navy</a> <a href="rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">rear admiral</a>. The two original DRR trains cost over $240,000 to build, with the two locomotives costing over $40,000 each.
Before the opening of Disneyland, a station in the Main Street, U.S.A. section and a station in the <a href="Frontierland%23Disneyland">Frontierland</a> section were built for the DRR. Main Street, U.S.A. Station, an example of <a href="Second%20Empire%20architecture%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada">Second Empire-style architecture</a>, was built at the entrance to Disneyland using an original design that incorporated <a href="forced%20perspective">forced perspective</a> elements on its upper levels to make it appear taller. Frontierland Station was built based on the design of the depot building located on the <a href="Grizzly%20Flats%20Railroad">Grizzly Flats Railroad</a>, a full-size narrow-gauge railroad owned by Disney animator Ward Kimball in his backyard. Besides the depot building, the DRR's functioning <a href="water%20tower">water tower</a> was also built at Frontierland Station.

Railroad-building expert Earl Vilmer created the track layout and operations for the DRR. Roger Broggie hired Vilmer because of his experience building railroads in Iran for the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> during World War II, in France after the war, and later in Venezuela for <a href="U.S.%20Steel">U.S. Steel</a>. Vilmer designed the operations of the DRR in such a way that each of its two trains would be assigned to a single station on the rail line, making only complete round trips possible. The "Retlaw 1" passenger train pulled by the No. 2 locomotive only serviced Main Street, U.S.A. Station while the "Retlaw 2" freight train pulled by the No. 1 locomotive only serviced Frontierland Station, and with <a href="siding%20%28rail%29">sidings</a> at both stations, each train would operate simultaneously and continue down the rail line even if the other train was stopped at its station. The first test run of the DRR's trains along the full length of its route occurred on July 10, 1955, one week before Disneyland's opening. The steam trains of the DRR were the first of Disneyland's attractions to become operational.

On July 17, 1955, Disneyland and the Disneyland Railroad opened, and the day began with Walt Disney driving the DRR's No. 2 locomotive and its passenger train into Main Street, U.S.A. Station with California Governor <a href="Goodwin%20J.%20Knight">Goodwin J. Knight</a> and AT&SF Railway President Fred G. Gurley riding in the locomotive's <a href="cab%20%28locomotive%29">cab</a>. They were greeted at the station's <a href="railway%20platform">platform</a> by the park opening ceremony's host <a href="Art%20Linkletter">Art Linkletter</a>, actor <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, and several television camera crews broadcasting the festivities nationwide. After exiting the locomotive, Linkletter briefly interviewed Disney, Knight, and Gurley before they walked towards the town square in the Main Street, U.S.A. section where Disney officially dedicated Disneyland. The DRR eventually became one of the most popular steam-powered railroads in the world with an estimated 6.6 million passengers each year.

Shortly after the Disneyland Railroad opened, A, B, and C tickets were introduced in Disneyland for admission to its rides, and C tickets, the highest-ranked tickets, were required to ride the DRR. These tickets were joined by the higher-ranked D ticket in 1956, and D tickets from that point forward were needed to gain access to the DRR.

One of the first additions to the DRR occurred in March 1956 when new covered shelters were built on each end of Frontierland Station's depot building. The shelters were added after the DRR's track on the western edge of its route, and the depot building standing next to it, were moved outwards.

Also during 1956, the Fantasyland Depot, a new station with a <a href="Medievalism">Medieval</a> theme and consisting of a covered platform with no station building, was created for the DRR in the <a href="Fantasyland%23Disneyland">Fantasyland</a> section. By the time this new station was added, the DRR's system of having one train assigned to a single station and using sidings to pass trains stopped at stations was abandoned and replaced by the current system where each train stops at every station along the railroad's route. Fantasyland Depot was removed by July 1966 when the "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Small%20World%23Disneyland">It's a Small World</a>" attraction, originally built for the <a href="1964%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair">1964 New York World's Fair</a>, was installed.

By 1957, the DRR was becoming overwhelmed by ever-increasing crowds; Disney determined that a third train was needed. Instead of having another locomotive built from scratch to pull the train, Disney believed that costs could be saved by purchasing and restoring an already-existing narrow-gauge steam locomotive, and the job of finding one was given to Roger Broggie. With the assistance of Gerald Best, a suitable locomotive was found in <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>; it had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894, had previously been used as a <a href="switcher">switcher</a> at a <a href="sugar%20cane%20mill">sugar cane mill</a> in Louisiana owned by the Godchaux Sugar Company, and was initially used by the Lafourche, Raceland & Longport Railway in Louisiana. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and having its <a href="firebox%20%28steam%20engine%29">firebox</a> reconfigured to burn diesel oil for fuel to generate steam. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 3 locomotive and it went into service on March 28, 1958, at a cost after restoration of more than $37,000. Joining the No. 3 locomotive when it went into service were five new open-air <a href="passenger%20car%20%28rail%29%23Narragansett-style%20excursion%20car">Narragansett-style excursion cars</a> with front-facing bench seating collectively referred to by Disneyland employees as the "Excursion Train", which was designed by Bob Gurr and built at Walt Disney Studios.

On March 31, 1958, the No. 3 locomotive participated in the inauguration ceremony for the DRR's <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> Diorama, which features a foreground with several lifelike animals and a background painted by artist <a href="Delmer%20J.%20Yoakum">Delmer J. Yoakum</a> on a single piece of seamless canvas measuring long by high. Located inside a tunnel on the DRR's route, the diorama was claimed by Disneyland to be the longest in the world, and during its inauguration it was blessed by Chief Nevangnewa, a 96-year-old <a href="Hopi">Hopi</a> chief. The diorama cost over $367,000 and took 80,000 labor hours to construct.

The addition of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the "Retlaw 2" freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped <a href="awning">awning</a>s on all of the cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought the total number of freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as "Holiday Red", to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand for the duration of the ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual <a href="stock%20car%20%28rail%29">cattle train</a>.

In 1958, a new station in the Tomorrowland section was built for the DRR. Tomorrowland Station, consisting of a covered platform with no station building, was constructed in April 1958 with a futuristic theme, which was updated in 1998 as part of a redevelopment of the Tomorrowland section.

Around the same time that the No. 3 locomotive was placed into service in 1958, Roger Broggie decided that a fourth locomotive was needed for the DRR. After Walt Disney concurred, Broggie once again began searching for a narrow-gauge steam locomotive to purchase and restore. Broggie eventually found an advertisement in a rail magazine offering a suitable locomotive for sale in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, and after contacting the seller, Broggie passed on the information to Gerald Best to research the locomotive. Best was able to determine that the locomotive had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925, that it had previously been used to pull tourist trains on the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Museum%20of%20Transportation">Pine Creek Railroad</a> in New Jersey, and that it had been initially used by the Raritan River Sand Company in New Jersey. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and adding a new tender built by Fleming Metal Fabricators designed to hold diesel oil. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 4 locomotive and it went into service on July 25, 1959, at a cost after restoration of more than $57,000. 1959 was also the year in which E tickets arrived, and the attractions deemed to be the best in the park required them, including the DRR.

To have sufficient space for the planned New Orleans Square section, the Disneyland Railroad's track on the western edge of its route was expanded outwards again in 1962, Frontierland Station's depot building in that same vicinity was moved across the DRR's track, and a covered platform with no station building was built on the opposite side to serve as the new Frontierland Station. Although the station was no longer in the Frontierland section, its name was not changed to "New Orleans Square Station" until September 1996.

By 1965, the six passenger cars of the DRR's "Retlaw 1" train, due to their slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the "Retlaw 1" passenger cars were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the "Grand Canyon" observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed "Lilly Belle" after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The "Lilly Belle" was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included <a href="varnish">varnish</a>ed <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> paneling, <a href="velour">velour</a> curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the "Lilly Belle" after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Japanese Emperor</a> <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a>, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled on the ends of the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other "Retlaw 1" passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former "Retlaw 1" passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in <a href="Santa%20Margarita%2C%20California">Santa Margarita, California</a>, leaving only the "Retlaw 1" combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the "Retlaw 1" combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.

In 1966, a five-gondola train set with green-and-white-striped awnings and a five-gondola train set with blue-and-white-striped awnings, referred to by Disneyland employees as "Holiday Green" and "Holiday Blue" respectively, were added to the DRR's rolling stock. Both train sets had side-facing bench seating like the "Holiday Red" freight train. By the time that the new "Holiday Green" and "Holiday Blue" trains sets were introduced in 1966, the DRR's original roundhouse, located on the end of a <a href="branch%20line">spur line</a> connected to the main line near the <a href="Rivers%20of%20America%20%28Disney%29%23Disneyland">Rivers of America</a> in the Frontierland section, had been replaced by a larger roundhouse, located on the end of a new spur line connected to the main line in the Tomorrowland section. The new roundhouse, where the DRR's locomotives and train cars are stored and maintained, was also built to house the storage and maintenance facility for the <a href="Disneyland%20Monorail">Disneyland Monorail</a>.

The DRR's Primeval World Diorama was put on display later in 1966, adjacent to the Grand Canyon Diorama. One year prior, the DRR's track on the eastern edge of its route had been expanded outwards to accommodate the diorama's construction. The <a href="Audio-Animatronics">Audio-Animatronic</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s from <a href="1964%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair%23Ford%20Motor%20Company%20Pavilion">Ford's Magic Skyway</a>, one of the attractions created by Disney for the 1964 New York World's Fair, were incorporated into the diorama, including a "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>" confronting a "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>". The diorama was one of the last additions made to the DRR, and Disneyland in general, before the death of Walt Disney on December 15, 1966.

From 1982, A, B, C, D, and E tickets were discontinued in favor of a pay-one-price admission system for Disneyland, allowing visitors to experience the park's attractions, including the DRR, as many times as desired. In June 1985, the new Videopolis Station, consisting of a covered platform with no station building, was built in the Fantasyland section for the DRR. That same year, the DRR's track on the northern edge of its route was expanded outwards in order to make room for the new <a href="Fantasyland%20Theatre">Videopolis</a> stage. With the Mickey's Toontown expansion of the park, Mickey's Toontown Depot, a cartoon-themed depot building, replaced Videopolis Station in 1993.

Out of a desire to have four trains regularly running at once each day on the DRR, in the mid-1990s the Disneyland park began to search for an additional narrow-gauge steam locomotive to add to the railroad's rolling stock. One such locomotive was acquired from Bill Norred in 1996 in exchange for the combine car and four coaches from the DRR's retired "Retlaw 1" passenger train set, but after the park received it, the new locomotive was deemed to be too large for the DRR's operations. It was then sent to the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World%20Railroad">Walt Disney World Railroad</a> in the <a href="Magic%20Kingdom">Magic Kingdom park</a> of <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Walt Disney World</a> in <a href="Bay%20Lake%2C%20Florida">Bay Lake, Florida</a>, where the locomotive was dedicated, despite being too small for the railroad's operations, and named after Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ward Kimball. Still needing a fifth locomotive for the DRR, the park traded the "Ward Kimball" locomotive in 1999 to the <a href="Cedar%20Point%20%26amp%3B%20Lake%20Erie%20Railroad">Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad</a> in the <a href="Cedar%20Point">Cedar Point</a> amusement park in <a href="Sandusky%2C%20Ohio">Sandusky, Ohio</a>, for a new locomotive suitable for the railroad. Named "Maud L.", the locomotive was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1902 and was originally used to haul <a href="sugarcane">sugar cane</a> at the <a href="Laurel%20Valley%20Sugar%20Plantation">Laurel Valley Sugar Plantation</a> in Louisiana owned by the Barker and Lepine Company. After arriving in Disneyland, the "Maud L.", later renamed "Ward Kimball" like the locomotive for which it was traded, was given a new cab built by Disney and a new boiler built by Hercules Power, which was subcontracted by Superior Boiler Works. Due to budget issues, the restoration of the locomotive was suspended not long after its arrival, and its parts were planned to be placed in long-term storage in late 2003. The "Ward Kimball" locomotive's restoration efforts were resurrected soon after, when it was decided that its addition to the DRR would be incorporated into the celebration of Disneyland's fiftieth anniversary in July 2005. In late 2004, Boschan Boiler and Restorations led by Paul Boschan, a former roundhouse manager and engineer at the <a href="Roaring%20Camp%20%26amp%3B%20Big%20Trees%20Narrow%20Gauge%20Railroad">Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad</a> in <a href="Felton%2C%20California">Felton, California</a>, was awarded the contract to complete the restoration of the "Ward Kimball". The restoration work performed included installing new <a href="driving%20wheel">driving wheel</a>s, attaching a new <a href="smokebox">smokebox</a> door, and applying <a href="gold%20leaf">gold-leaf</a> silhouettes of Kimball's <a href="Jiminy%20Cricket">Jiminy Cricket</a> character on the sides of the headlamp. The "Ward Kimball" locomotive, which entered service on June 25, 2005, became the DRR's No. 5 locomotive, and on February 15 the following year, John Kimball, the son of Ward Kimball, who died in 2002, christened the locomotive during its dedication ceremony.

A few weeks before the debut of the No. 5 locomotive, the railroad, for the first time in its history, hosted a privately owned train on its track. On the morning of May 10, before Disneyland opened for the day, a private ceremony was held at New Orleans Square Station to honor Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ollie Johnston, supposedly to thank him for helping to inspire Walt Disney's passion for trains, which led to the creation of Disneyland. The true motive for having Johnston there was soon revealed when a simple steam train not part of the DRR's rolling stock, consisting of a locomotive named "Marie E." and a caboose, rolled towards the station and stopped at its platform. Johnston, a previous owner of the steam train, used to run it on his vacation property, which he sold, along with the train, in 1993. The man who now owned the train was <a href="Pixar">Pixar</a> film director <a href="John%20Lasseter">John Lasseter</a>, who had brought the train to Disneyland in order to give Johnston, his mentor, an opportunity to reunite with and drive his former locomotive. Johnston, then in his nineties, was helped into the "Marie E.", and with Lasseter at his side, he grasped the locomotive's throttle and drove his former possession three times around the DRR's main line. Although Johnston died in 2008, Lasseter continues to run the "Marie E.", the caboose, and an assortment of train cars on his private <a href="Lasseter%20Family%20Winery%23Justi%20Creek%20Railway">Justi Creek Railway</a>.

The diesel oil used for fuel to generate steam in the DRR's locomotives was replaced in 2007 with B98 biodiesel, consisting of two percent diesel oil and ninety-eight percent <a href="soybean%20oil">soybean oil</a>. Due to problems with storing the soybean-based biodiesel, the DRR briefly switched back to conventional diesel oil in November 2008 before adopting new biodiesel incorporating recycled <a href="cooking%20oil">cooking oil</a> in January 2009.

On January 11, 2016, the DRR temporarily closed to accommodate the construction of .<ref name="/Film"></ref> The original DRR roundhouse building, which became a maintenance facility for ride vehicles of other Disneyland attractions, was demolished around April 2016. The DRR reopened on July 29, 2017, with a new route along the northern edge of the Rivers of America named "Columbia Gorge", which features rock formations, waterfalls, a <a href="trestle%20bridge">trestle bridge</a>, and the line's only left-hand turn. The DRR's dioramas were also given new special effects. During a media preview for the attraction's reopening the previous day, John Lasseter brought his "Marie E." locomotive and drove it along the DRR's new route. Pulled behind the "Marie E." were an inoperable locomotive and train car, which were both previously owned by Ward Kimball and run on his former Grizzly Flats Railroad. The inoperable locomotive, named "Chloe", and the train car are now owned by the <a href="Orange%20Empire%20Railway%20Museum">Orange Empire Railway Museum</a> in <a href="Perris%2C%20California">Perris, California</a>, which was in the process of restoring the "Chloe" to operating condition at the time of the DRR's media preview.

Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station adjacent to Disneyland's entrance, where a pump-style <a href="handcar">handcar</a> built by the <a href="Kalamazoo%20Manufacturing%20Company">Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company</a> can be seen on a siding, the trains of the Disneyland Railroad travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. The train will take around 18 minutes to complete a round trip on the main line when three trains are running, and 20 minutes when four trains are running; on any given day, between two and four trains run, with three trains running on average. An engineer accompanied by a <a href="fireman%20%28steam%20engine%29">fireman</a> operates the locomotive, while <a href="conductor%20%28rail%29">conductors</a> at each end of the train supervise the passengers. Prior to departing Main Street, U.S.A. Station, the engineer must confirm whether the signal light in the locomotive's cab is green, indicating that the track segment ahead is clear, or red, indicating that the track segment ahead is occupied by another train. The DRR's route is divided into eleven such segments, or blocks, and each locomotive has a <a href="automatic%20block%20signaling">block signal</a> in its cab to communicate the status of each block. Prior to the installation of <a href="cab%20signalling">cab signalling</a> in the locomotives around 2005, the status of each block along the railroad's of main-line track was displayed by track-side block signals, of which only the ones at the four stations remain.

Once the signal light in the locomotive turns green, the journey from the Main Street, U.S.A. section begins with the train traversing a small bridge, passing by the <a href="Adventureland%20%28Disney%29%23Disneyland">Adventureland</a> section, and going through a tunnel before arriving at New Orleans Square Station in the New Orleans Square section. While the train is stopped at this station, where the locomotive takes on water from the railroad's water tower if needed, a sound effect of a <a href="telegrapher">telegraph operator</a> using a <a href="telegraph%20key">telegraph key</a> to enter <a href="Morse%20code">Morse code</a> can be heard emanating from the old Frontierland Station depot building. The sound effect continuously repeats the first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 <a href="Disneyland%23Dedication">Disneyland dedication speech</a>. Adjacent to the old Frontierland Station depot building, a freight house building used as a train crew break and storage area can be seen, as well as a fully functioning historic <a href="railway%20semaphore%20signal">semaphore signal</a> connected to the station's block signal.

After the journey restarts, the train enters a tunnel through the <a href="Splash%20Mountain%23Disneyland">Splash Mountain</a> <a href="log%20flume%20%28ride%29">log flume</a> attraction and crosses a trestle bridge over the <a href="Critter%20Country%23Disneyland">Critter Country</a> section. It then moves over another trestle bridge that wraps around the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, and rolls through another tunnel before reaching Mickey's Toontown Depot between the Mickey's Toontown and Fantasyland sections. While the train is stopped at this station, a non-functioning water tower can be seen on the opposite side of the track to the station's depot building.

Once the journey resumes, the train moves across an <a href="overpass">overpass</a> and passes by the façade of the "It's a Small World" water-based <a href="dark%20ride">dark ride</a> attraction before reaching a fuel pump disguised as a boulder, where the train stops if the locomotive needs to be refueled. From this point, the train cuts across an access road and goes underneath the track of the Disneyland Monorail before stopping at Tomorrowland Station in the Tomorrowland section.

When the journey continues, the train goes across another access road and enters a tunnel containing the Grand Canyon Diorama followed by the Primeval World Diorama. As the train runs alongside the Grand Canyon Diorama, the main theme from "On the Trail", the third movement of <a href="Ferde%20Grof%C3%A9">Ferde Grofé's</a> "<a href="Grand%20Canyon%20Suite">Grand Canyon Suite</a>", can be heard; and as the train runs alongside the Primeval World Diorama, music from the 1961 film "<a href="Mysterious%20Island%20%281961%20film%29">Mysterious Island</a>" can be heard. Shortly after leaving the tunnel, the train arrives back at Main Street, U.S.A. Station, completing what the park refers to as "The Grand Circle Tour".

An option to ride on a seat in the tenders of the DRR's locomotives is available upon request at Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the start of each operating day. The option to ride in the DRR's "Lilly Belle" parlor car is also available upon request at Main Street, U.S.A. Station when a Disneyland employee is available to monitor the passengers aboard it and no heavy rain is falling. The DRR's roundhouse, which cannot normally be viewed by the public, is made available for viewing to participants of specific <a href="runDisney">runDisney</a> events where the race course organized for the runners goes past the facility.

The first four steam locomotives to enter service on the Disneyland Railroad are named after former AT&SF Railway presidents. The fifth is named after a former Disney animator. Walt Disney himself, after putting on an engineer's outfit, occasionally drove the DRR's locomotives when they were pulling trains with passengers on board. Each year, the DRR locomotive fleet consumes about of fuel. Since 2006, the locomotives of the DRR have been featured as static displays multiple times at Fullerton Railroad Days, an annual festival that takes place at the <a href="Fullerton%20Transportation%20Center">Fullerton Transportation Center</a> in <a href="Fullerton%2C%20California">Fullerton, California</a>.

The Disneyland Railroad today operates four sets of train cars, as well as a parlor car. The combine car from the railroad's former "Retlaw 1" passenger train, one of the DRR's two original train sets, was Walt Disney's favorite train car on the railroad, as it brought back memories from his youth working as a news butcher on the Missouri Pacific Railway.

Shojo Beat

Shojo Beat is a <a href="sh%C5%8Djo%20manga">"shōjo" manga</a> magazine formerly published in North America by <a href="Viz%20Media">Viz Media</a>. Launched in June 2005 as a sister magazine for "<a href="Shonen%20Jump%20%28magazine%29">Shonen Jump</a>", it featured serialized chapters from six manga series, as well as articles on Japanese culture, manga, <a href="anime">anime</a>, fashion and beauty. After its initial launch, "Shojo Beat" underwent two redesigns, becoming the first English anthology to use the <a href="cyan">cyan</a> and <a href="magenta">magenta</a> ink tones common to Japanese manga anthologies. Viz launched a related <a href="imprint%20%28trade%20name%29">imprint</a> of the same name for female-oriented manga, <a href="light%20novel">light novels</a> and anime.

Targeted at women ages 16–18, the first issue of "Shojo Beat" launched with a circulation of 20,000. By 2007, the average circulation was approximately 38,000 copies, with half coming from <a href="Subscription%20business%20model">subscriptions</a> rather than <a href="Retailing">store sales</a>. It was well received by critics, who praised its mix of manga series and the inclusion of articles on Japanese culture, though some critics found the early issues boring and poorly written. In May 2009, Viz announced that it was discontinuing the magazine; the July 2009 issue was the last released. Fans were disappointed at the sudden news. Industry experts felt its loss would leave female comic fans without a magazine of their own, but praised Viz for its choice to continue using the "Shojo Beat" imprint and branding for its "shōjo" manga and anime releases.

In February 2005, <a href="Viz%20Media">Viz Media</a> announced the creation of a new manga anthology, "Shojo Beat". Marketed as a sister publication of Viz's existing "<a href="Shonen%20Jump%20%28magazine%29">Shonen Jump</a>", the magazine started with six manga titles: "Crimson Hero", "Kaze Hikaru", "Baby & Me", "Godchild", "Nana", and "Absolute Boyfriend". Of the six titles, two each came from Japanese publishers <a href="Shueisha">Shueisha</a>, <a href="Shogakukan">Shogakukan</a>, and <a href="Hakusensha">Hakusensha</a>. The first issue, released in June 2005, featured <a href="Nana%20Komatsu%20%28Nana%29">Nana Komatsu</a> of "<a href="Nana%20%28manga%29">Nana</a>" on its July cover.

Yumi Hoashi was the publication's original <a href="editor-in-chief">editor-in-chief</a>. In November 2006, Hoashi left Viz, and Marc Weidenbaum replaced him as the magazine's editor-in-chief. Weidenbaum remained the magazine's editor until February 13, 2009, when Viz announced that he had left the company, though the magazine continued to list his name in the role through the May 2009 issue. Starting with the June 2009 issue, publisher Hyoe Narita was listed as the editor-in-chief.

The magazine's <a href="panda">panda</a> mascot, Moko, was first introduced in the October 2005 issue, though he remained nameless until the July 2006 issue. He later was given his own MySpace account run by Viz. With the July 2007 issue, a new mascot, Beat Girl, was introduced. Included in each issue on the "Editor's Letter" page as the magazine's "illustrated spokesperson," she was drawn by different artists each time. A third mascot, a star-shaped figure named Hoshiko, was introduced with the March 2008 issue as a friend for Moko.

With the magazine's first anniversary issue, dated July 2006, "Shojo Beat" switched to using <a href="cyan">cyan</a> and <a href="magenta">magenta</a> ink tones for the manga pages rather than black-and-white. Though this mirrors the format of Japanese manga anthologies, it was a first for manga anthologies published in North America. "Shojo Beat" launched another redesign with the January 2007 issue. The new design included more vivid color schemes and <a href="font">font</a>s and introduced a new "Girl Hero" column to spotlight women Viz felt were charitable and selfless and who would inspire readers. The existing columns were also expanded.

In May 2009, the magazine stopped accepting new subscriptions and ceased publication with the release of the July issue. Existing "Shojo Beat" subscriptions were transferred to Viz's "Shonen Jump" magazine. With the first copy of "Shonen Jump" sent to former subscribers, a letter informed them of the transfer and how to request a refund for the unfilled portion of their subscriptions if they would prefer. In a press release, Viz stated that the "difficult economic climate" was behind the magazine's cancellation.

As a manga anthology, the bulk of "Shojo Beat's" content was its manga chapters. Additional features included a letter from the editor, manga related news, a preview chapter from another Viz manga title being published under the "Shojo Beat" imprint, and articles on <a href="Japanese%20culture">Japanese culture</a>, current trends in Japan, and fashion and beauty. Sections toward the back of the magazine featured fan-related material, including <a href="fan%20art">fan art</a>, letters from readers, manga drawing lessons, and <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a> how-to guides and highlights. The magazine's official website included additional articles, downloads of templates for dressing up the magazine's panda mascot "Moko", and online previews of many of the manga series being published under the "Shojo Beat" label.

"Shojo Beat" contained chapters from six Japanese <a href="manga">manga</a> series licensed and translated to English by Viz. During its run, the magazine featured fourteen series, of which seven ended their runs and were replaced by other series. Only four of those replacements remained in the magazine until all of their chapters had been published. Each title serialized in the magazine was also published in "<a href="tank%C5%8Dbon">tankōbon</a>" volumes under Viz's "Shojo Beat" label. Viz noted that it periodically removed incomplete series from the magazine to help "keep the magazine fresh" and to allow it to speed up publication of the individual volumes.

This is a complete list of all titles that were serialized in "Shojo Beat". It does not include preview chapters. The titles that were running in the magazine when it was discontinued are highlighted.

With the launch of the "Shojo Beat" magazine, Viz Media created new imprints for its manga and fiction lines. The "Shojo Beat" imprint included series featured in the magazine as well as other <a href="sh%C5%8Djo%20manga">"shōjo" manga</a> titles licensed by Viz after the magazine's conception. Viz began releasing a few Japanese <a href="light%20novel">light novel</a>s under a "Shojo Beat Fiction" imprint that were related to its "Shojo Beat" manga titles. In February 2006, Viz launched the "Shojo Beat Home Video" line for releasing <a href="anime">anime</a> titles primarily designed for female viewers. The first title under the new imprint was "<a href="Full%20Moon%20o%20Sagashite">Full Moon o Sagashite</a>", the anime adaptation of the same titled manga that was also released by Viz. To promote the new anime line, Viz included a preview disc of the first volume of "Full Moon" in the June 2006 issue of "Shojo Beat". Though the magazine itself has been canceled, Viz stated in May 2009 that it will continue releasing both existing and new series under the "Shojo Beat" manga and anime imprints.

When "Shojo Beat" launched, it had a circulation of 20,000. In 2006, its average circulation had increased to 35,000, of which 41% were distributed through subscriptions, and the rest sold in newsstands and stores. In 2007, the circulation grew to 38,000, and subscriptions increased to 51%. The magazine's audience was overwhelmingly female, comprising 91% of its readers. Targeted towards "young women", "Shojo Beat"s "core audience" was between the ages of 13 and 19 and made up 61% of its readers; 47% of readers were 12–17 and 45% were 18–34.

"Shojo Beat" was nominated for a 2008 <a href="Anime%20Expo%23Organizational%20structure">Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Award</a> in the category of "Best Publication", but lost to Japan's "<a href="Newtype">Newtype</a>".

In reviewing the premiere release of "Shojo Beat", <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s <a href="Jessica%20Chobot">Jessica Chobot</a> sharply criticized the magazine. She felt it looked and read "like a teenie-bopper magazine" and referred to the issue's cover as a "bright, hot-pink, migraine-inducing, bubble-lettered spectacle". She considered the contents boring, and disagreed with Viz's selection of series, noting, "it's as if Viz had taken everything from their backed-up reject pile and tried to pull one over on the female populace. 90% of what I was reading was either poorly drawn or poorly written (more often than not, it was both)." "Comic World News"' David Welsh disagreed, as he felt that the magazine had several good series, and he praised "<a href="Nana%20%28manga%29">Nana</a>", "<a href="Absolute%20Boyfriend">Absolute Boyfriend</a>" and "<a href="Crimson%20Hero">Crimson Hero</a>" as the top three series of the initial issue. Greg McElhatton, co-founder of "" and former reviewer for iComics.com, praised the magazine's mainstream appearance, calling it a "smart" decision, as it would draw in its target audience by visually showing them that it's a magazine for teenage girls. While he felt that two of the manga titles in the premiere issue had weak openings, he found that the magazine was "off to a good, if not great start".

After its cancellation, "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>"s <a href="Heidi%20MacDonald">Heidi MacDonald</a> reported that the common response she saw from fans was that "everyone liked it but nobody paid for it". She noted that many fans expressed sorrow over the magazine's demise while indicating that they did not subscribe to it. Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for <a href="PopCultureShock">PopCultureShock</a>, remarked that the magazine had offered "just the right mixture of new stories, continuing series, and articles" and praised it for having a "funky, <a href="DIY">DIY</a> vibe". The staff of the "<a href="School%20Library%20Journal">School Library Journal</a>" called the magazine "one of a kind" and felt that its loss would leave a void for female fans, a generally under-acknowledged group of comic and manga readers. Staff member Brigid Alverson felt "Shojo Beat" was a great overall package that "featured intelligent articles that allowed the reader to be enthusiastic about Japanese pop culture without being geeky" making it distinct from other magazines for girls that were normally "filled with brainless celebrity stories or service articles tied to commercial products". Other participants praised the magazine's fashion articles for its educational articles on Japanese culture and for featuring girls of a variety of <a href="Body%20shape">body type</a>s wearing affordable fashions. Two staffers questioned Viz's decision to drop the magazine and wondered if the company had unrealistically expected the magazine to have the same circulation numbers as "Shonen Jump".

Isabelle Eberhardt

Isabelle Wilhelmine Marie Eberhardt (17 February 1877 – 21 October 1904) was a Swiss explorer and author. As a teenager, Eberhardt, educated in Switzerland by her father, published short stories under a male <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>. She became interested in North Africa, and was considered a proficient writer on the subject despite learning about the region only through correspondence. After an invitation from photographer Louis David, Eberhardt moved to Algeria in May 1897. She dressed as a man and converted to <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, eventually adopting the name Si Mahmoud Saadi. Eberhardt's unorthodox behaviour made her an <a href="Outcast%20%28person%29">outcast</a> among European settlers in Algeria and the <a href="French%20Algeria%23Government%20and%20administration">French administration</a>.

Eberhardt's acceptance by the <a href="Qadiriyya">Qadiriyya</a>, an Islamic order, convinced the French administration that she was a spy or an agitator. She survived an assassination attempt shortly thereafter. In 1901, the French administration ordered her to leave Algeria, but she was allowed to return the following year after marrying her partner, the Algerian soldier Slimane Ehnni. Following her return, Eberhardt wrote for a newspaper published by Victor Barrucand and worked for General <a href="Hubert%20Lyautey">Hubert Lyautey</a>. In 1904, at the age of 27, she was killed by a <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a> in <a href="A%C3%AFn%20S%C3%A9fra">Aïn Séfra</a>.

In 1906, Barrucand began publishing her remaining manuscripts, which received critical acclaim. She was seen posthumously as an advocate of <a href="decolonisation">decolonisation</a>, and streets were named after her in <a href="B%C3%A9char">Béchar</a> and <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>. Eberhardt's life has been the subject of several works, including the 1991 film "<a href="Isabelle%20Eberhardt%20%28film%29">Isabelle Eberhardt</a>" and the 2012 opera "".

Eberhardt was born in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, Switzerland, to Alexandre Trophimowsky and Nathalie Moerder (née Eberhardt). Trophimowsky was an <a href="anarchism">anarchist</a>, tutor, and former Orthodox priest-turned-atheist, and Nathalie was the <a href="Legitimacy%20%28family%20law%29">illegitimate</a> daughter of a middle-class <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> German and a Russian Jew. Nathalie was considered to be part of the Russian <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocracy</a>, meaning her illegitimacy was probably kept secret. She married widower Pavel deMoerder, a Russian <a href="General%20officer">general</a> forty years her senior, who hired Trophimowsky to tutor their children Nicolas, Nathalie, and Vladimir.

Around 1871 Nathalie took the children and left her husband for Trophimowsky, who had abandoned his own wife and family. They left Russia, staying in Turkey and then Italy before settling in Geneva. Around 1872 Nathalie gave birth to Augustin; deMoerder, who came to Switzerland in a failed attempt to reconcile with Nathalie, accepted the son as his own and allowed him to have his surname, but the boy's older siblings believed that Trophimowsky was the father. General deMoerder died several months later, and despite their separation had arranged for his estate to pay Nathalie a considerable regular income. The family remained in Switzerland. Four years later Eberhardt was born, and was registered as Nathalie's illegitimate daughter. Biographer <a href="Fran%C3%A7oise%20d%27Eaubonne">Françoise d'Eaubonne</a> speculated that Eberhardt's biological father was the poet <a href="Arthur%20Rimbaud">Arthur Rimbaud</a>, who had been in Switzerland at the time. Other historians consider this unlikely and find it more likely that Trophimowsky was the father, noting that Nathalie and Trophimowsky were rarely apart, that Eberhardt's birth did not impact negatively on their partnership, and that Eberhardt was Trophimowsky's favourite child. Biographer <a href="Cecily%20Mackworth">Cecily Mackworth</a> speculated that Eberhardt's illegitimacy was due to Trophimowsky's <a href="nihilism">nihilist</a> beliefs, which rejected traditional concepts of family.

Eberhardt was well educated; along with the other children in the family, she was home-schooled by Trophimowsky. She was fluent in French, spoke Russian, German and Italian, and was taught Latin, Greek, and classical <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>. She studied philosophy, <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, chemistry, history, and geography, though she was most passionate about literature, reading the works of authors including <a href="Pierre%20Loti">Pierre Loti</a>, <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> and <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Émile Zola</a> while she was a teenager, and was also an admirer of the poets <a href="Semyon%20Nadson">Semyon Nadson</a> and <a href="Charles%20Baudelaire">Charles Baudelaire</a>. At an early age she began wearing male clothing, enjoying its freedom, and her nonconformist father did not discourage her. The children of deMoerder resented their stepfather, who forbade them from obtaining professions or leaving the home, and effectively used them as slaves to tend to his extensive gardens. Eberhardt's sister Nathalie married against Trophimowsky's wishes in 1888, and was subsequently cut off from the rest of the household. Nathalie's departure had a profound effect on Eberhardt's childhood, as she had been responsible for most of the home duties; the household subsequently suffered from a lack of hygiene and regular meals.

Sometime prior to 1894 Eberhardt began corresponding with Eugène Letord, a French officer stationed in the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> who had placed a newspaper advertisement for a <a href="pen%20pal">pen pal</a>. Eberhardt asked him for every detail he could give her about life in the Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged the two of them to relocate to <a href="Annaba">Bône</a>, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series of circumstances that remain unclear though involving financial debts and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined the <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">French Foreign Legion</a> and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa.

In 1895, Eberhardt published short stories in the journal "La Nouvelle Revue Moderne" under the pseudonym of Nicolas Podolinsky; "Infernalia" (her first published work) is about a medical student's physical attraction to a dead woman. Later that year she published (), a story about North African religious life. Eberhardt had "remarkable insight and knowledge" of North Africa for someone acquainted with the region only through correspondence, and her writing had a strong <a href="Anti-imperialism">anti-colonial</a> theme. Louis David, an Algerian-French photographer touring Switzerland who was intrigued by her work, met with her. After hearing of her desire to move to <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, he offered to help her establish herself in Bône if she relocated there. In 1895, he took a photograph of Eberhardt wearing a sailor's uniform, which would become widely associated with her in later years.

Eberhardt relocated to Bône with her mother in May 1897. They initially lived with David and his wife, who both disapproved of the amount of time Eberhardt and her mother spent with Arabs. Eberhardt and her mother did not like the Davids' attitude, which was typical of European settlers in the area, and later avoided the country's French residents, renting an Arabic-style house far from the European quarter. Eberhardt, aware that a Muslim woman could go out neither alone nor unveiled, dressed as a man in a <a href="burnous">burnous</a> and turban. She expanded on her previous studies of Arabic, and became fluent within a few months. She and her mother converted to Islam. Mackworth writes that while Eberhardt was a "natural mystic", her conversion appeared to be largely for practical reasons, as it gave her greater acceptance among the Arabs. Eberhardt found it easy to accept Islam; Trophimowsky had brought her up as a <a href="fatalism">fatalist</a> and Islam gave her fatalism a meaning. She embraced the Islamic concept that everything is predestined and the will of God. Although Eberhardt largely devoted herself to the Muslim way of life, she frequently partook of marijuana and alcohol and had many lovers. According to a friend, Eberhardt "drank more than a Legionnaire, smoked more <a href="kief">kief</a> than a <a href="hashish">hashish</a> addict and made love for the love of making love". She was heterosexual, but often treated sexual intercourse as impersonal. The reason for her Arabic companions' tolerance of her lifestyle has been debated by biographers. According to Mackworth, the "delicate courtesy of the Arabs" led them to treat Eberhardt <a href="male%20privilege">as a man</a> because she wished to live as one. Eberhardt's behaviour made her an outcast with the French settlers and the <a href="French%20Algeria%23Government%20and%20administration">colonial administration</a>, who watched her closely. Seeing no reason as to why a woman would choose the company of impoverished Arabs over her fellow Europeans, they eventually concluded she must be an English agent, sent to stir up resentment towards the French.

Eberhardt began to write stories, including the first draft of her novel "Trimardeur" (). Her story "Yasmina", about a young <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> woman who falls in love with a French officer and the "tragedy this impossible love brings into her life", was published in a local French newspaper. Her mother, who had been suffering from heart problems, died in November 1897 of a heart attack, and was buried under the name of Fatma Mannoubia. Eberhardt was grief-stricken. Trophimowsky, who had been summoned when his partner's health had deteriorated but arrived after her death, showed no sympathy towards Eberhardt. When she told him she desperately wanted to die and rejoin her mother, he responded by calmly offering her his revolver, which she declined.

Eberhardt spent her money recklessly in Algiers, and quickly exhausted the funds left to her by her mother; she would often spend several days at a time in kief dens. Augustin, ejected from the Foreign Legion due to his health, returned to Geneva alongside Eberhardt in early 1899. They found Trophimowsky in poor health, suffering from <a href="throat%20cancer">throat cancer</a> and traumatised by the loss of Eberhardt's mother and Vladimir, who had committed suicide the previous year. Eberhardt nursed her father, growing closer to him. She also commenced a relationship and became engaged to Rehid Bey, an Armenian diplomat with whom she had been friends and possibly lovers when she was seventeen. Though Trophimowsky approved of the engagement, the relationship soon ended. Historian <a href="Lesley%20Blanch">Lesley Blanch</a> attributes the relationship's downfall to Bey being assigned to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. Trophimowsky died in May. Blanch attributes the death to a <a href="chloral">chloral</a> overdose, with which Eberhardt may have intentionally <a href="euthanasia">euthanised</a> him. Eberhardt intended to sell the villa, although Trophimowsky's legitimate wife opposed the execution of the will. After several weeks of legal contentions, Eberhardt mortgaged the property and returned to Africa on the first available ship. With both parents dead, she considered herself free of human attachments and able to live as a <a href="Vagrancy%20%28people%29">vagabond</a>. Eberhardt relinquished her mother's name, and called herself Si Mahmoud Saadi. She began wearing male clothing exclusively and developed a masculine personality, speaking and writing as a man. Eberhardt behaved like an Arab man, challenging gender and racial norms. Asked why she dressed as an Arab man, she invariably replied: "It is impossible for me to do otherwise." A few months later, Eberhardt's money ran low, and she returned to Geneva to sell the villa; due to the legal troubles there was little to no money available.

Encouraged by a friend, she went to Paris to become a writer but had little success. While in Paris Eberhardt met the widow of <a href="Marquis%20de%20Mor%C3%A8s">Marquis de Morès</a>. Although deMorès had been reportedly murdered by <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg</a> tribesmen in the Sahara, no one had been arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt was familiar with the area where deMorès died, she hired her to investigate his murder. The job benefited Eberhardt, who was destitute and longed to return to the Sahara. She returned to Algeria in July 1900, settling in <a href="El%20Oued">El Oued</a>. According to Sahara expert <a href="R.%20V.%20C.%20Bodley">R. V. C. Bodley</a>, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate deMorès' death; Bodley considered this due to a combination of the unwillingness of the French to co-operate in an investigation and Eberhardt's fatalism rather than deliberate dishonesty. Word eventually got back to the deMorès widow about Eberhardt's lackluster investigation, and she subsequently cut off her funding.

Eberhardt made friends in the area and met an Algerian soldier, Slimane Ehnni. They fell in love, and eventually lived together openly. This alienated Eberhardt from the French authorities, who were already outraged by her lifestyle. During her travels she made contact with the <a href="Qadiriyya">Qadiriyya</a>, a <a href="Sufism">Sufi</a> order. The order was led by Hussein benBrahim, who was so impressed with Eberhardt's knowledge of (and passion for) Islam that he initiated her into his "<a href="Zawiya%20%28institution%29">zawiya</a>" without the usual formal examination. This convinced the French authorities that she was a spy or an agitator, and they placed her on a widely circulated <a href="Blacklisting">blacklist</a>. The French transferred Ehnni to the "<a href="spahi">spahi</a>" regiment at <a href="Batna%2C%20Algeria">Batna</a>, possibly to punish Eberhardt (whom they could not harm directly). Too poor to accompany him to Batna, Eberhardt traveled to a Qadiriyya meeting in Behima in late January 1901 where she hoped to ask SiLachmi, a <a href="marabout">marabout</a>, for financial assistance. While waiting for the meeting to begin she was attacked by a man with a sabre, receiving a superficial wound to her head and a deep cut to her left arm. Her attacker, Abdallah ben Mohammed, was overpowered by others and arrested. When asked why he had tried to kill Eberhardt he only repeated "God wished it; God still wishes it." Eberhardt suspected that he was an assassin hired by the French authorities. Others attribute the attack to SiLachmi; Eberhardt was his mistress, whom he had grown tired of, and it is speculated he was simultaneously trying to get rid of her and pin the blame for the attack on a rival tribe. She was brought to the military hospital at ElOued the following day. After Eberhardt recovered in late February, she joined Ehnni with funds from members of the Qadiriyya who regarded her survival as a miracle.

After spending two months in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, she had no choice but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin and his wife and daughter in <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>. In mid-June she was summoned back to <a href="Constantine%2C%20Algeria">Constantine</a> to give evidence at the trial of her attacker, who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she bore no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and hoped that he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty. When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a man) as a <a href="Stevedore">dock labourer</a>. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including her novel "Trimardeur".

A friend of Eberhardt's gave her a <a href="letter%20of%20introduction">letter of introduction</a> to playwright <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Brieux">Eugène Brieux</a>, who opposed French rule in North Africa and supported Arab emancipation. He sent her a several-hundred-<a href="French%20franc">franc</a> <a href="advance%20against%20royalties">advance</a> and tried to have her stories published, but could not find anyone willing to publish pro-Arab writing. Eberhardt, unfazed, continued writing; her morale lifted when Ehnni was transferred to a "spahi" regiment near Marseille in late August to complete his final months of service. He did not require permission from his military superiors to marry in France, and he and Eberhardt were married in October 1901. Shortly before the wedding, Eberhardt and Augustin received the news that Trophimowsky's estate had finally been sold, though due to the mounting legal costs there was no money left for them to inherit. With this news, Eberhardt abandoned any hope of having a financially secure future. In February 1902 Ehnni was discharged, and the couple returned to Bône to live with his family.

After a short time living with Ehnni's family, the couple relocated to Algiers. Eberhardt became disappointed with Ehnni, whose only ambition after leaving the army appeared to be finding an unskilled job that would allow him to live relatively comfortably. She increased her own efforts as a writer, and several of her short stories were printed in the local press. She accepted a job offer from "Al-Akhbar" () newspaper publisher Victor Barrucand in March 1902. Eberhardt became a regular contributor to the newspaper; "Trimardeur" began appearing as a <a href="Serial%20%28literature%29">serial</a> in August 1903. Barrucand and Eberhardt formed a friendship, though Barrucand was frequently frustrated with his new employee's work ethic. Eberhardt's articles arrived irregularly, as she would only write when she felt like doing so. Her job paid poorly, but had many benefits. Through Barrucand's contacts, Eberhardt was able to access the famous <a href="Zawiya%20%28institution%29">"zawiya"</a> of <a href="Lalla%20Zaynab">Lalla Zaynab</a>. Eberhardt spoke highly of her time with Zaynab, though never disclosed what the two discussed; their meeting caused concern among the French authorities.

Eberhardt and Ehnni relocated to <a href="T%C3%A9n%C3%A8s">Ténès</a> in July 1902 after Ehnni obtained employment there as a translator. Eberhardt was incorrigibly bad with her money, spending anything she received immediately on tobacco, books, and gifts for friends, and pawning her meagre possessions or asking for loans when she realised there was no money left for food. This behaviour made her even more of a pariah among the other European residents of the town. Eberhardt would frequently leave for weeks at a time, being either summoned to Algiers by Barrucand or sent on assignments. She was given a regular column in his newspaper, where she wrote about the life and customs of Bedouin tribes. Both Ehnni and Eberhardt's health deteriorated, with Eberhardt regularly suffering from bouts of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. She was also probably affected by <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>.

Barrucand dispatched Eberhardt to report on the aftereffects of the 2September 1903 <a href="Battle%20of%20El-Moungar">Battle of El-Moungar</a>. She stayed with French Foreign Legion soldiers and met <a href="Hubert%20Lyautey">Hubert Lyautey</a>, the French officer in charge of <a href="Oran">Oran</a>, at their headquarters. Eberhardt and Lyautey became friends and, due to her knowledge of Islam and Arabic, she became a liaison between him and the local Arab people. While Eberhardt never ceased protesting against any repressive actions undertaken by the French administration, she believed that Lyautey's approach, which focused on diplomacy rather than military force, would bring peace to the region. Although details are unclear, it is generally accepted that Eberhardt also engaged in espionage for Lyautey. Concerned about a powerful marabout in the <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a>, Lyautey sent her to meet with him in 1904.

At the marabout's "zawiya", Eberhardt was weakened by fever. She returned to <a href="A%C3%AFn%20S%C3%A9fra">Aïn Séfra</a>, and was treated at the military hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a> struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore the ruins of the house where the couple had stayed. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.

At the time of her death, Eberhardt's possessions included several of her unpublished manuscripts. Lyautey instructed his soldiers to search for all of her papers in the aftermath of the flood, and posted those that could be found to Barrucand. After reconstructing them, substituting his own words where the originals were missing or too damaged to decipher, he began to publish her work. Some of what he published is considered to be more his work than Eberhardt's. Barrucand also received criticism for listing himself as the co-author of some of the publications, and for not clarifying which portions of text were his own. The first posthumous story, ""Dans l'Ombre Chaude de l'Islam"" (In the Warm Shadow of Islam) received critical acclaim when it was published in 1906. The book's success drew great attention to Eberhardt's writing and established her as among the best writers of literature inspired by Africa. A street was named after Eberhardt in <a href="B%C3%A9char">Béchar</a> and another in Algiers. The street in Algiers is in the outskirts; one writer at the time commented there was a sad symbolism in the fact the street "begins in an inhabited quarter and peters out into a wasteland". She was posthumously seen as an advocate of feminism and <a href="decolonisation">decolonisation</a>; according to Hedi Abdel-Jaouad in "<a href="Yale%20French%20Studies">Yale French Studies</a>", her work may have begun the decolonisation of North Africa. Eberhardt's relationship with Lyautey has triggered discussion by modern historians about her complicity in colonialism.

In 1954, author and explorer <a href="Cecily%20Mackworth">Cecily Mackworth</a> published the biography "The Destiny of Isabelle Eberhardt" after following Eberhardt's routes in Algeria and the Sahara. The book inspired <a href="Paul%20Bowles">Paul Bowles</a> to translate some of Eberhardt's writings into English. Novelist <a href="William%20Bayer">William Bayer</a> published "Visions of Isabelle", a fictionalised 1976 account of her life. In 1981, <a href="Timberlake%20Wertenbaker">Timberlake Wertenbaker</a> premiered "New Anatomies", a play about Eberhardt.

Eberhardt has been portrayed in two films. <a href="Leslie%20Thornton%20%28filmmaker%29">Leslie Thornton</a> directed a 1988 biography, "There Was An Unseen Cloud Moving", with seven amateur actresses playing Eberhardt. <a href="Ian%20Pringle%20%28director%29">Ian Pringle</a> directed "<a href="Isabelle%20Eberhardt%20%28film%29">Isabelle Eberhardt</a>", starring <a href="Mathilda%20May">Mathilda May</a>, in 1991. In 1994, the soundtrack for Pringle's film was released by musician <a href="Paul%20Sch%C3%BCtze">Paul Schütze</a>, titled "". In 1998, <a href="John%20Berger">John Berger</a> and <a href="Nella%20Bielski">Nella Bielski</a> published "Isabelle: A Story in Shots", a screenplay based on Eberhardt's life. <a href="Missy%20Mazzoli">Missy Mazzoli</a> composed an opera, "", in 2012.

Millennium Force

Millennium Force is a <a href="steel%20roller%20coaster">steel roller coaster</a> located at <a href="Cedar%20Point">Cedar Point</a> amusement park in <a href="Sandusky%2C%20Ohio">Sandusky, Ohio</a>. Manufactured by <a href="Intamin">Intamin</a>, it was the park's fourteenth roller coaster dating back to the opening of <a href="Blue%20Streak%20%28Cedar%20Point%29">Blue Streak</a> in 1964. Upon completion in 2000, Millennium Force broke six world records and was the world's first "<a href="Roller%20coaster%23By%20height">giga coaster</a>", a term coined by Intamin and Cedar Point to represent roller coasters that exceed in height and complete a full circuit. It was briefly the <a href="List%20of%20roller%20coaster%20rankings%23Tallest%20steel%20roller%20coasters">tallest</a> and <a href="List%20of%20roller%20coaster%20rankings%23Fastest%20steel%20roller%20coasters">fastest</a> in the world until <a href="Steel%20Dragon%202000">Steel Dragon 2000</a> opened later the same year. The ride is also the third-longest roller coaster in North America following <a href="The%20Beast%20%28roller%20coaster%29">The Beast</a> at <a href="Kings%20Island">Kings Island</a> and <a href="Fury%20325">Fury 325</a> at <a href="Carowinds">Carowinds</a>.

Millennium Force features a cable lift hill with a drop, two tunnels, three <a href="Roller%20coaster%20elements%23Overbanked%20turn">overbanked turns</a>, and four hills. The coaster also has a top speed of . Since its debut, Millennium Force has been voted the number one steel roller coaster ten times in "<a href="Amusement%20Today">Amusement Today</a>"'s annual <a href="Amusement%20Today%23Golden%20Ticket%20Awards">Golden Ticket Awards</a>; as of 2018, it had never been ranked lower than second place. Although Millennium Force has been surpassed in height and speed, it remains one of the tallest and fastest in the world.

The planning, design and development phases of Millennium Force took place over five years. The first rumors that a new record-breaking roller coaster would be built at Cedar Point, which included speculation about a ten <a href="roller%20coaster%20inversion">inversion</a> roller coaster from <a href="Bolliger%20%26amp%3B%20Mabillard">Bolliger & Mabillard</a> and an <a href="Arrow%20Dynamics">Arrow Dynamics</a> MegaLooper, began circulating in early 1998. A roller coaster from <a href="D.%20H.%20Morgan%20Manufacturing">D. H. Morgan Manufacturing</a> was also rumored. On July 2, 1999, <a href="Cedar%20Fair">Cedar Fair Entertainment Company</a> filed a trademark for the name Millennium Force, which raised more speculation about what the ride would be like. About a week later, the first track pieces were seen at the park, which confirmed that the ride would be manufactured by <a href="Intamin">Intamin</a>. Cedar Point officials also confirmed that it would not have inversions.

Millennium Force was announced on July 22, 1999, as the tallest roller coaster in the world, taking the record from <a href="Fujiyama%20%28roller%20coaster%29">Fujiyama</a> at <a href="Fuji-Q%20Highland">Fuji-Q Highland</a> in Japan. Don Miears, General Manager of Cedar Point said, "Millennium Force introduces the world to a whole new level of roller coaster riding." The ride cost $25 million to design and build. Millennium Force was built in the Frontier Trail section of the park and the <a href="Cedar%20Point%23Family%20rides">Giant Wheel</a> was relocated to make room for it. Cedar Point, Intamin, and <a href="Werner%20Stengel">Werner Stengel</a> designed the layout of the ride. After the ride was announced, several disputes about whether Millennium Force or was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world arose between Cedar Point and <a href="Six%20Flags%20Magic%20Mountain">Six Flags Magic Mountain</a>. Superman: The Escape is high and its speed is ; however, it is a <a href="shuttle%20roller%20coaster">shuttle roller coaster</a>, not a complete-circuit roller coaster.

Construction started in August 1999 when the site was cleared. The removal and relocation of the Giant Wheel began in October on closing day; the first of 226 supports was installed on October 11, starting at the <a href="brake%20run">brake run</a>. Two hundred twenty-six <a href="Deep%20foundation">footers</a>, each about deep were dug; the largest ones were . The concrete construction was done by Mosser Construction. The <a href="lift%20hill">lift hill</a> was topped off in early January 2000.

The ride's construction took seven months, and 120 construction workers and project managers participated. Testing took two months. The park conducted a "pull-through" by pulling a train along the course to ensure proper clearance. The ride was inspected and tested with water-dummies on the trains. The first media event was held on May 11, 2000, and the ride opened to the public two days later on May 13. When it opened, it broke six world records. It was the first <a href="Roller%20coaster%23By%20height">Giga Coaster</a> and was the world's fastest complete-circuit roller coaster, but was later overtaken by other rides. About a month after Millennium's debut, Cedar Point introduced a new queuing system called "Ticket to Ride" to reduce the waiting times, which allowed visitors to buy a ticket then return later and wait in a shorter line. In August, Cedar Point engaged John Hancock and Associates and Stalker Radar of <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> to measure the height and speed of Millennium Force. The height was measured at , and the speed was measured at , slightly faster than what the park had been advertising (92 mph).

Before the start of the 2004 season, Millennium Force's seat belts were modified because of an incident that occurred on <a href="Superman%20the%20Ride">Superman the Ride</a>, a similar roller coaster at <a href="Six%20Flags%20New%20England">Six Flags New England</a>. The new seat belts were shorter and some riders had difficulties with them. The roller coaster's layout was repainted over a three-year period, before the 2011, 2012 and 2013 seasons. In 2012, the park added a new LED lighting system.

Millennium Force's entrance is located behind the <a href="Cedar%20Point%20%26amp%3B%20Lake%20Erie%20Railroad">Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad</a>'s <a href="Luminosity%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%94%20Ignite%20the%20Night%21%23Celebration%20Plaza">Celebration Plaza</a> station. The queue is situated between the ride's last overbanked turn and the station. A DJ booth is provided to entertain waiting visitors; the park's "Jamming DJ's" take requests for family friendly songs from people in the queue. It was then replaced by Cedar Point's FUNtv, which plays music videos of popular songs, the Gatekeeper/Maverick shuffle, park trivia, sports news, park advertisements, weather forecasts, and popular news headlines. About a month after Millennium's debut, Cedar Point introduced a new queue system known as "Ticket to Ride" (later FreeWay) to reduce the wait time. Visitors could buy tickets then return later and wait in a shorter line. This system was discontinued in 2004 after several people complained it was unfair that others were going ahead of them in line. In 2012, Cedar Point introduced its <a href="Fast%20Lane%20%28Cedar%20Fair%29">Fast Lane</a> queue system on the ride; visitors can buy a wristband which enables them to wait in a shorter line. The system was tested at <a href="Kings%20Island">Kings Island</a> the previous year, where it received positive reviews.

Millennium Force covers ; it runs parallel to the shoreline of <a href="Sandusky%20Bay">Lake Erie</a> then travels to an island located inside the park, where the <a href="Shoot%20the%20Rapids">Shoot the Rapids</a> log flume and the <a href="Dinosaurs%20Alive%21%20%28attraction%29">Dinosaurs Alive!</a> attraction were formerly located. There are two tunnels, three overbanked turns and four hills. One cycle of the ride takes approximately 2 minutes and 20 seconds.

While the train is being loaded with passengers, the catch car for the <a href="Lift%20hill">cable lift</a> descends the lift hill and latches onto the middle car underneath the train. Once the train is cleared, the cable lift immediately pulls the train up the 45 degree lift hill at to a height of . The train drops at an 80 degree angle and reaches a top speed of at the bottom of the hill. It then climbs through a right <a href="Roller%20coaster%20elements%23Overbanked%20turn">overbanked turn</a> at 122 degrees from the horizontal axis, then travels through a tunnel as it passes over the Frontier Trail. It then travels over a parabolic hill, which provides a moment of <a href="Weightlessness">zero gravity</a> as it passes over a lagoon and down onto Adventure Island. It completes a , 360-degree right-handed helix, followed by a left overbanked turn. It then completes a small right-hand turn before traveling over another hill to leave the island. The train then travels left through a second tunnel where the <a href="On-ride%20camera">on-ride photo</a> is taken, followed by a left turn and a small hill, passing by the queue. Finally, the train travels high through another right overbanked turn over the queue and is stopped by <a href="Brake%20run">magnetic brakes</a>. Passengers disembark the ride at an unloading station and the train moves to a second station where it is loaded.

Millennium Force is a Giga Coaster model designed by Werner Stengel and built by Swiss manufacturer Intamin. It was the first of a series of roller coasters, including <a href="Top%20Thrill%20Dragster">Top Thrill Dragster</a>the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world in 2003that Intamin built at Cedar Point. , Millennium Force is one of only two Giga Coasters built by Intamin, the other being <a href="Intimidator%20305">Intimidator 305</a> at <a href="Kings%20Dominion">Kings Dominion</a>.

Millennium Force operates with three stainless steel, <a href="Stadium%20seating">stadium-style seating</a> <a href="train%20%28roller%20coaster%29">trains</a> colored red, blue, and yellow. Each train has nine cars that seat four passengers, allowing a maximum capacity of 36 people per train and 1,300 riders an hour. Each seat has an individual, hydraulic, T-shaped lap bar and seat belt which rests across the rider's lap. Each train weighs 19 tons.

The <a href="station%20%28roller%20coaster%29">station</a> has two platforms, one for unloading and one for loading. Two trains are loaded and unloaded while the third train is running the course. There is also a separate line in the station where riders can wait for the first seat. The loading platform has red overhead lights, which are located above the train. Millennium Force's theme song is played in the station while riders are boarding.

The steel tubular track is long and the lift is approximately high. The track is blue and the supports are silver. The track consists of 229 pieces, each weighing between . Intamin supplied the track with <a href="hollow%20structural%20section">hollow structural section</a>s (HSS), which is used in all the track pieces, supports and towers. Millennium Force uses three different track shapes. The simplest sections are two-pipe track, made with two running rails connected by square HSS cross-members. The ride also uses three-pipe track, which has two running rails with a backbone of round HSS, which forms a triangle. The third type of track forms a square and is considered the strongest. It has two running rails with two backbone tubes. As both a high altitude and high velocity ride, Millennium Force is affected by unfavorable weather conditions such as rain, lightning or strong winds; under these conditions the ride is closed, but in light rain it can remain open.

When the ride opened in 2000, Cedar Point chose <a href="High%20End%20Systems">High End Systems</a>, headquartered in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, to light the ride. Rob Decker, Cedar Point’s Corporate Director of Planning & Design, said that they thought they would have to mount multiple floodlights on the tower. However, they were able to install thirty EC-1 floodlights at the base of the lift hill structure which provided lighting throughout the ride's structure. Of the six main support towers, three had six EC-1s, and three towers had four EC-1s. The three tallest towers had another unit in the middle.

Over the years, the lights were not maintained and grew noticeably dimmer. In 2012, Cedar Point introduced a new nighttime show, <a href="Luminosity%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%94%20Ignite%20the%20Night%21">Luminosity — Ignite the Night!</a>, to "re-energize" the park at the end of the day. New LED lights from <a href="Sunrise%2C%20Florida">Sunrise, Florida</a>-based <a href="Chauvet%20Professional">Chauvet Professional</a> were installed to illuminate the ride. Twenty COLORado Range and ten COLORado Ridge wash lights were installed at the base of the lift hill structure.

When it opened in May 2000, Millennium Force broke six world records and used a new magnetic braking system instead of <a href="Vehicle%20brake%23Friction%20brake">friction brakes</a> found on most roller coasters. This new system enabled the use of a shorter brake run, which slows the train from down to a standstill in six seconds.

Millennium Force held the records for tallest and fastest complete-circuit roller coaster until August 2000, when <a href="Steel%20Dragon%202000">Steel Dragon 2000</a> opened. Millennium Force held the record for tallest and fastest roller coaster at Cedar Point until 2003, when Cedar Point debuted Top Thrill Dragster, which at the time was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world.

Millennium Force held the following records at the time of its debut:

At the time of Millennium Force's debut, Cedar Point held records for the following (May 2000 statistic on left and May 2013 statistic on right):

Millennium Force had an impact on the way roller coasters were built. Following its debut, the use of cable lift hills, which require less maintenance and support more weight than a traditional chain lift, became a prevalent feature in the industry. Millennium Force also paved the way for additional coasters breaking the barrier. Top Thrill Dragster, also built by Intamin, opened three years later as the first complete-circuit roller coaster to exceed in height. Intamin did not build another Giga Coaster until 2010, when it built <a href="Intimidator%20305">Intimidator 305</a> at <a href="Kings%20Dominion">Kings Dominion</a>. Intimidator 305 is similar to Millennium Force; it has a cable lift and similar layout but has different restraints; it uses shoulder harnesses instead of lap bars. <a href="Leviathan%20%28roller%20coaster%29">Leviathan</a> opened at <a href="Canada%27s%20Wonderland">Canada's Wonderland</a> in May 2012 breaking as well. Manufactured by <a href="Bolliger%20%26amp%3B%20Mabillard">Bolliger & Mabillard</a>, it uses a chain lift instead of a cable lift.

Millennium Force has one of the longest lines in the park, with passengers waiting over four hours when the ride debuted. The ride received positive reactions from visitors, many of whom said it was smooth and very comfortable. Others said, "It'll scare the daylights out of you". In its first six years of operation, Millennium Force had over 10 million riders. By August 2012, Millennium had given more than 21 million rides. Several television shows, including the <a href="Travel%20Channel">Travel Channel</a>'s "<a href="Extreme%20%28Travel%20Channel%20series%29">Extreme Terror Rides</a>", "<a href="Bert%20the%20Conqueror">Bert the Conqueror</a>", "<a href="Off%20Limits%20%28TV%20series%29">Off Limits</a>", the <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a>'s "Extreme Rides", and the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Channel">National Geographic Channel</a>'s "Super Coasters" have featured Millennium Force. Out of over 500 roller coasters that Werner Stengel has engineered, he stated that Millennium Force is his favorite. <a href="Robb%20Alvey">Robb Alvey</a>, a notable roller coaster enthusiast, called it a "milestone in roller coaster history".

Millennium Force has consistently ranked high in various polls and has won numerous awards. Millennium Force and <a href="Superman%20the%20Ride">Superman the Ride</a> (formerly Bizarro) at <a href="Six%20Flags%20New%20England">Six Flags New England</a> held the top two places in the <a href="Amusement%20Today%23Golden%20Ticket%20Awards">Golden Ticket Awards</a> from 2001–2015, often swapping positions. <a href="Fury%20325">Fury 325</a> has occupied the top spot since 2016. In the Travel Channel's "<a href="Insane%20Coaster%20Wars">Insane Coaster Wars</a>", Millennium Force was voted the "fan favorite" in the "Extreme Heights" and "The Top 10" categories. In 2013, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" ranked Millennium Force as the top roller coaster in the United States.

Make Way for Ducklings

Make Way for Ducklings is a children's <a href="picture%20book">picture book</a> written and illustrated by <a href="Robert%20McCloskey">Robert McCloskey</a>. First published in <a href="1941%20in%20literature">1941</a>, the book tells the story of a pair of <a href="mallard">mallard</a>s who decide to raise their family on an island in the lagoon in <a href="Public%20Garden%20%28Boston%29">Boston Public Garden</a>, a park in the center of <a href="Boston">Boston</a>.

"Make Way for Ducklings" won the <a href="Caldecott%20Medal">1942 Caldecott Medal</a> for McCloskey's illustrations, executed in <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> then <a href="lithography">lithographed</a> on <a href="zinc">zinc</a> plates. As of 2003, the book had sold over two million copies. The book's popularity led to the construction of a statue by <a href="Nancy%20Sch%C3%B6n">Nancy Schön</a> in the Public Garden of the mother duck and her eight ducklings, which is a popular destination for children and adults alike. In 1991, <a href="Barbara%20Bush">Barbara Bush</a> gave a duplicate of this sculpture to <a href="Raisa%20Gorbachev">Raisa Gorbachev</a> as part of the <a href="START%20Treaty">START Treaty</a>, and the work is displayed in Moscow's <a href="Novodevichy%20Park">Novodevichy Park</a>.

The book is the official children's book of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Massachusetts">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a>. Praise for the book is still high over 70 years since its first publication, mainly for the enhancing illustrations and effective pacing. It was criticised for having a loose plot, however. The book is popular worldwide.

"Make Way for Ducklings", published in 1941, was McCloskey's second book and was the winner of the <a href="Caldecott%20Medal">Caldecott Medal</a> in 1942. In his acceptance speech, McCloskey explained his motivation for the story. While attending the <a href="Vesper%20George%20Art%20School">Vesper George Art School</a> in the early 1930s, he would spend time in the Public Garden feeding the ducks. After some time away, he returned to Boston to paint a mural and created a draft of the book after inspiration from <a href="May%20Massee">May Massee</a>. To better illustrate the story, McCloskey spent time at the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> in New York, visited an <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a>, and eventually brought home for models six ducklings to live in his studio at 280 West 12th Street, apartment 4C, in New York's West Village.

The story begins as two ducks (Mr. and Mrs. Mallard) fly over various potential locations around the city of Boston, Massachusetts (United States) to start a family. Each time Mr. Mallard selects a location, Mrs. Mallard finds something wrong with it. Tired from their search, the mallards land at the Public Garden Lagoon to spend the night. In the morning, a <a href="Swan%20Boats%20%28Boston%2C%20Massachusetts%29">swan boat</a> passes by the mallards. The mallards mistake the swan boat for a real bird and enjoy peanuts thrown by the people on the boat. Mrs. Mallard suggests that they build their nest in the Public Garden. However, just as she says this, her husband is nearly run down by a passing bicyclist. The mallards continue their search, flying over Boston landmarks such as <a href="Beacon%20Hill%2C%20Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Beacon Hill</a>, the <a href="Massachusetts%20State%20House">Massachusetts State House</a>, and <a href="Louisburg%20Square">Louisburg Square</a>. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the <a href="Charles%20River">Charles River</a>. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day.

Shortly thereafter, the Mallards <a href="molt">molt</a>, and will not be able to fly until their new feathers grow again, and Mrs. Mallard hatches eight ducklings named Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. After the ducklings are born, Mr. Mallard decides to take a trip up the river to see what the rest of it is like. Mr. and Mrs. Mallard agree to meet at the Public Garden in one week. In the meantime, Mrs. Mallard teaches the eight ducklings all they need to know about being ducks, such as swimming, diving, marching along, and to avoid dangers such as bicycles and other wheeled objects.

One week later, Mrs. Mallard <a href="Imprinting%20%28psychology%29%23Filial%20imprinting">leads</a> the ducklings ashore and straight to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, <a href="Embankment%20Road">Embankment Road</a> (Storrow Drive had yet to be constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to <a href="Charles%20Street%20%28Boston%29">Charles Street</a> where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross <a href="Beacon%20Street">Beacon Street</a> to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic to make way for the ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives <a href="Happy%20ending">happily ever after</a>. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep.

Illustrated with sepia drawings rather than the traditional black-and-white pictures found in most children's books of the day, the book, which received the 1942 Caldecott Medal for its illustrations, has continued to garner praise years after its first publishing.
The drawings of <a href="Boston">Boston</a> represent a duck's eye view of the city. Each of the individual ducklings is "bored, inquisitive, sleepy, or they are scratching, talking over their backs one to another, running to catch up with the line". Children identify with the ducklings because they behave as children do. The comforting message shows parents as caretakers, protectors, and teachers.
According to fellow Caldecott winner <a href="Paul%20O.%20Zelinsky">Paul O. Zelinsky</a>, "I realized that if the action in the drawings were to move from left to right, the ducks could not have been shown passing the Corner Book Shop, which is a wonderful detail in the story ... He clearly knew these streets very well."
"'Robert McCloskey's unusual and stunning pictures have long been a delight for their fun as well as their spirit of place.'-- "The Horn Book""

"Make Way for Ducklings" has been continuously in print since it was first published. As of 2003, the book had sold over two million copies. In September 2006 the hardcover edition of the book ranked #2,182 in sales at <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> and #1,838 in sales at <a href="Barnes%20%26amp%3B%20Noble">Barnes & Noble</a>. The story has also been published in paperback and audiobook.

When it was first released in 1941, Ellen Buell of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called the book "one of the merriest we have had in a long time", praising the understated comedic aspect of the procession down Beacon Street, as well as McCloskey's "fine large pictures" which simultaneously demonstrate "economy of line" and "wealth of detail".

Viking publishing planned to release a 75th-anniversary edition of the classic in March 2016.

One critic, Alice Fannin, says the "loosely plotted" story gives no true explanation for why Mr. Mallard leaves the island in the <a href="Charles%20River">Charles River</a> or why the Mallards did not simply stay on the <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a> island in the first place and avoid the bicyclists on the shore. However, McCloskey has stated himself that he thinks of himself as an artist who writes children's books and not vice versa. Fannin also finds the characterization lacking, that is, the Mallards represent "rather <a href="stereotype">stereotypically</a> concerned parents", often showing the same facial expressions and rarely showing expressiveness.

Another critic has positively commented on McCloskey's use of page breaks as a pacing technique. McCloskey's use of one-sentence pages forces the reader to quickly turn the page, enhancing the sense of motion, especially during the home search and when Mrs. Mallard teaches the ducklings their basic skills. McCloskey also employs this page break method to heighten surprise. When searching for a home, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard seem to have found a home on page eleven.

'Good,' said Mr. Mallard, delighted that at last Mrs. Mallard had found a place that suited her. But — (p. 11)

Then, they encounter a sudden problem with the chosen location when Mrs. Mallard is nearly run over by a bicyclist on page thirteen.
"Make Way for Ducklings" was published in the 1940s. Many books of the time portray a male dominated society, a trend which "Make Way for Ducklings" does not follow. In context, the story takes place during wartime as fathers were being drafted and sent to Europe, requiring more social support for single parent families. McCloskey presented Mrs. Mallard as an "independent and nonsubmissive female character." This strong portrayal has led one critic to label the book as "pre-feminist."

Based on a 2007 online poll, the <a href="National%20Education%20Association">National Education Association</a> named "Make Way for Ducklings" one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children." In 2012 it was ranked number six among the "Top 100 Picture Books" in a survey published by "<a href="School%20Library%20Journal">School Library Journal</a>".

The city of Boston, the setting of the book, has whole-heartedly embraced the story. In the Public Garden, where the Mallards eventually settled, a bronze statue has been erected of Mrs. Mallard and her eight ducklings. While the tallest statue stands only 38 inches (.97 meters) tall, the caravan of bronze ducks set in <a href="cobblestone">Boston cobblestone</a> spans 35 feet (10.67 m) from front to back. The statue, installed October 4, 1987, was a tribute to Robert McCloskey "whose story ... has made the Boston Public Garden familiar to children throughout the world."

Since 1978, the city has hosted an annual Duckling Day parade each spring, with children and their parents dressed as ducklings. Part of the route retraces the path taken by Mrs. Mallard and her ducklings to get to the Public Garden.

In 2000, schoolchildren from <a href="Canton%2C%20Massachusetts">Canton, Massachusetts</a> decided that the book was worthy of being the official children's book of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and went to their state legislature to get a bill passed declaring it so. However, legislators from <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield, Massachusetts</a> blocked the legislation on the grounds the official book should be by Springfield native <a href="Dr.%20Seuss">Dr. Seuss</a>. Legislators reached a compromise when they agreed to make Dr. Seuss the official children's author of the commonwealth and "Make Way for Ducklings" the official children's book.

A statue similar to the one in the Boston Public Garden was erected in <a href="Novodevichy%20Park">Novodevichy Park</a> in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> as part of the <a href="START%20Treaty">START Treaty</a> by Acton, Massachusetts landscape and construction company Capizzi & Co. Inc. on July 30, 1991. The equipment, statues, cobblestones, and workers were all flown by the US Air Force in a C5 containing the heavy equipment, diesel fuel, and other assorted tools they would need. The individual statues, which were in total length, long, were presented by then <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States First Lady</a> <a href="Barbara%20Bush">Barbara Bush</a> to Russian First Lady <a href="Raisa%20Gorbachyova">Raisa Gorbachev</a> as a gift to the children of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Four of the ducks were <a href="art%20theft">stolen</a>, one in 1991 and three in February 2000. Thieves hoping to sell the ducks as scrap metal cut the statues off at the legs. The ducks were replaced in September 2000 at a rededication ceremony attended by former <a href="President%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">President of the Soviet Union</a> <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>.

"Make Way for Ducklings" was adapted into an 11-minute black-and-white cartoon created by <a href="Weston%20Woods">Weston Woods</a> in 1955. Founded by educator <a href="Morton%20Schindel">Morton Schindel</a> in 1953, Weston Woods Studios, Inc.(named after the wooded area outside his home in <a href="Weston%2C%20Connecticut">Weston, Connecticut</a>) specializes in animating children's picture books on film. The program is centered toward young struggling readers who, after watching the movie, are encouraged to read the books themselves.

In 1964, Schindel and Weston Woods Studios made the 18-minute "Robert McCloskey", a documentary which is sometimes screened in art schools. The film shows McCloskey sitting in Boston Public Garden and intercuts pages from his sketchbook drawings for "Make Way for Ducklings". The illustrator discusses experiences that have influenced his work and the relationship of craftsmanship to inspiration.

Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral

Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral () is a <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> three-<a href="spire">spire</a> <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a> in the city of <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a>, Ireland. It belongs to the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> and was completed in 1879. The cathedral is located on the south side of the <a href="River%20Lee">River Lee</a>, on ground that has been a place of worship since the seventh century, and is dedicated to <a href="Finbarr%20of%20Cork">Finbarr of Cork</a>, <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of the city. It was once in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Cork">Diocese of Cork</a>; it is now one of the three cathedrals in the Church of Ireland <a href="Diocese%20of%20Cork%2C%20Cloyne%20and%20Ross">Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross</a>, in the <a href="Province%20of%20Dublin%20%28Church%20of%20Ireland%29">ecclesiastical province of Dublin</a>.

Christian use of the site dates back to a seventh-century AD <a href="monastery">monastery</a>, which according to legend was founded by Finbarr of Cork. During the medieval period, the site absorbed successive wars, damage and waves of church building. Around 1536, during the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, the cathedral became part of the <a href="established%20church">established church</a>, later known as the Church of Ireland. The previous building was constructed in the 1730s, but was widely regarded as plain and featureless.

The cathedral's demolition and rebuild was commissioned in the mid-19th century by an <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> church intent on strengthening its hand after the reforms of <a href="Penal%20Laws%20%28Ireland%29">penal law</a>. Work began in 1863, and resulted in the first major commissioned project for the Victorian architect <a href="William%20Burges">William Burges</a>, who designed most of Fin Barre's architecture, sculpture, stained glass, mosaics and interior furniture. Saint Fin Barre's foundation stone was laid in 1865. The cathedral was <a href="consecrated">consecrated</a> in 1870 and the <a href="limestone">limestone</a> spires completed by October 1879.

The cathedral is mostly built from local stone sourced from <a href="Little%20Island%2C%20Cork">Little Island</a> and <a href="Fermoy">Fermoy</a>. The exterior is capped by three spires: two on the west front and above where the <a href="transept">transept</a> crosses the <a href="nave">nave</a>. Many of the external sculptures, including the <a href="gargoyle">gargoyle</a>s, were modelled by <a href="Thomas%20Nicholls%20%28sculptor%29">Thomas Nicholls</a>. The entrances contain the figures of over a dozen biblical figures, capped by a <a href="Tympanum%20%28architecture%29">tympanum</a> showing a <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">Resurrection scene</a>.

The church grounds are located south of the <a href="River%20Lee">River Lee</a> on Holy Island, on one of the many inlets forming the Great Marsh of <a href="Munster">Munster</a> ("Corcach Mor na Mumhan"). Saint Fin Barre's is on the site of at least two previous church buildings, each dedicated to <a href="Finbarr%20of%20Cork">Fin Barre of Cork</a>, <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a> city, and the founder of the monastic <a href="Hermitage%20%28religious%20retreat%29">hermitage</a> at <a href="Gougane%20Barra">Gougane Barra</a>.

Finbarr was born in about 550. He was, by legend, given Gougane Barra as a place of contemplation, and visited Cork city to lay the foundation stones for the "one true Christian faith". By legend, after Finbarr died his remains were brought to Cork to be enclosed in a shrine located on the site of today's <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a>.

Archaeological evidence suggests the first site at Fin Barre's probably dates from the 7th century, and consisted of a church and <a href="Irish%20round%20tower">round tower</a> which survived until the 12th century, after which it fell into neglect, or was destroyed during the <a href="Norsemen">Norse</a> invasions.

A 1644 reference to the site notes that "in one of the suburbs of Korq [Cork] there is an old tower ten or twelve feet [3.3 m] in circumference, and more than one hundred feet [30 m] high ... believ[ed] to have been built by St. Baril [Finbarr]". The building was badly damaged in 1690 during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Cork">Siege of Cork</a>, after which only the steeple remained intact, due to an outbreak of fire and the impact of a 24-pound (11 kg) <a href="Round%20shot">shot</a> from <a href="Elizabeth%20Fort">Elizabeth Fort</a> in nearby Barrack Street. The cannonball was rediscovered during the 1865 demolition and is now on display in the cathedral. The church was demolished in 1735 and replaced the same year by a smaller building, as part of a wider phase of citywide construction and renovation.

Only the earlier spire was retained for the new building. The older part of this church was described in 1862 as <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> in style, attached to a featureless modern tower with an "ill-formed" spire. The building was widely considered to be poorly designed. The "<a href="Dublin%20Builder">Dublin Builder</a>" described it as "a shabby apology for a cathedral which has long disgraced Cork", while "The Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland" judged it "a plain, massive, dull, tasteless, oblong pile, totally destitute of what is usually regarded as cathedral character, and possessing hardly a claim to any sort of architectural consideration". It was demolished in 1865.

In April 1862, the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>, in pursuit of a larger, more attractive cathedral, and determined to reassert its authority in response to a resurgent <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Ireland">Catholicism</a>, initiated a competition for a replacement building, which became the commission for the first cathedral to be built in the British Isles since London's <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's</a>. The following February, the designs of the architect <a href="William%20Burges">William Burges</a>, then 35, were declared the winner of the competition to build the new cathedral. Burges disregarded the £15,000 budget, and produced a design that he estimated would cost twice as much. Despite the protestations of fellow competitors, it won. His diary records his reaction – ""Got Cork!"" – while cathedral accounts mention a payment of £100 as prize money. The foundation stone was laid on 12 January 1865, the unfinished cathedral was consecrated in 1870, and the spires topped out in 1879.

Burges used earlier unrealised designs for the exterior, including those intended for the <a href="Crimea%20Memorial%20Church">Crimea Memorial Church</a>, Istanbul, <a href="St%20John%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Brisbane">St John's Cathedral, Brisbane</a> and elevations for <a href="Lille%20Cathedral">Lille Cathedral</a>. The main obstacle was economics. Despite the efforts of fundraisers, Cork was unable to afford a large cathedral. Burges partially alleviated this by designing a three-spired exterior which enhanced the size of the building to viewers. He realised early on the build would vastly exceed the money the city had raised.

The superiority of his design was recognised by the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Cork">Bishop of Cork</a>, <a href="John%20Gregg%20%28bishop%20of%20Cork%29">John Gregg</a>, who supported Burges and lobbied for additional funding. Gregg was instrumental in sourcing additional money, including local merchants such as William Crawford of the <a href="Beamish%20and%20Crawford">Crawford brewing family</a> and <a href="North%20Mall%20Distillery">Francis Wise</a>, a local distiller. The final total was significantly over £100,000. Burges, assured by the efforts of Gregg, was unconcerned.

Gregg died before the completion of the project. In his place, his son Robert continued his father's support, and in 1879 ceremoniously placed the final stone on the eastern spire. By then the contractors estimated that the build was nearing its completion, with only a number of pre-designed stained glass fittings left to be installed.
The cathedral holds the book of estimates prepared for the decoration of the west front. Nicholls was paid £1,769 for the modelling, and Robert McLeod £5,153 for the carving. Burges took 10 per cent for the design, more than his usual 5 per cent, apparently due to his high level of personal involvement. Its construction took seven years before the first service was held in 1870. During the first building phase, three firms of contractors were employed, owned by, chronologically, Robert Walker, Gilbert Cockburn and John Delany who eventually completed the construction of the spires in 1879. Building, carving and decoration continued into the 20th century, long after Burges' death in 1881, including the marble panelling of the aisles, the installation of the <a href="reredos">reredos</a> and side choir walls, and the 1915 construction of the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">chapter</a> house.

Saint Fin Barre's is described by the architectural historians David Lawrence and Ann Wilson as "undoubtedly [Burges'] greatest work in ecclesiastical architecture", with an interior that is "overwhelming and intoxicating". Through his ability, careful leadership of his team, artistic control, and by vastly exceeding the intended budget, Burges produced a building which – though not much larger than a parish church – has been described as "a cathedral becoming such a city and one which posterity may regard as a monument to <a href="El%20Shaddai">the Almighty's praise</a>".

Mindful that the cathedral was unlikely to be finished in his lifetime, Burges produced comprehensive plans for its decoration and furnishing; recorded in his "Book of Furniture" and "Book of Designs". At the end of the 20th century, a major restoration of the cathedral, costing £5 million, was undertaken. This included the reinstatement and restoration of the twin trumpets held by the resurrection angel which had been vandalised in 1999. The restoration programme also saw the cleaning, repointing and repair of the exterior of the building, including the re-carving of some of Burges' <a href="gargoyle">gargoyle</a>s, where repair proved impracticable. The cathedral's heating system was also replaced, when it was found to be damaging the intricate mosaic floor.

In 2006, Lawrence and Wilson published the first detailed study of the cathedral's history and architecture. The cathedral is one of the three cathedrals of the Anglican <a href="Diocese%20of%20Cork%2C%20Cloyne%20and%20Ross">Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross</a>.

Notable interments in the graveyard include those of archbishop <a href="William%20Lyon%20%28bishop%29">William Lyon</a> (died 1617), <a href="Richard%20Boyle%20%28archbishop%29">Richard Boyle</a> (died 1644), and in a family vault, the first "Lady <a href="Freemason">Freemason</a>", <a href="Elizabeth%20Aldworth">Elizabeth Aldworth</a> (died ).

The cathedral's style is <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a>, Burges' preferred period which he used for his own home, <a href="The%20Tower%20House">The Tower House</a>, in London. He reused elements of the unsuccessful designs he had earlier produced for competitions for cathedrals at Lille and <a href="Cathedral%20of%20St%20Stephen%2C%20Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. The shell of the building is mostly <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, sourced from near Cork, with the interior walls formed from stone brought from <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>. The red marble came from <a href="Little%20Island%2C%20Cork">Little Island</a>, the purple-brown stone from <a href="Fermoy">Fermoy</a>.

Each of the three spires supports a <a href="Celtic%20cross">Celtic cross</a>, a reference to <a href="Saint%20Patrick">Saint Patrick</a>, seen as a foundational ancestor by both Irish Catholics and Protestants. This inclusion was an implicit statement of national identity, but was against Burges' wishes. His initial design included <a href="weather%20vane">weather vane</a>s, a choice rejected by the building committee, who, according to the historian Antóin O'Callaghan, wanted the church to "retain the continuity with the one true faith of the ancient past".

The spires had a troubled construction: it was a difficult build from a technical point of view and thus expensive to fund. The cost reached £40,000 early in the build, with a further £60,000 spent by the time the spires were in place. Along the way, a number of sub-contractors were hired and dismissed; the contract was eventually completed by the Cork builder John Delaney, hired in May 1876. By the end of the following year the main and two ancillary spires were complete.

An 1881 estimate by the local stonemason McLeod suggests that Burges provided around 844 sculptures, of which around 412 were for the interior. The total of some 1,260 sculptures include 32 gargoyles, each with different animal heads. Burges oversaw nearly all aspects of the design, headquartered in his office in Buckingham Street and on numerous site visits. Most modern scholars agree that his overarching control over the design of the architecture, statuary, stained glass and internal decorations, led to the cathedral's unity of style. He considered sculpture as an "indispensable attribute of architectural effect" and, at Saint Fin Barre's, believed he was engaged upon "a work which has not been attempted since the West front of <a href="Wells%20Cathedral">Wells Cathedral</a>". In the designs for the pieces decorating the cathedral, Burges worked closely with <a href="Thomas%20Nicholls%20%28sculptor%29">Thomas Nicholls</a>, who constructed each figure in plaster, and with McLeod and local stonemasons, who carved almost all of the sculptures "<a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>".

Burges' designs for the western façade were based on medieval French <a href="iconography">iconography</a>. He considered this front to be the most important exterior feature as it would be lit by the setting sun and thus the most dramatic. The theme is <a href="Last%20Judgment">The Last Judgement</a>, with representations of the twelve <a href="Apostles">Apostles</a> bearing instruments of their martyrdom, the <a href="Parable%20of%20the%20Ten%20Virgins">Wise and the Foolish Virgins</a>, the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">Resurrection of the Dead</a> and the <a href="Four%20Evangelists">Beasts of The Evangelists</a>.

The <a href="gilding">gilded</a> copper "resurrection angel" facing eastwards on the main spire is locally the cathedral's most iconic feature, and colloquially known as the "goldie angel". It was designed by Burges and erected in 1870 free of charge as his gift to the city, in recognition of Cork's willingness to fund his original design, and positioned in place of an intended wrought-iron cross.
The imagery of the tympanum is taken from the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>, with the divine on the upper register, and mortals below. It shows an angel, accompanied by <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a>, measuring the <a href="temple%20in%20Jerusalem">temple in Jerusalem</a>, while beneath them the dead rise from their graves. Of these sculptures, the Victorian critic <a href="Charles%20Eastlake">Charles Eastlake</a>, writing in "A History of the Gothic Revival", considered that "no finer examples of decorative sculpture have been produced during the Revival".

Burges found it difficult to realise some of his original images for the sculptures and stained glass panels; a number of them contained frontal nudes, including the designs for the creation of the planets, the figures of <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and Eve</a>, Christ in Glory, Our Lord as King Crucified, the dead rising from their graves, and the welcoming angels. In August 1868, some Protestant committee members, led by the chancellor, George Webster, rejected the use of images of the naked human body in ecclesiastical iconography, especially in images of Christ, and forced Burges to provide clothed designs, modesty-providing loin cloths, or strategically placed foliage or books. In frustration Burges wrote, "I am sorry to see Puritanism so rampant in Cork ... I wish we could transplant the building to England". His revised designs were reviewed in April and May 1869, but were again rejected. Both Gregg and the dean, Arthur Edwards supported Burges, and moved the decision from the general committee to a select <a href="vestry">vestry</a> sub-committee. Although Webster continued to object, the modified designs were finally approved.

The cathedral's <a href="Architectural%20plan">plan</a> is conventional; the west front is opened by three entrance doors leading to the <a href="nave">nave</a>, with internal vaulting, <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcade</a>, <a href="triforium">triforium</a> and <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a>, rising to a timber roof. Beyond the nave, the <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a>, <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a>, <a href="Cathedra">bishop's throne</a> and altar end in an <a href="ambulatory">ambulatory</a>. The small floor-plan drew criticism both at the time and in later years. The building is relatively short at 180 feet length, but contains all of the traditional elements of a cathedral of much greater size. A contemporary critic, Robert Rolt Brash, wrote; "the effect of this is to make the building look exceedingly short, and disproportionately high". Although modest in size, the compact design makes the most of the small footprint. The three spires allow the illusion of greater interior space.

Burges designed the majority of the interior, including the mosaic pavement, the altar, the pulpit and bishop's throne. The narrow and unusually high marble nave, from red and <a href="puce">puce</a> stone, is supported by large <a href="column">column</a>s supporting the central tower and spire. The exterior gives the impression of a large structure, which is at odds with the reduced size of the interior, where the choir, <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a> and ambulatory take up almost half of the floor-space. The interior is filled with colour, most especially from the stained glass windows. This aspect of the interior is in marked contrast to the uniform and austere grey of the exterior.
The cylindrical pulpit is located near the entrance and was completed in 1874, but not painted until 1935. Like the baptismal font, it is placed on four sculpted legs. It contains five stone <a href="relief">relief</a> figures, assumed to be the <a href="four%20evangelists">four evangelists</a>, and <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a> sitting on an upturned "pagan" altar, and a winged dragon below the reading stand. The baptismal font is located near the entrance. Its ledge is decorated with a carving of the head of <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>. The font's bowl is of Cork red marble, and supported by a stem, also red marble, a marble shaft of sculpted capitals, and an octagonal base. Brass lettering reads "We are buried with Him by baptism into death".

The <a href="lectern">lectern</a> (reading desk) is made of solid <a href="brass">brass</a>, from a design Burges had originally intended for Lille Cathedral. It is decorated with the heads of <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and <a href="King%20David">King David</a>. There is a "Heroes Column" (<a href="War%20Memorial">War Memorial</a>) by the <a href="Choir">Choir</a>, at the Dean's chapel. It contains the names of 400 men from the dioceses killed in battle during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. A processional cross, completed in 1974 by <a href="Patrick%20Pye">Patrick Pye</a>, is located in front of the Dean's chapel. The 46-foot 'Great Oak Throne' of the Cork Dioceses Bishop was installed in 1878, alongside a statue of Fin Barre of Cork and a kneeling angel.

Burges conceived the iconographical scheme for the stained glass windows, designed the individual panels for the each of the 74 windows, and oversaw every stage of their production. According to Maurice Carey, "in consequence, the windows have a consistent cohesive style and follow a logical sequence in subject matter". The panels were <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a>ed by <a href="Horatio%20Walter%20Lonsdale">H. W. Lonsdale</a> and manufactured in London between 1868 and 1869 by <a href="William%20Gualbert%20Saunders">William Gualbert Saunders</a>, who worked in Burges' office before forming his own firm of stained glass makers. Doctrinal objections to some of the figures, particularly of Christ, lead to a delay of four years, with their eventual installation between 1873 and 1881. Four windows remain incomplete. Lonsdale's cartoons are kept at the cathedral.
Many of the figures relate to Christian iconography, and echo those in the tympanum, including, in the ambulatory a window showing <a href="God%20the%20Father">God</a> as the King of Heaven overlooking the evangelists <a href="Matthew%20the%20Apostle">Matthew</a>, <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">Mark</a>, <a href="Luke%20the%20Evangelist">Luke</a> and <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">John</a>. In the panel, Matthew takes human form, Mark is depicted as a lion, Luke as an ox, while John takes the form of an eagle. As elsewhere in the cathedral, the illustrations can be divided between the divine, wise and foolish.

The scheme begins and ends with two <a href="rose%20window">rose window</a>s, at the west front and south <a href="transept">transept</a> respectively. The west rose window shows God as the creator resting on a rainbow and in the act of blessing. He is surrounded by eight compartments, each inspired by the scenes from <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>, beginning with the creation of light, and ending with the birth of <a href="Eve">Eve</a>, and <a href="Adam">Adam</a> naming the animals. The south transept rose window, known as the "Heavenly Hierarchies", places <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Christ the King</a> in the centre, with the compartments containing a series of <a href="angel">angel</a>s, <a href="archangel">archangel</a>s and <a href="cherubim">cherubim</a>. Separate glass sheets containing building tools are placed between each angelic compartment.

The nave windows contain <a href="signs%20of%20the%20Zodiac">signs of the Zodiac</a>. Each <a href="lancet%20arch">lancet</a> by the arcade contains a <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> panel. These scenes are mostly from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, while those from the transepts onward are of prophets who foretold Christ's coming, or from the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. The clerestory panels above the high altar depict Christ reigning from his cross alongside <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">His Mother</a>, John, the <a href="Three%20Marys">Three Marys</a> and various disciples. The windows around the ambulatory include scenes from the <a href="Life%20of%20Christ">Life of Christ</a>, culminating in a representation of heaven at worship from the Book of Revelation.

The <a href="organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> was built in 1870 by <a href="William%20Hill%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">William Hill & Sons</a>. It consisted of three <a href="Manual%20%28music%29">manuals</a>, over 4,500 pipes and 40 <a href="organ%20stop">stop</a>s. The main organ utilised a <a href="tubular-pneumatic%20action">tubular-pneumatic action</a>, with <a href="tracker%20action">tracker action</a> for the other two manuals. It was in place for the cathedral's grand opening on <a href="Saint%20Andrew%27s%20Day">Saint Andrew's Day</a>, 1870, and positioned in the west gallery, but moved to the north transept in 1889, to improve acoustics, maximise space, and avoid its interference with the view of the windows. That year, a 14-foot pit was dug in the floor beside the nave, as the new location for the organ.

Its maintenance has been one of the most expensive part of the cathedral's upkeep. It was overhauled in 1889 by the Cork firm, T.W. Magahy, who added three new stops. The organ was moved from the west gallery (balcony) down to a pit in the north transept, where it sits today. Most of the choir organ is housed in an enclosure attached to the console, the lid of which can be raised or lowered electrically by the organist. The next major overhaul was in 1906 by <a href="Hele%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Hele & Co</a>mpany of Plymouth, who added a fourth manual (the Solo). By this stage, the action of the organ was entirely pneumatic. In 1965–1966 <a href="J.%20W.%20Walker%20%26amp%3B%20Sons%20Ltd">J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd</a> of London overhauled the soundboards, installed a new console with <a href="electropneumatic%20action">electropneumatic action</a>, and lowered the pitch.

By 2010 the organ's electrics were unreliable. Trevor Crowe was employed to reconstruct and increase the number of pipes, and make tonal enhancements, including a 32′ extension to the pedal <a href="trombone">trombone</a>. The project cost €1.2m and took three years to complete.

Under the Bridge

"Under the Bridge" is a song by American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>. It is the eleventh track on the group's fifth studio album, "<a href="Blood%20Sugar%20Sex%20Magik">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a>", and was released as its second <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a> on March 10, 1992. Vocalist <a href="Anthony%20Kiedis">Anthony Kiedis</a> wrote the lyrics to express feelings of loneliness and despondency, and to reflect on narcotics and their <a href="Anthony%20Kiedis%23Drug%20addictions">impact on his life</a>. Kiedis was driving home from rehearsals when "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" was in pre-production and said he sang the lyrics to himself. Kiedis initially did not feel that "Under the Bridge" would fit into the Chili Peppers' repertoire, and was reluctant to show it to his bandmates until producer <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> implored him to do so. The rest of the band was receptive to the lyrics and wrote the music.

The song became a critical and commercial success, peaking at number two on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, behind "<a href="Jump%20%28Kris%20Kross%20song%29">Jump</a>" by <a href="Kris%20Kross">Kris Kross</a> and later receiving a <a href="RIAA%20certification">platinum</a> certification by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. The single's success was widened with the release of its accompanying video, which was frequently played on music television channels. It won the "Viewer's Choice Award" and "Breakthrough Video" at the <a href="1992%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">1992 MTV Video Music Awards</a>.

"Under the Bridge" helped the Red Hot Chili Peppers enter the mainstream. <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" said that the song "unexpectedly drop-kicked the band into the Top 10", while Philip Booth of "<a href="The%20Tampa%20Tribune">The Tampa Tribune</a>" commented that it was a "pretty, undulating, [and] by-now omnipresent single." Its success led in part to the departure of guitarist <a href="John%20Frusciante">John Frusciante</a>, who preferred the band to remain <a href="Underground%20music">underground</a>. The song has become an inspiration to other artists, and remains a seminal component of the <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> movement of the early and mid-1990s.

During the production of the <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>' 1991 album "<a href="Blood%20Sugar%20Sex%20Magik">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a>", producer Rick Rubin regularly visited singer <a href="Anthony%20Kiedis">Anthony Kiedis</a> to review Kiedis' new material. He found a poem titled "Under the Bridge" while flipping through Kiedis' notebook and instantly took an interest in the poignant lyrics. Rubin suggested that Kiedis show it to the rest of the band: "I thought it was beautiful. I said 'We've got to do this.'" Kiedis was reluctant, as he felt the poem was too emotional and did not fit the Chili Peppers' style. After singing the poem to guitarist <a href="John%20Frusciante">John Frusciante</a> and drummer <a href="Chad%20Smith">Chad Smith</a>, Kiedis recalls that they "got up and walked over to their instruments and started finding the beat and guitar chords to match it". Frusciante chose the chords he played in the introduction to balance out the depressing nature of the lyrics, saying "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so I thought if the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier".

For several days Frusciante and Kiedis worked on the song, and it became one of the few tracks written and completed prior to the band moving into <a href="The%20Mansion%20%28recording%20studio%29">The Mansion</a> where they recorded the album. After the song was recorded, Rubin felt the grand and epic <a href="Conclusion%20%28music%29">outro</a> would benefit from a large group of singers. Frusciante invited his mother, Gail, and her friends, all of whom sang in a choir, to perform.

Kiedis wrote much of the song's lyrics during a period when he felt distraught and emotionally drained. He had maintained sobriety for roughly three years and felt that this had distanced him from his bandmates. While the group worked on "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", Frusciante and Flea often smoked <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a> together, ignoring Kiedis, who felt that Frusciante was "no longer in [his] world." Driving home after rehearsal in April 1991, Kiedis thought of his heroin and cocaine addiction during his relationship with former girlfriend <a href="Ione%20Skye">Ione Skye</a>: "the loneliness that I was feeling triggered memories of my time with Ione and how I'd had this beautiful angel of a girl who was willing to give me all of her love, and instead of embracing that, I was downtown with fucking gangsters shooting <a href="speedball%20%28drug%29">speedballs</a> under a bridge."

Kiedis' feelings of alienation from his bandmates led him to feel that the city of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> was his only companion: "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the <a href="Hollywood%20Hills">Hollywood Hills</a> that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." The lines "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling "Rolling Stone" that "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", "the place" meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.

One of the most notable verses in the song discusses the harsh effects of drugs, their role in destroying many of Kiedis' relationships, and their impact on his happiness. Based on one of Kiedis' experiences, the verse of "Under the Bridge" illustrates his efforts to enter gang territory under a bridge to purchase drugs. Kiedis pretended that a sister of one of the gang members was his fiancée to be permitted inside. Although he successfully acquired the drugs, Kiedis considers this moment to be one of the worst of his life as it demonstrated the level to which he was willing to sink in order to feed his addiction. For over 20 years, Kiedis refused to acknowledge the location of the bridge, though he noted that it is in <a href="downtown%20Los%20Angeles">downtown Los Angeles</a>. Using clues provided by Kiedis in his autobiography "Scar Tissue", writer <a href="Mark%20Haskell%20Smith">Mark Haskell Smith</a> concluded that the bridge that inspired the song was located in the city's <a href="MacArthur%20Park">MacArthur Park</a>, this however contradicts Kiedis own assertion that the bridge was underneath a freeway. Other possible cited locations have included the <a href="Belmont%20Tunnel%20/%20Toluca%20Substation%20and%20Yard">Belmont Tunnel</a> about half a mile from MacArthur Park, and more recently, the overpass where Interstate Highway 10 (the <a href="Santa%20Monica%20Freeway">Santa Monica Freeway</a>) crosses over Hoover Street <a href="Pico-Union%2C%20Los%20Angeles">close to downtown L.A.</a>

"Under the Bridge" is performed in <a href="Time%20signature">4/4 time</a> in the key of E major. The intro changes between D and F# major chords before the first verse brings the song into E. The bridge and outro of the song modulate to A minor. The song marks an important shift in style for Kiedis, who had spent most of his career singing rapidly due to his limited ability to reach high notes. The song begins with Frusciante playing a moderately slow intro that the guitarist said drew heavily on the 1967 <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> song "<a href="Little%20Wing">Little Wing</a>". As Kiedis begins to sing, the guitar playing becomes more rapid until it reaches an E <a href="major%20seventh%20chord">major seventh chord</a> that halts the song; the silence is broken by drummer <a href="Chad%20Smith">Chad Smith</a>'s closed <a href="hi-hat">hi-hat</a> and <a href="cross%20stick">cross stick</a> struck at a moderately fast tempo. Frusciante borrowed the E major seventh chord technique from British guitarist <a href="Marc%20Bolan">Marc Bolan</a> of the <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> band <a href="T.%20Rex%20%28band%29">T. Rex</a>, who initially wrote it in the song "Rip Off" from the group's 1971 album "<a href="Electric%20Warrior">Electric Warrior</a>"; Frusciante lightheartedly noted that "I ripped off a song called 'Rip Off'. I thought that was interesting."

The song continues with another verse and subsequent chorus, when the bass finally enters. After the next verse an E major seven chord again marks a break before the start of the chorus. The second chorus transitions into a different verse, where Smith begins to play the drums, and Kiedis sings "Take me all the way/Yeah/Yeah-e-yeah/Oh no, no." After Kiedis cues "One time," a choir, whose presence was added to make the ending sound more epic, sings "Under the bridge downtown," in which Kiedis sings "Is where I drew some blood/I could not get enough/Forgot about my love/I gave my life away" in between. As the choir, Kiedis and drums stop, Frusciante and Flea play the outro until the song ends.

The first single off "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" was "<a href="Give%20It%20Away%20%28Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20song%29">Give It Away</a>", which reached number one on the "Billboard" <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart in late 1991.<ref name="Billboard singles">

Numerical weather prediction

Numerical weather prediction (NWP) uses <a href="mathematical%20model">mathematical model</a>s of the atmosphere and oceans to <a href="weather%20forecasting">predict the weather</a> based on current weather conditions. Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of <a href="computer%20simulation">computer simulation</a> in the 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results. A number of global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide, using current weather observations relayed from <a href="radiosonde">radiosonde</a>s, <a href="weather%20satellites">weather satellites</a> and other observing systems as inputs.

Mathematical models based on the same physical principles can be used to generate either short-term weather forecasts or longer-term climate predictions; the latter are widely applied for understanding and projecting <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. The improvements made to regional models have allowed for significant improvements in <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20track%20forecasting">tropical cyclone track</a> and <a href="air%20quality">air quality</a> forecasts; however, atmospheric models perform poorly at handling processes that occur in a relatively constricted area, such as <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>s.

Manipulating the vast datasets and performing the complex calculations necessary to modern numerical weather prediction requires some of the most powerful <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a>s in the world. Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the <a href="forecast%20skill">forecast skill</a> of numerical weather models extends to only about six days. Factors affecting the accuracy of numerical predictions include the density and quality of observations used as input to the forecasts, along with deficiencies in the numerical models themselves. Post-processing techniques such as <a href="model%20output%20statistics">model output statistics</a> (MOS) have been developed to improve the handling of errors in numerical predictions.

A more fundamental problem lies in the <a href="Chaos%20theory">chaotic</a> nature of the <a href="partial%20differential%20equation">partial differential equation</a>s that govern the atmosphere. It is impossible to solve these equations exactly, and small errors grow with time (doubling about every five days). Present understanding is that this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with perfectly accurate input data and a flawless model. In addition, the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with <a href="Parametrization%20%28climate%29">parameterizations</a> for <a href="solar%20radiation">solar radiation</a>, <a href="moist%20processes">moist processes</a> (clouds and <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a>), <a href="heat%20transfer">heat exchange</a>, soil, vegetation, surface water, and the effects of terrain. In an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions, <a href="ensemble%20forecasting">ensemble forecasts</a> have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast, and to obtain useful results farther into the future than otherwise possible. This approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models.

The <a href="history%20of%20numerical%20weather%20prediction">history of numerical weather prediction</a> began in the 1920s through the efforts of <a href="Lewis%20Fry%20Richardson">Lewis Fry Richardson</a>, who used procedures originally developed by <a href="Vilhelm%20Bjerknes">Vilhelm Bjerknes</a> to produce by hand a six-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. It was not until the advent of the computer and <a href="computer%20simulation">computer simulation</a>s that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself. The <a href="ENIAC">ENIAC</a> was used to create the first weather forecasts via computer in 1950, based on a highly simplified approximation to the atmospheric governing equations. In 1954, <a href="Carl-Gustav%20Rossby">Carl-Gustav Rossby</a>'s group at the <a href="Swedish%20Meteorological%20and%20Hydrological%20Institute">Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute</a> used the same model to produce the first operational forecast (i.e., a routine prediction for practical use). Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Navy">Navy</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Weather%20Bureau">Weather Bureau</a>. In 1956, <a href="Norm%20Phillips">Norman Phillips</a> developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere; this became the first successful <a href="climate%20model">climate model</a>. Following Phillips' work, several groups began working to create <a href="general%20circulation%20model">general circulation model</a>s. The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the <a href="NOAA">NOAA</a> <a href="Geophysical%20Fluid%20Dynamics%20Laboratory">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory</a>.

As computers have become more powerful, the size of the initial data sets has increased and <a href="Atmospheric%20model%23Types">newer atmospheric models</a> have been developed to take advantage of the added available computing power. These newer models include more physical processes in the simplifications of the <a href="Navier%E2%80%93Stokes%20equations">equations of motion</a> in numerical simulations of the atmosphere. In 1966, <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on <a href="primitive%20equations">primitive-equation models</a>, followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977. The development of limited area (regional) models facilitated advances in forecasting the tracks of <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>s as well as <a href="air%20quality">air quality</a> in the 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1980s models began to include the interactions of soil and vegetation with the atmosphere, which led to more realistic forecasts.

The output of forecast models based on <a href="atmospheric%20dynamics">atmospheric dynamics</a> is unable to resolve some details of the weather near the Earth's surface. As such, a statistical relationship between the output of a numerical weather model and the ensuing conditions at the ground was developed in the 1970s and 1980s, known as <a href="model%20output%20statistics">model output statistics</a> (MOS). Starting in the 1990s, model ensemble forecasts have been used to help define the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the future than otherwise possible.

The <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> is a <a href="fluid">fluid</a>. As such, the idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a> and <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The process of entering observation data into the model to generate <a href="initial%20value%20problem">initial conditions</a> is called "initialization". On land, terrain maps available at resolutions down to globally are used to help model atmospheric circulations within regions of rugged topography, in order to better depict features such as downslope winds, <a href="Lee%20wave">mountain wave</a>s and related cloudiness that affects incoming solar radiation. The main inputs from country-based weather services are observations from devices (called <a href="radiosonde">radiosonde</a>s) in weather balloons that measure various atmospheric parameters and transmits them to a fixed receiver, as well as from <a href="weather%20satellite">weather satellite</a>s. The <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in <a href="METAR">METAR</a> reports, or every six hours in <a href="SYNOP">SYNOP</a> reports. These observations are irregularly spaced, so they are processed by <a href="data%20assimilation">data assimilation</a> and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms. The data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast.
A variety of methods are used to gather observational data for use in numerical models. Sites launch radiosondes in weather balloons which rise through the <a href="troposphere">troposphere</a> and well into the <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a>. Information from weather satellites is used where traditional data sources are not available. Commerce provides <a href="pilot%20report">pilot report</a>s along aircraft routes and ship reports along shipping routes. Research projects use <a href="weather%20reconnaissance">reconnaissance aircraft</a> to fly in and around weather systems of interest, such as <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>s. Reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over the open oceans during the cold season into systems which cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance, or are expected to be of high impact from three to seven days into the future over the downstream continent. Sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971. Efforts to involve <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a> in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of the Pacific.

An atmospheric model is a computer program that produces <a href="meteorological">meteorological</a> information for future times at given locations and altitudes. Within any modern model is a set of equations, known as the <a href="primitive%20equations">primitive equations</a>, used to predict the future state of the atmosphere. These equations—along with the <a href="ideal%20gas%20law">ideal gas law</a>—are used to evolve the <a href="density">density</a>, <a href="pressure">pressure</a>, and <a href="potential%20temperature">potential temperature</a> <a href="scalar%20field">scalar field</a>s and the air <a href="velocity">velocity</a> (wind) <a href="vector%20field">vector field</a> of the atmosphere through time. Additional transport equations for pollutants and other <a href="aerosol">aerosol</a>s are included in some primitive-equation high-resolution models as well. The equations used are <a href="nonlinear%20system">nonlinear</a> partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods, with the exception of a few idealized cases. Therefore, numerical methods obtain approximate solutions. Different models use different solution methods: some global models and almost all regional models use <a href="finite%20difference%20method">finite difference method</a>s for all three spatial dimensions, while other global models and a few regional models use <a href="spectral%20method">spectral method</a>s for the horizontal dimensions and finite-difference methods in the vertical.

These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined. These rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future; the time increment for this prediction is called a "time step". This future atmospheric state is then used as the starting point for another application of the predictive equations to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time step into the future. This time stepping is repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain <a href="numerical%20stability">numerical stability</a>. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The <a href="UKMET">UKMET</a> <a href="Unified%20Model">Unified Model</a> is run six days into the future, while the <a href="European%20Centre%20for%20Medium-Range%20Weather%20Forecasts">European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts</a>' <a href="Integrated%20Forecast%20System">Integrated Forecast System</a> and <a href="Environment%20Canada">Environment Canada</a>'s <a href="Global%20Environmental%20Multiscale%20Model">Global Environmental Multiscale Model</a> both run out to ten days into the future, and the <a href="Global%20Forecast%20System">Global Forecast System</a> model run by the <a href="Environmental%20Modeling%20Center">Environmental Modeling Center</a> is run sixteen days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a <a href="prognostic%20chart">prognostic chart</a>, or "prog".

Some meteorological processes are too small-scale or too complex to be explicitly included in numerical weather prediction models. "<a href="Parameterization">Parameterization</a>" is a procedure for representing these processes by relating them to variables on the scales that the model resolves. For example, the gridboxes in weather and climate models have sides that are between and in length. A typical <a href="cumulus%20cloud">cumulus cloud</a> has a scale of less than , and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by the equations of fluid motion. Therefore, the processes that such <a href="cloud">cloud</a>s represent are parameterized, by processes of various sophistication. In the earliest models, if a column of air within a model gridbox was conditionally unstable (essentially, the bottom was warmer and moister than the top) and the water vapor content at any point within the column became saturated then it would be overturned (the warm, moist air would begin rising), and the air in that vertical column mixed. More sophisticated schemes recognize that only some portions of the box might <a href="convection">convect</a> and that <a href="Entrainment%20%28meteorology%29">entrainment</a> and other processes occur. Weather models that have gridboxes with sizes between can explicitly represent convective clouds, although they need to parameterize <a href="cloud%20microphysics">cloud microphysics</a> which occur at a smaller scale. The formation of large-scale (<a href="stratus%20cloud">stratus</a>-type) clouds is more physically based; they form when the <a href="relative%20humidity">relative humidity</a> reaches some prescribed value. Sub-grid scale processes need to be taken into account. Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the <a href="cloud%20fraction">cloud fraction</a> can be related to a critical value of relative humidity less than 100%, reflecting the sub grid scale variation that occurs in the real world.

The amount of solar radiation reaching the ground, as well as the formation of cloud droplets occur on the molecular scale, and so they must be parameterized before they can be included in the model. <a href="Drag%20%28physics%29">Atmospheric drag</a> produced by mountains must also be parameterized, as the limitations in the resolution of <a href="elevation">elevation</a> contours produce significant underestimates of the drag. This method of parameterization is also done for the surface flux of energy between the ocean and the atmosphere, in order to determine realistic sea surface temperatures and type of sea ice found near the ocean's surface. Sun angle as well as the impact of multiple cloud layers is taken into account. Soil type, vegetation type, and soil moisture all determine how much radiation goes into warming and how much moisture is drawn up into the adjacent atmosphere, and thus it is important to parameterize their contribution to these processes. Within air quality models, parameterizations take into account atmospheric emissions from multiple relatively tiny sources (e.g. roads, fields, factories) within specific grid boxes.

The horizontal <a href="Domain%20of%20a%20function">domain of a model</a> is either "global", covering the entire Earth, or "regional", covering only part of the Earth. Regional models (also known as "limited-area" models, or LAMs) allow for the use of finer grid spacing than global models because the available computational resources are focused on a specific area instead of being spread over the globe. This allows regional models to resolve explicitly smaller-scale meteorological phenomena that cannot be represented on the coarser grid of a global model. Regional models use a global model to specify conditions at the edge of their domain (<a href="boundary%20condition">boundary condition</a>s) in order to allow systems from outside the regional model domain to move into its area. Uncertainty and errors within regional models are introduced by the global model used for the boundary conditions of the edge of the regional model, as well as errors attributable to the regional model itself.

Horizontal position may be expressed directly in <a href="geographic%20coordinates">geographic coordinates</a> (<a href="latitude">latitude</a> and <a href="longitude">longitude</a>) for global models or in a <a href="map%20projection">map projection</a> <a href="planar%20coordinates">planar coordinates</a> for regional models. The German weather service is using for its global <a href="https%3A//www.dwd.de/EN/research/weatherforecasting/num_modelling/01_num_weather_prediction_modells/icon_description.html">ICON model</a> (icosahedral non-hydrostatic global circulation model) a grid based on a <a href="Icosahedron">regular icosahedron</a>. Basic cells in this grid are triangles instead of the four corner cells in a traditional latitude-longitude grid.
The advantage is that, different from a latitude-longitude cells are everywhere on the globe the same size. Disadvantage is that equations in this non rectangular grid are more complicated.

The vertical coordinate is handled in various ways. Lewis Fry Richardson's 1922 model used geometric height (formula_1) as the vertical coordinate. Later models substituted the geometric formula_1 coordinate with a pressure coordinate system, in which the <a href="geopotential%20height">geopotential height</a>s of constant-pressure surfaces become <a href="dependent%20variable">dependent variable</a>s, greatly simplifying the primitive equations. This correlation between coordinate systems can be made since pressure decreases with height through the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>. The first model used for operational forecasts, the single-layer barotropic model, used a single pressure coordinate at the 500-millibar (about ) level, and thus was essentially two-dimensional. High-resolution models—also called "mesoscale models"—such as the <a href="Weather%20Research%20and%20Forecasting%20model">Weather Research and Forecasting model</a> tend to use normalized pressure coordinates referred to as <a href="sigma%20coordinates">sigma coordinates</a>. This coordinate system receives its name from the <a href="independent%20variable">independent variable</a> formula_3 used to <a href="nondimensionalization">scale</a> atmospheric pressures with respect to the pressure at the surface, and in some cases also with the pressure at the top of the domain.

Because forecast models based upon the equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions, statistical methods have been developed to attempt to correct the forecasts. Statistical models were created based upon the three-dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models, surface observations and the climatological conditions for specific locations. These statistical models are collectively referred to as <a href="model%20output%20statistics">model output statistics</a> (MOS), and were developed by the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> for their suite of weather forecasting models in the late 1960s.

Model output statistics differ from the "perfect prog" technique, which assumes that the output of numerical weather prediction guidance is perfect. MOS can correct for local effects that cannot be resolved by the model due to insufficient grid resolution, as well as model biases. Because MOS is run after its respective global or regional model, its production is known as post-processing. Forecast parameters within MOS include maximum and minimum temperatures, percentage chance of rain within a several hour period, precipitation amount expected, chance that the precipitation will be frozen in nature, chance for thunderstorms, cloudiness, and surface winds.

In 1963, <a href="Edward%20Lorenz">Edward Lorenz</a> discovered the <a href="chaos%20theory">chaotic nature</a> of the <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a> equations involved in weather forecasting. Extremely small errors in temperature, winds, or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days, making it impossible for long-range forecasts—those made more than two weeks in advance—to predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of <a href="forecast%20skill">forecast skill</a>. Furthermore, existing observation networks have poor coverage in some regions (for example, over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean), which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere. While a set of equations, known as the <a href="Liouville%27s%20theorem%20%28Hamiltonian%29">Liouville equations</a>, exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization, the equations are too complex to run in real-time, even with the use of supercomputers. These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about five or six days into the future.

<a href="Edward%20Epstein%20%28meteorologist%29">Edward Epstein</a> recognized in 1969 that the atmosphere could not be completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an <a href="Ensemble%20%28fluid%20mechanics%29">ensemble</a> of <a href="stochastic%20process">stochastic</a> <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20method">Monte Carlo simulations</a> to produce <a href="arithmetic%20mean">means</a> and <a href="variance">variance</a>s for the state of the atmosphere. Although this early example of an ensemble showed skill, in 1974 <a href="Cecil%20Leith">Cecil Leith</a> showed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble <a href="probability%20distribution">probability distribution</a> was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the atmosphere.

Since the 1990s, "ensemble forecasts" have been used operationally (as routine forecasts) to account for the stochastic nature of weather processes – that is, to resolve their inherent uncertainty. This method involves analyzing multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model by using different physical <a href="parametrization%20%28climate%29">parametrizations</a> or varying initial conditions. Starting in 1992 with <a href="Ensemble%20forecasting">ensemble forecasts</a> prepared by the <a href="European%20Centre%20for%20Medium-Range%20Weather%20Forecasts">European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts</a> (ECMWF) and the <a href="National%20Centers%20for%20Environmental%20Prediction">National Centers for Environmental Prediction</a>, model ensemble forecasts have been used to help define the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the future than otherwise possible. The ECMWF model, the Ensemble Prediction System, uses <a href="Singular%20value%20decomposition">singular vectors</a> to simulate the initial <a href="probability%20density%20function">probability density</a>, while the NCEP ensemble, the Global Ensemble Forecasting System, uses a technique known as <a href="Bred%20vector">vector breeding</a>. The UK <a href="Met%20Office">Met Office</a> runs global and regional ensemble forecasts where perturbations to initial conditions are produced using a <a href="Kalman%20filter">Kalman filter</a>. There are 24 ensemble members in the Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS).

In a single model-based approach, the ensemble forecast is usually evaluated in terms of an average of the individual forecasts concerning one forecast variable, as well as the degree of agreement between various forecasts within the ensemble system, as represented by their overall spread. Ensemble spread is diagnosed through tools such as <a href="spaghetti%20plot">spaghetti diagrams</a>, which show the dispersion of one quantity on prognostic charts for specific time steps in the future. Another tool where ensemble spread is used is a <a href="meteogram">meteogram</a>, which shows the dispersion in the forecast of one quantity for one specific location. It is common for the ensemble spread to be too small to include the weather that actually occurs, which can lead to forecasters misdiagnosing model uncertainty; this problem becomes particularly severe for forecasts of the weather about ten days in advance. When ensemble spread is small and the forecast solutions are consistent within multiple model runs, forecasters perceive more confidence in the ensemble mean, and the forecast in general. Despite this perception, a "spread-skill relationship" is often weak or not found, as spread-error <a href="Correlation%20and%20dependence%23Correlation%20and%20linearity">correlations</a> are normally less than 0.6, and only under special circumstances range between 0.6–0.7. The relationship between ensemble spread and <a href="forecast%20skill">forecast skill</a> varies substantially depending on such factors as the forecast model and the region for which the forecast is made.

In the same way that many forecasts from a single model can be used to form an ensemble, multiple models may also be combined to produce an ensemble forecast. This approach is called "multi-model ensemble forecasting", and it has been shown to improve forecasts when compared to a single model-based approach. Models within a multi-model ensemble can be adjusted for their various biases, which is a process known as "superensemble forecasting". This type of forecast significantly reduces errors in model output.

<a href="Air%20pollution%20forecasting">Air quality forecasting</a> attempts to predict when the concentrations of pollutants will attain levels that are hazardous to public health. The concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere is determined by their "transport", or <a href="Arithmetic%20mean">mean</a> velocity of movement through the atmosphere, their <a href="diffusion">diffusion</a>, <a href="chemical%20transformation">chemical transformation</a>, and ground <a href="Deposition%20%28aerosol%20physics%29">deposition</a>. In addition to pollutant source and terrain information, these models require data about the state of the <a href="fluid%20flow">fluid flow</a> in the atmosphere to determine its transport and diffusion. Meteorological conditions such as <a href="thermal%20inversion">thermal inversion</a>s can prevent surface air from rising, trapping pollutants near the surface, which makes accurate forecasts of such events crucial for air quality modeling. Urban air quality models require a very fine computational mesh, requiring the use of high-resolution mesoscale weather models; in spite of this, the quality of numerical weather guidance is the main uncertainty in air quality forecasts.

A General Circulation Model (GCM) is a <a href="mathematical%20model">mathematical model</a> that can be used in computer simulations of the global circulation of a planetary <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> or ocean. An atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) is essentially the same as a global numerical weather prediction model, and some (such as the one used in the UK Unified Model) can be configured for both short-term weather forecasts and longer-term climate predictions. Along with <a href="sea%20ice">sea ice</a> and land-surface components, AGCMs and oceanic GCMs (OGCM) are key components of global climate models, and are widely applied for understanding the <a href="climate">climate</a> and projecting <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. For aspects of climate change, a range of man-made chemical emission scenarios can be fed into the climate models to see how an enhanced <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a> would modify the Earth's climate. Versions designed for climate applications with time scales of decades to centuries were originally created in 1969 by <a href="Syukuro%20Manabe">Syukuro Manabe</a> and <a href="Kirk%20Bryan%20%28oceanographer%29">Kirk Bryan</a> at the <a href="Geophysical%20Fluid%20Dynamics%20Laboratory">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>. When run for multiple decades, computational limitations mean that the models must use a coarse grid that leaves smaller-scale interactions unresolved.

The transfer of energy between the wind blowing over the surface of an ocean and the ocean's upper layer is an important element in wave dynamics. The <a href="spectral%20wave%20transport%20equation">spectral wave transport equation</a> is used to describe the change in wave spectrum over changing topography. It simulates wave generation, wave movement (propagation within a fluid), <a href="wave%20shoaling">wave shoaling</a>, <a href="refraction">refraction</a>, energy transfer between waves, and wave dissipation. Since surface winds are the primary forcing mechanism in the spectral wave transport equation, ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from the atmosphere into the layer at the surface of the ocean. Along with dissipation of energy through <a href="Wind%20wave">whitecaps</a> and <a href="resonance">resonance</a> between waves, surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of the state of the sea surface.

Tropical cyclone forecasting also relies on data provided by numerical weather models. Three main classes of <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20forecast%20model">tropical cyclone guidance models</a> exist: Statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that is not based on the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.

In 1978, the first <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20forecast%20model">hurricane-tracking model</a> based on <a href="Atmospheric%20dynamics%23Dynamic%20meteorology">atmospheric dynamics</a>—the movable fine-mesh (MFM) model—began operating. Within the field of <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20track%20forecasting">tropical cyclone track forecasting</a>, despite the ever-improving dynamical model guidance which occurred with increased computational power, it was not until the 1980s when numerical weather prediction showed <a href="Forecast%20skill">skill</a>, and until the 1990s when it consistently outperformed <a href="statistical%20model">statistical</a> or simple dynamical models. Predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge, since statistical methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance.

On a molecular scale, there are two main competing reaction processes involved in the degradation of <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, or wood fuels, in <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>s. When there is a low amount of moisture in a cellulose fiber, <a href="volatilization">volatilization</a> of the fuel occurs; this process will generate intermediate gaseous products that will ultimately be the source of <a href="combustion">combustion</a>. When moisture is present—or when enough heat is being carried away from the fiber, <a href="charring">charring</a> occurs. The <a href="chemical%20kinetics">chemical kinetics</a> of both reactions indicate that there is a point at which the level of moisture is low enough—and/or heating rates high enough—for combustion processes become self-sufficient. Consequently, changes in wind speed, direction, moisture, temperature, or <a href="lapse%20rate">lapse rate</a> at different levels of the atmosphere can have a significant impact on the behavior and growth of a wildfire. Since the wildfire acts as a heat source to the atmospheric flow, the wildfire can modify local <a href="advection">advection</a> patterns, introducing a <a href="Feedback">feedback loop</a> between the fire and the atmosphere.

A simplified two-dimensional model for the spread of wildfires that used <a href="convection">convection</a> to represent the effects of wind and terrain, as well as <a href="Thermal%20radiation">radiative heat transfer</a> as the dominant method of heat transport led to <a href="reaction-diffusion%20system">reaction-diffusion system</a>s of <a href="partial%20differential%20equation">partial differential equation</a>s. More complex models join numerical weather models or <a href="computational%20fluid%20dynamics">computational fluid dynamics</a> models with a wildfire component which allow the feedback effects between the fire and the atmosphere to be estimated. The additional complexity in the latter class of models translates to a corresponding increase in their computer power requirements. In fact, a full three-dimensional treatment of <a href="combustion">combustion</a> via <a href="direct%20numerical%20simulation">direct numerical simulation</a> at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling is not currently practical because of the excessive computational cost such a simulation would require. Numerical weather models have limited forecast skill at spatial resolutions under , forcing complex wildfire models to parameterize the fire in order to calculate how the winds will be modified locally by the wildfire, and to use those modified winds to determine the rate at which the fire will spread locally. Although models such as <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos</a>' FIRETEC solve for the concentrations of fuel and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the combustion reaction, so approximations must be made for the temperature distribution within each grid cell, as well as for the combustion reaction rates themselves.

Kenora Thistles

The Kenora Thistles, officially the Thistles Hockey Club, were a Canadian <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> team based in <a href="Kenora">Kenora</a>, Ontario. Founded in 1894, they were originally known as the Rat Portage Thistles. The team competed for the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>, the ice hockey championship of Canada, five times between 1903 and 1907. The Thistles won the Cup in January 1907 and defended it once before losing it that March in a <a href="List%20of%20Stanley%20Cup%20challenge%20games">challenge series</a>. Composed almost entirely of local players, the team comes from the least populated city to have won the Stanley Cup. Nine players—four of them homegrown—have been inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>, and the Stanley Cup champion team was inducted into the <a href="Northwestern%20Ontario%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame</a>.

Though Kenora is in Ontario, the Thistles competed in <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>-based leagues throughout their existence, owing to the city's proximity to that province. The team joined the <a href="Manitoba%20Hockey%20Association">Manitoba Hockey Association</a> (MHA) in 1902, winning the league championship in three of their six seasons. They were idealized "as a team of hometown boys who used to play shinny together on the streets of Rat Portage". The Thistles were unable to cope with the advent of professionalism in ice hockey during the early 1900s. This combined with an economic downturn in 1907, and being unable to sustain their success, the team disbanded in 1908. The name "Thistles" has been used since for several senior, minor, and junior Kenora teams.

In 1836 the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> established a <a href="factory%20%28trading%20post%29">factory (trading post)</a> north of the current city of Kenora. They named it Rat Portage, a translation of the <a href="Ojibwe%20language">Ojibwe language</a>-name for the region: "Waszush Onigum", which literally means "the road to the country of the <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>". Around 1850 gold was discovered in the region, and the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> reached it in 1877. A sawmill was established in 1880. The town was incorporated in 1882, originally within the province of <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>. Located near the Manitoba–<a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> provincial border, the region was contested by both provinces until the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a> ruled in favour of Ontario in 1884. Its closer proximity to <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, away, and the rest of Manitoba, meant Rat Portage had closer ties with the west than with the rest of Ontario, where the closest city was <a href="Port%20Arthur%2C%20Ontario">Port Arthur</a> (now Thunder Bay), away.

With the railroad connecting Rat Portage to Central and Eastern Canada, the town grew quickly, going from only a few people before the railway link, to 5,202 in 1901 and 6,257 by 1908. The town grew to support several industries, mainly lumber, mining, and fishing but also milling, power development and tourism. An <a href="ice%20rink">ice rink</a> called the Princess Rink was built in 1886. It was replaced in 1897 by the Victoria Rink which had more seats (1,000) and a larger ice surface. The town's name was changed on May 11, 1905, to Kenora, which was derived from the first letters of the three neighbouring municipalities: Keewatin, Norman, and Rat Portage. The change occurred due to the establishment of a new flour mill in town; sports historian John Wong has suggested that local businessmen felt the name Rat Portage would not encourage sales of flour.

The first recorded ice hockey game played in Rat Portage was on February 17, 1893, organized by the Hardisty brothers, who had recently moved from Winnipeg to take part in a minor gold rush in the region. A club was formed in 1894, with a contest held to name it; the winning entry, "Thistles", was chosen by Bill Dunsmore, a carpenter with Scottish heritage. George Dewey, one of the wealthiest people in the town, donated the initial funds for the team. In recognition he was named the club's honorary president. Most of the players were from wealthy families or independently wealthy. They had the means to both take time off work to play and cover the considerable expenses associated with ice hockey.

The club had no owner or financial backer and, apart from Dewey's initial donation, local businesses never supported it financially. It was a community effort, with officers elected to make decisions for the club. As a result, the club was strained financially and would be throughout their existence. In March 1894 they successfully hosted a benefit concert to raise funds. Though a similar attempt the following year did not bring in as much money, concerts were held yearly until 1903.

Initially, the games were played within the club, but the players quickly grew tired of this. In 1894 the team was admitted to the Manitoba and Northwest Hockey Association, and entered the second-tier intermediate level. Though based in Ontario, the Thistles joined the Manitoba league because they were geographically closer to its teams. In their first season they won twelve games, showing they could easily compete at that level.

In January 1896 a game was held in Kenora between the senior team and a junior-aged team, with players aged 12–16. The junior players, many of whom were related to players on the senior team, felt they could compete with the older team, and subsequently won, easily defeating their opponents. In a 1953 newspaper article on the match Lowry Johnston, who was on the senior team, explained, "They were just too fast for us." A legend developed that the senior team quit hockey after that match, letting the junior players take their place in the Manitoba league. While this may not have happened as quickly as suggested, many of the players from the junior team soon joined the senior team and would hold major roles on the Thistles.

Bolstered by the younger players, the Thistles finished second in the Manitoba intermediate league in 1899–00. They won the league title in 1900–01, greatly outscoring their opponents. When the team started the 1901–02 season with a lopsided 12–0 victory, the club's executives became concerned. They felt if the games were not competitive people would not come to watch them, resulting in less revenue. Believing the team was strong enough to move up, they applied to join the senior Manitoba Hockey Association, which had two teams that season, both in Winnipeg: the <a href="Winnipeg%20Victorias">Victorias</a> and the <a href="Winnipeg%20Rowing%20Club">Winnipeg Rowing Club</a>. To prove they could compete, the Thistles played an exhibition match against the Victorias, one of the best teams in Canada, and a previous winner of the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>, the championship trophy of ice hockey in Canada. The Thistles fared well in the match, but the two Winnipeg teams decided against allowing them to join the league, arguing the Thistles applied too late in the season. Returning to the intermediate league, the Thistles, weakened by injuries to several players, finished in a tie for second overall. After the season ended <a href="Tommy%20Phillips">Tommy Phillips</a>, one of the best players on the Thistles, moved to Montreal to attend <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a>.

Before the 1902–03 season the Thistles were admitted to the senior league, along with the <a href="Brandon%20Wheat%20Cities">Brandon Wheat Cities</a> and the <a href="Portage%20la%20Prairie%20Plains">Portage la Prairie Plains</a>. The two Winnipeg teams, still concerned about the distance to Rat Portage, opposed their inclusion (and that of Portage la Prairie), stating they would only play against Brandon, the winner of the intermediate championship in 1902. Thus, the two Winnipeg clubs left the league before the start of the season and formed their own two-team league, the Western Canada Hockey League. Playing in the new three-team senior league, the Thistles won the championship and were allowed to issue a challenge for the Stanley Cup, held at the time by the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators%20%28original%29">Ottawa Hockey Club</a> (also known as the Senators).

For the 1903–04 season the Thistles competed again in the three-team Manitoba league. Prior to the season, the team was invited to join the Western Canada Hockey League, which still had only the two Winnipeg clubs. While they had downplayed the Thistles' importance before, the Winnipeg clubs were impressed by their play during the Stanley Cup challenge and considered it financially viable to add the team. The Thistles declined the offer and remained in the Manitoba league. Brandon won the league championship, and earned the chance to compete for the Cup against Ottawa, who won the series and retained it.

Before the <a href="1904%E2%80%9305%20MHA%20season">1904–05 season</a> the two Manitoba leagues merged to become the Manitoba Hockey Association. The Thistles were bolstered by the presence of Tommy Phillips (who had returned to visit his dying father) and goaltender <a href="Eddie%20Giroux">Eddie Giroux</a>, the only player not from Rat Portage. Giroux moved from <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> with the promise of a job in the lumber industry and for a chance to play ice hockey. The Thistles easily won the league championship, and again challenged Ottawa for the Stanley Cup.

Donated in 1892 by <a href="Frederick%20Stanley%2C%2016th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Stanley of Preston</a>, the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a>, the Stanley Cup was originally awarded to the top amateur team in Canada, who would then accept challenges from the winners of other leagues. From its inception until 1912, the Cup was nearly always won by teams from Montreal, Winnipeg, and Ottawa. In 1903 Ottawa won the Cup, after finishing the <a href="1903%20CAHL%20season">season</a> tied for first in the <a href="Canadian%20Amateur%20Hockey%20League">Canadian Amateur Hockey League</a> with the <a href="Montreal%20Victorias">Montreal Victorias</a>. They played a two-game, total-goal series for the league championship. The <a href="Montreal%20Hockey%20Club">Montreal Hockey Club</a>, who had held the Cup, finished third in the league and therefore lost the right to keep it.

The Thistles travelled to Ottawa for the two-game series to be decided on total goals scored. Relatively unknown outside Manitoba and Western Ontario, there was little press coverage of the team before the start of the series. Attendance at the games was rather low as the series coincided with an opening session of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">Canadian Parliament</a>, which was a social affair at the time. While the matches between Ottawa and Montreal, held just days earlier, attracted around 3,000 spectators, the Thistles' games saw 1,500 and then 1,000 viewers. Ottawa won the first game 6–2, media summaries suggesting the Thistles were nervous and unprepared for Ottawa's skilled play. Ottawa won the second match 4–2 and retained the Cup. Though the press credited the Thistles for being vastly improved, they felt that overall the team lacked "the finer points of the game".

The Thistles had a mixed reaction to their first Stanley Cup challenge. Small crowds made it a financial failure; the team lost about <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>800, a considerable sum at the time. It was still seen as an important step for the team, as it showed they could compete with the best teams in Canada. Team <a href="Captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">captain</a> <a href="Tom%20Hooper%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Tom Hooper</a> said that while they "were comparatively inexperienced, and ... consequently a little nervous", they were "not in the least discouraged" and planned to "be better qualified to play them when [they] come after the puck next year".

The Cup challenge was again played in Ottawa, this time in a best-of-three series. Media reports about the Thistles were more positive than those of 1903, the team being regarded as a strong chance for the Cup. Attendance for the series was considerable; the games attracted between 3,500 and 4,000 spectators, and hundreds more waiting outside for entry. There were also thousands across Canada who eagerly waited in newspaper offices and other venues for live telegraph reports on the games. Newspaper reports made a point of mentioning the home-grown nature of the team as some of them had begun to use professionals.

The Thistles won the first match 9–3, using a new style of play. With forward passing forbidden in ice hockey, conventional strategy was for teams to shoot the puck into the opposing end and skate after it (thereby losing possession of the puck). Instead, as the moved forward, the Thistles emphasised skating and passing the puck back and forth keeping control of it. This strategy was aided by their point and cover-point men (early names for <a href="defencemen">defencemen</a>) who lined up on the ice side-by-side rather than one in front of the other as was common. Ottawa came back to win the remaining games, 4–2 and 5–4, and retained the Cup. Though the Thistles lost the challenge, they were praised, newspapers noting the players' speed in particular. The "<a href="Montreal%20Star">Montreal Star</a>" claimed the Thistles were not only the fastest team from the west to challenge for the Cup, but the fastest "ever ... seen anywhere on ice". Before heading home after the series, the team played exhibition matches in Montreal and Toronto attracting thousands of spectators.

The <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20MHA%20season">1905–06 season</a> saw Kenora (as the town had been renamed) easily win the championship, setting up another challenge for the Cup, scheduled for January 1907. Due to fears that teams were covertly paying their players, the Winnipeg Rowing Club, which had been expected to play in the MHA, withdrew. As ardent followers of amateurism (Canadian sporting rules made anyone who played against a professional a professional as well) the club could not take part and had been replaced by the Winnipeg Hockey Club. The other league teams denied paying players, the Thistles calling the accusations "ridiculous". Despite these denials, it is quite likely there were paid players in the league. Sports historian R.S. Lappage has noted that by this point "it was generally recognized that most eastern teams were paying their players, and it would be reasonable to expect that teams of the M.H.L. ... had to pay their star players to retain their services". As early as 1903 financial offers had been made to players from the <a href="International%20Professional%20Hockey%20League">International Hockey League</a> based in Michigan—the first openly professional ice hockey league in the world.

Before the start of the <a href="1906%E2%80%9307%20MPHL%20season">1906–07 season</a> the issue of professionalism came up again for the Manitoba league. While most of the league's teams felt it should turn professional, the two Winnipeg teams (the Victorias and Winnipeg Hockey Club) were against this move and left the league. Though the league was now openly professional, the Thistles continued to remain a homegrown team, despite rumours before the season there would be a major overhaul of the roster.

To accommodate the Thistles' challenge against the Wanderers in January, which saw the team gone for nearly a month, modifications to the regular season schedule had to be made. As the Thistles were a popular team and likely to draw large crowds, the other teams wanted a double round-robin format—two home games, two away games against each team. The Thistles were against this, and only wanted to play one home and one away game against the others, as they would be gone for nearly a month for their Cup challenge. Ultimately a compromise was reached. The Thistles would play one home and away game, while the other three teams would play two home and two away. Since this would lead to an unbalanced schedule (the Thistles would have played six games while the other teams had played ten), scores in the games not including the Thistles would be combined for the purposes of the league standings, so all teams would be credited with six games played.

As the 1906 champions of the Manitoba league Kenora earned the right to challenge for the Stanley Cup, which was held by the <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Montreal Wanderers</a>, but the season ended too late for the series to be held that year. It was postponed until January 1907, during the league's regular season play.

The Thistles left for Montreal and the Cup challenge on January 12, 1907. Taking advantage of the new professionalism of their league, the club hired <a href="Art%20Ross">Art Ross</a>, and <a href="Joe%20Hall">Joe Hall</a> from Brandon, considered two of the best players in the Manitoba league. It is unclear how much they were paid for the series, but ice hockey historian Eric Zweig has speculated the amount was substantial (though Hall did not play any games for the Thistles). This marked the first time the Thistles had paid players on the team and confirmed their status as a professional club. The Wanderers, by contrast, had five professional players and four amateurs on their roster. The <a href="Eastern%20Canada%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association</a> (ECAHA), the Wanderers' league, allowed professionals beginning in the <a href="1907%20ECAHA%20season">1906–07</a> season as long as each players' status was defined by the team.

Though the Thistles hired two professional players, the media again emphasized the team consisted mainly of local amateurs, and noted the Wanderers had hired multiple professional players, most notably <a href="Hod%20Stuart">Hod Stuart</a>, who had played previously for the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Professionals">Pittsburgh Professionals</a>. Even so, the consensus was that the Thistles were the favourites to win the Cup. The first game of the two-game, total-goal series was held on January 17 in Montreal. Tommy Phillips scored all four Kenora goals in a 4–2 victory. The second game, on January 21, saw him record a further three goals, as Kenora won 8–6, giving them a 12–8 series win and the Stanley Cup. Following tradition, the Thistles had their name <a href="Chronology%20of%20Stanley%20Cup%20engravings">engraved on the Cup</a>. Unlike previous winners who wrote on the side of the bowl, the Thistles had "Thistles of Kenora 12 Wanderers 8 / Montreal Jan 17th & 21st 1907" engraved inside it.

On their return to Kenora later in January, the Thistles were warmly received; a reception at the Opera House saw each player given a commemorative cup by the city, among other gifts. The team's dire financial situation meant that an admission was charged for the celebratory banquet, unusual for similar events at the time. There were signs of improved finances, though. The owners of the Victoria Rink where the team played, stated their intention to build a 4,000 to replacement rink. This would have made it the largest rink west of Ontario and dwarf the Victoria Rink. This was suggested as a solution to the team's financial issues since they would earn a portion of each ticket sold.

Almost immediately after the Thistles won the Stanley Cup the Wanderers, who had won the ECAHA championship, issued a challenge for a re-match; <a href="William%20Foran">William Foran</a>, one of the Cup's trustees, told the Thistles they first had to win the Manitoba league title. Brandon and the Thistles finished in a tie for first, so a two-game total-goal series was played to decide the league championship; Kenora won both games, 8–6 and 4–1. Though this series determined who would play the Wanderers for the Cup, it was not initially regarded as a challenge series and only later confirmed as such by Cup trustees.

The Thistles signed three new players, as the league season and Cup challenge had seen regular players—Hooper, <a href="Billy%20McGimsie">Billy McGimsie</a>, and Phillips— sidelined by injuries. <a href="Fred%20Whitcroft">Fred Whitcroft</a>, who had played in <a href="Peterborough%2C%20Ontario">Peterborough, Ontario</a>, was signed for the rest of the season for a reported $700. To further bolster the team for the Cup challenge, the Thistles signed <a href="Alf%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Alf Smith</a> and <a href="Rat%20Westwick">Harry "Rat" Westwick</a>, both from the Ottawa Hockey Club; each player made their debut in the league's final season game and played in the series against Brandon. Smith and Westwick's signings drew protests from the Wanderers. They argued that since they spent the entire season with Ottawa in the ECAHA they should not be eligible to play for Kenora, as players had to play the full season with their team. The Thistles countered by arguing that the Wanderers brought in Hod Stuart and <a href="Riley%20Hern">Riley Hern</a> back in January. Foran defended the choice to allow Stuart, noting there had been no protest in January, and said that since Stuart and Hern spent the season with the Wanderers they were eligible.

A further issue arose when Foran told the Thistles that owing to the larger arena in Winnipeg, providing greater revenue from ticket sales, the series would be played in Winnipeg, not Kenora. It would begin the day after the Thistles finished their series with Brandon and would be a best-of three-game series. The Thistles were irate. They wanted to host the series, have a three-day break before it, and play a two-game, total-goal series. They discussed the matter with the Wanderers, and both agreed instead to a two-game series in Winnipeg, and that Kenora could use both Smith and Westwick. Foran consented to this arrangement.

With the details of the series settled, the first game was held on March 23, which the Wanderers won 7–2. The Thistles won the second match, on March 25, 6–5, but lost the series 12 goals to 8. Reports on the Thistles in the media noted how reliant the team was on their three imported players and that they could no longer be portrayed as a homegrown team. The Thistles' time as Stanley Cup champions ended after two months.

After losing the Stanley Cup, there were major changes to the Thistles' composition. <a href="Roxy%20Beaudro">Roxy Beaudro</a>, Eddie Geroux, and Billy McGimsie retired before the 1907–08 season, while Tommy Phillips joined the Ottawa Hockey Club after being offered $1,500 for the season. The team brought up four junior players, all under twenty years old, and were not expected to be as competitive as earlier versions of the team. This was apparent after the first game of the season, which the Thistles lost 16–1. The club forfeited the next two games before withdrawing from the league completely, arguing they could no longer compete at that level. They attempted to join the New Ontario Hockey League, which had teams in Port Arthur and <a href="Fort%20William%2C%20Ontario">Fort William</a>, but were refused. Instead, the Thistles played exhibition games for the rest of the season before folding.

The Thistles were unable to compete with the rising professionalism that was developing in ice hockey. Located in a small town, they were unable to build a large enough rink, let alone attract the crowds to fill it and raise revenue. The promise of a larger arena, suggested in the wake of the club's Stanley Cup championship, would have been impossible to realize since it would have required the entire town to attend games to sell it out. Compounding the issue was a major economic downturn in the region starting as early as 1905, mining in particular seeing a major collapse. This coincided with the establishment of professional ice hockey leagues across Canada. Along with the Manitoba league, the ECAHA turned fully professional in 1907. The <a href="Ontario%20Professional%20Hockey%20League">Ontario Professional Hockey League</a> was established the same year and, in 1911, the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Hockey%20League">Pacific Coast Hockey League</a> began in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. These developments meant the Thistles had to compete with a multitude of teams for players who were being offered higher salaries. As a result, sports historian John Wong has suggested it was unlikely that the Thistles could compete for top-rated players with clubs in larger cities and remain secure financially.

Kenora remains the smallest town to win the Stanley Cup, and a major North American professional championship. The Thistles' two months as Stanley Cup champions is also the shortest length of time a team has possessed the Cup. Four homegrown Thistles—<a href="Si%20Griffis">Si Griffis</a>, Tom Hooper, Billy McGimsie, and Tommy Phillips—were later inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>. The five players signed for their 1907 Cup challenges—Art Ross and Joe Hall from January; Alf Smith, Harry Westwick, and Fred Whitcroft—would also be inducted. The January 1907 Stanley Cup champion team were themselves elected to the <a href="Northwestern%20Ontario%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame</a> in 1982.

Lappage has noted that during their existence, the Thistles were romanticized in the press "as a team of hometown boys who used to play shinny together on the streets of Rat Portage". That players from the town were responsible for most of the team's success was respected. Further, the players remained active in the community outside hockey. Most took up local jobs, while in the summer several played other sports, particularly rowing—Griffis competed at the 1905 <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Henley%20Regatta">Royal Canadian Henley Regatta</a>—and baseball. The team also helped promote Kenora to a wider audience: as a booming town at the turn of the century, town officials were excited by the publicity the Thistles' success brought. Sports historian Stacey L. Lorenz has noted that "Although Kenora's experience of professional hockey was brief, the Thistles' early twentieth-century Stanley Cup challenges [illustrated] some of the key issues surrounding community identity, town promotion, and the amateur-professional controversy in [that] period."

Since the original team's demise in late 1907, the nickname "Thistles" has been used for many ice hockey clubs in Kenora, including the town's amateur, junior, and senior-level men's teams.

Launched in 1798, she served during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary</a> and <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, mostly on blockades or convoy escort duties. She fought only one fleet action, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>, but became so well known for her actions and her subsequent depictions in art and literature that she has been remembered as The Fighting Temeraire".

Built at <a href="Chatham%20Dockyard">Chatham Dockyard</a>, "Temeraire" entered service on the <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> blockade with the <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a>. Missions were tedious and seldom relieved by any action with the French fleet. The first incident of note came when several of her crew, hearing rumours they were to be sent to the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> at a time when peace with France seemed imminent, refused to obey orders. This act of mutiny eventually failed and a number of those responsible were tried and executed. <a href="Laid%20up">Laid up</a> during the <a href="Peace%20of%20Amiens">Peace of Amiens</a>, "Temeraire" returned to active service with the resumption of the wars with France, again serving with the <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a>, and joined <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson's</a> blockade of the Franco-Spanish fleet in <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> in 1805. At the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, the ship went into action immediately astern of Nelson's flagship, . During the battle "Temeraire" came to the rescue of the beleaguered "Victory", and fought and captured two French ships, winning public renown in Britain.

After undergoing substantial repairs, "Temeraire" was employed blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She went out to the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 was off the Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a>, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the <a href="River%20Tamar">River Tamar</a> until 1819. Further service brought her to <a href="Sheerness">Sheerness</a> as a <a href="receiving%20ship">receiving ship</a>, then a <a href="Depot%20ship">victualling depot</a>, and finally a <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a>. The <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.

This final voyage was depicted in a <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a> oil painting greeted with critical acclaim, entitled "<a href="The%20Fighting%20Temeraire">The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up, 1838</a>". The painting continues to be held in high regard and was voted Britain's favourite painting in 2005.

"Temeraire" was ordered from <a href="Chatham%20Dockyard">Chatham Dockyard</a> on 9 December 1790, to a design developed by <a href="Surveyor%20of%20the%20Navy">Surveyor of the Navy</a> <a href="John%20Henslow%20%28Surveyor%20of%20the%20Navy%29">Sir John Henslow</a>. She was one of three ships of the <a href="Neptune%20class%20ship%20of%20the%20line">"Neptune" class</a>, alongside her sisters and . The <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid down at Chatham in July 1793. Her construction was initially overseen by Master Shipwright Thomas Pollard and completed by his successor Edward Sison. "Temeraire" was launched on 11 September 1798 and the following day was taken into the <a href="graving%20dock">graving dock</a> to be fitted for sea. Her hull was fitted with <a href="copper%20sheathing">copper sheathing</a>, a process that took two weeks to complete. Refloated, she finished fitting out, and received her masts and yards. Her final costs came to £73,241, and included £59,428 spent on the hull, masts and yards, and a further £13,813 on rigging and stores.

She was commissioned on 21 March 1799 under Captain <a href="Peter%20Puget">Peter Puget</a>, becoming the second ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name "Temeraire". Her predecessor had been the 74-gun <a href="third-rate">third-rate</a> , a former French ship taken as a <a href="prize%20%28law%29">prize</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lagos">Battle of Lagos</a> on 19 August 1759 by a fleet under Admiral <a href="Edward%20Boscawen">Edward Boscawen</a>. Puget was only in command until 26 July 1799, during which time he oversaw the process of fitting the new "Temeraire" for sea. He was superseded by Captain <a href="Thomas%20Eyles">Thomas Eyles</a> on 27 July 1799, while the vessel was anchored off <a href="St%20Helens%2C%20Isle%20of%20Wight">St Helens, Isle of Wight</a>.

Under Eyles's command "Temeraire" finally put to sea at the end of July, <a href="flagship">flying the flag</a> of Rear Admiral <a href="Sir%20John%20Borlase%20Warren%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Borlase Warren</a>, and joined the <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> under the overall command of Admiral <a href="Alexander%20Hood%2C%20Viscount%20Bridport">Lord Bridport</a>. The Channel Fleet was at that time principally engaged in the blockade of the French port of <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, and "Temeraire" spent several long cruises of two or three months at a time patrolling the area. Eyles was superseded during this period by "Temeraire"s former commander, Captain Puget, who resumed command on 14 October 1799, and the following month "Temeraire" became the flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="James%20Hawkins-Whitshed">James Whitshed</a>.

Lord Bridport had been replaced as commander of the Channel Fleet by Admiral <a href="John%20Jervis%2C%201st%20Earl%20St%20Vincent">Lord St Vincent</a> in mid-1799, and the long blockade cruises were sustained throughout the winter and into the following year. On 20 April 1800 Puget was superseded as commander by Captain Edward Marsh. Marsh commanded "Temeraire" through the remainder of that year and for the first half of 1801, until his replacement, Captain Thomas Eyles, arrived to resume command on 31 August. Rear Admiral Whitshed had also struck his flag by now, and "Temeraire" became the flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="George%20Campbell%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">George Campbell</a>. By this time the <a href="Second%20Coalition">Second Coalition</a> against France had collapsed, and negotiations for peace were underway at <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a>. Lord St Vincent had been promoted to <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, and command of the Channel Fleet passed to Admiral <a href="William%20Cornwallis">Sir William Cornwallis</a>. With the end of the war imminent, "Temeraire" was taken off blockade duty and sent to <a href="Bantry%20Bay">Bantry Bay</a> to await the arrival of a convoy, which she would then escort to the West Indies. Many of the crew had been serving continuously in the navy since the start of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, and had looked forward to returning to England now that peace seemed imminent. On hearing rumours that instead they were to be sent to the West Indies, around a dozen men began to agitate for the rest of the crew to refuse orders to sail for anywhere but England.

The first open clash between the mutineers and officers came on the morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that "Temeraire" would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined that the majority of the crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that "Temeraire"s crew would be supported by the ship's <a href="Royal%20Marines">marines</a> as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's <a href="gunport">gunport</a>s, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could.

Alarmed by the actions of "Temeraire"s crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral <a href="Andrew%20Mitchell%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Sir Andrew Mitchell</a> the following day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> while Campbell returned to "Temeraire" and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers were struck by rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though the officers were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.

News of the mutiny created a sensation in England, and the Admiralty ordered "Temeraire" to sail immediately for <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> while an investigation was carried out. Vice-Admiral Mitchell was granted extraordinary powers regarding the <a href="capital%20punishment">death sentence</a> and "Temeraire"s marine complement was hastily augmented for the voyage to England. On the ship's arrival, the 14 imprisoned ringleaders were swiftly court-martialled in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> aboard , some on 6 January 1802 and the rest on 14 January. After deliberations, twelve were sentenced to be hanged, and the remaining two were to receive two hundred lashes each. Four men were duly hanged aboard "Temeraire", and the remainder were hanged aboard several of the ships anchored at Portsmouth, including , , and .

After the executions, "Temeraire" was immediately sent to sea, sailing from Portsmouth for the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> the day after and beginning preparations for her delayed voyage to the West Indies. She sailed for <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, arriving there on 24 February, and remained in the West Indies until the summer. During her time there the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amiens">Treaty of Amiens</a> was finally signed and ratified, and "Temeraire" was ordered back to Britain. She arrived at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 28 September and Eyles <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">paid her off</a> on 5 October. Because of the drawdown in the size of the active navy as a result of the peace, "Temeraire" was <a href="laid%20up">laid up</a> in the <a href="Hamoaze">Hamoaze</a> for the next eighteen months.

The peace of Amiens was a brief interlude in the wars with Revolutionary France, and in 1803 the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition">War of the Third Coalition</a> began. "Temeraire" had deteriorated substantially during her long period spent laid up, and she was taken into dry dock on 22 May to repair and refit, starting with the replacement of her copper sheathing. Work was delayed when a heavy storm hit Plymouth in January 1804, causing appreciable damage to "Temeraire", but was finally completed by February 1804, at a cost of £16,898. Command was assigned to Captain <a href="Eliab%20Harvey">Eliab Harvey</a>, and he arrived to take up his commission on 1 January 1804. On putting to sea he sailed to join the Channel Fleet, still under the overall command of Admiral Cornwallis.

"Temeraire" now resumed her previous duties blockading the French at Brest. Heavy weather took its toll, forcing her to put into <a href="Torbay">Torbay</a> for extensive repairs after her long patrols, repairs which eventually amounted to £9,143. During this time Harvey was often absent from his command, usually attending to his duties as <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Essex%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Essex</a>. He was temporarily replaced by Captain William Kelly on 27 August 1804, and he in turn was succeeded by Captain George Fawke on 6 April 1805. Harvey returned to his ship on 9 July 1805, and it was while he was in command that the reinforced <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a> squadron under Vice-Admiral <a href="Robert%20Calder">Sir Robert Calder</a> intercepted and attacked a Franco-Spanish fleet at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Finisterre%20%281805%29">Battle of Cape Finisterre</a>. The French commander, <a href="Pierre-Charles%20Villeneuve">Pierre-Charles Villeneuve</a>, was thwarted in his attempt to join the French forces at Brest, and instead sailed south to <a href="Ferrol%2C%20Galicia">Ferrol</a>, and then to <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>. When news of the Franco-Spanish fleet's location reached the Admiralty, they appointed Vice-Admiral <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a> to take command of the blockading force at Cadiz, which at the time was being commanded by Vice-Admiral <a href="Cuthbert%20Collingwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Collingwood">Cuthbert Collingwood</a>. Nelson was told to pick whichever ships he liked to serve under him, and one of those he specifically chose was "Temeraire".

"Temeraire" duly received orders to join the Cadiz blockade, and having sailed to rendezvous with Collingwood, Harvey awaited Nelson's arrival. Nelson's flagship, the 100-gun , arrived off Cadiz on 28 September, and he took over command of the fleet from Collingwood. He spent the next few weeks forming his plan of attack in preparation for the expected sortie of the Franco-Spanish fleet, issuing it to his captains on 9 October in the form of a memorandum. The memorandum called for two divisions of ships to attack at right angles to the enemy line, severing its van from the centre and rear. A third advance squadron would be deployed as a reserve, with the ability to join one of the lines as the course of the battle dictated. Nelson placed the largest and most powerful ships at the heads of the lines, with "Temeraire" assigned to lead Nelson's own column into battle. The fleet patrolled a considerable distance from the Spanish coast to lure the combined fleet out, and the ships took the opportunity to exercise and prepare for the coming battle. For "Temeraire" this probably involved painting her sides in the <a href="Nelson%20Chequer">Nelson Chequer</a> design, to enable the British ships to tell friend from foe in the confusion of battle.

The combined Franco-Spanish fleet put to sea on 19 October 1805, and by 21 October was in sight of the British ships. Nelson formed up his lines and the British began to converge on their distant opponents. Contrary to his original instructions, Nelson took the lead of the weather column in "Victory". Concerned for the commander-in-chief's safety in such an exposed position, <a href="Henry%20Blackwood">Henry Blackwood</a>, a long-standing friend of Nelson and commander of the frigate that day, suggested that Nelson come aboard his ship to better observe and direct the battle. Nelson refused, so Blackwood instead tried to convince him to let Harvey come past him in the "Temeraire", and so lead the column into battle. Nelson agreed to this, and signalled for Harvey to come past him. As "Temeraire" drew up towards "Victory", Nelson decided that if he was standing aside to let another ship lead his line, so too should Collingwood, commanding the lee column of ships. He signalled Collingwood, aboard his flagship , to let another ship come ahead of him, but Collingwood continued to surge ahead. Reconsidering his plan, Nelson is reported to have hailed "Temeraire", as she came up alongside "Victory", with the words "I'll thank you, Captain Harvey, to keep in your proper station, which is "astern" of the Victory". Nelson's instruction was followed up by a formal signal and Harvey dropped back reluctantly, but otherwise kept within one ship's length of "Victory" as she sailed up to the Franco-Spanish line.

Closely following "Victory" as she passed through the Franco-Spanish line across the bows of the French flagship , Harvey was forced to sheer away quickly, just missing "Victory"s stern. Turning to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-gun Spanish ship <a href="Spanish%20ship%20Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20de%20la%20Sant%C3%ADsima%20Trinidad">"Santísima Trinidad"</a> and engaged her for twenty minutes, taking <a href="raking%20fire">raking fire</a> from two French ships, the 80-gun and the 74-gun , as she did so. "Redoutable"s broadside carried away "Temeraire"s <a href="mizzen">mizzen</a> topmast. While avoiding a broadside from "Neptune", "Temeraire" narrowly avoided a collision with "Redoutable". Another broadside from "Neptune" brought down "Temeraire"s <a href="foremast">fore-yard</a> and <a href="main%20mast">main topmast</a>, and damaged her fore mast and <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a>. Harvey now became aware that "Redoutable" had come up alongside "Victory" and swept her decks with musket fire and grenades. A large party of Frenchmen now gathered on her decks ready to board "Victory". "Temeraire" was brought around; appearing suddenly out of the smoke of the battle and slipping across "Redoutable"s stern, "Temeraire" discharged a <a href="double-shotted">double-shotted</a> broadside into her. <a href="Jean%20Jacques%20%C3%89tienne%20Lucas">Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas</a>, captain of "Redoutable", recorded that "... the three-decker ["Temeraire"] – who had doubtless perceived that the "Victory" had ceased fire and would inevitably be taken – ran foul of the "Redoutable" to starboard and overwhelmed us with the point-blank fire of all her guns. It would be impossible to describe the horrible carnage produced by the murderous broadside of this ship. More than two hundred of our brave lads were killed or wounded by it."

"Temeraire" then rammed into "Redoutable", dismounting many of the French ship's guns, and worked her way alongside, after which her crew lashed the two ships together. "Temeraire" now poured continuous broadsides into the French ship, taking fire as she did so from the 112-gun Spanish ship lying off her stern, and from the 74-gun French ship , which came up on "Temeraire"s un-engaged starboard side. Harvey ordered his gun crews to hold fire until "Fougueux" came within point blank range. "Temeraire"s first broadside against "Fougueux" at a range of caused considerable damage to the Frenchman's rigging, and she drifted into "Temeraire", whose crew promptly lashed her to the side. "Temeraire" was now lying between two French 74-gun ships. As Harvey later recalled in a letter to his wife "Perhaps never was a ship so circumstanced as mine, to have for more than three hours two of the enemy's line of battle ships lashed to her." "Redoutable", sandwiched between "Victory" and "Temeraire", suffered heavy casualties, reported by Captain Lucas as amounting to 300 dead and 222 wounded. During the fight grenades thrown from the decks and topmasts of "Redoutable" killed and wounded a number of "Temeraire"s crew and set her starboard rigging and foresail on fire. There was a brief pause in the fighting while both sides worked to douse the flames. "Temeraire" narrowly escaped destruction when a grenade thrown from "Redoutable" exploded on her maindeck, nearly igniting the after-magazine. Master-At-Arms John Toohig prevented the fire from spreading and saved not only "Temeraire", but the surrounding ships, which would have been caught in the explosion.

After twenty minutes fighting both "Victory" and "Temeraire", "Redoutable" had been reduced to a floating wreck. "Temeraire" had also suffered heavily, damaged when "Redoutable"s main mast fell onto her <a href="poop%20deck">poop deck</a>, and having had her own topmasts shot away. Informed that his ship was in danger of sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to "Temeraire". Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship.

Lashed together, "Temeraire" and "Fougueux" exchanged fire, "Temeraire" initially clearing the French ship's upper deck with small arms fire. The French rallied, but the greater height of the three-decked "Temeraire" compared to the two-decked "Fougueux" thwarted their attempts to board. Instead Harvey dispatched his own boarding party, led by First-Lieutenant <a href="Thomas%20Fortescue%20Kennedy">Thomas Fortescue Kennedy</a>, which entered "Fougueux" via her main deck ports and <a href="Chains%20%28nautical%29">chains</a>. The French tried to defend the decks port by port, but were steadily overwhelmed. "Fougueux"s captain, <a href="Louis%20Alexis%20Baudoin">Louis Alexis Baudoin</a>, had suffered a fatal wound earlier in the fighting, leaving Commander François Bazin in charge. When he learned that nearly all of the officers were dead or wounded and that most of the guns were out of action, Bazin surrendered the ship to the boarders.

"Temeraire" had by now fought both French ships to a standstill, at considerable cost to herself. She had sustained casualties of 47 killed and 76 wounded. All her sails and yards had been destroyed, only her lower masts remained, and the <a href="rudder">rudder head</a> and starboard <a href="cathead">cathead</a> had been shot away. of her starboard hull was staved in and both <a href="Sternwalk">quarter galleries</a> had been destroyed. Harvey signalled for a frigate to tow his damaged ship out of the line, and came up to assist. Before "Sirius" could make contact, "Temeraire" came under fire from a counter-attack by the as-yet unengaged van of the combined fleet, led by Rear Admiral <a href="Pierre%20Dumanoir%20le%20Pelley">Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley</a>. Harvey ordered that the few guns that could be brought to bear be fired in response, and the attack was eventually beaten off by fresh British ships arriving on the scene.

Shortly after the battle had ended, a severe gale struck the area. Several of the captured French and Spanish ships foundered in the rising seas, including both of "Temeraire"s prizes, "Fougueux" and "Redoutable". Lost in the wrecks were a considerable number of their crews, as well as 47 "Temeraire" crewmen, serving as <a href="prize%20crew">prize crew</a>s. "Temeraire" rode out the storm following the battle, sometimes being taken in tow by less damaged ships, sometimes riding at anchor. She took aboard a number of Spanish and French prisoners transferred from other prizes, including some transferred from "Euryalus", which was serving as the temporary flagship of Cuthbert Collingwood, who was now in command as Nelson had been killed during the battle. Harvey took the opportunity to go aboard "Euryalus" and present his account of the battle to Collingwood, and so became the only captain to do so before Collingwood wrote his dispatch about the victory.

"Temeraire" finally put into Gibraltar on 2 November, eleven days after the battle had been fought. After undergoing minor repairs she sailed for England, arriving at Portsmouth on 1 December, three days before "Victory" passed by carrying Nelson's body. The battle-damaged ships quickly became tourist attractions, and visitors flocked to tour them. "Temeraire" was particularly popular on her arrival, being the only ship singled out by name in Collingwood's dispatch for her heroic conduct. Collingwood wrote
A circumstance occurred during the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the "Temeraire" was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, in the end the combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report in the immediate aftermath of the battle, contained several errors. "Temeraire" had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing "Temeraire"s decks of enemy seamen.

A number of artists visited the newly returned Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Academy">Royal Naval Academy</a>. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, sending them to <a href="Nicholas%20Pocock">Nicholas Pocock</a> to be used for Pocock's large paintings of the battle. "Temeraire" was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>. It is not known whether he visited "Temeraire", though he did go aboard "Victory", making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors who had been in the battle. The story of "Temeraire" had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so much so that when the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of "Temeraire".

The battle-damaged "Temeraire" was almost immediately dry-docked in Portsmouth to undergo substantial repairs, which eventually lasted sixteen months and cost £25,352. She finally left the dockyard in mid-1807, now under the command of Captain <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Hamilton%2C%202nd%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Trebinshun%20House">Sir Charles Hamilton</a>. Having fitted her for sea, Hamilton sailed to the Mediterranean in September and joined the fleet blockading the French in Toulon. The service was largely uneventful, and "Temeraire" returned to Britain in April 1808 to undergo repairs at Plymouth. During her time in Britain the strategic situation in Europe changed as Spain rebelled against French domination and entered the war against France. "Temeraire" sailed in June to join naval forces operating off the Spanish coast in support of anti-French forces in the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>.

This service continued until early 1809, when she returned to Britain. By now Britain was heavily involved in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a>, protecting mercantile interests. An expedition under <a href="James%20Gambier%2C%201st%20Baron%20Gambier">Sir James Gambier</a> in July 1807 had captured most of the <a href="Danish%20Navy">Danish Navy</a> at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Copenhagen">Second Battle of Copenhagen</a>, in response to fears that it might fall into Napoleon's hands, at the cost of starting a <a href="Gunboat%20War">war with Denmark</a>. Captain Hamilton left the ship, and was superseded by Captain <a href="Edward%20Sneyd%20Clay">Edward Sneyd Clay</a>. "Temeraire" now became the flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="Manley%20Dixon">Sir Manley Dixon</a>, with orders to go to the Baltic to reinforce the fleet stationed there under <a href="James%20Saumarez%2C%201st%20Baron%20de%20Saumarez">Sir James Saumarez</a>. "Temeraire" arrived in May 1809 and was sent to blockade <a href="Karlskrona">Karlskrona</a> on the Swedish coast.

While on patrol with the 64-gun and the frigate , "Temeraire" became involved in one of the heaviest Danish <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a> attacks of the war. A party of men from "Ardent" had been landed on the island of <a href="Roms%C3%B8">Romsø</a>, but were taken by surprise in a Danish night attack, which saw most of the "Ardent" men captured. The "Melpomene" was sent under a flag of truce to negotiate for their release, but on returning from this mission, was becalmed. A flotilla of thirty Danish gunboats then launched an attack, taking advantage of the stranded "Melpomene"s inability to bring her broadside to bear on them. "Melpomene" signalled for help to the "Temeraire", which immediately dispatched boats to her assistance. They engaged and then drove off the Danish ships, and then helped the "Melpomene" to safety. She had been heavily damaged and suffered casualties of five killed and twenty-nine wounded. "Temeraire"s later Baltic service involved being dispatched to observe the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Russian fleet</a> at <a href="Tallinn">Reval</a>, during which time she made a survey of the island of <a href="Naissaar">Nargen</a>. After substantial blockading and convoy escort work, "Temeraire" was ordered back to Britain as winter arrived, and she arrived in Plymouth in November 1809.

After a period under repair in Plymouth, "Temeraire" was recommissioned under the command of Captain Edwin H. Chamberlayne in late January 1810. The Peninsular War had reached a critical stage, with the Spanish government <a href="Siege%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">besieged in Cadiz</a> by the French. "Temeraire", now the flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="Francis%20Pickmore">Francis Pickmore</a>, was ordered to reinforce the city's water defences, and provided men from her sailor and marine complement to crew batteries and gunboats. Men from "Temeraire" were heavily involved in the fighting until July 1810, when Pickmore was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean and take up a new position as <a href="Port%20Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">port admiral</a> at <a href="Mah%C3%B3n">Mahón</a>. "Temeraire" was thereafter based either at Mahón or off Toulon with the blockading British fleet under Admiral <a href="Edward%20Pellew%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Exmouth">Sir Edward Pellew</a>. Chamberlayne was replaced by Captain <a href="Joseph%20Spear">Joseph Spear</a> in March 1811, and for the most part the blockade was uneventful. Though possessing a powerful fleet, the French commander avoided any contact with the blockading force and stayed in port, or else made very short voyages, returning to the harbour when the British appeared.

"Temeraire"s one brush with the French during this period came on 13 August 1811. Having received orders to sail to <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a>, Spear attempted to tack out of Hyères Bay. As he tried to do so, the wind fell away, leaving "Temeraire" becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. Her boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, "Temeraire" was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Pellew ordered her back to Britain, and health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic.

"Temeraire" arrived in Plymouth on 9 February 1812 and was docked for a survey several weeks later. The survey reported that she was "A well built and strong ship but apparently much decay'd". Spear was superseded on 4 March by Captain <a href="Samuel%20Hood%20Linzee">Samuel Hood Linzee</a>, but Linzee's command was short-lived. "Temeraire" left the dock on 13 March and was paid off one week later. Advances in naval technology had developed more powerful and strongly built warships, and though still comparatively new, "Temeraire" was no longer considered desirable for front-line service. While laid up the decision was taken to convert her into a <a href="prison%20ship">prison ship</a> to alleviate overcrowding caused by large influxes of French prisoners from the Peninsular War campaigns. Conversion work was carried out at Plymouth between November and December 1813, after which she was laid up in the <a href="River%20Tamar">River Tamar</a> as a prison hulk. From 1814 she was under the nominal command of Lieutenant John Wharton. Despite being laid up and disarmed "Temeraire" and the rest of her class were nominally re-rated as 104-gun <a href="first%20rate">first rate</a>s in February 1817.

"Temeraire"s service as a prison ship lasted until 1819, at which point she was selected for conversion to a <a href="receiving%20ship">receiving ship</a>. She was extensively refitted at Plymouth between September 1819 and June 1820 at a cost of £27,733, and then sailed to <a href="Sheerness%20Dockyard">Sheerness Dockyard</a>. As a receiving ship she served as a temporary berth for new naval recruits until they received a posting to a ship. She fulfilled this role for eight years, until becoming a victualling depot in 1829. Her final role was as a <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a> at Sheerness, under the title "Guardship of the Ordinary and Captain-Superintendent's ship of the Fleet Reserve in the Medway". This final post as flagship of the Medway Reserve involved her being repainted and rearmed, and she was used to train boys belonging to <a href="The%20Marine%20Society">The Marine Society</a>. For the last two years of her service, from 1836 to 1838 she was under the nominal command of Captain Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, in his post as Captain-Superintendent of Sheerness. Kennedy had been "Temeraire"s first-lieutenant at Trafalgar.

Kennedy received orders from the Admiralty in June 1838 to have "Temeraire" valued in preparation for her sale out of the service. She fired her guns for the last time on 28 June in celebration of the <a href="Coronation%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Coronation of Queen Victoria</a>, and work began on dismantling her on 4 July. Kennedy delegated this task to Captain <a href="John%20Hill%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Sir John Hill</a>, commander of . Her masts, stores and guns were all removed and her crew paid off, before "Temeraire" was put up for sale with twelve other ships. She was sold by <a href="Dutch%20auction">Dutch auction</a> on 16 August 1838 to John Beatson, a shipbreaker based at <a href="Rotherhithe">Rotherhithe</a> for £5,530. Beatson was then faced with the task of transporting the ship 55 miles from Sheerness to Rotherhithe, the largest ship to have attempted this voyage. To accomplish this he hired two <a href="tugboat">steam tugs</a> from the Thames Steam Towing Company and employed a Rotherhithe <a href="Maritime%20pilot">pilot</a> named William Scott and twenty five men to sail her up the Thames, at a cost of £58.

The tugs took the <a href="Hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a> of "Temeraire" in tow at 7:30 am on 5 September 1838, taking advantage of the beginning of the <a href="slack%20water">slack water</a>. They had reached <a href="Greenhithe">Greenhithe</a> by 1:30 pm at the <a href="wikt%3AEbb%20tide">ebb of the tide</a>, where they anchored overnight. They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a> and then <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> at noon. They reached <a href="Limehouse">Limehouse</a> Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at 2 pm. "Temeraire" was hauled up onto the mud, where she lay as she was slowly broken up. The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder <a href="pintle">pintle</a>s and <a href="gudgeon">gudgeon</a>s, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.

The immediate legacy of "Temeraire" was the use of the timber taken from her as she was broken up. A gong stand made from "Temeraire" timber was a wedding present to the future King <a href="George%20V">George V</a> on the occasion of his marriage to <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Mary of Teck</a>, and is held at <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>. A <a href="barometer">barometer</a>, <a href="gavel">gavel</a>, and some miscellaneous timber are in the collections of the <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a>, and chairs made from "Temeraire" oak are in the possession of the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Museum">Royal Naval Museum</a>, Portsmouth, <a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>, London and the Whanganui Regional Museum, <a href="Whanganui">Whanganui</a>. An <a href="altar">altar</a>, <a href="Altar%20rails">communion rail</a> and two <a href="Cathedra">bishop's chairs</a> survive in <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Rotherhithe">St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe</a>. A <a href="ship%20model">ship model</a> of "Temeraire" made by prisoners of war uses a stand made from wood taken from her, and is currently in the <a href="Watermen%27s%20Hall">Watermen's Hall</a> in London. Other relics of "Temeraire" known to exist or have existed are a <a href="tea%20caddy">tea caddy</a> made for her signal midshipman at Trafalgar, <a href="James%20Eaton">James Eaton</a>, and sold at auction in 2000, the frame for an oil painting by <a href="Edwin%20Henry%20Landseer">Sir Edwin Landseer</a> titled "Neptune", and a <a href="mantelpiece">mantelpiece</a> made for Beatson's office, supported by figures of <a href="Atlas%20%28mythology%29">Atlas</a> supposedly taken from "Temeraire"s stern gallery. The mantelpiece can no longer be traced, nor can a plaque once fixed to "Temeraire"s deck commemorating <a href="England%20expects%20that%20every%20man%20will%20do%20his%20duty">Nelson's signal at Trafalgar</a>, nor a wooden leg made for a Trafalgar veteran from "Temeraire"s wood. <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a> foreshadowed the fate of "Temeraire"s wood in an essay which claimed that "Perhaps, where the low gate opens to some cottage garden, the tired traveller may ask, idly, why the moss grows so green on its rugged wood, and even the sailor's child may not answer nor know that the night dew lies deep in the war rents of the wood of the old "Temeraire"."

"Temeraire" features in a number of paintings and prints, the earliest commemorating her role in the battle of Trafalgar. She can be seen at least partially in paintings of the battle by <a href="Clarkson%20Frederick%20Stanfield">Clarkson Frederick Stanfield</a>, <a href="John%20Christian%20Schetky">John Christian Schetky</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20Pocock">Nicholas Pocock</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Buttersworth">Thomas Buttersworth</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Whitcombe">Thomas Whitcombe</a>. A fictionalised depiction of her launch was produced by Philip Burgoyne. Later representations of the retired "Temeraire" were also popular. Though no known contemporary image of her in the prison ship role exists, she was painted while a guardship on the Medway in 1833 by <a href="Edward%20William%20Cooke">Edward William Cooke</a>, and by William Beatson and J. J. Williams while laid up at Rotherhithe in 1838. More recently she has been the subject of paintings by <a href="Geoff%20Hunt%20%28marine%20artist%29">Geoff Hunt</a>. The most famous painting of "Temeraire" was made by J. M. W. Turner and titled "<a href="The%20Fighting%20Temeraire">The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up, 1838</a>". Turner depicts "Temeraire" on her last voyage, towed up the Thames by a small black steam tug as the sun sets (or dawns). In choosing his title Turner created an enduring appellation, as previously she had been known to her crew as the "saucy" "Temeraire". Turner presented it for exhibition at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> in 1839 with an accompanying excerpt, slightly altered, of <a href="Thomas%20Campbell%20%28poet%29">Thomas Campbell's</a> poem "Ye Mariners of England". The flag which braved the battle and the breeze,<br>no longer owns her.

Turner's painting achieved widespread critical acclaim, and accolades from the likes of John Ruskin and <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>. It was Turner's particular favourite; he only lent it once and refused to ever do so again. He also refused to sell it at any price, and on his death bequeathed it to the nation. It hangs today in the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, and in 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>'s <a href="Today%20%28BBC%20Radio%204%29">"Today" programme</a>.

"<a href="The%20Fighting%20Temeraire">The Fighting Temeraire</a>" is a <a href="historical%20narrative">historical narrative</a> written by <a href="Sam%20Willis">Sam Willis</a> and details "extraordinary story of the mighty Temeraire, the ship behind J. M. W. Turner's iconic painting." It includes a detailed history of the ship, history of both the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> (1756–63) and the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> (1798–1815), and 50 full-color illustrations and 60 black-and-white photographs.

The "<a href="Temeraire%20%28series%29">Temeraire</a>" series is a <a href="historical%20fantasy">historical fantasy</a>/<a href="alternate%20history">alternate history</a> written by <a href="Naomi%20Novik">Naomi Novik</a> and while the ship itself is not featured, it is the namesake of the main character. The series takes place in an alternate version of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, in which the various nations fight with <a href="air%20force">air force</a>s made up of manned <a href="dragon">dragon</a>s. HMS "Temeraire" appears briefly in the ninth and final book.

"Temeraire" became the subject of a number of poems and songs commemorating her life and fate. An early work by James Duff written between 1813 and 1819 referenced her role as a prison ship, and was set to music in 1857 under the title "The Brave Old Temeraire". More generally, an anonymous poem entitled "The Wooden Walls of Old England" appeared in "<a href="Fraser%27s%20Magazine">Fraser's Magazine</a>" shortly after "Temeraire"s arrival at Rotherhithe, and lamented the fate of the great sailing warships. Turner's painting created an enduring interest in the story of "Temeraire" and several poems appeared in the decades following her breaking up. <a href="Gerald%20Massey">Gerald Massey</a> wrote "The Fighting Temeraire Tugged to Her Last Berth", <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a> produced "The Temeraire", and <a href="Henry%20Newbolt">Henry Newbolt</a> wrote "The Fighting Temeraire", with its closing lines Now the sunset's breezes shiver,<br>And she's fading down the river,<br>But in England's song forever,<br>She's the Fighting Temeraire.

a. Sometimes referred to as the "Dreadnought" class.

b. This "Temeraire" retained her French name after her capture, and served during the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, before being sold out of the service in 1784.

c. A number of general histories, including Goodwin's "The Ships of Trafalgar" and Noel Mostert's "The Line on the Wind", state that all 14 were hanged. Willis studied contemporary records and reports of the court-martial for his "The Fighting Temeraire", and states only 12 of the 14 were sentenced to be hanged. <a href="Roy%20and%20Lesley%20Adkins">Roy and Lesley Adkins</a> offer a third account, that twenty mutineers were tried, all were found guilty and eighteen were sentenced to death, the other two were to receive one hundred and twenty lashes each. They note that at least six were hanged and possibly as many as twelve, the remainder may have had their sentences commuted to <a href="Penal%20transportation">transportation</a>.

d. Lucas described the scene on "Redoutable": In less than half an hour our ship had been so fearfully mauled that she looked like little more than a heap of debris. Judging by appearances, no doubt, the "Temeraire", now hailed us to surrender and not prolong a useless resistance. My reply was instantly to order some soldiers who were near me to fire back; which they did with great alacrity. At the same moment almost, the main mast of the "Redoutable" fell on board the English ship. The two topmasts of the "Temeraire" then came down, falling on board of us. Our whole poop was stove in, helm rudder and stern post all shattered to splinters, all the stern frame, and the decks shot through. All our own guns were either smashed or dismounted by the broadsides of the "Victory" and the "Temeraire"... The hull itself was riddled, shot through from side to side; deck beams were shattered, port lids torn away or knocked to pieces. Four of our six pumps were so damaged as to be useless. The quarter-deck ladders were broken, which rendered communication with the rest of the ship very difficult. Everywhere the decks were strewn with dead men, lying beneath the debris. Out of a crew of 634 men we had 522 "hors de combat"; of whom 300 were killed and 222 wounded nearly all the officers among them ... The batteries and upper decks were practically abandoned – bare of men and were unable longer to offer any resistance. No one who had not seen the state of "Redoutable" could ever form an idea of her awful condition. Really I know of nothing on board that had not been hit by shot. 

e. The fall of the mainmast onto "Temeraire" also caused three French "<a href="obusier">obusier</a>s" to fall onto her decks. Harvey promptly claimed them as souvenirs, "with which ... to commemorate the event every year in May by firing them off from the mound at Chigwell."

f. The identity of these tugs has been difficult to determine. Winfield names only one tug, "Monarch". Goodwin names them as "London" and "Samson", while Willis states they were "Sampson" and "Newcastle".

Wonder Stories

Wonder Stories is an early American <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a> which was published under several titles from <a href="1929%20in%20science%20fiction">1929</a> to 1955. It was founded by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> in 1929 after he had lost control of his first science fiction magazine, "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", when his media company <a href="Experimenter%20Publishing">Experimenter Publishing</a> went bankrupt. Within a few months of the bankruptcy, Gernsback launched three new magazines: "Air Wonder Stories", "Science Wonder Stories", and "Science Wonder Quarterly".

"Air Wonder Stories" and "Science Wonder Stories" were merged in 1930 as "Wonder Stories", and the quarterly was renamed "Wonder Stories Quarterly". The magazines were not financially successful, and in 1936 Gernsback sold "Wonder Stories" to <a href="Ned%20Pines">Ned Pines</a> at <a href="Beacon%20Publications">Beacon Publications</a>, where, retitled "Thrilling Wonder Stories", it continued for nearly 20 years. The last issue was dated Winter 1955, and the title was then merged with "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>", another of Pines' science fiction magazines. "Startling" itself lasted only to the end of 1955 before finally succumbing to the decline of the <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> industry.

The editors under Gernsback's ownership were <a href="David%20Lasser">David Lasser</a>, who worked hard to improve the quality of the fiction, and, from mid-1933, <a href="Charles%20Hornig">Charles Hornig</a>. Both Lasser and Hornig published some well-received fiction, such as <a href="Stanley%20G.%20Weinbaum">Stanley Weinbaum</a>'s "<a href="A%20Martian%20Odyssey">A Martian Odyssey</a>", but Hornig's efforts in particular were overshadowed by the success of "<a href="Astounding%20Stories">Astounding Stories</a>", which had become the leading magazine in the new field of science fiction. Under its new title, "Thrilling Wonder Stories" was initially unable to improve its quality. For a period in the early 1940s it was aimed at younger readers, with a juvenile editorial tone and covers that depicted beautiful women in implausibly revealing <a href="Spacesuits%20in%20fiction">spacesuits</a>. Later editors began to improve the fiction, and by the end of the 1940s, in the opinion of science fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, the magazine briefly rivaled "Astounding".

By the end of the 19th century, stories centered on scientific inventions and set in the future, in the tradition of <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>, were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines. Magazines such as "<a href="Munsey%27s%20Magazine">Munsey's Magazine</a>" and "<a href="Argosy%20%28magazine%29">The Argosy</a>", launched in 1889 and 1896 respectively, carried a few science fiction stories each year. Some upmarket "slicks" such as "<a href="McClure%27s">McClure's</a>", which paid well and were aimed at a more literary audience, also carried scientific stories, but by the early years of the 20th century, science fiction (though it was not yet called that) was appearing more often in the <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a>s than in the slicks. The first science fiction magazine, "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", was launched in 1926 by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> at the height of the pulp magazine era. It helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre, and by the end of the 1930s a "<a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Science%20Fiction">Golden Age of Science Fiction</a>" had begun, inaugurated by the efforts of John W. Campbell, the editor of "<a href="Astounding%20Science%20Fiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a>". "Wonder Stories" was launched in the pulp era, not long after "Amazing Stories", and lasted through the Golden Age and well into the 1950s.

Gernsback's new magazine, "Amazing Stories", was successful, but Gernsback lost control of the publisher when it went bankrupt in February 1929. By April he had formed a new company, Gernsback Publications Incorporated, and created two subsidiaries: Techni-Craft Publishing Corporation and Stellar Publishing Corporation. Gernsback sent out letters advertising his plans for new magazines; the mailing lists he used almost certainly were compiled from the subscription lists of "Amazing Stories". This would have been illegal, as the lists were owned by Irving Trust, the receiver of the bankruptcy. Gernsback denied using the lists under oath, but historians have generally agreed that he must have done so. The letters also asked potential subscribers to decide the name of the new magazine; they voted for "Science Wonder Stories", which became the name of one of Gernsback's new magazines.

Gernsback's recovery from the bankruptcy judgment was remarkably quick. By early June he had launched three new magazines, two of which published science fiction. The June 1929 issue of "Science Wonder Stories" appeared on newsstands on 5 May 1929, and was followed on 5 June by the July 1929 issue of "Air Wonder Stories". Both magazines were monthly, with Gernsback as editor-in-chief and <a href="David%20Lasser">David Lasser</a> as editor. Lasser had no prior editing experience and knew little about science fiction, but his recently acquired degree from <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a> convinced Gernsback to hire him.

Gernsback claimed that science fiction was educational. He repeatedly made this assertion in "Amazing Stories", and continued to do so in his editorials for the new magazines, stating, for example, that "teachers encourage the reading of this fiction because they know that it gives the pupil a fundamental knowledge of science and aviation." He also recruited a panel of "nationally known educators [who] pass upon the scientific principles of all stories". Science fiction historian <a href="Everett%20Bleiler">Everett Bleiler</a> describes this as "fakery, pure and simple", asserting that there is no evidence that the men on the panel—some of whom, such as <a href="Lee%20De%20Forest">Lee De Forest</a>, were well-known scientists—had any editorial influence. However, <a href="Donald%20Menzel">Donald Menzel</a>, the astrophysicist on the panel, has said that Gernsback sent him manuscripts and made changes to stories as a result of Menzel's commentary.

In 1930, Gernsback decided to merge "Science Wonder Stories" and "Air Wonder Stories" into "Wonder Stories". The reason for the merger is unknown, although it may have been that he needed the space in the printing schedule for his new "Aviation Mechanics" magazine. Bleiler has suggested that the merger was caused by poor sales and a consequent need to downsize. In addition, "Air Wonder Stories" was probably focused on too specialized a niche to succeed. In an editorial just before "Science Wonder Stories" changed its name, Gernsback commented that the word "Science" in the title "has tended to retard the progress of the magazine, because many people had the impression that it is a sort of scientific periodical rather than a fiction magazine". Ironically, the inclusion of "science" in the title was the reason that science fiction writer <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> began reading the magazine; when he saw the August 1929 issue he obtained permission to read it from his father on the grounds that it was clearly educational. Concerns about the marketability of titles seem to have surfaced in the last two issues of "Science Wonder", which had the word "Science" printed in a color that made it difficult to read. On the top of the cover appeared the words "Mystery-Adventure-Romance", the last of which was a surprising way to advertise a science fiction magazine.

The first issue of the merged magazine appeared in June 1930, still on a monthly schedule, with Lasser as editor. The volume numbering continued that of "Science Wonder Stories", therefore "Wonder Stories" is sometimes regarded as a retitling of "Science Wonder Stories". Gernsback had also produced a companion magazine for "Science Wonder Stories", titled "Science Wonder Quarterly", the first issue of which was published in the fall of 1929. Three issues were produced under this title, but after the merger Gernsback changed the companion magazine's title to "Wonder Stories Quarterly", and produced a further eleven issues under that title.

In July 1933, Gernsback dismissed Lasser as editor. Lasser had become active in promoting workers' rights and was spending less time on his editorial duties. According to Lasser, Gernsback told him "if you like working with the unemployed so much, I suggest you go and join them". It is likely that cost-cutting was also a consideration, as Lasser was paid $65 per week, a substantial salary in those days. Soon after Lasser was let go, Gernsback received a <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>, "The Fantasy Fan", from a reader, <a href="Charles%20Hornig">Charles Hornig</a>. Gernsback called Hornig to his office to interview him for the position of editor; Hornig turned out to be only 17, but Gernsback asked him to proofread a manuscript and decided that the results were satisfactory. Hornig was hired at an initial salary of $20 per week. That same year, Gernsback dissolved Stellar Publications and created Continental Publications as the new publisher for "Wonder Stories". The schedule stuttered for the first time, missing the July and September 1933 issues; the recent bankruptcy of the company's distributor, Eastern Distributing Corporation, may have been partly responsible for this disruption. The first issue with Continental on the masthead, and the first listing Hornig as editor, was November 1933.

"Wonder Stories" had a circulation of about 25,000 in 1934, comparable to that of "Amazing Stories", which had declined from an early peak of about 100,000. Gernsback considered issuing a reprint magazine in 1934, "Wonder Stories Reprint Annual", but it never appeared. That year he experimented with other fiction magazines—"Pirate Stories" and "High Seas Adventures"—but neither was successful. "Wonder Stories" was also failing, and in November 1935 it started publishing bimonthly instead of monthly. Gernsback had a reputation for paying slowly and was therefore unpopular with many authors; by 1936 he was even failing to pay <a href="Laurence%20Manning">Laurence Manning</a>, one of his most reliable authors. Staff were sometimes asked to delay cashing their paychecks for weeks at a time. Gernsback felt the blame lay with dealers who were returning magazine covers as unsold copies, and then selling the stripped copies at a reduced rate. To bypass the dealers, he made a plea in the March 1936 issue to his readers, asking them to subscribe, and proposing to distribute "Wonder Stories" solely by subscription. There was little response, and Gernsback decided to sell. He made a deal with Ned Pines of <a href="Beacon%20Magazines">Beacon Magazines</a> and on 21 February 1936 "Wonder Stories" was sold.

Pines' magazines included several with "Thrilling" in the title, such as "Thrilling Detective" and "Thrilling Love Stories". These were run by <a href="Leo%20Margulies">Leo Margulies</a>, who had hired <a href="Mort%20Weisinger">Mort Weisinger</a> (among others) as the workload increased in the early 1930s. Weisinger was already an active science fiction fan, and when "Wonder Stories" was acquired, Margulies involved him in the editorial work. Margulies' group worked as a team, with Margulies listed as editor-in-chief on the magazines and having final say. However, since Weisinger knew science fiction well, Weisinger was quickly given more leeway, and bibliographers generally list Weisinger as the editor for this period of the magazine's history.

The title was changed to "Thrilling Wonder Stories" to match the rest of the "Thrilling" line. The first issue appeared in August 1936—four months after the last Gernsback "Wonder Stories" appeared. "Wonder Stories" had been monthly until the last few Gernsback issues; "Thrilling Wonder" was launched on a bimonthly schedule. In February 1938 Weisinger asked for reader feedback regarding the idea of a companion magazine; the response was positive, and in January 1939 the first issue of "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>" appeared, alternating months with "Thrilling Wonder". A year later "Thrilling Wonder" went monthly; this lasted fewer than eighteen months, and the bimonthly schedule resumed after April 1941. Weisinger left that summer and was replaced at both "Startling" and "Thrilling Wonder" by <a href="Oscar%20J.%20Friend">Oscar J. Friend</a>, a pulp writer with more experience in <a href="Western%20fiction">Westerns</a> than science fiction, though he had published a novel, "The Kid from Mars", in "Startling Stories" just the year before. In mid-1943 both magazines went to a quarterly schedule, and at the end of 1944 Friend was replaced in his turn by <a href="Sam%20Merwin%2C%20Jr.">Sam Merwin, Jr.</a> The quarterly schedule lasted until well after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> ended: "Thrilling Wonder" returned to a bimonthly schedule with the December 1946 issue and again alternated with "Startling" which went bimonthly in January 1947. Merwin left in 1951 in order to become a freelance editor, and was replaced by <a href="Samuel%20Mines">Samuel Mines</a>, who had worked for Ned Pines since 1942.

The Thrilling Wonder logo, a winged man against the background of a glass mountain was taken from the <a href="Noel%20Loomis">Noel Loomis</a> story, "The Glass Mountain."

By the summer of 1949 <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a>, one of the largest pulp publishers, had shut down every one of their pulps. This format was dying out, though it took several more years before the pulps completely disappeared from the newsstands. Both "Thrilling Wonder" and "Startling" went quarterly in 1954, and at the end of that year Mines left. The magazines did not survive him for long; only two more issues of "Thrilling Wonder" appeared, both edited by <a href="Alexander%20Samalman">Alexander Samalman</a>. After the beginning of 1955, "Thrilling Wonder" was merged with "Startling", which itself ceased publication at the end of 1955.

After the demise of "Thrilling Wonder Stories" the old "Wonder Stories" title was revived for two issues, published in 1957 and 1963. These were both edited by Jim Hendryx Jr. They were numbered vol. 45, no. 1 and 2, continuing the volume numbering of "Thrilling Wonder". Both were selections from past issues of "Thrilling Wonder"; the second one convinced Ned Pines, the publisher who had bought "Wonder Stories" from Gernsback in 1936 and who still owned the rights to the stories, to start a reprint magazine called "Treasury of Great Science Fiction Stories" in 1964; a companion, "Treasury of Great Western Stories", was added the next year.

In 2007, Winston Engle published a new magazine in book format, titled "Thrilling Wonder Stories", with a cover date of Summer 2007. Engle commented that it was "not a pastiche or nostalgia exercise as much as modern SF with the entertainment, inspirational value, and excitement of the golden age". A second volume appeared in 2009.

Six months after the debut of "Thrilling Wonder Stories", its June 1937 issue contained a picture feature by Jack Binder entitled "IF —!". Binder's earlier training as a fine artist helped him create detailed renderings of space ships, lost cities, future cities, landscapes, indigenous peoples, and even ancient <a href="Atlantis">Atlantins</a>. "IF —!"'s pen and ink drawings are hand-lettered and rendered in black and white. These one-to-two page studies presented readers with possible outcomes to early 20th-century scientific quandaries. These included:

When "Air Wonder Stories" was launched in the middle of 1929 there were already pulp magazines such as "Sky Birds" and "Flying Aces" which focused on aerial adventures. Gernsback's first editorial dismissed these as being of the "purely 'Wild West'-world war adventure-sky busting type". By contrast, Gernsback said he planned to fill "Air Wonder" solely with "flying stories of the future, strictly along scientific-mechanical-technical lines, full of adventure, exploration and achievement." Non-fiction material on aviation was printed, including quizzes, short popular articles, and book reviews. The letters column made it clear that the readership comprised more science fiction fans than aviation fans, and Gernsback later commented that the overlap with "Science Wonder" readers was 90% (a figure that presumably referred only to the subscription base, not to newsstand sales).

Gernsback frequently ran reader contests, one of which, announced in the February 1930 issue of "Air Wonder Stories", asked for a slogan for the magazine. <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a>, later to become famous as the author of "<a href="The%20Day%20of%20the%20Triffids">The Day of the Triffids</a>", won with "Future Flying Fiction", submitted under his real name of John Beynon Harris. Later that year a contest in "Science Wonder Quarterly" asked readers for an answer to the question "What I Have Done to Spread Science Fiction". The winner was <a href="Raymond%20Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a> who later became editor of Gernsback's original magazine, "Amazing Stories". He won the contest for his role in founding a "Science Correspondence Club".

"Science Wonder"'s first issue included the first part of a serial, "The Reign of the Ray", by <a href="Fletcher%20Pratt">Fletcher Pratt</a> and Irwin Lester, and short stories by <a href="Stanton%20Coblentz">Stanton Coblentz</a> and <a href="David%20H.%20Keller">David H. Keller</a>. "Air Wonder" began with a reprinted serial, <a href="Victor%20MacClure">Victor MacClure</a>'s "Ark of the Covenant". Writers who first appeared in the pages of these magazines include <a href="Neil%20R.%20Jones">Neil R. Jones</a>, <a href="Ed%20Earl%20Repp">Ed Earl Repp</a>, <a href="Raymond%20Z.%20Gallun">Raymond Z. Gallun</a> and <a href="Lloyd%20Eshbach">Lloyd Eshbach</a>. The quality of published science fiction at the time was generally low, and Lasser was keen to improve it. On 11 May 1931 he wrote to his regular contributors to tell them that their science fiction stories "should deal "realistically" with the effect upon people, individually and in groups, of a scientific invention or discovery. ... In other words, allow yourself one fundamental assumption—that a certain machine or discovery is possible—and then show what would be its logical and dramatic consequences upon the world; also what would be the effect upon the group of characters that you pick to carry your theme."

Lasser provided ideas to his authors and commented on their drafts, attempting to improve both the level of <a href="scientific%20literacy">scientific literacy</a> and the quality of the writing. Some of his correspondence has survived, including an exchange with <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>, whom Lasser commissioned in early 1932 to write a story based on a plot provided by a reader—the winning entry in one of the magazine's competitions. Lasser emphasized to Williamson the importance of scientific plausibility, citing as an example a moment in the story where the earthmen have to decipher a written Martian language: "You must be sure and make it convincing how they did it; for they have absolutely no method of approach to a written language of another world." On one occasion Lasser's work with his authors extended to collaboration: "The Time Projector", a story which appeared in the July 1931 issue of "Wonder Stories", was credited to <a href="David%20H.%20Keller">David H. Keller</a> and David Lasser. Both Lasser and, later, Hornig, were given almost complete editorial freedom by Gernsback, who reserved only the right to give final approval to the contents. This was in contrast to the more detailed control Gernsback had exerted over the content of "Amazing Stories" in the first years of its existence. Science fiction historian Sam Moskowitz has suggested that the reason was the poor financial state of "Wonder Stories"—Gernsback perhaps avoided corresponding with authors as he owed many of them money.

Lasser allowed the letter column to become a free discussion of ideas and values, and published stories dealing with topics such as the relationship between the sexes. One such story, Thomas S. Gardner's "The Last Woman", portrayed a future in which men, having evolved beyond the need for love, keep the last woman in a museum. In "The Venus Adventurer", an early story by <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a>, a spaceman corrupts the innocent natives of Venus. Lasser avoided printing <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a>, and several stories from "Wonder" in the early 1930s were more realistic than most contemporary space fiction. Examples include <a href="Edmond%20Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a>'s "A Conquest of Two Worlds", <a href="P.%20Schuyler%20Miller">P. Schuyler Miller</a>'s "The Forgotten Man of Space", and several stories by <a href="Frank%20K.%20Kelly">Frank K. Kelly</a>, including "The Moon Tragedy".

Lasser was one of the founders of the <a href="American%20Rocket%20Society">American Rocket Society</a> which, under its initial name of the "Interplanetary Society", announced its existence in the pages of the June 1930 "Wonder Stories". Several of "Wonder"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s writers were also members of the Interplanetary Society, and perhaps as a consequence of the relationship "Wonder Stories Quarterly" began to focus increasingly on fiction with interplanetary settings. A survey of the last eight issues of "Wonder Stories Quarterly" by Bleiler found almost two-thirds of the stories were interplanetary adventures, while only a third of the stories in the corresponding issues of "Wonder Stories" could be so described. "Wonder Stories Quarterly" added a banner reading "Interplanetary Number" to the cover of the Winter 1931 issue, and retained it, as "Interplanetary Stories", for subsequent issues. Lasser and Gernsback were also briefly involved with the fledgling <a href="Technocracy%20movement">Technocracy movement</a>. Gernsback published two issues of "Technocracy Review", which Lasser edited, commissioning stories based on technocratic ideas from <a href="Nat%20Schachner">Nat Schachner</a>. These appeared in "Wonder Stories" during 1933, culminating in a novel, "The Revolt of the Scientists".

Reviews of fiction and popular science books were published, and there was a science column which endeavored to answer readers' questions. These features were at first of good quality, but deteriorated after Lasser's departure, although it is not certain that Lasser wrote the content of either one. An influential non-fiction initiative was the creation of the Science Fiction League, an organization that brought together local science fiction fan clubs across the country. Gernsback took the opportunity to sell items such as buttons and insignia, and it was undoubtedly a profitable enterprise for him as well as a good source of publicity. It was ultimately more important in becoming one of the foundations of <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fandom</a>.

When Hornig took over from Lasser at the end of 1933 he attempted to continue and expand Lasser's approach. Hornig introduced a "New Policy" in the January 1934 issue, emphasizing originality and barring stories that merely reworked well-worn ideas. He asked for stories that included good science, although "not enough to become boring to those readers who are not primarily interested in the technicalities of the science". However, "Astounding" was moving into the lead position in the science fiction magazine field at this time, and Hornig had difficulty in competing. His rates of payment were lower than "Astounding"'s one cent per word; sometimes his writers were paid very late, or not at all. Despite these handicaps, Hornig managed to find some good material, including <a href="Stanley%20G.%20Weinbaum">Stanley G. Weinbaum</a>'s "<a href="A%20Martian%20Odyssey">A Martian Odyssey</a>", which appeared in the July 1934 "Wonder" and has been frequently reprinted.

In the December 1934 – January 1935 issue of Hornig's <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>, "Fantasy Magazine", he took the unusual step of listing several stories that he had rejected as lacking novelty, but which had subsequently appeared in print in other magazines. The list includes several by successful writers of the day, such as <a href="Raymond%20Z.%20Gallun">Raymond Z. Gallun</a> and <a href="Miles%20Breuer">Miles Breuer</a>. The most prominent story named is "<a href="Triplanetary%20%28novel%29">Triplanetary</a>" by <a href="E.%20E.%20Smith">E. E. Smith</a>, which appeared in "Amazing".

Both Lasser and Hornig printed fiction translated from French and German writers, including Otfrid von Hanstein and <a href="Otto%20Willi%20Gail">Otto Willi Gail</a>. With the rise of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including <a href="Donald%20A.%20Wollheim">Donald Wollheim</a>) wrote letters complaining about the inclusion of German stories. The editorial response was a strong defense of the translations; Gernsback argued that events in Germany were irrelevant to the business of selecting fiction.

The covers for almost every issue of "Air Wonder", "Science Wonder", "Wonder Stories" and "Wonder Stories Quarterly" were painted by <a href="Frank%20R.%20Paul">Frank R. Paul</a>, who had followed Gernsback from "Amazing Stories". The only exception was a cover image composed of colored dots, which appeared on the November 1932 issue.

When the magazine moved to Beacon Publications, as "Thrilling Wonder", the fiction began to focus more on action than on ideas. The covers, often by <a href="Earle%20K.%20Bergey">Earle K. Bergey</a>, typically depicted bizarre aliens and <a href="damsel%20in%20distress">damsels in distress</a>. In 1939, a reader, Martin Alger, coined the phrase "bug-eyed monster" to describe one such cover; <a href="Bug-eyed%20monster">the phrase</a> subsequently entered the dictionary as a word for an alien. Several well-known writers contributed, including <a href="Ray%20Cummings">Ray Cummings</a>, and <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>, whose "Brain-Stealers of Mars" series began in "Thrilling Wonder" in the December 1936 issue. A comic-strip began in August 1936, the first issue of the Beacon Publications version. It was illustrated and possibly written by Max Plaisted. The strip, titled "Zarnak", was not a success, and was cancelled after eight issues.

Weisinger's successor, Friend, gave the magazine a significantly more juvenile feel. He used the alias "Sergeant Saturn" and was generally condescending to the readers; this may not have been his fault as Margulies, who was still the editorial director, probably wanted him to attract a younger readership. Under Friend's direction, Earle K. Bergey transformed the look of "Thrilling Wonder Stories" by foregrounding human figures in space, focusing on the anatomy of women in implausibly revealing spacesuits and his trademark "brass brassières".

Merwin, who took over with the Winter 1945 issue, adopted a more mature approach than Friend's. He obtained fiction from writers who had previously been publishing mainly in John Campbell's "Astounding". The Summer 1945 issue of "Thrilling Wonder" included <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>'s first published story, "The World Thinker". Merwin also published several stories by <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, some of which were later included in Bradbury's collection "<a href="The%20Martian%20Chronicles">The Martian Chronicles</a>". Other well-known writers that Merwin was able to attract included <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>, <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A. E. van Vogt</a>, and <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>. "Thrilling Wonder" often published intelligent, thoughtful stories, some of which Campbell would have been unlikely to accept at "Astounding": he did not like to publish stories that showed the negative consequences of scientific advances such as nuclear power. In the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, during the late 1940s "Thrilling Wonder" became a serious rival to "Astounding"'s long domination of the field. However, this is not a universal opinion, as the magazine is elsewhere described during Merwin's tenure as "evidently secondary to "Startling"".

Samuel Mines took over from Merwin at the end of 1951, both at "Startling Stories" and "Thrilling Wonder". He argued against restrictions in <a href="List%20of%20science%20fiction%20themes">science fiction themes</a>, and in 1952 published <a href="Philip%20Jos%C3%A9%20Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a>'s "The Lovers", a ground-breaking story about inter-species sex, in "Startling". He followed this in 1953 with another taboo-breaking story from Farmer, "Mother", in "Thrilling Wonder", in which a spaceman makes his home in an alien womb. In the December 1952 "Thrilling Wonder", Mines published Edmond Hamilton's "What's It Like Out There?", a downbeat story about the realities of space exploration that had been considered too bleak for publication when it had originally been written in the 1930s. Sherwood Springer's "No Land of Nod", in the same issue, dealt with incest between a father and his daughter in a world in which they are the only two survivors. These stories were all well received by the readership.

For a few years, Lasser was the dominant force in science fiction. Under him, "Wonder Stories" was the best of the science fiction magazines of the early 1930s, and the most successful of all Gernsback's forays into the field. Lasser shaped a new generation of writers, who in many cases had no prior writing experience of any kind; "Wonder Stories" was part of a "forcing ground", according to Isaac Asimov, where young writers learned their trade. The magazine was less constrained by pulp convention than its competitors, and published some novels such as <a href="Eric%20Temple%20Bell">Eric Temple Bell</a>'s "The Time Stream" and <a href="Festus%20Pragnell">Festus Pragnell</a>'s "The Green Man of Graypec", which were not in the mainstream of development of the science fiction genre.

As "Thrilling Wonder" the magazine was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, and by the time Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, "<a href="Astounding%20Science%20Fiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a>" had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. "Thrilling Wonder" could not compete with <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell%2C%20Jr.">John Campbell</a> and the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Science%20Fiction">Golden Age of science fiction</a> that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.

The editorial duties at "Wonder Stories" and its related magazines were not always performed by the person who bore the title of "editor" in the magazine's masthead. From the beginning until the sale to Beacon Publications, Gernsback was listed as editor-in-chief; Lasser was variously listed as "literary editor" and "managing editor", while Hornig was always listed as "managing editor". Similarly, under Beacon Publications, the nominal editor (initially Leo Margulies) was not always the one to work on the magazine. The following list shows who actually performed the editorial duties. More details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.

The publisher only changed once through the lifetime of the magazine, when Gernsback sold "Wonder Stories" in 1936. However, Gernsback changed the name of his company from Stellar Publishing Corporation to Continental Publications, Incorporated, with effect from December 1933. "Thrilling Wonder"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s publisher went by three names: Beacon Publications initially, then Better Publications from the August 1937 issue, and finally, starting with the Fall 1943 issue, Standard Magazines.

Gernsback experimented with the price and format, looking for a profitable combination. Both "Air Wonder" and "Science Wonder" were bedsheet-sized (8.5 × 11.75 in, or 216 × 298 mm) and priced at 25 cents, as were the first issues of "Wonder Stories". With the November 1930 issue "Wonder Stories" changed to pulp format, 6.75 × 9.9 in (171 × 251 mm). It reverted to bedsheet after a year, and then in November 1933 became a pulp magazine for good. The pulp issues all had 144 pages; the bedsheet issues generally had 96 pages, though five issues from November 1932 to March 1933 had only 64 pages. Those five issues coincided with a price cut to 15 cents, which was reversed with the April 1933 issue. Gernsback cut the price to 15 cents again from June 1935 until the sale to Beacon Publications in 1936, though this time he did not reduce the page count. The short duration of these price cuts suggests Gernsback rapidly realized that the additional circulation they gained him cost too much in lost revenue. Under Beacon Publications "Thrilling Wonder" remained pulp-sized throughout.

There were two British reprint editions of "Thrilling Wonder". The earlier edition, from Atlas Publishing, produced three numbered issues from 1949 to 1950, and a further seven from 1952 to 1953. Another four issues appeared from Pemberton between 1953 and 1954; these were numbered from 101 to 104. There were Canadian editions in 1945–1946 and 1948–1951.

Gospel of the Ebionites

The Gospel of the Ebionites is the conventional name given by scholars to an <a href="apocryphal%20gospels">apocryphal gospel</a> extant only as seven brief quotations in a <a href="heresiology">heresiology</a> known as the "<a href="Panarion">Panarion</a>", by <a href="Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis">Epiphanius of Salamis</a>; he misidentified it as the "Hebrew" gospel, believing it to be a truncated and modified version of the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>. The quotations were embedded in a <a href="polemic">polemic</a> to point out inconsistencies in the beliefs and practices of a <a href="Jewish%20Christian">Jewish Christian</a> sect known as the <a href="Ebionites">Ebionites</a> relative to <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene</a> <a href="orthodoxy">orthodoxy</a>.

The surviving fragments derive from a <a href="gospel%20harmony">gospel harmony</a> of the <a href="Synoptic%20Gospels">Synoptic Gospels</a>, composed in <a href="Koine%20Greek">Greek</a> with various expansions and abridgments reflecting the theology of the writer. Distinctive features include the absence of the <a href="virgin%20birth%20of%20Jesus">virgin birth</a> and of the <a href="genealogy%20of%20Jesus">genealogy of Jesus</a>; an <a href="Adoptionist">Adoptionist</a> <a href="Christology">Christology</a>, in which Jesus is chosen to be <a href="Son%20of%20God">God's Son</a> at the time of his <a href="Baptism%20of%20Jesus">Baptism</a>; the abolition of the <a href="Korban">Jewish sacrifices</a> by Jesus; and an advocacy of <a href="vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a>. It is believed to have been composed some time during the middle of the 2nd century in or around the region <a href="Perea%20%28region%29">east of the Jordan River</a>. Although the gospel was said to be used by "Ebionites" during the time of the <a href="Early%20Christianity">early church</a>, the identity of the group or groups that used it remains a matter of conjecture.

The "Gospel of the Ebionites" is one of several <a href="Jewish-Christian%20gospels">Jewish–Christian gospels</a>, along with the "<a href="Gospel%20of%20the%20Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a>" and the "<a href="Gospel%20of%20the%20Nazarenes">Gospel of the Nazarenes</a>"; all survive only as fragments in quotations of the early <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a>. Due to their fragmentary state, the relationships, if any, between the Jewish–Christian gospels and a <a href="Hebrew%20Gospel%20hypothesis">hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel</a> are uncertain and have been a subject of intensive scholarly investigation. The Ebionite gospel has been recognized as distinct from the others, and it has been identified more closely with the lost "<a href="Gospel%20of%20the%20Twelve">Gospel of the Twelve</a>". It shows no dependence on the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a> and is similar in nature to the harmonized gospel sayings based on the Synoptic Gospels used by <a href="Justin%20Martyr">Justin Martyr</a>, although a relationship between them, if any, is uncertain. There is a similarity between the gospel and a source document contained within the <a href="Clementine%20literature">Clementine</a> "Recognitions" (1.27–71), conventionally referred to by scholars as the "<a href="Ascents%20of%20James">Ascents of James</a>", with respect to the command to abolish the Jewish sacrifices.

Epiphanius is believed to have come into possession of a gospel that he attributed to the Ebionites when he was bishop of <a href="Salamis%2C%20Cyprus">Salamis, Cyprus</a>. He alone among the Church Fathers identifies Cyprus as one of the "roots" of the Ebionites. The gospel survives only in seven brief quotations by Epiphanius in Chapter 30 of his heresiology the "Panarion", or "Medicine Chest", (c. 377) as a polemic against the Ebionites. His citations are often contradictory and thought to be based in part on his own conjecture. The various, sometimes conflicting, sources of information were combined to point out inconsistencies in Ebionite beliefs and practices relative to <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">Nicene orthodoxy</a>, possibly to serve, indirectly, as a polemic against the <a href="Arians">Arians</a> of his time.

The term "Gospel of the Ebionites" is a modern convention; no surviving document of the early church mentions a gospel by that name. Epiphanius identifies the gospel only as "in the Gospel used by them, called 'according to Matthew'" and "they call it 'the Hebrew [gospel]'". As early as 1689 the French priest <a href="Richard%20Simon%20%28priest%29">Richard Simon</a> called the text "Gospel of the Ebionites". The name is used by modern scholars as a convenient way to distinguish a gospel text that was probably used by the Ebionites from Epiphanius' mistaken belief that it was a Hebrew version of the Gospel of Matthew. Its place of origin is uncertain; one speculation is that it was composed in the region east of the Jordan where the Ebionites were said to have been present, according to the accounts of the Church Fathers. It is thought to have been composed during the middle of the 2nd century, since several other gospel harmonies are known to be from this period.

According to scholars <a href="Oskar%20Skarsaune">Oskar Skarsaune</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Alan%20Koch">Glenn Alan Koch</a>, Epiphanius incorporated excerpts from the gospel text at a late stage in the composition of "Panarion" 30, primarily in chapters 13 and 14 As Epiphanius describes it, "The Gospel which is found among them ... is not complete, but falsified and distorted ..." (13.1–2). In particular, it lacked some or all of the first two chapters of Matthew, which contain the <a href="infancy%20narrative">infancy narrative</a> of the virgin birth of Jesus and the <a href="David">David</a>ic genealogy via <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>, "They have removed the genealogies of Matthew ..." (14.2–3).

There is general agreement about the seven quotations by Epiphanius cited in the critical edition of "Jewish Christian gospels" by <a href="Philipp%20Vielhauer">Philipp Vielhauer</a> and Georg Strecker, translated by George Ogg, in <a href="Schneemelcher">Schneemelcher</a>'s "New Testament Apocrypha". The translations of <a href="Bernhard%20Pick">Bernhard Pick</a> (1908), with the sequence of four fragments arranged in the order of Vielhauer & Strecker from the beginning of the gospel are as follows:

The three quotations by Epiphanius in "Panarion" 30.13.6, 4, and 7, respectively, form the opening of the gospel narrative, including the mission of <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, his appearance and diet, and the baptism of Jesus by John. The beginning of the gospel (13.6) has parallels to the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> but in abbreviated form. The text shows a familiarity with the infancy narrative of Luke 1:5 despite lacking a birth narrative of its own. Quoting from the text regarding the diet of John (13.4), Epiphanius complains that the Ebionites have falsified the text by substituting the word "cake" ("egkris" ἐγκρίς) for "locust" ("akris" ἀκρίς, in Matthew 3:4). The similarity of the wording in Greek has led scholars to conclude that Greek was the original language of composition. In the narrative of the baptism of Jesus by John (13.7), the voice of God speaks three times in close parallels to the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Gospel of Mark</a> 1:11, Luke 3:23 (<a href="Western%20text-type">Western text-type</a>), and Matthew 3:17, respectively. The presence of multiple baptismal <a href="theophanies">theophanies</a> has led to a consensus among modern scholars that the text quoted by Epiphanius is a gospel harmony of the Synoptic Gospels. The appearance of a great light on the water may be an echo of <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">St. Paul</a>'s conversion or an additional harmonization of the "Gospel of the Hebrews" to this work.

Epiphanius begins his description of the gospel text (13.2b–3) with a quotation which has the <a href="apostle">apostle</a> <a href="Matthew%20the%20Apostle">Matthew</a> narrating directly to the reader. Jesus recalls how the <a href="twelve%20apostles">twelve apostles</a> were chosen and addresses Matthew in the second person as "you also Matthew". Although twelve apostles are mentioned, only eight are named. They are said to be chosen by Jesus, "for a testimony to Israel". The phrase "who chose us" has been interpreted as evidence that the text may be the lost "<a href="Gospel%20of%20the%20Twelve">Gospel of the Twelve</a>" mentioned by <a href="Origen">Origen</a>. However, the identification of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius with this otherwise unknown gospel is disputed. The position of this quotation was tentatively assigned based on a parallel to the Synoptic Gospels.

The fifth and sixth quotations (following Vielhauer & Strecker's order) are associated with a Christological controversy. The polemics of Epiphanius along with his quotations of the gospel text (in italics) are shown in parallel:

The fifth quotation (14.5) appears to be a harmony of Matthew 12:47–48 and its Synoptic parallels. However, Jesus' final proclamation shows a closer agreement to "<a href="2%20Clement">2 Clement</a>" 9:11 than any of the Synoptics. The unity of this quotation with the gospel text in Chapter 13 has been questioned. The command to abolish the sacrifices in the sixth quotation (16.5) is unparalleled in the Canonical Gospels, and it suggests a relationship to Matthew 5:17 ("I did not come to abolish the Law") that is echoed in the Clementine literature.

Referring to a parallel passage in Luke 22:15, Epiphanius complains that the Ebionites have again falsified the gospel text:

thereby making Jesus declare that he would not eat meat during the <a href="Passover">Passover</a>. The immediate context suggests the possible attribution of the quotation to a Clementine source; however a linkage between the gospel fragments and the Clementine literature remains uncertain.

The baptismal scene of the gospel text (13.7) is a harmony of the Synoptic Gospels, but one in which the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> is said to descend to Jesus in the form of a dove and "enter into him". This divine election at the time of his baptism is known as an Adoptionist Christology, and it is emphasized by the quotation of <a href="Psalm%202">Psalm 2</a>:7, as found in the "Western text" of Luke 3:22, "You are my son, this day I have begotten you." The Spirit entering into Jesus and the great light on the water are thought to be based on the prophecies of <a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a> 61:1 and 9:1, respectively. His Adoptionist son-ship is characterized by the belief that Jesus was a mere man, who, by virtue of his perfect righteousness, was imbued with the divinity of the eternal Christ through his Baptism in order to carry out the prophetic task for which he had been chosen.

The absence of any reference to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the <a href="end-time">end-time</a> <a href="prophet">prophet</a>, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more at home with the Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to <a href="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a>. According to scholars <a href="Richard%20Bauckham">Richard Bauckham</a> and <a href="Petri%20Luomanen">Petri Luomanen</a>, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than <a href="Substitutionary%20atonement">substituting</a> for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.

The change in wording of the gospel text from "locust" ("akris") to "cake" ("egkris") for John the Baptist's diet (13.4) has been interpreted as evidence of <a href="Jewish%20vegetarianism">Jewish vegetarianism</a>. However, the association of the diet of John the Baptist with vegetarianism has been questioned. Epiphanius gives no indication of concern for vegetarianism in this part of the Gospel text, and it may instead be an allusion to the <a href="manna">manna</a> in the wilderness of <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a> 16:31 and <a href="Book%20of%20Numbers">Numbers</a> 11:8, or, according to scholar Glenn Alan Koch, to <a href="1%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BKings">1 Kings</a> 19:6 where <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a> eats cakes in oil.

Further evidence has been found in the quotation based on Luke 22:15 (22.4), where the saying has been modified by insertion of the word "flesh" to provide a rationale for vegetarianism. The immediate context of the quotation suggests that it may be closely related to a Clementine source, the "Journeys of Peter". Reading from the same source, Epiphanius states that the Ebionites abstained from "meat with soul in it" (15.3), and he attributes this teaching to Ebionite interpolations "they corrupt the contents and leave a few genuine items". Due to the close association of this saying with the Clementine literature of the 3rd and 4th century, the earlier practice of vegetarianism by the 2nd-century Ebionites known to Irenaeus has been questioned. The strict vegetarianism of the Ebionites known to Epiphanius may have been a reaction to the cessation of Jewish sacrifices and a safeguard against the consumption of <a href="kosher">unclean meat</a> in a <a href="pagan">pagan</a> environment.

Epiphanius incorrectly refers to the gospel in his possession as the Gospel of Matthew and the gospel "according to the Hebrews", perhaps relying upon and conflating the writings of the earlier Church Fathers, Irenaeus and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, respectively. His 4th century colleague <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> remarks that the <a href="Nazarene%20%28sect%29">Nazarenes</a> and Ebionites both used the "Gospel of the Hebrews", which was considered the original Matthew by many of them. Jerome's report is consistent with the prior accounts of Irenaeus and Eusebius.

The relationship between the "Gospel of the Ebionites", the "Gospel of the Hebrews", and the "Gospel of the Nazarenes" remains unclear. All the Jewish–Christian gospels survive only as fragments in quotations, so it is difficult to tell if they are independent texts or variations of each other. Scholar <a href="Albertus%20Klijn">Albertus Klijn</a> established the modern consensus, concluding that the gospel harmony composed in Greek appears to be a distinctive text known only to Epiphanius. Scholar <a href="Marie-%C3%89mile%20Boismard">Marie-Émile Boismard</a> has claimed the Ebionite gospel is partly dependent upon a <a href="Hebrew%20gospel%20hypothesis">hypothetical Hebrew gospel</a> as a source; however this conjecture remains a minority view. Its putative relationship to the gospel text known to Origen as the "Gospel of the Twelve" remains a subject of scholarly debate.

The Ebionite gospel is one example of a type of gospel harmony that used the Gospel of Matthew as a base text but did not include the Gospel of John; it is believed to pre-date <a href="Tatian">Tatian</a>'s <a href="Diatessaron">Diatessaron</a> (c. 170) which included all four <a href="canonical%20gospels">canonical gospels</a>. The gospel has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century <a href="homily">homily</a> known as "2 Clement", suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his <a href="First%20Apology">First Apology</a> and <a href="Dialogue%20with%20Trypho">Dialogue with Trypho</a> were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar <a href="George%20Howard%20%28Hebraist%29">George Howard</a>, harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found in the "Gospel of the Ebionites" may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.

The "Recognitions of Clement" contains a source document ("Rec." 1.27–71), conventionally referred to by scholars as the "Ascents of James", which is believed to be of Jewish–Christian origin. The "Ascents" shares a similarity to the "Gospel of the Ebionites" with regard to the baptism of the Pharisees by John ("Pan." 30.13.4; "Rec." 1.54.6–7) and the command to abolish the Jewish sacrifices, adding that a Christian water baptism is to be substituted for the remission of <a href="Christian%20views%20on%20sin">sins</a>. Based on these similarities, scholars Richard Bauckham and <a href="F.%20Stanley%20Jones">F. Stanley Jones</a> have postulated a direct dependence of the "Ascents of James" on the "Gospel of the Ebionites".

The gospel Epiphanius attributed to the Ebionites is a valuable source of information that provides modern scholars with insights into the distinctive characteristics of a vanished branch of Jewish Christianity. However, scholars disagree on whether the information contained within the seven fragments preserved by Epiphanius accurately reflects the traditions of the second-century Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus, or if their belief system changed, perhaps greatly, over a span of 200 years compared to this early group. The Ebionites known to Irenaeus (first mentioned in "<a href="Adversus%20Haereses">Adversus Haereses</a>" 1.26.2, written around 185) and other Church Fathers prior to Epiphanius were described as a Jewish sect that regarded Jesus as the Messiah but not as <a href="God%20the%20Son">divine</a>. They insisted on the necessity of following <a href="Halakha">Jewish law and rites</a> and they used only the Jewish–Christian gospel. The Ebionites rejected the epistles of <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">Paul of Tarsus</a>, whom they regarded as an <a href="Antinomianism%23Pauline%20passages%20supporting%20antinomianism">apostate from the Law</a>.

In Epiphanius' polemic against the Ebionites found in "Panarion" 30, a complex picture emerges of the beliefs and practices of the 4th century Ebionites that cannot easily be separated from his method of combining together disparate sources. While scholars such as <a href="Hans-Joachim%20Schoeps">Hans-Joachim Schoeps</a> literally interpreted Epiphanius' account as describing a later <a href="syncretic">syncretic</a> development of Ebionism, more recent scholarship has found it difficult to reconcile his report with those of the earlier Church Fathers, leading to a conjecture by scholar Petri Luomanen that a second group of <a href="Hellenistic%20Judaism">Hellenistic</a>-<a href="Samaritan">Samaritan</a> Ebionites may also have been present. The rejection of the Jewish sacrifices and the implication of an end-time prophet Christology due to the lack of a birth narrative lend support for the association of the "Gospel of the Ebionites" with a group or groups different from the Ebionites known to Irenaeus.

Scholarship in the area of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on artificial constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail to take into account the pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention has been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.

Hare coursing

Hare coursing is the pursuit of <a href="hare">hare</a>s with <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>s and other <a href="sighthound">sighthound</a>s, which chase the hare by sight, not by scent.

In some countries, it is a legal, competitive activity in which dogs are tested on their ability to run, overtake and turn a hare, rather than a form of hunting aiming at the capture of <a href="Game%20%28food%29">game</a>. It has a number of variations in its rules around the world. Coursing can also be a form of <a href="hunting">hunting</a> or <a href="pest%20control">pest control</a>. It is a long-established hunting technique, practiced historically in England, especially with <a href="greyhounds">greyhounds</a> or sighthound breeds, or with <a href="lurcher">lurcher</a>s which are crossbred sighthounds. The sport grew in popularity in Europe during the 19th century, but has since experienced a decline due in part to the introduction of <a href="greyhound%20racing">greyhound racing</a> with betting, and animal welfare legislation.

In recent decades, controversy has developed around hare coursing, with some viewing it as a cruel <a href="bloodsport">bloodsport</a>. 
Hare coursing is illegal in Scotland, Wales and England and became illegal in Northern Ireland in 2011. It, however, continues elsewhere in the world as a regulated and judged, competitive sport, in places like the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, <a href="Iberia">Iberia</a>, and the <a href="Western%20United%20States">Western United States</a>.

Whether for sporting or hunting purposes, hare coursing was in Europe historically restricted to landowners and the nobility, who used sighthounds, the ownership of which was at certain historic times prohibited among the lower social classes.

The oldest documented description of hare coursing is the work known in English as "On Coursing". It was written by <a href="Arrian">Arrian</a> a Greek historian of <a href="Roman%20Greece">the Roman period</a>, circa 180 AD and is known in Anicent Greek as "Kynegetikos" and in Latin as "Cynegeticus". Arrian felt compelled to describe the sight hunt and sighthounds because the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greeks</a> only knew the scent hunt; "On Coursing" complements <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>'s classic work on that subject, "Cynegeticus" ("On Hunting"). <a href="William%20Dansey">William Dansey</a>, an English clergyman, translated "On Coursing" in 1831.

It is from Arrian that the most famous quote on the sporting fairness of coursing originates: "... true huntsmen do not take out their hounds to catch the creature, but for a trial of speed and a race, and they are satisfied if the hare manages to find something that will rescue her".

The competitive version of hare coursing was given definitive form when the first complete set of English rules was drawn up in the reign of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> by <a href="Thomas%20Howard%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk</a>, providing for a pursuit of no more than two hounds, a headstart termed "Law" to be given to the hare for a fair run, and for the manner of awarding points on "Speed", "Go-bye", "Turn", "Wrench", "Kill" & "Trip", to judge the dogs' performance.

The first modern coursing club was established at <a href="Swaffham">Swaffham</a> in 1776, and the <a href="National%20Coursing%20Club">National Coursing Club</a> was founded to regulate the sport in 1858. From 1876 coursing meets were held at <a href="Plumpton%2C%20East%20Sussex">Plumpton, East Sussex</a> and this name was used for such events in Australia.

During the 19th century, coursing crossed the class divide, and reached its peak of popularity, with more than 150 coursing clubs in Britain, some attracting up to 80,000 people. By the late 19th century, hare coursing had become a predominantly <a href="working%20class">working class</a> sport.

Coursing declined during the 20th century, notably due to the development of urban <a href="greyhound%20racing">greyhound racing</a> in the 1920s and there were fewer than 30 coursing clubs in the UK by 2000.

The oldest form of hare coursing simply involved two dogs chasing a hare, the winner being the dog that caught the hare; this could be for sport, food or <a href="pest%20control">pest control</a>. In order to indulge in the informal practice, or hunting, various cross breeds (under the generic British term <a href="lurcher">lurcher</a>s) have been created; such animals may be specifically bred for coursing, such as the staghounds used to hunt coyote in the United States. Informal coursing has long been closely associated with pheasant hunting or <a href="poaching">poaching</a>, lacking the landowner's permission, and is often seen as a problem by the local public, landowners and the police. Clubs affiliated to the Association of Lurcher Clubs organised informal coursing with the landowner's permission, sometimes using a single lurcher rather than a pair to chase a hare.

Lure coursing is a sport for dogs based on hare coursing, but involving dogs chasing a mechanically operated lure. Some critics of hare coursing suggest that coursers could test their dogs through lure coursing. However, coursers believe that, while lure coursing is good athletic exercise for their dogs, it does not approximate the testing vigour and sport of live coursing.<a href="http%3A//fernhill.com/about-deerhounds/lure-bite-deerhounds-lure-coursing/"></a>

Hare coursing was banned in the U.K. by the <a href="Hunting%20Act%202004">Hunting Act 2004</a>. However, as of 2015 it continues, illegally. Allegedly, typical organised group coursing involves two to 12 people walking in a line approximately 10 metres apart and then slipping their dogs to chase flushed hares. The dogs may be filmed so that the coursing can be played later, if & when betting occurs. It is suggested that hare coursing occurs on a large scale in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, although the "gangs" may travel large distances to course hares.<a href="https%3A//www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hare-coursing-gangs-terrorising-farmers-with-illicit-underground-competitions-a6783411.html"></a>

Modern hare coursing is practiced using a number of sighthounds: mainly <a href="greyhounds">greyhounds</a> but also <a href="Borzoi">Borzoi</a>s, <a href="Saluki">Saluki</a>s, <a href="Whippets">Whippets</a>, and <a href="Scottish%20Deerhound">Deerhounds</a> that are registered with a governing body such as the National Coursing Club or Kennel Club in Great Britain, the Irish Coursing Club, or the <a href="National%20Open%20Field%20Coursing%20Association">National Open Field Coursing Association</a> (NOFCA) in the US. Events are conducted through local coursing clubs which are regulated by their governing body. The objective of legal formal coursing is to test and judge the athletic ability of the dogs rather than to kill the hare.

Legal, formal hare coursing has a number of variations in how it is undertaken. Open coursing takes place in the open field, and closed coursing (or park or Irish style) takes place in an enclosure with an escape route. Open coursing is either run as "walked-up" coursing, where a line of people walk through the countryside to flush out a hare, or as "driven coursing", where hares are driven by beaters towards the coursing field. In each case, when a suitable hare appears, a person known as a "slipper" uses a "slip" with two collars to release two dogs at the same time, in pursuit of the hare which is given a head start (known as "fair law"), usually between (). The sighthound is released elsewhere by the handler.

The chased hare will then run at around 40–45 km/h (24–26 mph) and the course will last around 35–40 seconds over 0.5 km (0.3 miles). The greyhounds which pursue the hare will, being faster, start to catch up with it. As greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile, they find it difficult to follow the hares' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs. This agility gives the hare an important and often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape. Under some coursing club rules, the dogs are awarded points on how many times they can turn the hare, and how closely they force the hare's progress. In the UK, the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback, and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next round of a <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament">knock-out</a> tournament. The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February.

Hare coursing is popular in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, with the national meeting in <a href="Clonmel">Clonmel</a>, <a href="County%20Tipperary">County Tipperary</a>, being the most important event in the coursing calendar, attracting 10,000 spectators, and claimed by its organisers to be worth up to €16 million for the local economy. There are around 70 formal coursing clubs in the Republic and two in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, together holding 80–85 meetings per year.

There are several differences between the rules of coursing in Great Britain (where it is regulated by the <a href="National%20Coursing%20Club">National Coursing Club</a>) and Irish coursing which has been organised by the Irish Coursing Club since 1916. Because hares are not plentiful in all parts of the <a href="Ireland">island of Ireland</a>, mainly due to modern <a href="Agriculture">agricultural practices</a>, coursing clubs are licensed by the Irish government to net 70–75 hares for their events. The hares are then transported in boxes to the coursing venue where they are kept for up to eight weeks and trained to be coursed.

Instead of being coursed on open land, the Irish form is run in a secure enclosure over a set distance. Since 1993, Irish Coursing Club rules have made it compulsory for the greyhounds to be <a href="Muzzle%20%28device%29">muzzled</a> while they chase the hare. After the coursing event, the hares are transported back to where they were netted and re-released into the wild. Whereas the UK form of coursing was run with dogs winning points for their running and turning of the hare, the Republic of Ireland form is run on the basis that the first dog to turn the hare wins. This is denoted by either a red flag or a white flag, indicating the colours of the respective dogs' collars.

Greyhounds were introduced in the Americas for sport and pleasure, they helped farmers control jackrabbits, and organised coursing meets were taking place in the United States in the 19th century, by 1886 according to <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf Coast</a> Greyhounds. "Open field coursing" of <a href="hare">jackrabbits</a>, which are members of the hare family, now takes place in a number of states in Western America, including <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a> and <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, and is said by the North American Coursing Association to take place also in <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> and <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. It takes place with up to four dogs chasing the hare.

The legality of hare coursing across the different <a href="U.S.%20state">states of the USA</a> is not always clear. Animal Place, a California-based animal rights group which opposes coursing, claims that the activity is legal in California, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming but illegal in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> and <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. The pro-coursing campaign, Stop2110 says that open field coursing is legal in all US states with a huntable population of jackrabbits. <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a> state lists jackrabbits as a protected species, due to an unusually low population for a western state, and bans all forms of hunting them.

During the 2006–07 coursing season, the leading United States coursing body, the National Open Field Coursing Association, registered 480 dogs of various breeds, and oversaw 83 coursing events. Its quarry is the <a href="black-tailed%20jackrabbit">black-tailed jackrabbit</a>. Coursing of <a href="white-tailed%20jackrabbit">white-tailed jackrabbit</a>s is organised by a smaller body, the North American Coursing Association.

According to the UK Government review, the <a href="Burns%20Inquiry">Burns Inquiry</a> (published in 2000), hare coursing was taking place in Pakistan, Portugal and Spain. Pakistan has officially prohibited the use of dogs or hawks for coursing unless a special licence is issued for carrying out such activity although, according to some reports, hare coursing is still practised and popular. Hare coursing in Portugal is run in both forms: open ("Prova de Galgos a Campo"), and closed (park) coursing where it is known as "lebre a corricão". Hare coursing in Portugal may only be legally undertaken with two dogs and operates under the same ethos as coursing in the United States. In Spain, the hare coursing is "open coursing", and the areas where the activity takes place includes the Medinrua area. Coursing has long been undertaken in Spain, where <a href="Galgo%20Espa%C3%B1ol">Spanish galgos</a> rather than greyhounds are used. These dogs have a precarious life after their coursing careers, with <a href="World%20Animal%20Protection">World Animal Protection</a> suggesting that many tens of thousands die cruelly each year. Hare coursing also takes place in Russia but is illegal in most European countries and in Australia, where it had a long history from 1867 until it was banned in 1985 following a long decline in popularity.

As long ago as 1516, <a href="Thomas%20More">Thomas More</a> wrote in "<a href="Utopia">Utopia</a>" that,
Coursing has long sparked opposition from activists concerned about <a href="animal%20welfare">animal welfare</a>. In 1892, <a href="Lady%20Florence%20Dixie">Lady Florence Dixie</a> criticised hare coursing as an "aggravated form of torture" and the <a href="League%20Against%20Cruel%20Sports">League Against Cruel Sports</a> was established in 1924 to campaign against <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a> coursing on <a href="Lower%20Morden">Morden Common</a> and continues to believe that it is wrong to expose animals to the risk of injury or death for human entertainment. The <a href="Waterloo%20Cup">Waterloo Cup</a> became a centrepiece of the campaign against coursing in the UK. In opposition, coursing has long enjoyed the fame of being known as "the noblest of field sports" precisely because the death of the hare is not the aim of the sport. Under most regulated forms of coursing only two hounds pursue the hare, the dogs competing against each other for a short time, and allowing the hare a significant chance of escape.

Until the 1970s, there was a dearth of <a href="scientific%20evidence">scientific evidence</a> on the welfare impact of coursing. The first thorough study was carried out in 1977–79 by the <a href="Universities%20Federation%20for%20Animal%20Welfare">Universities Federation for Animal Welfare</a> (UFAW), albeit that it said that it was "not easy to draw conclusions from these reports". According to a review of this study conducted for the <a href="Burns%20Inquiry">Burns Inquiry</a>, "Of the 53 hares killed, 43 had neck injuries, 18 of which were inflicted by the handler (as evidenced from a clean break and no teeth marks). No clean breaks were believed to have been caused by dogs (where tooth marks were evident). The UFAW team's assessment was that all chest injuries would have been quickly fatal (in six cases these included a punctured heart); 10 animals without neck injuries had chest injuries. Abdominal injuries included six punctured livers, but generally involved a ruptured gut. In the UFAW team's opinion, hindleg and <a href="Back%20injury">back injuries</a> could have been extremely painful until chest or neck injuries were inflicted".

The Burns Inquiry, set up by the UK Government to examine hunting with dogs in <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a>, which included coursing, concluded that "We are ... satisfied that being pursued, caught and killed by dogs during coursing seriously compromises the welfare of the hare. It is clear, moreover, that, if the dog or dogs catch the hare, they do not always kill it quickly. There can also sometimes be a significant delay, in "driven" coursing, before the "picker-up" reaches the hare and dispatches it (if it is not already dead). In the case of "walked-up" coursing, the delay is likely to be even longer".

Since the introduction of muzzling for greyhounds in 1993, deaths to hares are less common, falling from an average of 16% to about 4% of hares coursed (reducing to around 150–200 hares per year). Muzzled dogs are more likely to buffet a hare than to bite it, a factor that may still affect the hare's subsequent survival. Hares can either die due to injuries sustained by contact with the much larger dogs or due to capture <a href="myopathy">myopathy</a>. The report from the official Countryside ranger at the Wexford Coursing Club meeting in December 2003 confirms that, exceptionally, 40 hares died at the event and the report of the <a href="veterinary%20surgeon">veterinary surgeon</a> who examined the hares blames the "significant stress" of being "corralled and coursed". Coursing supporters deny that hare coursing is cruel and say that hares that are injured, pregnant or ill are not allowed to run. Hares are reported to be examined by a vet before and after racing.

In the context of open (not park) coursing, the (British) National Coursing Club evidence to the Burns Inquiry said that muzzled coursing can cause more suffering than unmuzzled if the coursing officials are not able to reach injured hares quickly. The <a href="Irish%20Council%20Against%20Bloodsports">Irish Council Against Bloodsports</a>, an organisation that campaigns against hare coursing has video evidence that shows this happening, even in enclosed coursing.

In 2000, the rules of the UK National Coursing Club awarded a point to a greyhound that killed a hare "through superior dash and speed". By early 2003, this rule had been deleted to remove the appearance of the kill incentive. Observers of hare coursing at the Waterloo Cup – the most important event in the UK coursing calendar until it was last held in 2005 – regularly reported a minority of people in the crowd cheering when hares were killed. In 2005 in the US, points were still awarded for a "touch ... where the quarry is captured or killed".

The number of hares killed in coursing is unclear. The UK government's <a href="Burns%20Inquiry">Burns Inquiry</a> which submitted its final report in 2000 said that about 250 hares were killed each year in formal coursing. although much larger numbers of kills are believed to take place in informal coursing. The UK National Coursing Club and the organisers of the now defunct Waterloo Cup said that, on average, one in seven or eight hares coursed were killed. Inspectors from the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Animals">Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a> who attended the event estimated that a greater number, one in five hares coursed, were killed.

During the 2013 season, the <a href="National%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20Service%20%28Ireland%29">Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service</a> oversaw 23 hare coursing meetings. Over 100 hares “required assistance” after being struck during races, which led to over 20 of them dying of natural causes or having to be euthanised.

In different parts of the world two contrasting arguments are made in favour of hare coursing. In some places, the high densities of hare leads to the animals being considered as agricultural <a href="pest%20%28animal%29">pests</a> – a view taken, for example, by the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Food%20and%20Agriculture">California Department of Agriculture</a>. Coursing is sometimes defended on this basis, even though the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife</a> has said that coursing does not "reduce the population enough to alleviate damage".

Elsewhere, such as in the UK, hares are not always seen as pests, and there are <a href="Biodiversity%20Action%20Plan%23Species%20plans">species action plans</a> aiming to significantly increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.

The practice of hare coursing has only recently, in historical terms, been debated in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a>, although Parliament created an exemption in 1921 from the <a href="animal%20cruelty">cruelty</a> legislation, the <a href="Protection%20of%20Animals%20Act%201911">Protection of Animals Act 1911</a>, for animals released for coursing. <a href="Eric%20Heffer">Eric Heffer</a>, MP for <a href="Liverpool%20Walton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Liverpool Walton</a>, was a major opponent of coursing in the late 1960s, and Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> joined in the criticism.

Under Wilson's premiership, the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> voted for Government Bills to ban hare coursing in 1969 and 1975, but neither passed the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> to become law. In 2002, the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> passed the <a href="Protection%20of%20Wild%20Mammals%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%202002">Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act</a>, which banned hare coursing in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. In 2004 the British Parliament passed the <a href="Hunting%20Act%202004">Hunting Act</a>, which banned hare coursing as well as other forms of <a href="Fox%20hunting">hunting with hounds</a> with effect from 18 February 2005. Prosecutions were successful against two hare coursers in 2008 and against two Yorkshire landowners in 2009. The private prosecution brought against the organisers of the March 2007 North Yorkshire event organised by a Field Trialling Club clarified in September 2009 that hare coursing is still an illegal activity under the <a href="Hunting%20Act%202004">Hunting Act 2004</a> even if the dogs used are <a href="muzzle%20%28device%29">muzzle</a>d.

No formal coursing has taken place in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> since 2002, as Ministers have refused the coursing clubs permission to net hares, and have protected them from being coursed or hunted under the <a href="Game%20Preservation%20Act%20%28Northern%20Ireland%29%201928">Game Preservation (Northern Ireland) Act</a> and in June 2010 the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> voted to ban the practice. The two extant Northern Ireland coursing clubs since 2002 have travelled to the Republic to hold meetings jointly with coursing clubs there. <a href="Opinion%20poll">Opinion poll</a>s commissioned by the <a href="League%20Against%20Cruel%20Sports">League Against Cruel Sports</a> as part of its campaigning have shown very strong public opposition to hare coursing from both urban and rural residents of Northern Ireland (and the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>).

In 2015, it was reported that hare coursing incidents had fallen by approximately 78 per cent across <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> since the re-launch of an operation against coursing in September 2013.

In early 2006, the <a href="Television%20channel">TV channel</a> <a href="KABC-TV">ABC 7</a> showed a film of coursing with sets of three greyhounds competing in the chase of a number of hares. Coursing was banned in <a href="Solano%20County%2C%20California">the County concerned</a>, and California Assemblywoman <a href="Loni%20Hancock">Loni Hancock</a> promoted a bill, AB2110, to make it a crime for any person in California to engage in open field coursing – defined as a "competition in which dogs are, by the use of rabbits, hares, or foxes, assessed as to skill in hunting live rabbits, hares, or foxes". A pro-coursing campaign was also established. The Bill was passed by the Public Safety Committee but did not become law.

Royal baccarat scandal

The royal baccarat scandal, also known as the Tranby Croft affair, was a British gambling scandal of the late 19th century involving the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>—the future King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>. The scandal started during a house party in September 1890, when <a href="Sir%20William%20Gordon-Cumming%2C%204th%20Baronet">Sir William Gordon-Cumming</a>, a <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">lieutenant-colonel</a> in the <a href="Scots%20Guards">Scots Guards</a>, was accused of cheating at <a href="Baccarat%20%28card%20game%29">baccarat</a>.

Edward had been invited to stay at <a href="Tranby%20Croft">Tranby Croft</a>, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, the home of <a href="Arthur%20Wilson%20%28shipping%20magnate%29">Arthur Wilson</a> and his family. Among Edward's party were his advisers, <a href="George%20Coventry%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Coventry">Lord Coventry</a> and Lieutenant-General <a href="Owen%20Lewis%20Cope%20Williams">Owen Williams</a>; Gordon-Cumming, a friend of the prince, was also invited. On the first night the guests played baccarat, and Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming illegally adding to his stake. Stanley informed other members of the Wilson family, and they agreed to watch him on the following evening. Gordon-Cumming was again seen to be acting in a suspicious manner. The family members asked the advice of the royal courtiers who, with the agreement of the prince, confronted Gordon-Cumming and pressured him into signing a document that declared he would never play cards again, in exchange for the silence of the guests.

The secret was not kept for long, and Gordon-Cumming demanded a retraction from the Wilson family, whom he considered to blame for divulging the news. They refused, and he filed a writ for <a href="Defamation">slander</a> in February 1891. Despite the efforts of the prince's courtiers to have the matter dealt with by a <a href="court-martial">military court</a>, the case was heard in June 1891. The atmosphere at trial was described as being like a theatre, and Edward was called as a witness, the second time the heir to the throne had been compelled to appear in court having previously entered the witness box during the notorious Mordaunt divorce case of 1871. Gordon-Cumming's senior counsel, the <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Solicitor General</a> <a href="Edward%20George%20Clarke">Sir Edward Clarke</a>, did not persuade any of the defendants to change their stories, but he highlighted several inaccuracies and serious discrepancies in their evidence. Despite a strong and well-regarded closing speech by Clarke on Gordon-Cumming's behalf, the judge's summing up was described as biased by some, and the jury found against the lieutenant-colonel.

Gordon-Cumming was dismissed from the army the following day, and was ostracised from society for the rest of his life. A leader in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" stated that "He has committed a mortal offence. Society can know him no more." Public opinion was on his side, and the prince was at his most unpopular for several years afterwards. The affair has been of subsequent interest to writers; two books have examined the matter, and there have been two fictionalised accounts of the events.

At the time of the events at the country home <a href="Tranby%20Croft">Tranby Croft</a>, Yorkshire, <a href="Sir%20William%20Gordon-Cumming%2C%204th%20Baronet">Sir William Gordon-Cumming</a> was a 42-year-old <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">lieutenant-colonel</a> in the <a href="Scots%20Guards">Scots Guards</a>, having seen service in <a href="Anglo-Zulu%20War">South Africa</a> (1879), <a href="Anglo-Egyptian%20War%20%281882%29">Egypt</a> (1882) and <a href="Mahdist%20War">Sudan</a> (1884–85). Gordon-Cumming's biographer, Jason Tomes, thought that his subject possessed "audacity and wit [and] gloried in the sobriquet of the most arrogant man in London", while "<a href="Sporting%20Life%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Sporting Life</a>" described him as "possibly the most handsome man in London, and certainly the rudest". In addition to considerable land holdings in Scotland, Gordon-Cumming owned a house in <a href="Belgravia">Belgravia</a>, London; he was a friend of the Prince of Wales, and would lend it to the prince for assignations with royal mistresses. Gordon-Cumming was a womaniser, and stated that his aim was to "perforate" members of "the sex"; his liaisons included <a href="Lillie%20Langtry">Lillie Langtry</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a> and <a href="Lady%20Randolph%20Churchill">Lady Randolph Churchill</a>. He was unmarried at the time of the events and subsequent court case.

<a href="Edward%20VII">Edward, Prince of Wales</a> was a 49-year-old married father of five at the time he visited Tranby Croft, and had a history of association with scandals. In 1866 he had incurred the censure of his mother, <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, when he became involved with "the fast racing set", and his betting had "harm[ed] his reputation and contribute[d] to the widespread unpopularity of the monarchy in this period", according to his biographer, <a href="Sidney%20Lee">Sidney Lee</a>.

In April 1869 <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Mordaunt%2C%2010th%20Baronet">Sir Charles Mordaunt</a> (1836–1897) learnt that his wife had had three separate affairs, and that her lovers included the heir to the throne. Although Mordaunt did not carry out his threat of citing the prince as co-respondent in the subsequent divorce case, Edward was <a href="subpoena">subpoena</a>ed to appear in court as a witness. Although Edward did not want to appear—and the queen wrote to the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> to see if this could be avoided—the law was such that the heir to the throne could be forced to appear if necessary. The prince appeared voluntarily and was in the witness box for seven minutes, during which time he denied having had a sexual relationship with Mordaunt's wife; he was not cross-examined. Edward's biographer, <a href="Colin%20Matthew">Colin Matthew</a>, wrote that "the hearing coincided with general criticism of the very different deportments of both the queen and the prince. The latter was several times booed in public". Despite the "<a href="L%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9">taboo on open criticism</a> on [the prince's] actions, an undercurrent of dissatisfaction existed" with him and his actions. For Edward, although such affairs could be discussed between friends, scandal was to be avoided wherever possible.

In 1890 the prince gave up dancing, telling his son <a href="George%20V">George</a> that "I am getting too old and fat for these amusements"; he replaced dancing with other pursuits, like attending the opera and playing <a href="Baccarat%20%28card%20game%29">baccarat</a>. He enjoyed baccarat so much that when he travelled he brought a set of leather counters, valued on one side from five shillings to £10 and engraved with <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%27s%20feathers">his feathers</a> on the other; the counters had been a present from his friend Reuben Sassoon, a member of the <a href="Sassoon%20family">well-known banking family</a>.

Surrounding the prince was a fashionable clique known as the <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a> set, named after the <a href="Marlborough%20House">prince's home</a> overlooking <a href="The%20Mall%2C%20London">The Mall</a>, London. The set was a mixture of old titled families and "plutocratic and parvenu" families with fortunes from new industry, and Edward carried out an active policy to spread the social circle of the royal family to include new industrialists such as the shipping magnate <a href="Arthur%20Wilson%20%28shipping%20magnate%29">Arthur Wilson</a>.

Arthur Wilson was the 52-year-old <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>-based owner of a shipping business. He built his home at Tranby Croft, in the <a href="East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">East Riding of Yorkshire</a>, as a Victorian country house, and he and his family moved in during the summer of 1876. As well as a wife, Mary, he also had a son, (Arthur) Stanley Wilson, and a daughter, Ethel; her husband, Edward Lycett Green was the son of the local manufacturer and MP, <a href="Sir%20Edward%20Green%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Edward Green</a>. Tomes reports that Gordon-Cumming may have previously propositioned Ethel Lycett Green.

Baccarat is a game for up to 20 players, together with a banker and croupier; several packs of cards are used, depending on the number of players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip value, while tens and <a href="face%20card">court cards</a> count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10s and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.

In 1886 the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court of Justice</a> in London ruled in the Parks case—"Jenks v. Turpin"—that baccarat was a game of chance rather than skill, and was therefore illegal when gambling was involved. In reporting the case, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described baccarat as "a new game, partly of chance, at which £1,000 may be lost in 20 minutes". After a solicitor asked the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="Henry%20Matthews%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Llandaff">Henry Matthews</a>, to clarify the position regarding baccarat in social clubs and private houses, the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> civil servant <a href="Godfrey%20Lushington">Godfrey Lushington</a> stated that there was nothing in the court's judgment that made baccarat illegal if not played for money.

The former <a href="Shadow%20Home%20Secretary">Shadow Home Secretary</a> and historian <a href="Roy%20Hattersley">Roy Hattersley</a> comments that although baccarat was illegal, "worse still in the eyes of many Englishmen, [it was] thought to be popular in France".

In the years running up to 1890 the Prince of Wales had taken to visiting <a href="Doncaster%20Racecourse">Doncaster Racecourse</a> for the <a href="Doncaster%20Cup">Doncaster Cup</a>. In previous years he had stayed at <a href="Brantingham%20Thorpe">Brantingham Thorpe</a> with his friend <a href="Christopher%20Sykes%20%28politician%29">Christopher Sykes</a>, the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> Member of Parliament for <a href="Beverley%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Beverley</a>. Sykes had run into financial difficulties and could not afford to host Edward, and Tranby Croft, home to Arthur Wilson and family, became the venue. After consulting with the prince, the Wilsons also invited some of Edward's inner circle, including Sykes, Gordon-Cumming and the prince's courtiers: the <a href="equerry">equerry</a> Tyrwhitt Wilson, <a href="George%20Coventry%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Coventry">Lord Coventry</a>, Lord Edward Somerset, Captain Arthur Somerset—his cousin—and Lieutenant-General <a href="Owen%20Lewis%20Cope%20Williams">Owen Williams</a>, along with their wives. Also accompanying the party was Lieutenant <a href="Berkeley%20John%20Talbot%20Levett">Berkeley Levett</a>, a brother officer to Gordon-Cumming in the Scots Guards and a friend of the Wilson family.

Among those originally invited were <a href="Francis%20Greville%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Lord Brooke</a> and his wife <a href="Daisy%20Greville%2C%20Countess%20of%20Warwick">Daisy</a>; her step-father died two days before the party was due to leave London, and she and her husband withdrew from the trip. Daisy, the prince's mistress at the time, was known to some journalists as "babbling" Brooke because of her propensity to gossip. On 6 September Edward returned early from travelling in Europe; he visited Harriet Street where he found Daisy Brooke "in Gordon-Cumming's arms", which soured the relationship between the two men.

After dinner on 8 September, the guests at Tranby Croft listened to music from Ethel Lycett Green until about 11 pm, when the prince suggested a game of baccarat. Although the Wilsons did not have a suitably-sized table, Stanley Wilson improvised, putting two card tables alongside the smoking room table—all of which were of differing sizes—and covered them with a tapestry cloth. Among the evening's players were the prince, who acted as dealer; Sassoon, who took the part of banker; and Gordon-Cumming. Sitting next to the last-named was Stanley Wilson, who was on Levett's left.

As the game began Gordon-Cumming discussed the tapestry with Wilson, commenting that the different colours of the cloth made it difficult to see the counters; Gordon-Cumming put a piece of white paper in front of him on which to place his now highly-visible stake. Although many of the inexperienced party were playing for small stakes, Gordon-Cumming was betting between £5 and £25 for a coup; he played the system of betting, in which if he won a hand with a £5 stake, he would add his winnings to the stake, together with another £5, as the stake for the next hand. Soon after play began Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming add two red £5 counters onto his stake after the hand had finished, but before the stake had been paid—a method of cheating known in casinos as ; after he thought that this had happened a second time, Wilson turned to Levett and, according to the later court transcripts, whispered "My God, Berkeley, this is too hot!" further explaining that "the man next to me is cheating!" After Levett also watched for a few minutes, he agreed, saying to Wilson "this is too hot". After half an hour the game was completed and the prince congratulated Gordon-Cumming on his play; the future king also asked Mrs Wilson for a more suitable table for the following day. Stanley Wilson instructed the butler to move a longer, three-foot wide table in and cover it with green baize. Wilson then discussed the cheating with Levett. The two men were uncertain what steps to take, and agreed that Stanley would ask his brother-in-law, Lycett Green, for his advice. Although Lycett Green thought it impossible that Gordon-Cumming would have cheated, Stanley told him that he was certain, as was Levett.

The following day, 9 September, the party visited the races, where the prince's horse won the Clumber Stakes. After dinner the prince once again wanted to play baccarat and asked for a chalk line to be drawn on the baize, six inches from the edge, behind which players were to keep their counters when not placing their stake. Edward was banker and Williams acted as the <a href="croupier">croupier</a>. When Gordon-Cumming arrived at the table, there were only two vacant seats. At either of them, Gordon-Cumming would be surrounded by members of the Wilson family, all of whom had been informed of Stanley and Levett's suspicions.
After half an hour's play Lycett Green once again became convinced that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left the table and sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was finished Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all of whom had been watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they differed in their versions of what they saw. Others saw nothing, including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225, £100 more than anyone else.

Mary Wilson's brother died unexpectedly that night in Hull; although she and her husband did not attend for a second day's racing, they asked all the other guests not to interrupt the plans, and the remainder of the party attended, watching the <a href="St%20Leger%20Stakes">St Leger Stakes</a>. During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling him that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.
When the party returned to Tranby Croft that evening Lycett Green, Stanley Wilson and both Somersets met Coventry; Levett refused to attend. After Lycett Green had told Coventry what he had seen, the latter summoned Williams, who was a mutual friend of both the prince and Gordon-Cumming. Lycett Green repeated the allegation once again. Williams later recounted that he was "shocked and overwhelmed with a sense of calamity", and said that Edward must be informed immediately. There was some disagreement between the courtiers on whether to tell the prince; Coventry and Wilson both thought it the right move, but Arthur Somerset felt that the matter could and should be dealt with by those present. Later he was persuaded that informing the prince was the right course of action. Lycett Green grew more pugnacious throughout the discussions, and threatened to accuse Gordon-Cumming in public at the races the following day; he also stated that "I will not be a party to letting Gordon-Cumming prey on society in future". The men decided that Gordon-Cumming should sign a document admitting his guilt in exchange for their silence, and Williams and Coventry went to Edward to inform him of what had been happening. The two men told the prince that "the evidence they had heard was absolutely conclusive and they did not believe Sir William Gordon-Cumming had a leg to stand on".

The prince believed what he had been told by his courtiers, and also assumed that cheating had taken place; he later said that with accusations from five witnesses he believed the worst of his friend straight away. At no point had any of those concerned investigated the situation more closely, by asking others present or seeking out Gordon-Cumming's side of events, but they had believed the events as told to them by Lycett Green and Stanley Wilson. After informing the prince, the two courtiers sought out the accused man and informed him of what had been said. Coventry broke the news to him, saying that "There is a very disagreeable thing that has occurred in this house. Some of the people staying here object ... to the way you play baccarat", and that the accusation was that he had "resorted to foul play" at the game. Gordon-Cumming denied the accusation, asking "Do you believe the statements of a parcel of inexperienced boys?", and demanded to see the prince.

After dinner the guests signed the visitors book, after which the prince—accompanied by Coventry, Williams and the two Somersets—received Lycett Green and the other accusers. After hearing what they had to say, the prince dismissed all except Coventry and Williams, and called for Gordon-Cumming, who told Edward that the accusation was "foul and abominable"; the prince pointed out that "there are five accusers against you". Gordon-Cumming then withdrew while the royal party discussed what the next steps would be. He returned after half an hour to find just the two courtiers, who urged him to sign a document that they had drafted. Under pressure, and still denying the accusations, Gordon-Cumming signed the document without knowing who else would sign it afterwards.

The courtiers took the document to Edward, who summoned the other members of the house; he read the note to them and signed it, pointing out to everyone that the promise of secrecy was incumbent on all of them. He also added that Gordon-Cumming was still protesting his innocence, despite signing a paper that "practically admitted his guilt". The paper was then signed by the men present: the prince, Coventry, Williams, Wilson and his son, both Somersets, Lycett Green, Levett and Sassoon. Although the prince hoped that this would bring an end to the affair, Arthur Somerset pointed out that it would not remain secret. Edward asked him "not even when gentlemen have given their word not to divulge it?"; Somerset replied that "It is impossible, sir. Nothing in the world known to ten people was ever kept secret".

On the advice of Williams, Gordon-Cumming left Tranby Croft early the following morning, 11 September; he left behind a letter to Mary Wilson apologising for his early departure, and one for Williams, again stating his innocence, but acknowledging that "it is essential to avoid an open row and the scandal arising therefrom."

Once he was back in London Gordon-Cumming received a response to the letter he had written to Williams. Signed by the prince, Coventry and Williams, the note advised him that "you must clearly understand that in the face of the overwhelming evidence against you, it is useless to attempt to deny the accusations". Gordon-Cumming wrote to Edward with a "final appeal to show how utterly it remains in your power to utterly damn, morally and physically, one who has ever been a loyal and devoted subject": it went unanswered by prince and courtiers.

Instead of hunting big game abroad as he usually did over the winter months, Gordon-Cumming remained in Britain, and spent time in London and at his Scottish estate. He was also seen in the presence of an American heiress, Florence Garner, and the two became engaged. On 27 December he received an anonymous message from Paris that read: "they are beginning to talk much here of ... your sad adventure ... They have talked too much in England. He sent the message to Williams and asked him to let the prince know the contents.

A fortnight later Gordon-Cumming was informed by a lady acquaintance that the events at Tranby Croft were being discussed in London society; he again wrote to Williams to inform him of developments and received an unsatisfactory response. Gordon-Cumming then sent a telegram to the prince asking to meet and informing him that "information I have recently received to the effect that the whole story is the subject of comment at the <a href="Turf%20Club%20%28Gentlemen%27s%20Club%29">Turf Club</a> ... the promise of secrecy made has been broken by those concerned". Although Edward acknowledged receipt of the message, he declined to meet. After the negative response from the prince, Gordon-Cumming lost patience and decided to fight the situation. He released his fiancée from their engagement and then visited his solicitors, Wontner & Sons. Wontners had some knowledge of the law surrounding baccarat as they had previously been involved in the "Jenks v. Turpin" case.

On the advice of his solicitors Gordon-Cumming obtained a written summary of events from Coventry and Williams, and informed his commanding officer, Colonel Stacey, of the situation. Stacey told Gordon-Cumming that, according to Article 41 of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Regulations">Queen's Regulations</a>, he should already have reported the matter. Gordon-Cumming replied that because the prince had been involved, and because all present had been sworn to secrecy, he had been unable to fulfil the requirement of the Regulations. He then "placed his <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commission</a> in Stacey's hands pending the result of ... [the] action".

As the matter involved the prince, Stacey consulted other officers in the regiment about what should be done, and found that opinion was divided between allowing Gordon-Cumming to remain in the regiment while he defended himself, or removing him straight away. The <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> of the Scots Guards, the prince's younger brother, the <a href="Prince%20Arthur%2C%20Duke%20of%20Connaught%20and%20Strathearn">Duke of Connaught</a>, was also asked: according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke "insisted that Gordon-Cumming must be crushed". Stacey disagreed, and thought that the whole story needed to be brought out before such a decision was taken. He reported the situation to the <a href="Adjutant-General%20to%20the%20Forces">Adjutant-General to the Forces</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> <a href="Redvers%20Buller">Sir Redvers Buller</a>, and requested permission to let Gordon-Cumming retire on <a href="half-pay">half-pay</a>. Buller agreed to the request, but stated that if Gordon-Cumming's legal action failed, the permission would be reviewed. Stacey relayed the message to Gordon-Cumming and told him that signing the note was an error: "Because you signed that document you will never put on a sword in the regiment. If you bring a successful action you will be allowed to retire: if you fail, you will be dismissed [from] the service". The Duke of Connaught strongly disapproved of Buller's decision, and he withdrew to Portsmouth, refusing to again be drawn on the affair, even after his brother requested further advice.
On 27 January Gordon-Cumming made a final attempt to have the rumours scotched by instructing his solicitors to write to the two Lycett Greens, Stanley Wilson, Levett and Mary Wilson, to demand retraction of the accusation or face a writ for slander. On 6 February, with no withdrawal forthcoming, Gordon-Cumming issued writs against the five, claiming £5,000 against each of them.

On receipt of the writ the Wilsons consulted their solicitor <a href="Sir%20George%20Lewis%2C%201st%20Baronet">George Lewis</a>, who had also acted for the prince on previous occasions. Lewis briefed <a href="Charles%20Russell%2C%20Baron%20Russell%20of%20Killowen">Sir Charles Russell</a> to act as counsel for the defence, assisted by <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>, the future <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> Prime Minister. Wontner & Sons approached the <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Solicitor General</a>, <a href="Edward%20George%20Clarke">Sir Edward Clarke</a>, to act as counsel on Gordon-Cumming's behalf. One of Lewis's early concerns was to ensure Edward did not appear in court. If Gordon-Cumming could be found guilty by a military tribunal, then the rationale for a court case would disappear. Lewis asked Coventry and Williams to raise the matter again with Buller, who rejected their entreaties. Buller explained his decision in a letter to the queen's secretary, <a href="Henry%20Ponsonby">Sir Henry Ponsonby</a>, writing that "I absolutely declined to take action against ... [Gordon-Cumming] upon street rumours".

After Buller received a letter from Wontners confirming that civil action was taking place, he consulted the <a href="Judge%20Advocate%20General%20of%20the%20Armed%20Forces">Judge Advocate General</a>, who informed him that no military enquiry should take place while such a case was proceeding. Lewis then tried to persuade the <a href="Guards%27%20Club">Guards' Club</a>, of which Gordon-Cumming was a member, to carry out an enquiry into the events, which would have negated much of the need for a trial. A vote of the members rejected the possibility, and the civil trial remained the outcome. The prince was furious with the Guards, and wrote to Ponsonby that "The decision of the Guards Club is a terrible blow to the Scots Guards; and I feel most deeply for the officers who have the honour of their regiment so much at heart."

Journalists drew their own conclusions from the manoeuvrings by the prince and his entourage, with the radical press quick to attack the attempts to avoid the scrutiny of a civil court. "<a href="The%20Echo%20%28London%29">The Echo</a>" wrote that "The Baccarat Scandal is to be hushed up ... It is, no doubt, a very comfortable arrangement for all parties concerned", while even "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", normally sympathetic to Edward, foresaw political problems if the trial was prejudiced by such actions.

It was decided the case would be heard by the <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Lord Chief Justice</a>, <a href="John%20Coleridge%2C%201st%20Baron%20Coleridge">Lord Coleridge</a>. His court at the <a href="Royal%20Courts%20of%20Justice">Royal Courts of Justice</a>, London, was converted to accommodate the case by raising the height of the bench and witness box and installing new seating. In May it was announced that the case would start on 1 June, and that entry to the court would be by ticket only.

The trial opened on 1 June 1891. Ticket holders began queuing at 9:30 am, and the court was full half an hour before its 11 am start time. The prince sat on a red leather chair on a raised platform between the judge and the witness box; his appearance was the first time since 1411 that an heir to the throne had appeared involuntarily in court. "<a href="The%20Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">The Pall Mall Gazette</a>" stated that "the court presented an appearance which, save for the dignity of its own fittings and its rows of learned-looking law books, might have been taken for a theatre at a fashionable matinée", with society ladies watching proceedings with opera glasses or <a href="lorgnette">lorgnette</a>s. The correspondent of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" described the opening of the case as being "in the presence of a carefully selected and fashionable assembly", while Clarke later wrote that "the court had a strange appearance. Lord Coleridge had appropriated half of the public gallery, and had given tickets to his friends".

Clarke opened the case for the plaintiff, telling the jury that "It is a simple question, aye or no, did Sir William Gordon-Cumming cheat at cards?" After describing Gordon-Cumming's background and record, he explained the rules of baccarat, which he described as "the most unintelligent mode of losing your own money, or getting somebody else's, I ever heard of". Clarke also outlined Gordon-Cumming's system of placing bets which, he explained, could have been mistaken by the inexperienced players as cheating, rather than a correct method of gambling. After his opening speech, Clarke then questioned Gordon-Cumming, and his approach was to show that Gordon-Cumming "was a man of honour who had been sacrificed to save the courtiers".

After an adjournment for lunch Gordon-Cumming returned to the witness box, where he was cross-examined by Russell. During the session Russell provided a model of the table used and a photograph of the room, and questioned Gordon-Cumming about the bets where cheating had been suspected. Russell also asked him about why he had signed the document agreeing not to play cards: Gordon-Cumming stated that he had "lost my head ... on that occasion. If I had not lost my head I would not have signed that document". Gordon-Cumming's cross-examination ran into the second day, after which he was then re-examined by Clarke; his time in the witness box lasted until 1 pm. "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" considered that "Gordon-Cumming made an admirable witness ... leaning easily on the rail, his grey-gloved left hand resting easily on the bare right, perfectly dressed, his tones equable, firm, neither over-hurried nor over-deliberate, cool, but not too cool".

Gordon-Cumming was replaced in the witness box by the prince. Examined by Clarke, he stated that he had not seen any cheating, and was ignorant of the accusations until he was told by Coventry and Williams. After 20 minutes of questions from both Clarke and Russell, the prince was free to depart. As the prince was leaving the witness box, a member of the jury put two questions to Edward: whether the heir had seen "nothing of the alleged malpractices of the plaintiff?", and "what was your Royal Highness's opinion at the time as to the charges made against Sir William Gordon-Cumming?" To the first question the prince replied that he had not, although he explained that "it is not usual for a banker to see anything in dealing cards"; to the second, he stated that "the charges appeared to be so unanimous that it was the proper course—no other course was open to me—than to believe them". In comparison with Gordon-Cumming's performance in the witness box, Edward did not make a strong impression; the reporter for "The New York Times" noticed "that the heir apparent was decidedly fidgety, that he kept changing his position, and that he did not seem able to keep his hands still ... Except to those near him, only two or three of his answers were fairly audible throughout the courtroom". "<a href="The%20Daily%20News%20%28UK%29">The Daily News</a>" agreed, and stated that the impression gained from the prince's performance was unfavourable.

The court adjourned for lunch after Edward's examination, and after the break Clarke called his last witness, Williams. Under Clarke's questioning Williams confirmed that he had seen no actions by Gordon-Cumming that he considered as unfair. After Clarke finished questioning Williams, Asquith cross-examined the soldier for the remainder of the session; after a brief re-examination by Clarke, the day—and the case for the plaintiff—came to an end. The third day began with the opening speech for the defendants, after which Stanley Wilson took the stand for the remainder of the day, and on into the fourth day. Examined by Asquith, Stanley recounted seeing Gordon-Cumming illicitly add counters to his stake twice on the first night and at least twice on the second night, although he could not remember the full details. When cross-examined by Clarke he was not brow-beaten by the lawyer's questions, although Clarke made him appear "brash, conceited and callow". Stanley was replaced in the witness box by Levett; "<a href="The%20Morning%20Advertiser">The Morning Advertiser</a>" considered that Levett "felt somewhat uncomfortable" appearing against Gordon-Cumming, and reported that he had "described his position as an 'awkward' one". Despite his discomfort, Levett confirmed that on the first evening he had seen Gordon-Cumming add counters after the hand had finished but before the stake had been paid. He was unsure of other details of the evening's play, and had not witnessed anything on the second night.

Edward Lycett Green, described by Havers, Grayson and Shankland as "the emotional force behind the accusations", was next in the witness box. Although Lycett Green had not played on the first night, Clarke considered him a potentially dangerous witness who was capable of giving vital evidence. Lycett Green stated that he had seen Gordon-Cumming twice push counters over the chalk line when he should not have done so; he had considered accusing Gordon-Cumming at the time, but decided against it because he "did not like to make a scene before ladies". At points in the examination by Asquith, Lycett Green contradicted the course of events outlined by Stanley Wilson—which Levett had also done—and on one point regarding a question the prince put to Levett; his answer was "highly suspect". Havers, Grayson and Shankland later wrote that "it is remarkable that he, the prime mover in the affair, seemed unable to say anything without qualifying it with some such remark as, 'I don't exactly remember' ... The hedging by the principal accuser certainly weakens the defendants' case". They also thought that "[h]is refusal to remember anything was obviously humbug, a deliberate policy".

Lycett Green was followed into the witness box by his wife, and her testimony ran into the following day. Under questioning she confirmed that she had seldom played baccarat before; although she had seen nothing untoward on the first night, she accepted her husband's second-hand version of events as the truth, but did not agree that as a result she had been watching Gordon-Cumming. Although she "gave the most important part of her evidence with clarity and conviction", and had impressed the public and press, according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, she provided a different series of events to those outlined by other witnesses, although she stated that she thought she had seen Gordon-Cumming illicitly add to his stake.

After Mrs Lycett Green had finished her testimony on the fifth day, her place was taken by Mrs Wilson. On examination by Russell, Mrs Wilson stated that she thought she saw Gordon-Cumming cheat twice by adding additional counters to his stake. When Clarke cross-examined her, he asked if anyone had placed a stake of £15. Mrs Wilson stated that only her husband had placed such an amount, but Wilson had not played on either night as he disliked both the game and high-stakes gambling. Havers, Grayson and Shankland consider it "rather shocking really, considering that she had sworn to tell the truth, ... to find her coming out with this ... lie spoken, apparently, with the complete self-assurance that the other members of her family had shown".

The final witness called for the defence was Coventry. He was one of the non-playing members of the party who had witnessed no cheating, understood little about gambling and, as a non-soldier, knew nothing of Article 41 of the Queen's Regulations. When cross-examined by Clarke, Coventry confirmed that as far as he was aware, the witnesses had all decided to watch Gordon-Cumming's play on the second night, despite their claims to the contrary.
As the defence closed, the "<a href="Daily%20Chronicle%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Daily Chronicle</a>" considered "the obvious doubts which tainted the accusations of the defendants ... they and the Prince's flunkeys all contradicted each other on material points". Russell's summing up for the defence took the remainder of the day and the court adjourned until the following Monday, when he continued. He referred to a possible thirteen acts of cheating that the defendants were alleged to have seen, and that "we have five persons who believe he cheated, swearing unmistakably they saw him cheat, and telling you how they saw him cheat".

Once Russell had completed his speech for the defendants, Clarke gave his reply, which the "Daily Chronicle" considered to be "a very brilliant, powerful, wily and courageous effort". Clarke pointed to the many inaccuracies in both the written statement prepared by Coventry and Williams, and in the memories of all concerned. He went on to outline that there had been celebrations at the races—the prince's horse had won on the first day, and the St Leger had been run on the second—combined with the full hospitality of the Wilsons to consider: according to the court reporter for "The Times", Clarke "alluded to the profuse hospitalities of Tranby Croft, not with any idea of suggesting drunkenness, but as indicating that the guests might not be in a state for accurate observation". He also drew the jury's attention to the gaps in the defendants' memories, where they were so precise about some of their observations, but could not remember other, key, details. Clarke lampooned some of the involved parties, referring to Lycett Green as "a <a href="Master%20of%20Fox%20Hounds">Master of Hounds</a> who hunts four days a week", while Stanley Wilson was a spoiled wastrel from a rich family who lacked initiative and drive. Above all, Clarke indicated, the defendants—with the exception of Stanley Wilson—saw what they had been told to expect: "the eye saw what it expected or sought to see ... there was only one witness who saw Sir William Gordon-Cumming cheat without expecting it—young Mr. [Stanley] Wilson. The others were all told there had been cheating, and expected to see it". At the end of his reply, Clarke's speech was greeted by applause amongst those in the galleries. The British lawyer <a href="Heber%20Hart">Heber Hart</a> later wrote that Clarke's speech was "probably the most conspicuous example of the moral courage and independence of the Bar that has occurred in modern times", while Clarke considered it to be "one of the best speeches I ever made."
The following day, 9 June, Coleridge began his four-hour summing up. His summary was a response to Clarke's, and he went through on a point-by-point basis to discredit the solicitor general's speech, although in places his description "was directly contrary to the evidence". Tomes relates that "many opined that the judge's summing-up had been unacceptably biased"; Havers, Grayson and Shankland call Coleridge's speech "biased", while "<a href="National%20Observer%20%28UK%29">The National Observer</a>" considered it "a melancholy and flagrant violation of the best traditions of the English bench." Some sections of the press, however, were more sympathetic; "The Pall Mall Gazette" thought the summing up to be justified, while "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" thought Coleridge's summary to have been "nobly comprehensive and eloquent ... he fulfilled his duty perfectly, displaying nothing but impartial desire for the truth".

The jury deliberated for only 13 minutes before finding in favour of the defendants; their decision was greeted by prolonged hissing from some members of the galleries. According to the historian <a href="Christopher%20Hibbert">Christopher Hibbert</a> "the demonstrations in court were an accurate reflection of the feelings of the people outside". The historian <a href="Philip%20Magnus-Allcroft">Philip Magnus-Allcroft</a> later wrote that "a storm of obloquy broke over the head of the Prince of Wales. It would be difficult to exaggerate the momentary unpopularity of the Prince", and he was booed at <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Ascot</a> that month.

Gordon-Cumming was dismissed from the army on 10 June 1891, the day after the case closed, and he resigned his membership of his four London clubs: the <a href="Carlton%20Club">Carlton</a>, Guards', Marlborough and Turf. Although he offered to break his engagement for a second time, he married his American heiress fiancée the same day; she had stood by him throughout the scandal and the couple went on to have five children together. He retired to his Scottish estate and his property in <a href="Dawlish">Dawlish</a>, Devon. He never re-entered society and the prince "declined to meet anyone who henceforth acknowledged the Scottish baronet". The leader in "The Times" stated that "He is ... condemned by the verdict of the jury to social extinction. His brilliant record is wiped out and he must, so to speak, begin life again. Such is the inexorable social rule ... He has committed a mortal offence. Society can know him no more." None of Gordon-Cumming's close friends spoke to him again, although some relented after Edward's death in 1910; Gordon-Cumming remained bitter about the events until his death in 1930. Clarke retained his faith in his client and, in his 1918 memoirs, wrote that "I believe the verdict was wrong, and that Sir William Gordon-Cumming was innocent".
Following the trial the prince changed his behaviour to some extent, and although he continued to gamble, he did so in a more discreet manner; he stopped playing baccarat altogether, taking up <a href="whist">whist</a> instead. While he was unpopular at the end of the case, Ridley considers that the matter "probably did little serious damage to ... [the prince's] standing"; Havers, Grayson and Shankland agree, and write that by 1896, when the prince's horse <a href="Persimmon%20%28horse%29">Persimmon</a> won the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a>, the prince "had never been more popular". Matthew observes that it was only when one of the prince's own circle of confidantes brought him to court that the newspapers would "seriously harr[y] him ... the British in the 1890s had no general wish to see their future monarch fail".

The scandal and court case have been the subject of factual and fictional publications. Most biographies of Edward VII contain some details of the scandal, but the first book to cover it in detail did not appear until 1932. This was Teignmouth Shore's "The Baccarat Case", published in the Notable British Trials series and incorporating a full transcript of the case. In 1977 Havers, Grayson and Shankland wrote "The Royal Baccarat Scandal", which was subsequently dramatised in a play of the same name by <a href="Royce%20Ryton">Royce Ryton</a>; the play was first produced at the <a href="Chichester%20Festival%20Theatre">Chichester Festival Theatre</a>. Ryton's work was also broadcast in December 1991 as a two-hour drama on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>. In 2000 <a href="George%20MacDonald%20Fraser">George MacDonald Fraser</a> placed his fictional antihero, <a href="Harry%20Flashman">Harry Flashman</a>, into the scandal in the short story "The Subtleties of Baccarat", one of the three stories in "<a href="Flashman%20and%20the%20Tiger">Flashman and the Tiger</a>".

No Depression (album)

No Depression is the first studio album by <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a> band <a href="Uncle%20Tupelo">Uncle Tupelo</a>, released in June 1990. After its formation in the late 1980s, Uncle Tupelo recorded the "Not Forever, Just for Now" demo tape, which received a positive review by the "<a href="College%20Media%20Journal">College Media Journal</a>" in 1989. The review led to the band's signing with what would become <a href="Rockville%20Records">Rockville Records</a> later that year. The album was recorded with producers <a href="Sean%20Slade">Sean Slade</a> and <a href="Paul%20Q.%20Kolderie">Paul Q. Kolderie</a> at <a href="Fort%20Apache%20Studios">Fort Apache Studios</a>, on a budget of US$3,500.

"No Depression" was critically acclaimed and sold well for an <a href="independent%20music">independent release</a>. Selling over 15,000 copies within a year of its release, the album's success inspired the roots music magazine "<a href="No%20Depression%20%28periodical%29">No Depression</a>". The record is considered one of the most important alternative country albums, and its title is often used as a synonym for the alternative country genre after being popularized by "No Depression" magazine. After regaining the rights to the album through a lawsuit, Uncle Tupelo released a remastered version in 2003 through <a href="Legacy%20Records">Legacy Records</a>, expanded to include six bonus tracks.

<a href="Jay%20Farrar">Jay Farrar</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a> and <a href="Mike%20Heidorn">Mike Heidorn</a> began their musical careers in the 1980s playing in a <a href="garage%20band">garage band</a>, The Plebes. After a few gigs, creative differences between the members led to the development of a <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> sound for the band. As punk rock was unpopular in the <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a> region, the band changed their style to <a href="blues-rock">blues-rock</a> and renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo. At this point, they stopped performing <a href="cover%20song">covers</a> and began to write their own songs.

The band discovered a musical niche around <a href="Washington%20University%20in%20St.%20Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a>, where bands such as <a href="Brian%20Henneman">Brian Henneman</a>'s Chicken Truck performed in a similar style. The trio recorded its first professional tracks in <a href="Champaign%2C%20Illinois">Champaign, Illinois</a> with future Chicago punk producer <a href="Matt%20Allison%20%28record%20producer%29">Matt Allison</a>. The <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo tape</a>, "Not Forever, Just for Now", contained early versions of several songs that would later appear on their debut album, including "Train", "Whiskey Bottle", "Flatness", "Screen Door", and "Before I Break".

That demo, as well as the band's rigorous touring schedule, attracted the attention of several music scouts. Record labels initially were wary of signing the band whom they perceived as straddling "the divide between the countrified punk of early 1980s such as <a href="Green%20on%20Red">Green on Red</a>, <a href="Jason%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Scorchers">Jason & the Scorchers</a>, and <a href="X%20%28U.S.%20band%29">X</a>—none of whom had bum-rushed the charts—and the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> <a href="grunge">grunge</a> of <a href="Mudhoney">Mudhoney</a> and <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>, which was still years from breaking out commercially". However, the influential "<a href="College%20Media%20Journal">CMJ New Music Report</a>" gave the demo tape a favorable review in 1989, praising its "mature, developed, seriously thought-out songwriting". This review prompted New York City-based distributor <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Trading">Dutch East India Trading</a> to provide funding for the band to record an album on their Giant Records label, shortly before the label was renamed to <a href="Rockville%20Records">Rockville Records</a>.

Six months before signing a full contract with Giant/Rockville, Uncle Tupelo recorded the tracks for "No Depression" over ten days in January 1990 at <a href="Fort%20Apache%20Studios">Fort Apache South</a>, a musician-run studio in the <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Massachusetts">Roxbury</a> neighborhood of <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. As the trio could not afford the cost of recording at a <a href="Multitrack%20recording">twenty-four track</a> studio in nearby <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>, they settled on the cheaper Fort Apache studio. The album cost US$3,500 to produce, $1,000 of which went to in-house producers <a href="Sean%20Slade">Sean Slade</a> and <a href="Paul%20Q.%20Kolderie">Paul Q. Kolderie</a>. The band was interested in working with Slade and Kolderie after hearing their production of <a href="Dinosaur%20Jr.">Dinosaur Jr.</a>'s album "<a href="Bug%20%28Dinosaur%20Jr%20album%29">Bug</a>". The producers allowed Farrar to use the same 1961 <a href="Gibson%20Les%20Paul">Gibson Les Paul</a> guitar that <a href="J.%20Mascis">J. Mascis</a> used on "Bug", which gave the <a href="power%20chord">power chord</a>s on "No Depression" a richer tone.

Slade and Kolderie suggested that the band deemphasize the <a href="roots%20rock">roots rock</a> influences heard on "Not Forever, Just for Now" and convinced them to replace the <a href="harmonica">harmonica</a> parts with <a href="pedal%20steel%20guitar">pedal steel guitar</a>. For this, Slade and Kolderie recruited guitarist Rich Gilbert of <a href="Human%20Sexual%20Response%20%28band%29">Human Sexual Response</a> for the recording. The tracks were recorded using little <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a>; only a few <a href="banjo">banjo</a> and <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a> parts were later added to the songs. At the suggestion of Slade and Kolderie, "No Depression" was recorded on eight-track, so "the music would compress and "jump" off the tape during playback". The recording sessions occurred before Uncle Tupelo officially became affiliated with Giant Records, so there was little input from the label.

Lyrically the songs reflected the band members' experiences growing up in Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling of living in a small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a>. Musically, "No Depression" was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the <a href="Minutemen%20%28band%29">Minutemen</a>. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on <a href="Folkways%20Records">Folkways Records</a>.

"No Depression" was released by Rockville Records on June 21, 1990. The promotional tour for the album began at Cicero's Basement, a St. Louis bar associated with Washington University. The tour took Uncle Tupelo to both the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> and the <a href="Southwestern%20United%20States">Southwestern United States</a>. Missouri radio stations <a href="KDHX">KDHX</a> and <a href="KCOU">KCOU</a> frequently played tracks off the album. By March 1991, "No Depression" had sold over 15,000 units, a hit by independent record standards. The proceeds from the album recuperated the $3,500 cost of the album, but Rockville refused to pay the band any royalties. Farrar and Tweedy later successfully sued Rockville <a href="Chief%20Executive%20Officer">CEO</a> Barry Tenenbaum to attain the royalties. The surprise success of the album prompted <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> to pay the band to record additional tracks with Slade and Kolderie at Fort Apache Studio in the summer of 1990, but the results were not released. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" did not publish a review of the album upon its initial release, although the magazine later featured Uncle Tupelo in an article about rising stars alongside <a href="The%20Black%20Crowes">The Black Crowes</a>. "Rolling Stone" later called the album "one of the loudest, loneliest wails in recent memory to arise from the Midwest's recession-plagued plains". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> dismissed the album as a "dud".

After the lawsuit with Tenenbaum, Farrar and Tweedy received the rights to their first three albums (including "No Depression"), which were previously held by Rockville. In 2003, Uncle Tupelo remastered and re-released "No Depression" with six bonus tracks through <a href="Legacy%20Records">Legacy Records</a>, a <a href="Sony%20Music">Sony Music</a> label. Among the bonus tracks were cover versions of the <a href="Flying%20Burrito%20Brothers">Flying Burrito Brothers</a>' "Sin City", the Carter Family's "Blues Die Hard", and <a href="The%20Vertebrats">The Vertebrats</a>' "Left in the Dark". The liner notes for the re-release featured an article written by Mike Heidorn about Uncle Tupelo's early days and the creation of "No Depression". Upon re-release, <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> referred to the album as "Uncle Tupelo's landmark opening <a href="salvo">salvo</a>", praising its "undeniable electricity" and remarking that it brought "new life" to the fusion of country and punk rock. "Rolling Stone" critic Tom Moon lauded "the band's impressive songwriting range", but noted that the bonus material was "pleasant but unconsequential". "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" gave the re-issue an 8.4 rating out of 10, proclaiming ""No Depression" is a significant record".

"No Depression" is cited by <a href="RealNetworks">RealNetworks</a> as one of the most important albums in the alternative country genre. This was partly due to the success of the alternative country periodical "<a href="No%20Depression%20%28periodical%29">No Depression</a>", which took its name partly from the album. Due the impact of the album on alternative country, "No Depression" is sometimes used as a synonym for the genre. AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny noted that the album helped the band "kick-start a revolution which reverberated throughout the American underground". In 1999, "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" listed the album as one of the "Top 90 Albums of the 90s".

All songs written by Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy, and Mike Heidorn except as indicated.

Pioneer Zephyr

The Pioneer Zephyr is a <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel-powered</a> <a href="railroad">railroad</a> train formed of <a href="railroad%20car">railroad car</a>s permanently articulated together with <a href="Jacobs%20bogie">Jacobs bogie</a>s, built by the <a href="Budd%20Company">Budd Company</a> in 1934 for the <a href="Chicago%2C%20Burlington%20and%20Quincy%20Railroad">Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad</a> (CB&Q), commonly known as the Burlington. The train featured extensive use of <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a>, was originally named the "Zephyr", and was meant as a promotional tool to advertise passenger rail service in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. The construction included innovations such as <a href="shotwelding">shotwelding</a> (a specialized type of <a href="spot%20welding">spot welding</a>) to join the stainless steel, and articulation to reduce its weight.

On May 26, 1934, it set a <a href="Land%20speed%20record%20for%20railed%20vehicles">speed record</a> for travel between <a href="Denver%2C%20Colorado">Denver</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, and <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, when it made a 1,015.4-mile (1,633 km) non-stop "Dawn-to-Dusk" dash in 13 hours 5 minutes at an average speed of almost 78 mph (124 km/h). For one section of the run it reached a speed of 112.5 mph (181 km/h), just short of the then US land speed record of 115 mph (185 km/h). The historic dash inspired a 1934 film and the train's nickname, "The Silver Streak".

The train entered regular revenue service on November 11, 1934, between <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="Omaha">Omaha</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, and <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Nebraska">Lincoln</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>. It operated this and other routes until its retirement in 1960, when it was donated to Chicago's <a href="Museum%20of%20Science%20and%20Industry%20%28Chicago%29">Museum of Science and Industry</a>, where it remains on public display. The train is generally regarded as the first successful <a href="streamliner">streamliner</a> on American railroads.

In the early 1930s, the US was in the depths of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. Without the money to purchase new goods, freight trains were not hauling as much as they had in the previous decade. People who could not buy goods also could not afford to travel to the extent that they had before, so passenger revenues were also down. Automobile travel had increasingly cut into rail ridership since the mid-1920s, making faster, more efficient service imperative for railroads to compete. Railroads needed a way to re-energize the traveling public and offer a bit of hope for the days to come.

One of the railroad presidents who faced this challenge was <a href="Ralph%20Budd">Ralph Budd</a>, formerly of the <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28U.S.%29">Great Northern Railway</a> and now president of the <a href="Chicago%2C%20Burlington%20and%20Quincy%20Railroad">Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad</a> (Burlington), who sought to develop a more efficient high speed train to replace conventional steam-powered heavyweight equipment to lower operating costs, attract more customers, and restore profitability to passenger service. The project hinged on two major elements: developing lighter railcars and developing an internal combustion driven power system adequate for high speed service.

In 1932 Ralph Budd met <a href="Edward%20G.%20Budd">Edward G. Budd</a> (no relation), an automotive steel pioneer who was founder and president of the <a href="Budd%20Company">Budd Company</a>. Edward Budd was demonstrating his new <a href="Budd-Michelin%20rubber-tired%20rail%20cars">Budd-Michelin</a> rail motorcar built of <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a>. Pneumatic-wheeled railcars never found popularity for actual service in the US — they tended to derail — but they demonstrated the successful construction of lightweight stainless steel <a href="unibody">unibody</a> railcars.

Stainless steel provided many benefits over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; it was a lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> meant that it would not have to be painted to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.

In developing the Budd-Michelin railcar, the Budd Company used the formed steel technology in which they were industry pioneers and solved the most difficult problem in using stainless steel for railcar construction: developing a welding technique that would not compromise the strength and corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. On August 20, 1932, <a href="Earl%20J.%20Ragsdale">Earl J. Ragsdale</a>, an engineer at the Budd Company, filed a patent application for a "Method and product of electric welding"; on January 16, 1934, the <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) granted US patent 1,944,106 to the Budd Company. <a href="shot%20welding">Shotwelding</a>, as Ragsdale termed his method, involved automatic control of the timing of individual <a href="spot%20welding">spot welds</a>. In spot welding, the two pieces of metal that are to be joined are pressed together with an <a href="electrode">electrode</a> on each side of the joint. A very high electric current is passed through the joint and fuses the two pieces of metal together. If a spot weld is heated too long, heat will spread from the weld at a middling temperature that weakens the stainless steel and compromises its corrosion-resistant properties unacceptably; Ragsdale's precisely-timed welds solved the problem. With their patented welding process at the core of stainless steel railcar construction, the cars produced by Budd were a truly unique product.

The other major problem Ralph Budd faced in developing a practical high speed lightweight train was to find a powerplant adequate to drive a trainset at a speed competitive with the faster steam trains. The existing powerplants for motorized railcars were completely inadequate. Contemporary four-stroke marine and stationary <a href="Diesel%20engine">diesel</a> engines had low power-to-weight ratios and were only efficient under a narrow range of operating conditions, rendering them unsuitable for mobile use. Spark-ignited petroleum distillate engines also suffered from low power-to-weight ratios along with being maintenance-intensive and smokey, and gasoline engines showed limited potential for higher power hauling applications. The solution to Budd's problem presented itself in the new two-stroke diesel engines developed by the partnership of the <a href="Winton%20Engine%20Company">Winton Engine Company</a> and <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>, which represented a factor-of-four improvement in power-to-weight ratio over the previous generation of diesel engines. Their efficient operating range was also improved, owing largely to improvements in <a href="fuel%20injection">fuel injection</a> developed by GM and Winton. A <a href="diesel-electric">diesel-electric</a> system driven by the new engine was used to power General Motors' automotive assembly exhibit at the 1933 <a href="Century%20of%20Progress">Century of Progress</a> Chicago World's Fair. Budd saw the compact, efficient system in action, saw a major piece of his lightweight train puzzle fall into place, then approached GM about developing it into a system for rail propulsion. The result was a diesel-electric drive system developed by GM's subsidiary <a href="Electro-Motive%20Corporation">Electro-Motive Corporation</a>, powered by an eight-cylinder, 600 hp Winton 201A diesel engine, installed in a new three car stainless steel streamliner within a year. In 1933 a Century of Progress exhibit inspired the "Zephyr" streamliner; the following year the new "Zephyr" streamliner inspired the Century of Progress fair and the rest of the country.
Another factor in making the "Zephyr" lighter than conventional trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their <a href="bogie">trucks</a> with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer <a href="Walter%20B.%20Dean">Walter B. Dean</a>, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only reduced the number of trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for <a href="Railway%20coupling">couplers</a> between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.

The exterior design of the train was left to <a href="aeronautics">aeronautical</a> engineer <a href="Albert%20Gardner%20Dean">Albert Gardner Dean</a> (Walter Dean's younger brother) who designed the sloping nose shape, with <a href="architects">architects</a> <a href="Paul%20Philippe%20Cret">Paul Philippe Cret</a> and <a href="John%20Harbeson">John Harbeson</a>, devising a way to strengthen and beautify the sides with the train's horizontal fluting. On April 15, 1936, Colonel Ragsdale, Walter Dean and Albert Dean, filed patent applications for a "Rail Car Front End Construction". On September 23, 1941 the USPTO granted US patents 2,256,493 and 2,256,494 to the Budd Company. The streamlining extended to the undercarriage as well to reduce drag.

Naming the train was a task that was very seriously taken by Budd. He wanted a name that started with the letter "Z" because this train was intended to be the "last word" in passenger service; Budd and his coworkers looked up the last words in their dictionaries, but neither "zymurgy" nor "zyzzle" conveyed the meanings that Budd was looking for. The name of the new train came from "<a href="The%20Canterbury%20Tales">The Canterbury Tales</a>", which Budd had been reading. The story begins with pilgrims setting out on a journey, inspired by the budding springtime and by <a href="Zephyrus">Zephyrus</a>, the gentle and nurturing west wind. Budd thought that would be an excellent name for a sleek new traveling machine—"Zephyr".

The first "Zephyr" (9900) was completed by the Budd Company on April 9, 1934, powered by an eight-cylinder, 600-<a href="horsepower">horsepower</a> (447 kW), 8-201-A model <a href="Winton%20Motor%20Carriage%20Company">Winton</a> engine. The diesel-electric drive system using generators, control, and traction-drive equipment from <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> became the technological basis for later diesel locomotives that would replace steam.

The train's engineer sat in a small compartment in the nose of the train, directly in front of the <a href="Prime%20mover%20%28locomotive%29">prime mover</a>. Behind the engine in the first carbody was a long <a href="railway%20post%20office">railway post office</a> section. The second carbody consisted of a small baggage section and a short buffet and 20-passenger <a href="Coach%20%28rail%29">coach</a> section. The third and final carbody in the train, as originally built, was configured as half coach (40-passenger seats) and half <a href="observation%20car">observation car</a> (12 passenger seats). As built, the train had 72 seats and could carry 50,000 <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">pounds</a> (22.7 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s) of baggage and express freight. This train's official christening occurred on April 18, 1934, at the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>'s <a href="Broad%20Street%20Station%20%28Philadelphia%29">Broad Street Station</a> in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Following the "Zephyr" Budd built an identical trainset, the "<a href="Flying%20Yankee">Flying Yankee</a>", for the Boston and Maine railroad, and went on to build a series of larger and more powerful "Zephyr" trainsets for Burlington.

To catch the public's attention, this train was not simply rolled out of the factory; it made a dash from one end of the CB&Q, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The railroad spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the "Zephyr"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s route were diverted to <a href="rail%20siding">sidings</a> and the <a href="railroad%20switch">turnouts</a> were spiked into the proper alignment for the "Zephyr"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s run. Track and <a href="maintenance%20of%20way">maintenance of way</a> workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the "Zephyr"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road <a href="grade%20crossing">grade crossing</a> was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> and the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a>.

The train left Denver at 07:04 <a href="Central%20Standard%20Time%20Zone">Central Daylight Time</a> and at 20:09, 13 hours 5 minutes later, broke through the tape at the designated finish line at <a href="Halsted%20Street%20station">Halsted Street station</a>, 1.8 miles west of <a href="Chicago%20Union%20Station">Chicago Union Station</a>. The train's average speed from start to finish was 77 mph (124 km/h); and had reached a speed of 112.5 mph (181 km/h). The non-stop 1,015 mile (1,633 km) trip exceeded the railroad's expectations in being 1 hour 55 minutes faster than was scheduled. The Burlington's contemporary passenger trains plied the same distance in around 25 hours.

Riding the train were Ralph Budd, Edward G. Budd, Harold L. Hamilton, president of the <a href="Electro-Motive%20Corporation">Electro-Motive Corporation</a>, a number of reporters, some Burlington employees, members of the public, and Zeph, a <a href="burro">burro</a> that was contributed by a Colorado newspaper, the "Rocky Mountain News", as a mascot for the train. The newspaper had described Zeph to the railroad as a "Rocky Mountain canary" so the train's crew had originally planned only enough space for a birdcage; when they found out it was not a bird, the railroad hastily built a pen in the baggage section and bought some hay for it. When asked about the burro, Ralph Budd replied "why not? One more jackass on this trip won't make a difference."

The train did not stop at the Halsted station, but traveled farther to east to the 1934 <a href="Century%20of%20Progress">Century of Progress</a> fair on the Lake Michigan shore, where it was put on public display on opening day. After its showing on the "Wings of a Century" stage, the train was taken on a 31-state, 222-city publicity tour. More than two million people saw the train before it entered revenue service.

Part of the tour included a test run between Chicago and <a href="Minneapolis%E2%80%93St.%20Paul">Minneapolis–St. Paul</a> a full five hours faster than the Burlington's fastest steam-powered train. Due to the "Zephyr"'s success on this test run, the Burlington immediately ordered two more "Zephyr" trainsets that were dubbed the "Twin Zephyrs", starting the spread of the "Zephyr" brand.

Following the "Pioneer Zephyr" 9900, two identical trainsets, 9901 and 9902, were built and put into service as the "<a href="Twin%20Cities%20Zephyr">Twin Cities Zephyr</a>" between Chicago and Minneapolis - St. Paul in April 1935. The four car set 9903 entered service as the "<a href="Mark%20Twain%20Zephyr">Mark Twain Zephyr</a>" between St. Louis and Burlington, Iowa in October 1935. On May 31, 1936, the trainsets of the "Pioneer Zephyr" and the "Mark Twain Zephyr", 9900 and 9903, were transferred to a new Chicago-Denver service called the "<a href="Advance%20Denver%20Zephyr">Advance Denver Zephyr</a>" on a 16 hour schedule. They were replaced six months later by two new ten-car trains, pulled by power units 9906 and 9907, named the "<a href="Denver%20Zephyr">Denver Zephyr</a>". The six car sets 9904 and 9905 replaced 9901 and 9902 on the Twin Cities run in December 1936. At that time, the 9901 was reassigned to a new service, the "<a href="Sam%20Houston%20Zephyr">Sam Houston Zephyr</a>", running between <a href="Ft.%20Worth">Ft. Worth</a> and <a href="Houston">Houston</a> via <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a> on trackage jointly owned by the <a href="Chicago%2C%20Rock%20Island%20and%20Pacific">Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific</a>. This was the first streamlined train in Texas, and was joined about a year later by the "<a href="Texas%20Rocket">Texas Rocket</a>" on alternate timing. The 9902 inaugurated the "<a href="Ozark%20State%20Zephyr">Ozark State Zephyr</a>", a joint operation with the <a href="Alton%20Railroad">Alton Railroad</a> between <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> and <a href="Kansas%20City">Kansas City</a>, where it was joined by the 9904 on alternate timing about a year later. The last of the classic "Zephyrs," 9908, entered service as the "<a href="General%20Pershing%20Zephyr">General Pershing Zephyr</a>" between Kansas City and St. Louis in 1939, replacing the less commodious 9902 set. The 9904 set continued to provide alternate timing on this route across the Show Me State, but had its original name of "<a href="Mark%20Twain%20Zephyr">Mark Twain Zephyr</a>" restored, despite no longer operating through <a href="Samuel%20Clemens">Samuel Clemens</a>' hometown of Hannibal.

While 9900-9903 were <a href="power%20car">power car</a>s, only one more, the unique 9908, was built. 9904-9907 were locomotives with the twin 900 hp 12-cylinder engine layout that the early <a href="EMD%20E-unit">E-units</a> would use. 9906 and 9907, built for the ten car "Denver Zephyr" sets in 1936, included booster units. 9908 used the new 1000 hp <a href="EMD%20567">EMD 567</a> motor in a single motor configuration. After 9908, all Burlington passenger engines were standard production locomotives, except for the cosmetic stainless steel bodywork of the <a href="EMD%20E5">E5s</a>.

Winton diesel engines were used in early <a href="Electro-Motive%20Company">EMC</a> designs, and 9900 had an eight-cylinder 201A model developing 600 hp at 750 rpm. Two-stroke diesel motors, while a breakthrough in locomotive power, were an immature technology. Some of their early reliability problems were mitigated with changes to individual parts such as pistons; other solutions had to wait for a differently designed motor. For example, the first generation of pistons in the Winton motor only had about 50,000 miles of useful life, later extended to about 100,000 miles. EMC's next generation diesel motor had pistons with a useful life of over 500,000 miles. The problems were most acute under the operating conditions of locomotive, rather than stationary or marine, use. Even with the problems of the 201A, their maintenance regime was significantly lower than for steam locomotives.

9900 and 9901-9903 were articulated trainsets, with common trucks (Jacobs bogies) between each car. This caused operating problems, as train lengths could not be changed for demand and any single failure affected the entire train. All following power units were separate from their train, although four more articulated and semi-articulated carsets were built.

The "Zephyr"'s power (leading) car was numbered 9900, the baggage-coach <a href="combine%20car">combine car</a> 505, and the coach-observation 570. The train was placed in regular service between <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha</a> and <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Nebraska">Lincoln</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, on November 11, 1934, replacing a pair of <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s and six heavyweight <a href="Passenger%20car%20%28rail%29">passenger cars</a>, weighing up to eight times as much as the "Zephyr". By June 1935, it proved popular enough to add a fourth car, providing additional coach seating. The fourth car was originally a 40-seat coach number 525, but the following June it was switched to <a href="Minneapolis-St.%20Paul">Twin Cities</a> service, then back to the "Pioneer Zephyr" in December. Car 525 remained on the train until June 1938. Just over five years after it was introduced, the "Pioneer Zephyr" crossed the one million mile mark in regular service on December 29, 1939, near <a href="Council%20Bluffs%2C%20Iowa">Council Bluffs</a>, <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>.

Ralph Budd and the Burlington capitalized on the "Zephyr"'s success. As most passenger trains needed larger capacity the Burlington made a transition to larger <a href="diesel%20locomotive">diesel-electric locomotives</a> pulling individual passenger cars. New streamlined cars of standard size were ordered, which quickly became the standard of many railroads. Burlington ordered its large <a href="EMD%20E-unit">"E" series</a> passenger diesels with matching stainless-steel fluting. Many of the Burlington's long distance <a href="List%20of%20named%20passenger%20trains">named passenger trains</a> began operating under the "Zephyr" banner, including the "<a href="Nebraska%20Zephyr">Nebraska Zephyr</a>", "<a href="Twin%20Cities%20Zephyr">Twin Cities Zephyr</a>", and perhaps the most famous of the namesake, the "<a href="California%20Zephyr">California Zephyr</a>".

On the second anniversary of the train's famous dash, the original "Zephyr" was rechristened the "Pioneer Zephyr" to distinguish it as the first of the Burlington's growing "Zephyr" fleet. In 1938, car 525 was replaced by car number 500, a 40-seat buffet/lounge car, to provide light meals. Car number 505, the baggage-coach <a href="combine%20car">combine</a>, was rebuilt at this time into a full <a href="baggage%20car">baggage car</a>, but it kept its original windows.

In regular service, the "Pioneer Zephyr" had its share of accidents. In 1939 it was involved in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab. The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the cab back from the front of the locomotive to above a large nose, as on <a href="EMD%20F-unit">EMD F-unit</a> and <a href="EMD%20E-unit">EMD E-unit</a> locomotives.

Since the "Pioneer Zephyr" was built of stainless steel, which is not as recyclable as <a href="aluminium">aluminum</a>, the train was spared from the metal recycling drives of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. By contrast, <a href="Union%20Pacific">Union Pacific</a>'s <a href="M-10000">M-10000</a>, built of aluminum, was scrapped in 1942 for the war effort, among other reasons.

In 1948 and 1949, the "Pioneer Zephyr" was temporarily removed from service to participate in the <a href="Chicago%20Railroad%20Fair">Chicago Railroad Fair</a>'s "Wheels A-Rolling" pageant. The fair's purpose was to celebrate 100 years of railroad history west of Chicago, and the "Pioneer Zephyr"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s role in the pageant was to highlight the latest strides in railroad technology. It resumed regular passenger operations when the fair ended on October 2, 1949. By 1955 the "Pioneer Zephyr"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s route had been updated to run between <a href="Galesburg%2C%20Illinois">Galesburg</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, and <a href="Saint%20Joseph%2C%20Missouri">Saint Joseph</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>; the trainset had been in continual service since 1934, operating over nearly 3 million miles (4.8 million kilometres). The "Pioneer Zephyr"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s last revenue run was a trip from <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Nebraska">Lincoln</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, to <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, (along the train's regular revenue route) that then continued to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> on March 20, 1960. When <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> took over passenger rail services in 1971, the legendary "Zephyr" name was preserved, and the "California Zephyr" is an Amtrak route in the 21st century.

Press publicity had apparently first coined the term "Silver Streak". The "Pioneer Zephyr"'s famous Denver-Chicago dash served as the inspiration for the 1934 film "<a href="The%20Silver%20Streak">The Silver Streak</a>" starring <a href="Charles%20Starrett">Charles Starrett</a>. In that story, the crew was racing to the <a href="Boulder%20Dam">Boulder Dam</a> construction site with an <a href="Negative%20pressure%20ventilator">iron lung</a>, with only moments to spare. The original "Zephyr" trainset was used for the exterior shots in the film, while interior scenes were filmed on a soundstage in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20California">Hollywood</a>. For the film, the "Burlington Route" nameplate on the train's nose was replaced with one that read "Silver Streak".

The sensation caused by the new "Zephyr" trainsets sparked intense competition centered on speed and styling in the region served by the CB&Q. In May 1935 the Milwaukee Road introduced the <a href="Milwaukee%20Road%20class%20A">Class A</a> steam-powered high speed streamliner locomotive on its Chicago-Twin Cities "<a href="Hiawatha%20%28train%29">Hiawatha</a>" run, in direct competition with the CB&Q "<a href="Twin%20Cities%20Zephyr">Twin Cities Zephyr</a>". The styling of the Class A was directly evocative of the "Zephyr", with a "shovel-nose" front end featuring a high-mounted headlamp ensconced in grillework. Another early adopter of streamline styling was the <a href="New%20York%20Central">New York Central</a> railway with its "Commodore Vanderbilt" steam locomotive, showing styling elements borrowed from the "Zephyr", unveiled in <a href="1934%20in%20rail%20transport">December 1934</a>. A "Zephyr"-type trainset, the "<a href="Flying%20Yankee">Flying Yankee</a>", started service between <a href="Boston">Boston</a> and <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a> in April 1935, signaling new competition for steam-powered passenger service on the east coast. The <a href="Gulf%2C%20Mobile%20and%20Northern%20Railroad">Gulf, Mobile, and Northern</a> <a href="Rebel%20%28train%29">Rebel</a> featured styling similar to that of the "Zephyr", entering service on July 10, 1935 between New Orleans and Jackson, Tennessee. The race was on nationally to develop faster and more stylish locomotives for passenger service, boosting the streamliner trend.

Style and structural elements of the "Zephyr" were incorporated into the EMC <a href="EMD%20E-unit">"E" series</a> diesel locomotives introduced in 1937, featuring "shovel-nose" front ends beneath their elevated cabs. The <a href="EMD%20E5">E5</a> units produced for CB&Q paid homage to the original "Zephyr" trainsets with a stainless steel body, fluted lower bodywork, horizontal black stripes across the front, and faux grillework flanking the upper headlamp. The lightweight construction introduced to mainline service by the "Zephyr" trainsets became the standard for new railcars used with the new EMC-powered diesel streamliners such as the <a href="AT%26amp%3BSF">AT&SF</a> "<a href="Super%20Chief">Super Chief</a>."

On May 26, 1960, the 26th anniversary of the "Dawn-to-Dusk" dash, the original "Pioneer Zephyr" train (car numbers 9900, 505 and 570) was donated to Chicago's <a href="Museum%20of%20Science%20and%20Industry%20%28Chicago%29">Museum of Science and Industry</a> (MSI). Car number 500, which operated with the train from 1938, went along with "<a href="Mark%20Twain%20Zephyr">Mark Twain Zephyr</a>" trainset 9903 to a party in <a href="Mount%20Pleasant%2C%20Iowa">Mount Pleasant</a>, <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>, for static display in a town park, but plans for the train's display did not work out; in 2002 car 500 and the "Mark Twain Zephyr" were stored in <a href="Granite%20City%2C%20Illinois">Granite City, Illinois</a> with plans to display it in <a href="Fairfield%2C%20Iowa">Fairfield</a>, <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>.

MSI displayed the "Pioneer Zephyr" outdoors, with no protection from the weather, until 1994. At that time, the steam locomotive that shared the display space with the "Zephyr", <a href="Atchison%2C%20Topeka%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway">Santa Fe</a> #2903, was donated to the <a href="Illinois%20Railway%20Museum">Illinois Railway Museum</a> (IRM) at <a href="Union%2C%20Illinois">Union</a>, west of Chicago, while MSI prepared a new display location for the "Zephyr".

MSI dug a pit in front of the building and built a new display area for the "Zephyr", where it could be displayed year-round. In 1998, after the train received a <a href="cosmetic%20restoration">cosmetic restoration</a> by <a href="Northern%20Rail%20Car">Northern Rail Car</a> in <a href="Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, the pit was finally ready to receive the train. Rohn Metal Fabricating, Inc., known for its expertise in stainless steel fabrication, played a part in the interior restoration of the "Zephyr". The "Pioneer Zephyr" train is still on display at MSI just outside the main entrance from the museum's underground parking area, where it is one of the more popular exhibits.

Brian Booth

Brian Charles Booth (born 19 October 1933) is a former <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team">Australian cricketer</a> who played in 29 <a href="Test%20cricket">Tests</a> from 1961 to 1966, and 93 <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> matches for New South Wales. He captained <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> for two Tests during the 1965–66 <a href="The%20Ashes">Ashes</a> series while regular captain <a href="Bob%20Simpson%20%28cricketer%29">Bob Simpson</a> was absent due to illness and injury. Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm <a href="pace%20bowling">medium pace</a> or <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>. He had an inclination to use his feet to charge <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowlers</a>. Booth was known for his <a href="sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a> on the field and often invoked <a href="Sydney%20Anglicans">Christianity</a> while discussing ethics and sport.

Born near the <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> country town of <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a>, Booth moved to Sydney in 1952 and played in the <a href="Sydney%20Grade%20Cricket">grade cricket</a> competition while training to become a teacher. He made his first-class debut for the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales cricket team</a> and came to prominence in dramatic circumstances in his second match, against the touring <a href="England%20cricket%20team">Englishmen</a> in 1954–55. Due to late withdrawals, Booth was selected at late notice and had to be called from work on the morning of the match. After arriving after the start of the match, he scored 74 following a batting collapse. Booth struggled to make an impression early in his career and missed a season to train and with the Australian <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a> team for the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Olympics</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Upon returning to first-class cricket in 1957–58, he held down a regular position in the state team while the Test players were touring overseas. Booth gradually progressed and gained selection on the 1959–60 Australian Second XI tour to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

Booth was selected for the Australian team that toured England in 1961 and played in the final two Tests. Upon his return to Australia, Booth made two <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">centuries</a> in the 1962–63 home Test series against England, establishing himself in the Test team. He made two further centuries the following summer against <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a> and was named the Australian player of the year. Following the retirement of <a href="Richie%20Benaud">Richie Benaud</a>, Booth was appointed vice-captain under Simpson as Australia embarked on a successful 1964 tour of England, which saw the retention of the Ashes. Booth played his final Test series in 1965–66 against England, captaining Australia in the First and Third Tests because Simpson was sidelined with a broken wrist and <a href="chickenpox">chickenpox</a> respectively. The First Test was drawn but Australia fell to its first innings defeat in almost ten years in the Third Test. As he was also in a form slump, Booth was dropped as the Australian selectors made mass changes, ending his career. In retirement, Booth returned to his teaching duties and served as an Anglican lay-preacher. He was inducted into the <a href="Cricket%20NSW">Cricket NSW</a> Hall of Fame in 2014.

The son of "Snowy" Booth, a market gardener and talented country cricketer, Booth was born in <a href="Perthville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Perthville</a>, located outside the New South Wales regional town of <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a>. His father hung pictures of <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a> and <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a> on the wall and told him that "these are the two greatest living cricketers". Booth represented <a href="Bathurst%20High%20School%20%28Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales%29">Bathurst High School</a> at the age of 13 and played first grade cricket in Bathurst at 15. He was selected for a New South Wales youth country side at the age of just 14. In 1950, Booth represented New South Wales Country against a combined Sydney team, and moved to <a href="St.%20George%20Cricket%20Club">St. George</a> to play on a weekly basis two years later. He made the first grade team at the age of 19 and began a four-year course at <a href="Sydney%20Teachers%20College">Sydney Teachers College</a>. Booth also played hockey in <a href="Perthville">Perthville</a> and began playing for St. George upon his arrival in Sydney.

Booth made his <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut for <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> against <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a> in the 1954–55 <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a>. He made a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> in the first innings before adding 19 in the second. <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> won, but Booth was dropped when the Test players returned from international duty. Booth was recalled a month later for a match against <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>'s <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201954-55">English cricket team</a> at the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>. <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> and <a href="Bill%20Watson%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Watson</a> had to withdraw at late notice and Booth was asked to play, having already started his day's work as a teacher at <a href="Hurlstone%20Agricultural%20High%20School">Hurlstone Agricultural College</a>. He caught a train and arrived at the ground more than half an hour after the start of play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth came in with a borrowed cap and <a href="Cricket%20bat">bat</a> to join <a href="Peter%20Philpott">Peter Philpott</a>. They put on an 83-run partnership, and Booth eventually finished the innings unbeaten on 74 as the hosts folded for 172. Booth made a duck in the second innings and took his maiden first-class wicket as New South Wales defeated Hutton's men. It was only the tourists' second loss for the campaign, and the last match in Booth's debut season.

Booth had a low key season in 1955–56, struggling to find a regular position in the New South Wales team. As there were no international matches during the summer, the Test players were available for the whole campaign. He played in six matches and had few opportunities, managing only 157 runs at 31.40, passing fifty on only one occasion. New South Wales went on to claim a hat-trick of Sheffield Shield titles.

Booth was selected for the New South Wales hockey team in 1955 and toured New Zealand in 1956. Good performances on this tour led to his selection in the Australian Olympic squad for the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Summer Olympics</a>, but he had an anxious wait following media claims that he had received out of pocket expenses for playing cricket, which would make him a professional and therefore ineligible to participate in the Olympics. Eventually, Booth and fellow first-class cricketers <a href="Ian%20Dick">Ian Dick</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Foley%20%28Australian%20sportsman%29">Maurice Foley</a> were cleared to play for Australia. Booth then missed the 1956–57 <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> season because he was part of the Australian field hockey team that finished fifth at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Booth was selected as an inside left, but was not utilised in any of Australia's matches. In his absence, New South Wales won a fourth consecutive domestic title.

In 1957–58, the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team">Australian Test team</a> toured South Africa during the southern hemisphere summer, opening up opportunities in the Shield competition back in Australia. Booth established himself at first-class level with 503 runs at 50.30. After scoring two fifties, he broke through for his maiden first-class century against the <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victorian Bushrangers</a> at the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>, in his last match of the season. He put on a partnership of 325 with future Test teammate <a href="Norm%20O%27Neill">Norm O'Neill</a> in fewer than four hours. It was his fifteenth first-class match, and helped his state secure a fifth successive title with a ten-wicket win over their arch-rivals. With the Test players returning to Australia in 1958–59, Booth again faced more competition for places. He struggled, playing six matches and aggregating only 190 runs at 31.66. He only had six innings for the entire season, and in his only opportunity against <a href="Peter%20May%20%28cricketer%29">Peter May</a>'s touring Englishmen, he made a duck. Booth passed 50 on two occasions during the season, making 75 and 85. In one high-scoring match against <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a>, he took 0/97 with his part-time <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>.

The national team toured the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> during the 1959–60 Australian season, opening up more vacancies at a domestic level. Booth had a strong first-class season, scoring 718 runs at 65.27 with two centuries to place third on the run scoring aggregates. He started the season with 168 as New South Wales defeated Queensland by an innings before scoring 177 two matches later in an innings win over South Australia. His state completed a seventh Sheffield Shield triumph in succession.

Booth's performances saw him selected for a second choice Australian team that toured <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> under the captaincy of <a href="Ian%20Craig">Ian Craig</a>. He scored 105 in his first innings for his country, in a victory over <a href="Auckland%20cricket%20team">Auckland</a>. Booth scored 184 runs at 30.66 and took three wickets at 25.00 in the four international matches against <a href="New%20Zealand%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a>. Booth considered retiring after the season, feeling that the time needed for first-class cricket was impinging on his work as a lay preacher and a Christian youth worker.

Booth brought himself into contention for the Test selection with a series of strong displays in 1960–61. He aggregated 981 runs at an average of 65.40, with three centuries. Only five players scored more runs, all at lower averages. Two of the centuries were in combined Australian XI matches at the end of the season for expected Test squad members. In a match against the <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmanian Tigers</a>, Booth struck a breezy 100 from 104 balls in 90 minutes of batting. Another highlight was an 87 against the touring <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>, helping New South Wales to complete an innings win. Booth's productivity helped his state to another Sheffield Shield win.

Booth was then selected for <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> tour of England in 1961; he and Victorian opening batsmen <a href="Bill%20Lawry">Bill Lawry</a>, the two uncapped batsmen in the team, were regarded as the last two players chosen. Booth quickly gained a reputation for his attention to physical fitness. He led the Australians in their morning exercises during the sea voyage, which captain <a href="Richie%20Benaud">Richie Benaud</a> made optional. After scoring 37 and seven against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a> in his first match on English soil, Booth broke through for his first century for Australia, scoring 113 against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a> in his fifth match in England. He made 59 against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>, but was overlooked for the first three Tests.

Booth scored 127 not out against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>, and in the next match against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, he was caught behind for 99 from the bowling of another Brian Booth. He played consistently, with two more half-centuries to earn his debut in the Fourth Test at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28cricket%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a> in place of <a href="Colin%20McDonald%20%28Australian%20cricketer%29">Colin McDonald</a>. The series was evenly poised at 1–1, and Australia batted first on a pitch that initially assisted <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowling</a>. The surface was tinged with green and England fielded a pace line-up that included <a href="Brian%20Statham">Brian Statham</a> and <a href="Fred%20Trueman">Fred Trueman</a>. Booth was struck in the torso by his first ball, a <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> that did not rise as high as was expected. He managed to repel a spearing <a href="yorker">yorker</a> on the second ball and compiled a battling 46, the second highest score on the difficult pitch, featuring in a partnership of 46—the highest in Australia's innings—with Bill Lawry. Australia managed only 190 on the bowler-friendly pitch. Booth only managed nine in the second innings before Australia retained the Ashes after an English collapse on the final day resulted in a 54-run win. In the drawn Fifth and final Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, Booth came in with the score at 4/211 after the dismissal of O'Neill for 117. He featured in a 185-run partnership with <a href="Peter%20Burge%20%28cricketer%29">Peter Burge</a>. Booth was dismissed for 71 while attempting to loft the spin of <a href="Tony%20Lock">Tony Lock</a> over the infield, as captain Richie Benaud needed quick runs; observers felt the need to attack cost Booth his maiden Test century. Booth added three more 70s in the closing tour matches before the team returned to Australia.

The 1961–62 season was entirely a domestic season. Booth scored 507 runs at 42.25 with two centuries, against Queensland and South Australia. He placed 13th on the run scoring aggregates, helping New South Wales to win its ninth consecutive Sheffield Shield.

After scoring 72 in the opening match of the season and adding 41 against the touring Englishmen for New South Wales, Booth retained his place in the Test team for the <a href="1962-63%20Ashes%20series">1962–63 Ashes series</a>. He scored his maiden Test century in the First Test at <a href="the%20Gabba">the Gabba</a>, compiling 112 in the first innings of a high scoring draw. Thirteen innings reached fifty, but Booth was the only player to reach three figures. English captain <a href="Ted%20Dexter">Ted Dexter</a> attempted to shut down Booth's scoring by employing <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a>. In the <a href="1962-63%20Ashes%20series%23Second%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Melbourne">Second Test</a> at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>, <a href="Fred%20Titmus">Fred Titmus</a> bowled outside leg stump with five men on the on side, but Booth completed consecutive centuries with 103 in the second innings. As a result of Dexter's defensive field placings, Booth scored at only half the rate he managed in the First Test. Booth took six hours to reach triple figures and hit only four boundaries. His innings was not enough to prevent England from completing a seven-wicket victory. Booth was unable to maintain his form for the rest of the season, with 34 and 77 in the Fourth Test in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> being the only other times that he passed 20. Australia won the Third Test, drawing the series, and Booth ended the series with 404 runs at 50.50. He added a further three fifties in the Sheffield Shield as Victoria ended New South Wales' nine-year winning streak.

Booth started the 1963–64 season strongly. He scored centuries in his first two innings, recording 121 and 169 not out against Queensland and Western Australia respectively. In his rapid innings against <a href="Western%20Warriors">Western Australia</a> at the SCG, which took only 165 minutes, Booth reached 100 in 94 minutes during the second session of the day. In the lead-up to the Tests, Booth scored 63 for his state against South Africa but was unable to prevent defeat. In the Tests, he began the way he did in the previous season, with a century. Coming to the crease with Australia at 3/88 in the first innings of the First Test in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, Booth withstood an opening burst of bouncers from South African spearhead <a href="Peter%20Pollock">Peter Pollock</a>. He went on to accumulate his Test best of 169 from 81 overs of batting, in a display that gained wide praise because of his elegant strokemaking. One newspaper proclaimed that his innings had "more <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace</a> than the Princess of Monaco." <a href="Ray%20Robinson%20%28cricket%20writer%29">Ray Robinson</a> said "it was a tailored innings, fit to be put on display in a showcase and unrumpled by a single chance". South African skipper <a href="Trevor%20Goddard%20%28cricketer%29">Trevor Goddard</a> later said "We didn't mind the leather chasing, when he played so charmingly". Booth's innings was the highlight of a match that was uneventful in terms of cricket but notorious for the <a href="throwing%20%28cricket%29">no-balling</a> of <a href="Ian%20Meckiff">Ian Meckiff</a>. A broken finger sidelined Booth for a month and prevented him from playing in the Second Test, but he returned for the Third Test in Sydney, and began a sequence of 75, 16, 58 and 24. He finished the series in the Fifth Test in his home town, top-scoring in both of Australia's innings, with 102 not out and 87 in a draw. It capped off a productive fortnight for Booth; he had scored 162 not out against South Australia before the final Test. In four Tests, he aggregated 531 runs at 88.50. For the entire first-class season, Booth had struck five centuries and totalled 1,180 runs. According to <a href="Gideon%20Haigh">Gideon Haigh</a>, he had "played exquisitely" throughout the season, which was his career peak and saw him named the Australian Cricketer of the Year for 1963–64.

Captain Benaud retired at the end of the South Africa series—he had already relinquished the leadership after the First Test—and Booth was elevated to the vice-captaincy under <a href="Bob%20Simpson%20%28cricketer%29">Bob Simpson</a> for the 1964 tour of England. Along with Simpson and Lawry, Booth was one of three on-tour selectors. Some observers felt that the personable Booth would have been more popular among the playing group than Simpson, while others thought that he would not have been hard-nosed enough in pursuing his team's competitive interest. While Simpson was known for being relentlessly hard-nosed, he was also abrasive and sometimes irritated others by making derogatory comments towards teammates. Booth again ran daily fitness classes during the voyage, and on this occasion, Simpson made them compulsory for the players. Booth started the tour well, scoring 109 not out in his third match for the summer, against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>. He passed 50 three more times before the start of the Tests, when his form waned.

Booth failed to pass 20 in the first six innings of the Test series. With Australia 1–0 up after three Tests, a draw in the Fourth Test was sufficient to retain the urn. Booth regained his touch with three scores beyond fifty in four innings leading up to the Fourth Test, including 132 against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>. When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Fourth Test, Booth made a "courtly" 98 in a 219-run partnership with Simpson. The Australians batted for more than two days to burn off any chance of an England victory. Booth then scored 193 not out, his highest for the summer, in Australia's 7/315 declared against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, setting up the tourists' victory. He made 74 in the Fifth Test and ended the series with 210 runs at 42.00. Along with Simpson and Lawry, Booth was one of three Australians to accumulate more than 1,500 first-class runs for the English summer.

Three Tests against <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> and one against <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a> lay ahead of Booth as the Australians visited the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> on the late-1964 voyage back to Australia. He had a mediocre time, passing fifty only once, with 74 in the Second Test at <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>'s <a href="Brabourne%20Stadium">Brabourne Stadium</a>. That innings was terminated when Indian wicket-keeper <a href="KS%20Indrajitsinhji">KS Indrajitsinhji</a> fumbled a stumping opportunity—the ball rolled back down the pitch. Despite breaking the stumps with his hand while the ball was not in close proximity, Indrajitsinhji's appeal was upheld. According to Haigh, "It seemed like ten men [one of the Australians was ill] were pitted against thirteen [eleven Indian players and two umpires]". Booth compiled 127 runs at 21.17 and took the only three wickets of his Test career on the spin-friendly subcontinental surfaces. He took 2/33 in the drawn Third Test in <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, before capturing his final wicket in the second innings of the only Test against Pakistan in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>. At the time, cricket matches in Australia and England were typically interrupted by the Sunday rest day, and Booth used these for religious observances. However, this custom was not observed on the subcontinent. Booth wanted to withdraw for personal reasons, but decided to play due to injuries and illnesses to other players. He made 57 in a Test against Pakistan in Melbourne upon arrival in Australia. It was the only home Test of the season before the hosts embarked upon a tour to the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. Booth scored 115 for his state against the Pakistanis and ended the Australian season with 327 runs at 46.71.

Australia arrived in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> in 1964–65 for five Tests against the emerging power of the 1960s, who were led by the hostile express <a href="pace%20bowling">pace bowling</a> of <a href="Wes%20Hall">Wes Hall</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Griffith">Charlie Griffith</a>. After narrowly evading a bouncer at the start of his innings, Booth made a battling top-score of 56 in the First Test loss at <a href="Sabina%20Park">Sabina Park</a> in <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>. He then made 117 in the Second Test at <a href="Port%20of%20Spain">Port of Spain</a> in <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, an innings that included a stand of 228 with <a href="Bob%20Cowper">Bob Cowper</a>, which helped Australia hang on for a draw. It was to be Booth's last Test century, an innings he regarded as his "most satisfying", having collected a series of bruises, on a ground with no sightscreen. Booth did not pass 40 in the last three Tests and ended with 234 runs at 29.25 as Australia lost 2–1, their first series loss since the 1956 Ashes series and their first series loss against a team other than England, excluding a one-off Test against Pakistan in 1956. He had particular trouble with the pace of Griffith, and on one occasion, the paceman hit him on the nose before <a href="yorker">yorking</a> him on the next ball; Booth maintains that he did not see the ball. Booth added two more fifties in the four first-class matches outside the Tests.

At the start of the 1965–66 season, Booth scored fifties in three consecutive matches, including an 80 against the <a href="MCC%20tour%20of%20Australia%20in%201965-66">MCC tourists</a>. The <a href="1965-66%20Ashes%20series">1965-66 Ashes series</a> saw Booth captain Australia for the first time in a Test. Simpson sustained a broken wrist, leaving Booth to lead the hosts in the First Test in Brisbane. Booth prepared quietly, leaving Simpson to handle the press. He won the toss and elected to bat; fewer than two hours of play was possible on a rain-shortened first day, and the second day was entirely washed out. Booth made only 16 before being caught and bowled by <a href="Fred%20Titmus">Fred Titmus</a> on the third morning, but centuries to Lawry and debutant <a href="Doug%20Walters">Doug Walters</a> saw Australia declare at 6/443. Booth rotated his spinners and dismissed the tourists for 280; the match ended in a draw with England at 3/186 after being forced to <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a>. When <a href="Geoff%20Boycott">Geoff Boycott</a> pushed a ball from <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Peter%20Philpott">Peter Philpott</a> away with his hand, Booth refused to appeal for <a href="handled%20the%20ball">handling the ball</a>.

After the drawn Second Test, Simpson contracted <a href="chickenpox">chickenpox</a>, so Booth was again captain for the Third Test in front of his home crowd at the SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests; his teammates felt that their captain had been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.
England batted first and their openers immediately seized the initiative, putting on 234 for the first wicket in four hours. The tourists made 488 and Booth scored eight as Australia replied with 221 and were forced to follow on. He made 27 in the second innings before being bowled by <a href="David%20Allen%20%28cricketer%29">David Allen</a> as the hosts fell to an innings defeat. It was Australia's biggest defeat at home since the Fourth Test of the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201911%E2%80%9312">1911–12 Ashes series</a> when they lost by an innings and 225 runs. After the match, England captain <a href="M.%20J.%20K.%20Smith">Mike Smith</a> told Booth that he expected to see him in the Fourth Test, but his Australian counterpart prophetically predicted his downfall.

With Australia 0–1 down, the selectors took drastic action and dropped Booth, Cowper, Philpott, McKenzie and <a href="David%20Sincock">David Sincock</a>. The revamped team won the next Test by an innings, and Booth never played for Australia again. If he had played another Test, Booth would have been eligible for the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Cricket%20Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a>'s retirement bonus of AUD50 a Test. Booth's last five Test innings had netted only 84 runs. After the match, he received a letter from <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>, then a member of the selection panel and the <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Board of Control</a>:

Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and will be the first to admit that your form has not been good.

Booth ended the first-class season with 596 runs at 29.80, including four half-centuries. He continued to play for New South Wales before retiring during the 1968–69 season.

In the 1966–67 Australian season, Booth scored 638 runs at 49.07, ranking fifth in the run-scoring aggregates for the summer. He scored 149 against Queensland, and added four fifties, including two scores in the 90s. As a result, Booth was made vice-captain of an Australian Second XI that toured New Zealand under the leadership of <a href="Les%20Favell">Les Favell</a>, while the national team was in South Africa. After failing to pass 26 in his first five innings, Booth made his highest first-class score—214 not out—against <a href="Central%20Districts%20Stags">Central Districts</a>, and was Australia's leading run-scorer for the tour. After scoring only 62 runs in the first four innings in the opening three international matches against New Zealand, Booth made 179 in the fourth and final match.

Booth was less successful in his penultimate season in 1967–68, with only 426 runs at 23.66, including two half-centuries, both against Victoria. A decision by administrators to introduce Sunday play into the Sheffield Shield ended his career, as he refused to make himself available for games that involved Sunday play. He played in only one match in his final season in 1968–69, scoring a duck and 15 as New South Wales lost to South Australia by three wickets. Booth continued to play grade cricket for the St. George club until 1976–77, leading the batting averages and aggregates in 1974–75. With 10,674 runs at 45.42, he was fifth on the all-time run-scoring aggregates in Sydney grade competition at the time of his retirement, but has now dropped to ninth.

Brian Booth, that model of a man and of a batsman who tends to be under-rated and forgotten because both he and his cricket were so blamelessly self-effacing. Tall, upright, correct in method, ever-patient, he repeated the hundred he had got at <a href="the%20Gabba">Brisbane</a>, and so gave England a target to go for while all around him were failing. 
Booth was regarded as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style. In <a href="Field%20hockey">hockey</a>, a player is not allowed to lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his <a href="late%20cut">late cut</a> and his <a href="cover%20drive">cover drive</a>, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to <a href="Mark%20Waugh">Mark Waugh</a>. He was known for his quick footwork against <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowling</a> and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181 cm, weighed 66 kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and on the second day of the Second Test against the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> in <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> in 1964–65, he <a href="run%20out">ran out</a> <a href="Gary%20Sobers">Gary Sobers</a> and <a href="Basil%20Butcher">Basil Butcher</a> with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner before converting to <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>.

Booth had a reputation for walking when he knew that he was out, without waiting for the <a href="Umpire%20%28cricket%29">umpire's</a> decision, and he was regarded as a player and leader of the highest principles. He was known for his record of instilling high standards of conduct into his players and prevented them from showing dissent towards unfavourable umpiring decisions. Robinson said that "if a prize were offered for fairplaymanship among Australia's post-war cricketers Brian Booth ought to win it hands down". Lawry regarded Booth as one of the most gentlemanly cricketers that he knew.

A committed <a href="Christianity">Christian</a>, Booth is an <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> lay-preacher, and often invokes religious and ethical arguments while talking about issues such as <a href="sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a>. Booth became intensely religious in the 1950s after befriending Pastor Roy Gray, a colleague in district cricket and a classmate at Sydney Teachers College. Gray challenged his friend's faith, and Booth reflected that "Until that point, sport had really been my God". During Booth's career, the media made much of his religious convictions. After scoring his maiden Test century, Booth was asked whether he felt that God was with him. He replied in the affirmative, and the next day, a newspaper printed the headline "England can't win. God is on Brian Booth's side."

Booth co-authored "Cricket and Christianity" with <a href="Paul%20White%20%28missionary%29">Paul White</a> and wrote "Hockey Fundamentals" and "Booth to Bat". In 1998 he wrote "Sport and sportsmanship: a Christian perspective towards 2000" for the Australian Christian Forum on Education. He believed that the foundations of sport were courtesy and fairness, and he condemned the prevalence of verbal jousting in the modern game. During his career, Booth often spoke at religious functions in combination with other Christian cricketers. He appeared with the English Test opener Reverend <a href="David%20Sheppard">David Sheppard</a> at <a href="Sydney%20Town%20Hall">Sydney Town Hall</a> and preached with <a href="Conrad%20Hunte">Conrad Hunte</a> in the West Indies.

Despite Booth's views being more genteel than that of most of his teammates, there was minimal friction or disconnect. Early in his state career, Booth declined to join a <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a> gambling sweep organised by captain <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>. However, Miller included Booth in the event by assigning him to look after the money. Booth said "That was typical of Keith. That he was able to turn something that might have been a problem into something positive, giving me a responsibility, making me feel part of the team." He added "The boys just accepted me for what I was. If they didn't share the strength of my convictions, they were quite happy for me to hold them." Simpson said that Booth never attempted to impose his worldview on his teammates and never gave any inkling that he disapproved of their behaviour.

After retirement, Booth resumed full-time duties as a Sydney schoolmaster. He spent 12 years as a teacher in the government secondary schools of New South Wales before becoming an instructor in physical education at Sydney Teachers College in 1967. Before retiring in 1989, Booth served as the head of the Health and Human Movement Studies Department at the <a href="Sydney%20Institute%20of%20Education">Sydney Institute of Education</a>—the successor of the STC—for five years. In 1958, he married Judith Williams, whom he met at STC. They had four daughters, the first being born in 1961, and six grandchildren. Booth is the uncle of hammer thrower <a href="Brooke%20Krueger-Billett">Brooke Krueger-Billett</a>, who represented Australia at the <a href="2006%20Commonwealth%20Games">2006 Commonwealth Games</a>.
In 1967, Booth was appointed as the founding chairman of the Youth Advisory Council, a body that sought to address community issues such as hooliganism. Booth was made a life member of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Cricket%20Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a> (NSWCA) in 1974 and served as a vice-president for four years from 1973–74 onwards. He was awarded life membership of the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>, the home of cricket. Booth has remained involved in grassroots cricket with <a href="St%20George%20Cricket%20Club">St George</a>. He has served as the club president among other positions on the executive committee, and currently serves as a coach. The Booth Saunders pavilion at the club's home ground, <a href="Hurstville%20Oval">Hurstville Oval</a>, is jointly named in his honour. He is also the patron of the St George Randwick Men's Hockey Club and the St George Women's Hockey Club.

In the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201974">1974 Federal Election</a>, Booth gained preselection as the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a> candidate for the <a href="Division%20of%20St%20George">Division of St George</a>, standing against Science Minister <a href="William%20Morrison%20%28Australian%20politician%29">William Morrison</a> of the ruling <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201974">federal election</a>. The seat, which had changed hands at several elections in the past, was held by Morrison for Labor, who were returned to office. In 1982, Booth was awarded a <a href="MBE">MBE</a> for "services to the community and sport".

In 2002, Booth returned to the public spotlight when he condemned the <a href="sledging%20%28cricket%29">sledging</a>, or verbal intimidation tactics, that are used in modern cricket. He stated "I can't remember in the games that I played in, I can't ever remember being sledged, and I can't ever remember sledging anybody", in reference to <a href="Steve%20Waugh">Steve Waugh</a>'s Australian team, which was perceived as being too hostile. In the Australian edition of the 2002 "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>", he wrote a chapter titled "The Curse of Sledging".

Booth was inducted into the <a href="Cricket%20NSW">Cricket NSW</a> Hall of Fame in 2014 alongside <a href="Geoff%20Lawson%20%28cricketer%29">Geoff Lawson</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Peden">Margaret Peden</a>.

Golden jackal

The golden jackal ("Canis aureus") is a <a href="Evolution%20of%20the%20wolf%23Wolf-like%20canids">wolf-like canid</a> that is native to <a href="Southeast%20Europe">Southeast Europe</a>, <a href="Southwest%20Asia">Southwest Asia</a>, <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>, and regions of <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Compared with the <a href="Arabian%20wolf">Arabian wolf</a>, which is the smallest of the <a href="Gray%20wolf">gray wolves</a> ("Canis lupus"), the jackal is smaller and possesses shorter legs, a shorter tail, a more elongated torso, a less-prominent forehead, and a narrower and more pointed muzzle. The golden jackal's coat can vary in color from a pale creamy yellow in summer to a dark tawny beige in winter. It is listed as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> due to its widespread distribution and high density in areas with plenty of available food and optimum shelter.

The ancestor of the golden jackal is believed to be the extinct <a href="Canis%20arnensis">Arno river dog</a> that lived in <a href="Southern%20Europe">Mediterranean Europe</a> 1.9million years ago. It is described as having been a small, jackal-like canine. Genetic studies indicate that the golden jackal expanded from India around 20,000 years ago towards the end of the last <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">ice age</a>. The oldest golden jackal fossil, found at the <a href="Ksar%20Akil">Ksar Akil</a> rock shelter near <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, Lebanon, is 20,000 years old. The oldest golden jackal fossils in Europe were found in Greece and are 7,000 years old. There are seven <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the golden jackal. The golden jackal is more closely related to the gray wolf, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="African%20golden%20wolf">African golden wolf</a>, and <a href="Ethiopian%20wolf">Ethiopian wolf</a> than it is to the African <a href="black-backed%20jackal">black-backed jackal</a> or <a href="side-striped%20jackal">side-striped jackal</a>. It is capable of producing fertile <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> with both the gray wolf and the African golden wolf. <a href="Jackal%E2%80%93dog%20hybrid">Jackal–dog hybrid</a>s called <a href="Sulimov%20dogs">Sulimov dogs</a> are in service at the <a href="Sheremetyevo%20Airport">Sheremetyevo Airport</a> near Moscow where they are deployed by the Russian airline <a href="Aeroflot">Aeroflot</a> for scent-detection.

Golden jackals are abundant in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains. The golden jackal is a social species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, with the ability to exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small <a href="ungulates">ungulates</a>. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of <a href="domestic%20water%20buffalo">domestic water buffalo</a> calves. The jackal's competitors are the <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>, <a href="wolf">wolf</a>, <a href="jungle%20cat">jungle cat</a>, <a href="Wildcat%23Forest%20wildcat">forest wildcat</a>, and, in the Caucasus, the <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>, and, in Central Asia, the <a href="steppe%20wildcat">steppe wildcat</a>. The jackal is expanding beyond its native grounds in Southeast Europe into <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>, occupying areas where there are few or no wolves.

The biological family "<a href="Canidae">Canidae</a>" is composed of the South American canids, the fox-like canids, and the <a href="Evolution%20of%20the%20wolf%23Wolf-like%20canids">wolf-like canids</a>. All species within the wolf-like canids share a similar morphology and possess 78<a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, allowing them potentially to <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">interbreed</a>. Within the wolf-like canids is the jackal group, which includes the three jackals: the <a href="black-backed%20jackal">black-backed jackal</a> ("C.mesomelas"), the <a href="side-striped%20jackal">side-striped jackal</a> ("Canis adustus"), and the golden jackal ("Canis aureus"). These three species are approximately the same size, possess similar dental and skeletal morphology, and are identified from each other primarily by their coat color. They were once thought to have different distributions across Africa with their ranges overlapping in <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a> (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania). Although the jackal group has traditionally been considered as homogenous, genetic studies show that jackals are not <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> (they do not share a common ancestor), and they are only distantly related. The accuracy of the colloquial name "jackal" to describe all jackals is therefore questionable.

<a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">Mitochondrial DNA</a> (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. Thus, <a href="phylogenetic%20analysis">phylogenetic analysis</a> of mDNA sequences within a species provides a history of maternal lineages that can be represented as a <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">phylogenetic tree</a>. A 2005 genetic study of the canids found that the <a href="gray%20wolf">gray wolf</a> and <a href="dog">dog</a> are the most closely related on this tree. The next most closely related are the <a href="coyote">coyote</a> ("Canis latrans"), golden jackal, and <a href="Ethiopian%20wolf">Ethiopian wolf</a> ("Canis simensis"), which have all been shown to <a href="Hybridisation%20%28biology%29">hybridize</a> with the dog in the wild. The next closest are the <a href="dhole">dhole</a> ("Cuon alpinus") and <a href="African%20wild%20dog">African wild dog</a> ("Lycaon pictus"), which are not members of genus "Canis". These are followed by the black-backed and side-striped jackals, members of genus "Canis" and the most <a href="lineage%20%28genetic%29%23Basal%20lineage">basal</a> members of this <a href="clade">clade</a>.

Results from two recent studies of mDNA from golden jackals indicate that the specimens from Africa are genetically closer to the gray wolf than are the specimens from Eurasia. In 2015 a major DNA study of golden jackals concluded that the six "C.aureus" subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species "C.anthus" (African golden wolf), reducing the number of golden jackal subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this study shows the golden jackal diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the African golden wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the golden jackal and the African golden wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.

The <a href="Canis%20arnensis">Arno river dog</a> ("Canis arnensis") is an extinct species of canine that was endemic to <a href="Mediterranean%20Europe">Mediterranean Europe</a> during the <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a> around 1.9million years ago. It is described as a small jackal-like dog and probably the ancestor of modern jackals. Its anatomy and morphology relate it more to the modern golden jackal than to the two African jackal species, the black-backed jackal and the side-striped jackal.

The oldest golden jackal fossil was found at the <a href="Ksar%20Akil">Ksar Akil</a> rock shelter located northeast of <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, Lebanon. The fragment of a single tooth is dated approximately 7,600 years ago. The oldest golden jackal fossils found in Europe are from <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> and Kitsos in Greece and are dated 7,000–6,500 years ago. An unusual fossil of a heel bone found in <a href="Azykh%20Cave">Azykh Cave</a>, in <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, dates to the <a href="Middle%20Pleistocene">Middle Pleistocene</a> and is described as probably belonging to the golden jackal, but its classification is not clear. The fossil is described as being slightly smaller and thinner than the <a href="cave%20lynx">cave lynx</a>, similar to the fox, but too large, and similar to the wolf, but too small. As the golden jackal falls between these two in size, the fossil possibly belongs to a golden jackal. The absence of clearly identified golden jackal fossils in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> region and <a href="Transcaucasia">Transcaucasia</a>, areas where the species currently resides, indicates that the species is a relatively recent arrival.

A <a href="haplotype">haplotype</a> is a group of <a href="genes">genes</a> found in an organism that is inherited from one of its parents. A <a href="haplogroup">haplogroup</a> is a group of similar haplotypes that share a single <a href="single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">mutation</a> inherited from their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the golden jackal form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by golden jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes golden jackals from all of the other regions. Indian golden jackals exhibit the highest <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a>, and those from northern and western India are the most <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a>, which indicates that India was the center from which golden jackals spread. The extant golden jackal lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, the warmer regions of India and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> provided a refuge from colder surrounding areas. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the beginning of the warming cycles, the golden jackal lineage expanded out of India and into Eurasia to reach the Middle East and Europe.

Outside of India, golden jackals in the Caucasus and Turkey demonstrate the next highest genetic diversity, while those in Europe indicate low genetic diversity, confirming their more recent expansion into Europe. Genetic data indicates that the golden jackals of the <a href="Peloponnese%20Peninsula">Peloponnese Peninsula</a> in Greece and the <a href="Dalmatian%20coast">Dalmatian coast</a> in Croatia may represent two ancient European populations from 6,000 years ago that have survived into modern times.
Jackals were absent from most of Europe until the 19th century, when they started to expand slowly. Jackals were recorded in Hungary with the nearest population known at that time being found in Dalmatia, some 300 kilometers away. This was followed by rapid expansion of jackals towards the end of the 20th century. Golden jackals from both <a href="Southeast%20Europe">Southeast Europe</a> and the Caucasus are expanding into the <a href="Baltic%20region">Baltic</a>. In the Middle East, golden jackals from Israel have a higher genetic diversity than European jackals. This is thought to be due to Israeli jackals having <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridized</a> with dogs, gray wolves, and African golden wolves, creating a <a href="hybrid%20zone">hybrid zone</a> in Israel.

Genetic analysis reveals that mating sometimes occurs between female jackals and gray wolves, producing jackal-wolf hybrids that experts cannot visually distinguish from wolves. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a <a href="jackal%E2%80%93dog%20hybrid">jackal–dog hybrid</a>. There was 11–13% of ancient <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a> into the golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf <a href="genome">genome</a> is derived from admixture with golden jackals in ancient times.

In 2018, <a href="whole%20genome%20sequencing">whole genome sequencing</a> was used to compare members of the genus "Canis". The study supports the <a href="African%20golden%20wolf">African golden wolf</a> being distinct from the golden jackal, and with the <a href="Ethiopian%20wolf">Ethiopian wolf</a> being genetically <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> to both. There is evidence of gene flow between African golden wolves, golden jackals, and gray <a href="wolves">wolves</a>. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a> showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and Eurasian continents in canid evolution. There was evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. The study proposes that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American wolves.

The golden jackal was <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomi</a>cally subordinated to the genus "<a href="Canis">Canis</a>" by the Swedish zoologist <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his 1758 publication "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". Thirteen <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> were described since then.

The golden jackal is similar to the gray wolf but is distinguished by its smaller size, lighter weight, more elongated torso, less-prominent forehead, shorter legs and tail, and a muzzle that is narrower and more pointed. The legs are long in relation to its body, and the feet are slender with small pads. Males measure in body length and females . Males weigh and females weigh . The shoulder height is for both. In comparison, the smallest wolf is the <a href="Arabian%20wolf">Arabian wolf</a> ("Canis lupus arabs"), which weighs on average .

The skull is most like that of the <a href="dingo">dingo</a>, and is closer to that of the coyote ("C.latrans") and the gray wolf ("C.lupus") than to that of the black-backed jackal ("C.mesomalas"), the side-striped jackal ("C.adustus"), and the Ethiopian wolf ("C.simensis"). Compared with the wolf, the skull of the golden jackal is smaller and less massive, with a lower nasal region and shorter facial region; the projections of the skull are prominent but weaker than those of the wolf; the <a href="canine%20teeth">canine teeth</a> are large and strong but relatively thinner; and its <a href="carnassial">carnassial</a> teeth are weaker. The golden jackal is a less specialized species than the gray wolf, and these skull features relate to the jackal's diet of small <a href="bird">bird</a>s, <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, small vertebrates, insects, carrion, fruit, and some vegetable matter. Occasionally, the golden jackal develops a horny growth on the skull referred to as a "<a href="jackal%27s%20horn">jackal's horn</a>", which usually measures in length and is concealed by fur. This feature was once associated with magical powers by the people of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.

The jackal's fur is coarse and relatively short, with the base color golden, varying seasonally from a pale creamy yellow to a dark tawny. The fur on the back is composed of a mixture of black, brown, and white hairs, sometimes giving the appearance of the dark saddle like that seen on the black-backed jackal. The underparts are a light pale ginger to cream color. Individual specimens can be distinguished by their unique light markings on the throat and chest. The coats of jackals from high elevations tend to be more buff-colored than those of their lowland counterparts while those of jackals in rocky, mountainous areas may exhibit a grayer shade. The bushy tail has a tan to black tip. <a href="Melanism">Melanism</a> can cause a dark-colored coat in some golden jackals, a coloring once fairly common in Bengal. Unlike melanistic wolves and coyotes that received their dark pigmentation from interbreeding with domestic dogs, melanism in golden jackals probably stems from an independent mutation that could be an adaptive trait. What is possibly an albino specimen was photographed in southeastern Iran during 2012.

The jackal <a href="Moulting">moults</a> twice a year, in spring and in autumn. In Transcaucasia and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>, the spring moult begins at the end of winter. If the winter has been warm, the spring moult starts in the middle of February; if the winter has been cold, it begins in the middle of March. The spring moult lasts for 60–65 days; if the animal is sick, it loses only half of its winter fur. The spring moult commences with the head and limbs, extends to the flanks, chest, belly and rump, and ends at the tail. Fur on the underparts is absent. The autumn moult occurs from mid-September with the growth of winter fur; the shedding of the summer fur occurs at the same time. The development of the autumn coat starts with the rump and tail and spreads to the back, flanks, belly, chest, limbs and head, with full winter fur being attained at the end of November.

In <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a> the golden jackal inhabits Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In Central Asia it inhabits Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In Southeast Asia it inhabits Myanmar and Thailand. There have been two reported sightings from Cambodia, three from southern Laos, and two from Vietnameach sighting made only in lowland, open deciduous forest, and no specimens were presented. In Southwestern Asia it inhabits Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In Europe it inhabits Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the Ukraine. It has been sighted in Belarus, the Czech Republic, and Germany. It was first recorded in Denmark in 2015, likely a natural migrant from further south, and the species has since been confirmed from several locations in <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a>. It has been reported in the media in the Netherlands but it is unclear if this jackal was an escapee from a private zoo.

The golden jackal's <a href="omnivore">omnivorous diet</a> allows it to eat a large range of foods; this diet, together with its tolerance of dry conditions, enables it to live in different habitats. The jackal's long legs and lithe body allow it to trot over great distances in search of food. It is able to go without water for extended periods and has been observed on islands that have no fresh water. Jackals are abundant in valleys and along rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores, but are rare in foothills and low mountains. In Central Asia they avoid waterless deserts and cannot be found in the <a href="Karakum%20Desert">Karakum Desert</a> nor the <a href="Kyzylkum%20Desert">Kyzylkum Desert</a>, but can be found at their edges or in <a href="oasis">oases</a>. On the other hand, in India they can be found living in the <a href="Thar%20Desert">Thar Desert</a>. They are found in dense thickets of prickly bushes, reed flood-lands and forests. They have been known to ascend over up the slopes of the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>; they can withstand temperatures as low as and sometimes . They are not adapted to snow, and in snow country they must travel along paths made by larger animals or humans. In India, they will occupy the surrounding foothills above arable areas, entering human settlements at night to feed on garbage, and have established themselves around hill stations at <a href="height%20above%20mean%20sea%20level">height above mean sea level</a>. They generally avoid mountainous forests, but may enter alpine and sub-alpine areas during dispersal. In Turkey, the Caucasus, and Transcaucasia they have been observed up to above mean sea level, particularly in areas where the climate supports shrublands in high elevations.

The golden jackal is both a predator and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In <a href="Bharatpur%2C%20Rajasthan">Bharatpur</a>, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the <a href="Kanha%20Tiger%20Reserve">Kanha Tiger Reserve</a>, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of <a href="buckthorn">buckthorn</a>, <a href="dogbane">dogbane</a>, <a href="Java%20plum">Java plum</a>, and the pods of <a href="Prosopis%20juliflora">mesquite</a> and the <a href="Cassia%20fistula">golden rain tree</a>. The jackal will scavenge off the kills made by the lion, tiger, leopard, dhole, and gray wolf. In some regions of Bangladesh and India, jackals subsist by scavenging on carrion and garbage, and will cache extra food by burying it. The Irish novelist, playwright and poet, <a href="Oliver%20Goldsmith">Oliver Goldsmith</a>, wrote about the golden jackal:

In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, golden jackals primarily hunt <a href="hare">hare</a>s and <a href="mouse">mouse</a>-like rodents, and also <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>s, <a href="francolin">francolin</a>s, <a href="duck">duck</a>s, <a href="coot">coot</a>s, <a href="moorhen">moorhen</a>s, and <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s. Vegetable matter eaten by jackals in these areas includes fruits, such as <a href="pear">pear</a>s, <a href="Crataegus">hawthorn</a>, <a href="dogwood">dogwood</a>, and the cones of <a href="common%20medlar">common medlar</a>s. The jackal is implicated in the destruction of <a href="grape">grape</a>, <a href="watermelon">watermelon</a>, <a href="muskmelon">muskmelon</a>, and <a href="nut%20%28fruit%29">nut</a> crops. Near the <a href="Vakhsh%20River">Vakhsh River</a>, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a>, while during winter they feed on <a href="Elaeagnus%20angustifolia">wild stony olives</a>. Around the edges of the <a href="Karakum%20Desert">Karakum Desert</a>, jackals feed on <a href="gerbil">gerbil</a>s, <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s, <a href="snake">snake</a>s, <a href="fish">fish</a>, <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s, the fruits of wild stony olives, <a href="mulberry">mulberry</a>, dried <a href="apricot">apricot</a>s, watermelons, muskmelons, <a href="tomato">tomato</a>es, and grapes.

In <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>, the golden jackal's diet consists of mammals, fruits, vegetables, insects, birds and their eggs, grasses and leaves. Jackals change their diet to more readily available foods. In Serbia, their diet is primarily livestock carcasses that are increasingly prevalent due to a lack of removal, and this may have led to the expansion of their population. In Hungary, 55% of their diet is composed of <a href="common%20vole">common vole</a>s and <a href="bank%20vole">bank vole</a>s, and 41% is composed of wild boar carcasses. Information on the diet of the golden jackal in northeastern Italy is scant, but it is known to prey on small <a href="roe%20deer">roe deer</a> and hares. In Israel, golden jackals are significant predators of snakes; during a poisoning campaign against golden jackals there was an increase in human snakebite reports, but a decrease when the poisoning ceased.

Golden jackals exhibit flexible social organization depending on the availability of food. The <a href="breeding%20pair">breeding pair</a> is the basic social unit, and they are sometimes accompanied by their current litter of pups. In India, their distributions are a single jackal, 31%, two jackals, 35%, three jackals, 14%, and more than three jackals, 20%. Family groups of up to 4–5 individuals have been recorded. <a href="Scent%20marking">Scent marking</a> through urination and defecation is common around golden jackal den areas and on the trails they most often use. Scent marking is thought to assist in territorial defense. The hunting ranges of several jackals can overlap. Jackals can travel up to during a single night in search of either food or more suitable habitat. Non-breeding members of a pack may stay near a distant food source, such as a carcass, for up to several days before returning to their home range. Home range sizes can vary between , depending on the available food.

Social interactions such as greetings, grooming, and group howling are common in jackals. Howling is more frequent between December and April when pair bonds are being formed and breeding occurs, which suggests howling has a role in the delineation of territory and for defense. Adult jackals howl standing and the young or subordinate jackals howl sitting. Jackals are easily induced to howl and a single howl may solicit replies from several jackals in the vicinity. Howling begins with 2–3 low-pitched calls that rise to high-pitched calls. The howl consists of a wail repeated 3–4 times on an ascending scale, followed by three short yelps. Jackals typically howl at dawn and in the evening, and sometimes at midday. Adults may howl to accompany the ringing of church bells, with their young responding to sirens or the whistles of steam engines and boats. Social canids such as golden jackals, wolves, and coyotes respond to human imitations of their howls. When there is a change in the weather, jackals will produce a long and continuous chorus. Dominant canids defend their territories against intruders with either a howl to warn them off, approach and confront them, or howl followed by an approach. Jackals, wolves and coyotes will always approach a source of howling. Golden jackals give a warning call that is very different from their normal howling when they detect the presence of large carnivores such as wolves and tigers.

Golden jackals are monogamous and will remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals have only one breeding cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts for several minutes, as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and the timing of the births coincides with the annual abundance of food.

In India, the golden jackal will take over the dens of the <a href="Bengal%20fox">Bengal fox</a> and the <a href="Indian%20crested%20porcupine">Indian crested porcupine</a>, and will use abandoned gray wolf dens. Most breeding pairs are spaced well apart and maintain a core territory around their dens. Den excavations commence from late April to May in India, with dens located in scrub areas. Rivulets, gullies, and road and check-dam embankments are prime denning habitats. Drainage pipes and culverts have been used as dens. Dens are long and deep, with between 1–3 openings. Young pups can be moved between 2–4 dens. The male helps with digging the den and raising the pups. In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, the burrow is located either in thick shrub, on the slopes of gullies, or on flat surfaces. In <a href="Dagestan">Dagestan</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, litters are sometimes located within the hollows of fallen trees, among tree roots, and under stones on river banks. In Central Asia, the golden jackal does not dig burrows but constructs lairs in dense <a href="tugai">tugai</a> thickets. Jackals in the tugais and cultivated lands of Tajikistan construct lairs in long grass, shrubs, and reed openings.

In Transcaucasia, golden jackal pups are born from late March to late April, and in northeastern Italy during late April; they can be born at any time of year in Nepal. The number of pups born in a single litter varies geographically. Jackals in Transcaucasia give birth to 3–8 pups, Tajikistan 3–7 pups, <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> 2–8 pups, and Bulgaria 4–7 pups; in India the average is four pups. The pups are born with closed eyes that open after 8–11 days, with the ears erecting after 10–13 days. Their teeth erupt at 11 days after birth, and the eruption of <a href="adult%20dentition">adult dentition</a> is completed after five months. Pups are born with soft fur that ranges in color from light gray to dark brown. At the age of one month, their fur is shed and replaced with a new reddish-colored pelt with black speckles. The pups have a fast growth rate and weigh at two days of age, at one month, and at four months. Females possess four pairs of teats, and <a href="lactation">lactation</a> lasts for up to 8–10 weeks. The pups begin to eat meat at the age of 15–20 days.

Dog pups show unrestrained fighting with their siblings from 2 weeks of age, with injury avoided only due to their undeveloped jaw muscles. This fighting gives way to play-chasing with the development of running skills at 4–5 weeks. Wolf pups possess more-developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age, when they first show signs of play-fighting with their siblings; serious fighting occurs during 4–6 weeks of age. Compared to wolf and dog pups, golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4–6 weeks, when play-fighting frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm. This aggression ceases by 10–12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed. Once the lactation period concludes, the female drives off the pups. Pups born late remain with their mother until early autumn, at which time they leave either singly or in groups of two to four individuals. Females reach sexual maturity after 10–11 months and males at 21–22 months.

The golden jackal often hunts alone, and sometimes in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping into the air and pouncing on them. In India, they can dig <a href="Indian%20gerbil">Indian gerbil</a>s out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4–5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding <a href="blackbuck">blackbuck</a> calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.

Pack-hunting of <a href="langurs">langurs</a> is recorded in India. Packs of between 5 and 18 jackals scavenging on the carcasses of large ungulates is recorded in India and Israel. Packs of 8–12 jackals consisting of more than one family have been observed in the summer periods in Transcaucasia. In India, the <a href="Montagu%27s%20harrier">Montagu's harrier</a> and the <a href="Pallid%20harrier">Pallid harrier</a> roost in their hundreds in grasslands during their winter migration. Jackals stalk close to these roosting harriers and then rush at them, attempting to catch one before the harriers can take off or gain sufficient height to escape.

In Southeastern Asia, golden jackals have been known to hunt alongside <a href="dhole">dhole</a> packs. They have been observed in the <a href="Blackbuck%20National%20Park%2C%20Velavadar">Blackbuck National Park, Velavadar</a>, India, following <a href="Indian%20wolves">Indian wolves</a> ("Canis lupus pallipes") when these are on a hunt, and they will scavenge off wolf kills without any hostility shown from these wolves. In India, lone jackals expelled from their pack have been known to form <a href="Commensalism">commensal relationships</a> with <a href="tiger">tiger</a>s. These solitary jackals, known as "kol-bahl", will associate themselves with a particular tiger, trailing it at a safe distance to feed on the big cat's kills. A "kol-bahl" will even alert a tiger to prey with a loud "pheal". Tigers have been known to tolerate these jackals, with one report describing how a jackal confidently walked in and out between three tigers walking together. Golden jackals and wild boar can occupy the same territory.

The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. Wolves dominate jackals, and jackals dominate foxes. In 2017 in Iran, an Indian wolf under study killed a golden jackal. In Europe, the range of wolves and jackals is mutually exclusive, with jackals abandoning their territory with the arrival of a wolf pack. One experiment used loudspeakers to broadcast the calls of jackals, and this attracted wolves at a trotting pace to chase away the perceived competitors. Dogs responded to these calls in the same way while barking aggressively. Unleashed dogs have been observed to immediately chase away jackals when the jackals were detected. In Europe, there are an estimated 12,000 wolves. The jackal's recent expansion throughout eastern and western Europe has been attributed to the extermination of the local wolf populations. The present diffusion of the jackal into the northern Adriatic hinterland is in areas where the wolf is absent or very rare. In the past, jackals competed with tigers and leopards, feeding on the remains of their kills and, in one case, on a dead tiger. Leopards once hunted jackals, but today the leopard is rare and the tiger is extinct in the jackal's range.

Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets. Red foxes fear jackals, which are three times bigger than red foxes. Red foxes will avoid close proximity to jackals and fox populations decrease where jackals are abundant. Foxes can be found only at the fringes of jackal territory. <a href="Striped%20hyena">Striped hyena</a>s prey on golden jackals, and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.

The golden jackal is listed as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> due to its widespread distribution, with it being common throughout its range and with high densities in those areas where food and shelter are abundant. In Europe, golden jackals are not listed under the 1973 "<a href="CITES">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a>" nor the 1979 <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Migratory%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Animals">Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals</a>. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various international legal instruments. These include the 1979 "<a href="Berne%20Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20European%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Habitats">Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats</a>", the "<a href="1992%20Convention%20on%20Biological%20Diversity">1992 Convention on Biological Diversity</a>", and the 1992 European Union "<a href="Habitats%20Directive">Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora</a>". The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when responding to the arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the golden jackal in Europe. The group also has an interest in the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone who has an interest in golden jackals.

In Europe, there are an estimated 70,000 golden jackals. They are fully protected in Albania, Germany, Italy, Macedonia, Poland, and Switzerland. They are unprotected in Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina , Czech Republic, Estonia, and Greece. They are hunted in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. Their protection in Austria and Turkey depends on the part of the country. Their status in Moldova is not known.

The Syrian jackal was common in Israel and Lebanon in the 1930s–40s, but their populations were reduced during an anti-<a href="rabies">rabies</a> campaign. Its current status is difficult to ascertain, due to possible <a href="Jackal-Dog%20Hybrid">hybridisation with pariah dogs</a> and <a href="African%20golden%20wolves">African golden wolves</a>. The jackal population for the Indian subcontinent is estimated to be over 80,000. In India, the golden jackal occurs in all of India's protected areas apart from those in the higher areas of the Himalayas. It is included in <a href="CITES">CITES</a> AppendixIII, and is listed in the <a href="Wildlife%20Protection%20Act%2C%201972">Wildlife Protection Act, 1972</a>, under ScheduleIII, thus receiving legal protection at the lowest level to help control the trade of pelts and tails in India.

Some golden jackals carry diseases and parasites harmful to human health. These include <a href="rabies">rabies</a>, and <a href="Leishmania%20donovani">Donovan's "Leishmania"</a> that is harmless to jackals but may cause <a href="leishmaniasis">leishmaniasis</a> in people. Jackals in southwestern Tajikistan can carry up to 16 species of parasitic <a href="cestode">cestode</a>s (flatworm), <a href="roundworm">roundworm</a>s, and <a href="acanthocephala">acanthocephala</a>ns (thorny-headed worms), these are: "<a href="Sparganosis">Sparganum mansoni</a>", "<a href="Diphyllobothrium%20mansonoides">Diphyllobothrium mansonoides</a>", "<a href="Taenia%20hydatigena">Taenia hydatigena</a>", "<a href="Taenia%20pisiformis">T.pisiformis</a>", "T.ovis", "<a href="Hydatigera%20taeniaeformis">Hydatigera taeniaeformis</a>", "<a href="Dipylidium%20caninum">Dipylidium caninum</a>", "Mesocestoides lineatus", "<a href="Ancylostoma%20caninum">Ancylostoma caninum</a>", "<a href="Uncinaria%20stenocephala">Uncinaria stenocephala</a>", "<a href="Dioctophyma%20renale">Dioctophyma renale</a>", "<a href="Toxocara%20canis">Toxocara canis</a>", "<a href="Toxascaris%20leonina">Toxascaris leonina</a>", "<a href="Dracunculus%20medinensis">Dracunculus medinensis</a>", "Filariata" and "Macracanthorhynchus catulinum". Jackals infected with "<a href="Dracunculus%20medinensis">Dracunculus medinensis</a>" can infect bodies of water with their eggs, which cause <a href="dracunculiasis">dracunculiasis</a> in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading <a href="coenurosis">coenurosis</a> in sheep and cattle, and <a href="canine%20distemper">canine distemper</a> in dogs. In Tajikistan, jackals may carry up to 12 <a href="tick">tick</a> species (which include "<a href="Ixodes">Ixodes</a>", "<a href="Rhipicephalus">Rhipicephalus</a> turanicus", "R.leporis", "R.rossicus", "<a href="Rhipicephalus%20sanguineus">R. sanguineus</a>", "R.pumilio", "R.schulzei", "<a href="Hyalomma">Hyalomma</a> anatolicum", "H.scupense" and "H.asiaticum"), four <a href="flea">flea</a> species ("<a href="Pulex%20irritans">Pulex irritans</a>", "Xenopsylla nesokiae", "<a href="Dog%20flea">Ctenocephanlides canis</a>" and "<a href="Ctenocephalides%20felis">C.felis</a>"), and one species of <a href="louse">louse</a> ("Trichodectes canis").

In Iran, some golden jackals carry intestinal worms (<a href="helminths">helminths</a>) and "<a href="Echinococcus%20granulosus">Echinococcus granulosus</a>". In Israel, some jackals are infected with intestinal helminths and "<a href="Leishmania%20tropica">Leishmania tropica</a>". In Romania, a jackal was found to be carrying "<a href="Trichinella%20britovi">Trichinella britovi</a>". In northeastern Italy, the jackal is a carrier of the tick species "<a href="Ixodes%20ricinus">Ixodes ricinus</a>" and "<a href="Dermacentor%20reticulatus">Dermacentor reticulatus</a>", and the smallest human fluke "<a href="Metagonimus%20yokogawai">Metagonimus yokogawai</a>" that can be caught from ingesting infected raw fish. In Hungary, some jackals carry dog heartworm "<a href="Dirofilaria%20immitis">Dirofilaria immitis</a>", and some have provided the first record in Hungary of "<a href="Trichinella%20spiralis">Trichinella spiralis</a>" and the first record in Europe of "<a href="Echinococcus%20multilocularis">Echinococcus multilocularis</a>". The jackal is dispersing across Europe through rivers and valleys, bringing parasites into regions where these did not previously exist.

Golden jackals appear in <a href="Folklore%20of%20India">Indian folklore</a> and in two ancient texts, the "<a href="Jakata">Jakata</a>s" and the "<a href="Panchatantra">Panchatantra</a>", where they are portrayed as intelligent and wily creatures. The ancient Hindu text, the "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>", tells the story of a learned jackal who sets his friends the tiger, wolf, <a href="Indian%20grey%20mongoose">mongoose</a>, and mouse against each other so he can eat a gazelle without sharing it. The "Panchatantra" tells the fable of a jackal who cheats a wolf and a lion out of their shares of a camel. In <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> tales, the jackal is regarded as being cunning in a way similar to the fox in European tales. One popular Indian saying describes the jackal as "the sharpest among beasts, the crow among birds, and the barber among men". For a person embarking on an early morning journey, hearing a jackal howl was considered to be a sign of impending good fortune, as was seeing a jackal crossing a road from the left side.

In <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, the jackal is portrayed as the familiar of several deities with the most common being <a href="Chamunda">Chamunda</a>, the emaciated, devouring goddess of the cremation grounds. Another deity associated with jackals is <a href="Kali">Kali</a>, who inhabits the cremation ground and is surrounded by millions of jackals. According to the "<a href="Tantrasara">Tantrasara</a>" scripture, when offered animal flesh, Kali appears in the form of a jackal. The goddess <a href="Shivadooti">Shivaduti</a> is depicted with a jackal's head. The goddess <a href="Durga">Durga</a> was often linked to the jackal. Jackals are considered to be the <a href="vahana">vahana</a>s (vehicles) of various protective Hindu and Buddhist deities, particularly in Tibet. According to the <a href="flood%20myth">flood myth</a> of the Kamar people in <a href="Raipur%20district">Raipur district</a>, India, the god Mahadeo (<a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>) caused a deluge to dispose of a jackal who had offended him. In <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s <a href="Mowgli">Mowgli</a> stories collected in "<a href="The%20Jungle%20Book">The Jungle Book</a>", the character <a href="Tabaqui">Tabaqui</a> is a jackal despised by the Seeonee wolf pack due to his mock cordiality, his scavenging habits, and his subservience to <a href="Shere%20Khan">Shere Khan</a> the tiger.

In the Marwahi forest division of the <a href="Chhattisgarh">Chhattisgarh</a> state in eastern India, the jackal is of conservation value and there were no jackal attacks reported before 1997. During 1998–2005 there were 220 reported cases of jackal attacks on humans, although none were fatal. The majority of these attacks occurred in villages, followed by forests and crop fields. Jackals build their dens in the bouldery hillocks that surround flat areas, and these areas have been encroached by human agriculture and settlements. This encroachment has led to <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">habitat fragmentation</a> and the need for jackals to enter agricultural areas and villages in search for food, resulting in conflict with humans. People in this region habitually chase jackals from their villages, which leads to the jackals becoming aggressive. Female jackals with pups respond with an attack more often than lone males. In comparison, over twice as many attacks were carried out by <a href="Sloth%20bears">Sloth bears</a> over the same period. There are no known attacks on humans in Europe.

The golden jackal can be a harmful pest that attacks domestic animals such as <a href="domestic%20turkey">turkeys</a>, lambs, <a href="sheep">sheep</a>, <a href="goat">goat</a>s, <a href="domestic%20water%20buffalo">domestic water buffalo</a> calves, and valuable game species like newborn <a href="roe%20deer">roe deer</a>, <a href="hare">hare</a>s, <a href="coypu">coypu</a>, <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>s, <a href="francolin">francolin</a>s, <a href="grey%20partridge">grey partridge</a>s, <a href="bustard">bustard</a>s and <a href="waterfowl">waterfowl</a>. It destroys grape, coffee, maize, sugarcane, and eats <a href="watermelon">watermelon</a>s, <a href="muskmelon">muskmelon</a>s, and <a href="Nut%20%28fruit%29">nuts</a>. In Greece, golden jackals are not as damaging to livestock as wolves and red foxes but they can become a serious nuisance to small stock when in great numbers. In southern Bulgaria, over 1,000 attacks on sheep and lambs were recorded between 1982 and 1987, along with some damage to newborn deer in game farms. The damage by jackals in Bulgaria was minimal when compared to the livestock losses due to wolves. Approximately 1.5–1.9% of calves born in the <a href="Golan%20Heights">Golan Heights</a> die due to predation, mainly by jackals. The high predation rate by jackals in both Bulgaria and Israel is attributable to the lack of preventative measures in those countries and the availability of food in illegal garbage dumps, leading to jackal population explosions.

Golden jackals are extremely harmful to fur-bearing rodents, such as coypu and <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s. Coypu can be completely extirpated in shallow water bodies. During 1948–1949 in the <a href="Amu%20Darya">Amu Darya</a>, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal fecal contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.

During British rule in <a href="British%20India">India</a>, sportsmen conducted golden jackal hunting on horseback with hounds, with <a href="jackal%20coursing">jackal coursing</a> a substitute for the <a href="fox%20hunting">fox hunting</a> of their native England. They were not considered as beautiful as English red foxes, but were esteemed for their endurance in the chase with one pursuit lasting hours. India's weather and terrain added further challenges to jackal hunters that were not present in England: the hounds of India were rarely in as good condition as English hounds, and although the golden jackal has a strong odor, the terrain of northern India was not good in retaining scent. Also, unlike foxes, jackals sometimes <a href="thanatosis">feigned death</a> when caught and could be ferociously protective of their captured packmates.

Jackals were hunted in three ways: with <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>s, with <a href="foxhound">foxhound</a>s, and with mixed packs. Hunting jackals with greyhounds offered poor sport because greyhounds were too fast for jackals, and mixed packs were too difficult to control. From 1946 in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, British diplomats and Iraqi riders conducted jackal coursing together. They distinguished three types of jackal: the "city scavenger", which was described as being slow and so smelly that dogs did not like to follow them; the "village jack", which was described as being faster, more alert, and less odorous; and the "open-country jack", which was described as being the fastest, cleanest, and providing the best sport of all three populations.

Some indigenous people of India, such as the <a href="Koli%20people">Kolis</a> and Vaghirs of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> and <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> and the <a href="Narikurava">Narikurava</a>s in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, hunt and eat golden jackals, but the majority of South Asian cultures consider the animal to be unclean. The orthodox "<a href="dharma">dharma</a>" texts forbid the eating of jackals because they have five nails. In the area of the <a href="former%20Soviet%20Union">former Soviet Union</a>, jackals are not actively hunted and are usually captured only incidentally during the hunting of other animals by means of traps or shooting during drives. In Transcaucasia, jackals are captured with large fishing hooks baited with meat and suspended from the ground with wire. The jackals can only reach the meat by jumping, and are then hooked by the lip or jaw.

In Russia and the other nations of the former Soviet Union, golden jackals are considered furbearers of low quality because of their sparse, coarse, and monotonously colored fur. Jackal hairs have very little fur fiber; therefore, their pelts have a flat appearance. The jackals of Asia and the Middle East produce the coarsest pelts, though this can be remedied during the <a href="Fur%20clothing%23Processing%20of%20fur">dressing</a> process. <a href="Elburz">Elburz</a> in northern Iran produces the softest furs. Jackal skins are not graded to a fur standard, and are made into collars, women's coats, and fur coats. During the 1880s, 200 jackals were captured annually in Mervsk and in the Zakatal area of the Transcaucasus, with 300 jackals being captured there during 1896. In this same period, a total of 10,000 jackals were taken within Russia and their furs sent exclusively to the <a href="Nizhegorod">Nizhegorod</a> fair. In the early 1930s there were 20,000–25,000 jackal skins tanned annually in the Soviet Union, but these could not be utilized within the country, and so the majority were exported to the United States. Commencing from 1949, they were all used within the Soviet Union.

The golden jackal may have once been tamed in Neolithic <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> 11,000 years ago, as there is a sculpture of a man cradling a jackal found in <a href="G%C3%B6bekli%20Tepe">Göbekli Tepe</a>. French explorers during the 19thcentury noted that people in the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> kept golden jackals in their homes. The <a href="Kalmyk%20people">Kalmyk people</a> near the Caspian Sea were known to frequently cross their dogs with jackals, and Balkan shepherds once crossed their sheepdogs with jackals.

The Russian military established the Red Star kennels in 1924 to improve the performance of working dogs and to conduct military dog research. The Red Star kennel developed "Laikoid" dogs, which were a cross-breed of <a href="Spitz">Spitz</a>-type Russian <a href="Laika%20%28dog%20breed%29">Laikas</a> with <a href="German%20Shepherds">German Shepherds</a>. By the 1980s, the ability of Russia's bomb and narcotic detection dogs were assessed as being inadequate. Klim Sulimov, a research scientist with the DS Likhachev Scientific Research Institute for Cultural Heritage and Environmental Protection, began cross-breeding dogs with their wild relatives in an attempt to improve their scent-detection abilities. The researchers assumed that during domestication dogs had lost some of their scent-detection ability because they no longer had to detect prey. Sulimov crossed European jackals with Laikas, and also with <a href="fox%20terriers">fox terriers</a> to add trainability and loyalty to the mix. He used the jackal because he believed that it was the wild ancestor of the dog, that it had superior scent-detecting ability, and, because it was smaller with more endurance than the dog, it could be housed outdoors in the Russian climate. Sulimov favored a mix of one quarter jackal and three-quarters dog. Sulimov's program continues today with the use of the hybrid <a href="Sulimov%20dog">Sulimov dog</a>s at the <a href="Sheremetyevo%20Airport">Sheremetyevo Airport</a> near <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> by the Russian airline <a href="Aeroflot">Aeroflot</a>.

The hybrid program has been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues pointing out that in other tests the Laika performed just as well as the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs need to be able to scent-detect and identify the many humans that they come into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.

The word 'jackal' appeared in the <a href="English%20language">English language</a> around 1600. It derives from the Turkish word "çakal", which originates from the Persian word "šagāl". It is also known as the common jackal, the Asiatic jackal, and Eurasian golden jackal.

Prince William, Duke of Gloucester

Prince William, Duke of Gloucester (24 July 1689 – 30 July 1700) was the son of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Princess Anne</a>, later Queen of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> from 1702, and her husband, <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Denmark">Prince George of Denmark</a>. He was their only child to survive infancy. Styled <a href="Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Duke of Gloucester</a>, he was viewed by contemporaries as a Protestant champion because his birth seemed to cement the Protestant succession established in the "<a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>" that had deposed his Catholic grandfather <a href="James%20II">James II</a> the previous year.

Gloucester's mother was estranged from her brother-in-law and cousin, <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>, and her sister, <a href="Mary%20II">Mary II</a>, but supported links between them and her son. He grew close to his uncle William, who created him a <a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Garter">Knight of the Garter</a>, and his aunt Mary, who frequently sent him presents. At his nursery in Campden House, <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a>, he befriended his Welsh body-servant, Jenkin Lewis, whose memoir of the Duke is an important source for historians, and operated his own miniature army, called the "Horse Guards", which eventually comprised 90 boys.

Gloucester's precarious health was a constant source of worry to his mother. His death, in 1700 at the age of 11, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights 1689</a>. The <a href="English%20Parliament">English Parliament</a> did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, and so passed the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which settled the throne of England on <a href="Electress%20Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Electress Sophia of Hanover</a>, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.

In late 1688, in what became known as the "<a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>", the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">King James</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> was deposed by his <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> nephew and son-in-law, Dutch <a href="stadtholder">stadtholder</a> <a href="William%20III%20of%20Orange">William III of Orange</a>. William and his wife, James's elder daughter <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a>, were recognised by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">English</a> and <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Scottish</a> parliaments as king and queen. As they had no children, Mary's younger sister, <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Anne</a>, was designated their <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a> in England and Scotland. The accession of William and Mary and the succession through Anne were enshrined in the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights 1689</a>.

Anne was married to <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Denmark">Prince George of Denmark</a>, and in their six years of marriage Anne had been pregnant six times, but none of her children had survived. Her seventh pregnancy resulted in the birth of a son at 5 a.m. on 24 July 1689 in <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court Palace</a>. As it was usual for the births of potential heirs to the throne to be attended by several witnesses, the King and Queen and "most of the persons of quality about the court" were present. Three days later, the newborn baby was baptised William Henry after his uncle King William by <a href="Henry%20Compton%20%28bishop%29">Henry Compton</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. The King, who was one of the godparents along with the <a href="George%20Savile%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Halifax%23Family">Marchioness of Halifax</a> and the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>, <a href="Charles%20Sackville%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Dorset">Lord Dorset</a>, declared him <a href="Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Duke of Gloucester</a>, although the peerage was never formally created. Gloucester was second in line to the throne after his mother, and because his birth secured the Protestant succession, he was the hope of the revolution's supporters. The ode "The Noise of Foreign Wars", attributed to <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>, was written in celebration of the birth. Other congratulatory odes, such as Purcell's last royal ode "Who Can From Joy Refrain?" and <a href="John%20Blow">John Blow</a>'s "The Duke of Gloucester's March" and "A Song upon the Duke of Gloucester", were composed for his birthdays in later years. Opponents of the revolution, supporters of James known as the <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobites</a>, spoke of Gloucester as "a sickly and doomed usurper".

Though described as a "brave livlylike boy", Gloucester became ill with <a href="convulsions">convulsions</a> when he was three weeks old, so his mother moved him into Craven House, Kensington, hoping that the air from the surrounding gravel pits would have a beneficial effect on his health. His convulsions were possibly symptomatic of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>, likely contracted at birth and which resulted in <a href="hydrocephalus">hydrocephalus</a>. As was usual among royalty, Gloucester was placed in the care of a governess, <a href="Barbara%20Berkeley%2C%20Viscountess%20Fitzhardinge">Lady Fitzhardinge</a>, and was suckled by a <a href="wet%20nurse">wet nurse</a>, <a href="Mrs.%20Pack">Mrs. Pack</a>, rather than his mother. As part of his treatment, Gloucester was driven outside every day in a small open carriage, pulled by <a href="Shetland%20pony">Shetland ponies</a>, to maximise his exposure to the air of the gravel pits. When the effectiveness of this treatment exceeded their expectations, Princess Anne and her husband acquired a permanent residence in the area, Campden House, a <a href="Jacobean%20architecture">Jacobean</a> mansion, in 1690. It was here that Gloucester befriended Welsh body-servant Jenkin Lewis, whose memoir of his master is an important source for historians.

Throughout his life, Gloucester suffered from a recurrent "ague", which was treated with regular doses of <a href="Jesuit%27s%20bark">Jesuit's bark</a> (an early form of <a href="quinine">quinine</a>) by his physician, <a href="John%20Radcliffe%20%28physician%29">John Radcliffe</a>. Gloucester disliked the treatment intensely, and usually vomited after being given it. Possibly as a result of hydrocephalus, he had an enlarged head, which his surgeons pierced intermittently to draw off fluid. He could not walk properly, and was apt to stumble. Nearing the age of five, Gloucester refused to climb stairs without two attendants to hold him, which Lewis blamed on indulgent nurses who over-protected the boy. His father <a href="Birching">birched</a> him until he agreed to walk by himself. <a href="Corporal%20punishment">Corporal punishment</a> was usual at the time, and such treatment would not have been considered harsh.

Gloucester's <a href="language%20acquisition">language acquisition</a> was delayed: he did not speak correctly until the age of three, and consequently the commencement of his education was postponed by a year. The Reverend Samuel Pratt, a <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> graduate, was appointed the Duke's tutor in 1693. Lessons concentrated on geography, mathematics, Latin, and French. Pratt was an enemy of Jenkin Lewis, and they frequently disagreed over how Gloucester should be educated. Lewis remained Gloucester's favourite attendant because, unlike Pratt, he was knowledgeable in military matters and could therefore help him with his "Horse Guards", a miniature army consisting of local children. Over a couple of years from 1693, the size of the army grew from 22 to over 90 boys.

Princess Anne had fallen out with her sister and brother-in-law, William and Mary, and reluctantly agreed to the advice of her friend, the <a href="Sarah%20Churchill%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Marlborough">Countess of Marlborough</a>, that Gloucester should visit his aunt and uncle regularly to ensure their continued goodwill towards him. In an attempt to heal the rift, Anne invited the King and Queen to see Gloucester drill the "Horse Guards". After watching the boys' display at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a>, the King praised them, and made a return visit to Campden House the following day. Gloucester grew closer to his aunt and uncle: the Queen bought him presents from his favourite toy shop regularly. Her death in 1694 led to a superficial reconciliation between Anne and William, which occasioned a move to <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>, London. Gloucester having tired of him, Lewis only attended St James's every two months.

On his seventh birthday, Gloucester attended a ceremony at <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle</a>, to install him as a knight of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, an honour the King had given him six months before. Gloucester became ill during the celebratory banquet afterwards and left early, but after his recovery went <a href="deer%20hunting">deer hunting</a> in <a href="Windsor%20Great%20Park">Windsor Great Park</a>, where he was <a href="wiktionary%3Ablood%23Verb">blooded</a> by <a href="Samuel%20Masham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Masham">Samuel Masham</a>, his father's <a href="Page%20%28occupation%29">page</a>. Princess Anne wrote to the Countess of Marlborough, "My boy continues yet very well, and looks better, I think, than ever he did in his life; I mean more healthy, for though I love him very well, I can't brag of his beauty."
During the trial of <a href="Sir%20John%20Fenwick%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir John Fenwick</a>, who was implicated in <a href="Jacobite%20assassination%20plot%201696">a plot to assassinate King William</a>, Gloucester signed a letter to the King promising his loyalty. "I, your Majesty's most dutiful subject," the letter read, "had rather lose my life in your Majesty's cause than in any man's else, and I hope it will not be long ere you conquer France." Added to the letter was a declaration by the boys in Gloucester's army: "We, your Majesty's subjects, will stand by you while we have a drop of blood."

In 1697, Parliament granted King William £50,000 to establish a household for the Duke of Gloucester, though the King only permitted the release of £15,000, keeping the difference for himself. The establishment of Gloucester's own household in early 1698 revived the feud between Anne and William. William was determined to limit Anne's involvement in the household, and therefore appointed, against her wishes, the <a href="low%20church">low church</a> <a href="Gilbert%20Burnet">Gilbert Burnet</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, as Gloucester's <a href="preceptor">preceptor</a>. Anne was <a href="high%20church">high church</a>, and Burnet, knowing she was unhappy, attempted to decline the appointment, but the King insisted he accept it. Anne's anger was only placated by an assurance from King William that she could choose all the lower servants of the household. The <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Earl of Marlborough</a>, a friend of Anne's, was appointed Gloucester's governor, after the <a href="Charles%20Talbot%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Shrewsbury">Duke of Shrewsbury</a> declined the office on the grounds of ill health. Shortly before the King sailed for the Netherlands, he received Anne's choices from Marlborough but he refused to confirm them. His favourite, the <a href="Arnold%20van%20Keppel%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Albemarle">Earl of Albemarle</a>, eventually convinced him to agree to Anne's appointments, and the King's acceptance was sent from the Netherlands in September 1698. The Marlboroughs' twelve-year-old son, <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%20Marquess%20of%20Blandford">Lord Churchill</a>, was appointed Gloucester's <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Horse">Master of the Horse</a>, and became a friend and playmate. <a href="Abigail%20Masham%2C%20Baroness%20Masham">Abigail Hill</a>, a kinswoman of the Countess of Marlborough, was appointed his laundress, and Abigail's brother, <a href="John%20Hill%20%28courtier%29">Jack Hill</a>, was made one of Gloucester's <a href="Gentleman%20of%20the%20Bedchamber">gentlemen of the bedchamber</a>.
Burnet lectured Gloucester for hours at a time on subjects such as the feudal constitutions of Europe and law before the time of Christianity. Burnet also encouraged Gloucester to memorise facts and dates by heart. Government ministers inspected Gloucester's academic progress every four months, finding themselves "amazed" by his "wonderful memory and good judgement". His childhood troop was disbanded, and King William made him the honorary commander of a real regiment of Dutch footguards. In 1699, he attended the <a href="List%20of%20trials%20of%20peers%20in%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">trials in the House of Lords</a> of <a href="Charles%20Mohun%2C%204th%20Baron%20Mohun">Lord Mohun</a> and <a href="Edward%20Rich%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Lord Warwick</a>, who were accused of murder. Mohun was acquitted; Warwick was found guilty of manslaughter but escaped punishment by pleading <a href="privilege%20of%20peerage">privilege of peerage</a>.

As he neared his eleventh birthday, Gloucester was assigned the rooms in Kensington Palace that had been used by his aunt, Queen Mary, who died in 1694. At his birthday party at Windsor, on 24 July 1700, he complained of a sudden fatigue, but was initially thought to have overheated himself while dancing. By nightfall, he was suffering from a sore throat and chills, followed by a severe headache and a high fever the next day. A physician, Hannes, did not arrive until 27 July. Gloucester was immediately <a href="Bloodletting">bled</a>, but his condition continued to deteriorate. Over the next day, he developed a rash and suffered a bout of diarrhoea. A second physician, Gibbons, arrived early on 28 July, followed by Radcliffe that evening.

The physicians could not agree on a diagnosis. Radcliffe thought he had <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a>, while others thought it was <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. They administered "cordial powders and cordial juleps". Gloucester was bled, to which Radcliffe strongly objected. He told his colleagues, "you have destroyed him and you may finish him". He prescribed blistering, which was no more effective. In great pain, Gloucester passed the evening of 28 July "in great sighings and dejections of spirits ... towards morning, he complained very much of his blisters." Anne, who had spent an entire day and night by her son's bedside, now became so distressed that she fainted. However, by midday on 29 July, Gloucester was breathing more easily and his headache had diminished, leading to hopes that he would recover. The improvement was fleeting, and that evening, he was "taken with a convulsing sort of breathing, a defect in swallowing and a total deprivation of all sense". Prince William died close to 1 a.m. on 30 July 1700, with his parents beside him. In the end, the physicians decided the cause of death was "a malignant fever". An autopsy revealed severe swelling of the <a href="lymph%20nodes">lymph nodes</a> in the neck and an abnormal amount of fluid in the <a href="Ventricular%20system">ventricles</a> of his brain: "four and a half ounces of a limpid humour were taken out." A modern diagnosis is that Gloucester died of acute <a href="Streptococcal%20pharyngitis">bacterial pharyngitis</a>, with associated <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Had he lived, though, it is almost certain the prince would have succumbed to complications of his hydrocephalus.

King William, who was in the Netherlands, wrote to Marlborough, "It is so great a loss to me as well as to all England, that it pierces my heart." Anne was prostrate with grief, taking to her chamber. In the evenings, she was carried into the garden "to divert her melancholy thoughts". Gloucester's body was moved from Windsor to Westminster on the night of 1 August, and he lay in state in the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> before being entombed in the Royal Vault of the <a href="Henry%20VII%20Chapel">Henry VII Chapel</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on 9 August. As was usual for royalty in mourning, his parents did not attend the funeral service, instead remaining in seclusion at Windsor.

In an allusion to Prince William's death, <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> politician <a href="William%20Shippen%20%28MP%29">William Shippen</a> wrote:

Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as his mother was the only person remaining in the Protestant line to the throne established by the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights 1689</a>. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in a child who survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, so it passed the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, <a href="Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Sophia, Electress of Hanover</a>, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George</a> ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">House of Hanover</a>.

William was styled as: His Royal Highness Prince William, Duke of Gloucester. The title became extinct on his death.


Gloucester bore the <a href="Royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal arms</a>, <a href="Cadency">differenced</a> by an <a href="inescutcheon">inescutcheon</a> of the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Denmark">Danish coat of arms</a> and a <a href="Label%20%28heraldry%29">label</a> of three points <a href="Argent">Argent</a>, the centre point bearing a cross <a href="Gules">Gules</a>.

Plateosaurus

Plateosaurus (probably meaning "broad <a href="lizard">lizard</a>", often mistranslated as "flat lizard") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="Plateosauridae">plateosaurid</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived during the Late <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a>, around 214 to 204 <a href="timeline%20of%20the%20evolutionary%20history%20of%20life">million years ago</a>, in what is now Central and Northern Europe and Greenland, North America. "Plateosaurus" is a <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (early) <a href="sauropodomorpha">sauropodomorph</a> dinosaur, a so-called <a href="prosauropoda">"prosauropod"</a>. As of 2011, two <a href="species">species</a> are recognised: the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "P. engelhardti" from the late <a href="Norian">Norian</a> and <a href="Rhaetian">Rhaetian</a>, and the slightly earlier "P. gracilis" from the lower Norian. However, others have been assigned in the past, and there is no broad consensus on the species <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of plateosaurid dinosaurs. Similarly, there are a plethora of <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a> (invalid duplicate names) at the genus level.

Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and described three years later by <a href="Christian%20Erich%20Hermann%20von%20Meyer">Hermann von Meyer</a>, "Plateosaurus" was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it was not one of the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>, Germany, has led to the nickname "Schwäbischer Lindwurm" (Swabian <a href="lindworm">lindworm</a>).

"Plateosaurus" was a <a href="bipedalism">bipedal</a> <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a> with a small skull on a long, flexible neck, sharp but plump plant-crushing teeth, powerful hind limbs, short but muscular arms and grasping hands with large claws on three fingers, possibly used for defence and feeding. Unusually for a dinosaur, "Plateosaurus" showed strong developmental plasticity: instead of having a fairly uniform adult size, fully grown individuals were between long and weighed between . Commonly, the animals lived for at least 12 to 20 years, but the maximum life span is not known.

Despite the great quantity and excellent quality of the fossil material, "Plateosaurus" was for a long time one of the most misunderstood dinosaurs. Some researchers proposed theories that were later shown to conflict with <a href="Geology">geological</a> and <a href="paleontology">palaeontological</a> evidence, but have become the paradigm of public opinion. Since 1980 the taxonomy (relationships), <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> (how the animals became embedded and fossilised), biomechanics (how their skeletons worked), and palaeobiology (life circumstances) of "Plateosaurus" have been re-studied in detail, altering the interpretation of the animal's biology, posture and behaviour.

"Plateosaurus" had the typical body shape of a herbivorous bipedal dinosaur: a small skull, a long and flexible neck composed of 10 <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical vertebrae</a>, a stocky body, and a long, mobile tail composed of at least 40 <a href="caudal%20vertebrae">caudal vertebrae</a>. The arms of "Plateosaurus" were very short, even compared to most other "prosauropods". However, they were strongly built, with hands adapted for powerful grasping. The <a href="shoulder%20girdle">shoulder girdle</a> was narrow (often misaligned in skeletal mounts and drawings), with the <a href="clavicle">clavicle</a>s (collar bones) touching at the body's midline, as in other basal sauropodomorphs. The hind limbs were held under the body, with slightly flexed knees and ankles, and the foot was <a href="digitigrade">digitigrade</a>, meaning the animal walked on its toes. The proportionally long lower leg and <a href="metatarsus">metatarsus</a> show that "Plateosaurus" could run quickly on its hind limbs. The tail of "Plateosaurus" was typically dinosaurian, muscular and with high mobility.
The skull of "Plateosaurus" is small and narrow, rectangular in side view, and nearly three times as long as it is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral <a href="temporal%20foramen">temporal foramen</a> at the back. The large, round <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye socket), the sub-triangular <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a> and the oval <a href="naris">naris</a> (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>, 24 to 30 per <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>, and 21 to 28 per <a href="mandible">dentary</a> (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that "Plateosaurus" could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved <a href="sclerotic%20ring">sclerotic ring</a>s (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).
The ribs were connected to the dorsal (trunk) vertebrae with two joints, acting together as a simple hinge joint, which has allowed researchers to reconstruct the inhaled and exhaled positions of the ribcage. The difference in volume between these two positions defines the air exchange volume (the amount of air moved with each breath), determined to be approximately 20 L for a "P. engelhardti" individual estimated to have weighed 690 kg, or 29 mL/kg bodyweight. This is a typical value for birds, but not for mammals, and indicates that "Plateosaurus" probably had an <a href="Bird%20lung">avian</a>-style flow-through lung, although indicators for <a href="Skeletal%20pneumaticity">postcranial pneumaticity</a> (air sacs of the lung invading the bones to reduce weight) can be found on the bones of only a few individuals, and were only recognised in 2010. Combined with evidence from bone <a href="histology">histology</a> this indicates that "Plateosaurus" was <a href="endotherm">endotherm</a>ic.

The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Plateosaurus" is "P. engelhardti". Adults of this species reached in length, and ranged in mass from . The geologically older species, "P. gracilis" (formerly named "Sellosaurus gracilis"), was somewhat smaller, with a total length of .

In 1834, physician Johann Friedrich Engelhardt discovered some vertebrae and leg bones at <a href="Heroldsberg">Heroldsberg</a> near <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, Germany. Three years later German <a href="Paleontology">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Christian%20Erich%20Hermann%20von%20Meyer">Hermann von Meyer</a> designated them as the <a href="holotype">type specimen</a> of a new genus, "Plateosaurus". Since then, remains of well over 100 individuals of "Plateosaurus" have been discovered at various locations throughout Europe.

Material assigned to "Plateosaurus" has been found at over 50 localities in Germany (mainly along the <a href="Neckar">Neckar</a> and <a href="Pegnitz%20%28river%29">Pegnitz</a> river valleys), Switzerland (<a href="Frick%2C%20Aargau">Frick</a>) and France. Three localities are of special importance, because they yielded specimens in large numbers and of unusually good quality: near <a href="Halberstadt">Halberstadt</a> in <a href="Saxony-Anhalt">Saxony-Anhalt</a>, Germany; <a href="Trossingen">Trossingen</a> in <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>, Germany; and Frick. Between the 1910s and 1930s, excavations in a <a href="clay%20pit">clay pit</a> in Saxony-Anhalt revealed between 39 and 50 skeletons that belonged to "Plateosaurus", along with teeth and a small number of bones of the <a href="theropod">theropod</a> "<a href="Liliensternus">Liliensternus</a>", and two skeletons and some fragments of the turtle "<a href="Proganochelys">Proganochelys</a>". Some of the plateosaur material was assigned to "P. longiceps", a species described by palaeontologist <a href="Otto%20Jaekel">Otto Jaekel</a> in 1914 but now considered a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">junior synonym</a> of "P. engelhardti". Most of the material found its way to the <a href="Museum%20f%C3%BCr%20Naturkunde">Museum für Naturkunde</a> in Berlin, where much of it was destroyed during World War II. The Halberstadt quarry today is covered by a housing development.
The second major German locality with "P. engelhardti" finds, a quarry in Trossingen in the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>, was worked repeatedly in the 20th century. Between 1911 and 1932, excavations during six field seasons led by German palaeontologists Eberhard Fraas (1911–1912), <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Huene">Friedrich von Huene</a> (1921–23), and finally Reinhold Seemann (1932) revealed a total of 35 complete or partially complete skeletons of "Plateosaurus", as well as fragmentary remains of approximately 70 more individuals. The large number of specimens from <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a> had already caused German palaeontologist Friedrich August von Quenstedt to nickname the animal "Schwäbischer Lindwurm" (Swabian <a href="lindworm">lindworm</a> or Swabian <a href="dragon">dragon</a>). Much of the Trossingen material was destroyed in 1944, when the Naturaliensammlung in Stuttgart (predecessor to the <a href="State%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20Stuttgart">State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart</a> (SMNS)) burnt to the ground after an Allied bombing raid. Luckily, however, a 2011 study by SMNS curator Rainer Schoch found that, at least from the finds of Seemann's 1932 excavation, "the scientifically most valuable material is still available".

The "Plateosaurus" skeletons in a clay pit of the Tonwerke Keller AG in Frick, Switzerland, were first noticed in 1976. While the bones are often significantly deformed by <a href="taphonomy">taphonomic</a> processes, Frick yields skeletons of "P. engelhardti" comparable in completeness and position to those of Trossingen and Halberstadt.

In 1997, workers of an <a href="oil%20platform">oil platform</a> of the <a href="Snorre%20oil%20field">Snorre oil field</a>, located at the northern end of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, were drilling through <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> for oil exploration when they stumbled on a fossil they believed to be plant material. The drill core containing the fossil was extracted from below the seafloor. Martin Sander and Nicole Klein, palaeontologists of the <a href="University%20of%20Bonn">University of Bonn</a>, analysed the bone microstructure and concluded that the rock preserved fibrous bone tissue from a fragment of a limb bone belonging to "Plateosaurus", making it the first dinosaur found in Norway. "Plateosaurus" material has also been found in the <a href="Fleming%20Fjord%20Formation">Fleming Fjord Formation</a> of East Greenland.
"Plateosaurus gracilis", the older species, is found in the <a href="L%C3%B6wenstein%20Formation">Löwenstein Formation</a> (Lower Norian). "P. engelhardti" stems from the upper Löwenstein Formation (Upper Norian), the <a href="Trossingen%20Formation">Trossingen Formation</a> (Upper Norian), and equivalently aged rock units. "Plateosaurus" thus lived probably from approximately 214 to 204 million years ago.

"Plateosaurus" is a member of a group of early <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s known as "<a href="Plateosauridae">prosauropods</a>". The group name is obsolete, as "Prosauropoda" is not a <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic</a> group (thus given in quotation marks), and most researchers prefer the term "basal <a href="Sauropodomorpha">sauropodomorph</a>". "Plateosaurus" was the first "prosauropod" to be described, and gives its name to the family <a href="Plateosauridae">Plateosauridae</a> Marsh, 1895 as the <a href="type%20genus">type genus</a>. Initially, when the genus was poorly known, it was only included in <a href="Sauria">Sauria</a>, being some kind of reptile, but not in any more narrowly defined taxon. In 1845, von Meyer created the group <a href="Dinosaur">Pachypodes</a> (a defunct junior <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of Dinosauria) to include "Plateosaurus", "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>", "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Hylaeosaurus">Hylaeosaurus</a>". Plateosauridae was proposed by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> in 1895 within <a href="Theropoda">Theropoda</a>. Later it was moved to "<a href="Plateosauridae">Prosauropoda</a>" by von Huene, a placement that was accepted by most authors. Before the advent of <a href="cladistics">cladistics</a> in paleontology during the 1980s, with its emphasis on <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> groups (<a href="clade">clade</a>s), Plateosauridae was defined loosely, as large, broad-footed, broad-handed forms with relatively heavy skulls, unlike the smaller "<a href="Anchisaurus">anchisaurids</a>" and sauropod-like "<a href="melanorosauridae">melanorosaurids</a>". Reevaluation of "prosauropods" in light of the new methods of analysis led to the reduction of Plateosauridae. For many years the clade only included "Plateosaurus" and various junior synonyms, but later two more genera were considered to belong to it: "Sellosaurus" and possibly "<a href="Unaysaurus">Unaysaurus</a>". Of these, "Sellosaurus" is probably another junior synonym of "Plateosaurus".

The type series of "Plateosaurus engelhardti" included "roughly 45 bone fragments", of which nearly half are lost. The remaining material is kept in the Institute for Palaeontology of the <a href="University%20of%20Erlangen-Nuremberg">University of Erlangen-Nuremberg</a>, Germany. From these bones, German palaeontologist Markus Moser in 2003 selected a partial <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> (series of fused hip vertebrae) as a <a href="syntype">lectotype</a>. The type locality is not known for certain, but Moser attempted to infer it from previous publications and the colour and preservation of the bones. He concluded that the material probably stems from the "Buchenbühl", roughly south of Heroldsberg.

The type specimen of "Plateosaurus gracilis", an incomplete <a href="postcranium">postcranium</a>, is kept at the <a href="State%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20Stuttgart">Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Stuttgart</a>, Germany, and the type locality is Heslach, a suburb of the same city.

The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the name "Plateosaurus" is not entirely clear. Moser pointed out that the original description contains no information, and various authors have offered differing interpretations. German geologist <a href="Hanns%20Bruno%20Geinitz">Hanns Bruno Geinitz</a> in 1846 gave "(<a href="wikt%3A%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%85%CF%82">πλατυς</a>, breit)" [English: broad] In the same year, Agassiz offered <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "<a href="wikt%3A%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7">πλατη</a>" ("platê" – "paddle", "rudder"; Agassiz translates this as <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "pala" = "spade") and "<a href="wikt%3A%CF%83%CE%B1%CF%85%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82">σαυρος</a>" ("sauros" – "lizard"). Agassiz consequently renamed the genus "Platysaurus", probably from Greek "πλατυς" ("platys" – "broad, flat, broad-shouldered"), creating an invalid junior synonym. Later authors often referred to this derivation, and the secondary meaning "flat" of "πλατυς", so that "Plateosaurus" is often translated as "flat lizard". Often, claims were made that "πλατυς" is supposed to have been intended as a reference to flat bones, for example the laterally flattened teeth of "Plateosaurus", but the teeth and other flat bones such as the pubic bones and some skull elements were unknown at the time of description.

In 1855, von Meyer published a detailed description of "Plateosaurus" with illustrations, but again gave no details on the etymology. He repeatedly referred to its gigantic size ("Riesensaurus" = giant lizard) and massive limbs ("schwerfüssig"), comparing "Plateosaurus" to large modern land mammals, but did not describe any important features that fit the terms "flat" or "shaped like an oar."

In addition to his formal scientific descriptions, von Meyer also gave a public lecture about fossil reptiles in 1851 that included a short mention of "Plateosaurus". That talk and a later one on fossil mammals were turned into a general audience book published in 1852, entitled "Über die Reptilien und Säugethiere der verschiedenen Zeiten der Erde" ["On the Reptiles and Mammals from the Different Time Periods of the Earth"]. In the German text (page 44), von Meyer briefly described "Plateosaurus" and mentioned that it had "breite, starke Gliedmaassenknochen," which translates as "broad, strong limb bones." Because his original description of "Plateosaurus" in 1837 stressed the similarity of its large limb bones to those of "Megalosaurus" and "Iguanodon", a meaning "broad lizard" for the name "Plateosaurus" to refer in particular to its robust limb bones would seem plausible.

The taxonomic history of "Plateosaurus" is "long and confusing", a "chaotic tangle of names". As of 2011, only two species are universally accepted as valid: the type species "P. engelhardti" and "P. gracilis", previously assigned to its own genus "Sellosaurus". British palaeontologist <a href="Peter%20Galton">Peter Galton</a> showed clearly that all cranial material from Trossingen, Halberstadt and Frick pertains to one species. Moser performed the most extensive and detailed investigation of all plateosaurid material from Germany and Switzerland, concluding that all "Plateosaurus" and most other prosauropod material from the <a href="Keuper">Keuper</a> stems from the same species as the type material of "Plateosaurus engelhardti". Moser considered "Sellosaurus" to be the same genus as "Plateosaurus", but did not discuss whether "S. gracilis" and "P. engelhardti" belong to the same species. Palaeontologist Adam Yates of the <a href="University%20of%20the%20Witwatersrand">University of the Witwatersrand</a> cast further doubt on the generic separation. He included the type material of "Sellosaurus gracilis" in "Plateosaurus" as "P. gracilis" and reintroduced the old name "<a href="Efraasia">Efraasia</a>" for some material that had been assigned to "Sellosaurus". In 1926, von Huene had already concluded the two genera were the same.

Yates has cautioned that "P. gracilis" may be a metataxon, which means that there is neither evidence that the material assigned to it is monophyletic (belongs to one species), nor that it is <a href="Paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> (belongs to several species). This is the case because the holotype of "P. (Sellosaurus) gracilis" has no skull, and the other specimens consist of skulls and material that overlaps too little with the holotype to make it certain that it belongs to the same taxon. It is therefore possible that the known material contains more species belonging to "Plateosaurus".

Some scientists regard other species as valid as well, for example "P. erlenbergensis". Such works, however, ignore Moser (2003), the publication that shows the type series of "P. engelhardti" to be diagnostic, and other material to be referable to it.

All named species of "Plateosaurus" except the type species and "P. gracilis" have turned out to be junior synonyms of the type species or invalid names. Von Huene practically erected a new species and sometimes a new genus for each relatively complete find from Trossingen (three species of "Pachysaurus" and seven of "Plateosaurus") and Halberstadt (one species of "Gresslyosaurus" and eight of "Plateosaurus"). Later, he merged several of these species, but remained convinced that more than one genus and more than one species of "Plateosaurus" was present in both localities. Jaekel also believed that the Halberstadt material included several plateosaurid dinosaurs, as well as non-plateosaurid prosauropods. Systematic research by Galton drastically reduced the number of genera and species. Galton synonymised all cranial material, and described differences between the <a href="syntype">syntype</a>s of "P. engelhardti" and the Trossingen material, which he referred to "P. longiceps". Galton recognised "P. trossingensis" ("P. fraasianus" and "P. integer" are junior objective synonyms) to be identical to "P. longiceps". Markus Moser, however, showed that "P. longiceps" is itself a junior synonym of "P. engelhardti". Furthermore, a variety of species in other genera were created for material belonging to "P. engelhardti", including "Dimodosaurus poligniensis", "Gresslyosaurus robustus", "Gresslyosaurus torgeri", "Pachysaurus ajax", "Pachysaurus giganteus", "Pachysaurus magnus" and "Pachysaurus wetzelianus".

The skull of AMNH FARB 6810, the best-preserved skull of "Plateosaurus" that has been taken apart during preparation and is thus available as separate bones, was described anew in 2011. The authors of that publication, palaeontologists Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark A. Norell, refer the skull to "P. erlenbergensis", a species erected in 1905 by Friedrich von Huene and regarded as a synonym of "P. engelhardti" by Markus Moser. If the "P. erlenbergensis" holotype is diagnostic (i.e., has enough characters to be distinct from other material), it is the correct name for the material assigned to "P. longiceps" Jaekel, 1913.

Aside from fossils clearly belonging to "Plateosaurus", there is much prosauropod material from the German <a href="Trossingen%20Formation">Knollenmergel</a> in museum collections, most of it labeled as "Plateosaurus", that does not belong to the type species and possibly not to "Plateosaurus" at all. Some of this material is not diagnostic; other material has been recognised to be different, but was never sufficiently described.

The <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> (burial and fossilisation process) of the three main "Plateosaurus" sites—Trossingen, Halberstadt and Frick—is unusual in several ways. All three sites are nearly monospecific assemblages, meaning that they contain practically only one species, which requires very special circumstances. However, shed teeth of <a href="theropoda">theropods</a> have been found at all three sites, as well as remains of the early turtle "Proganochelys". Additionally, a partial "prosauropod" skeleton was found in Halberstadt that does not belong to "Plateosaurus", but is preserved in a similar position. All sites yielded almost complete and partial skeletons of "Plateosaurus", as well as isolated bones. The partial skeletons tend to include the hind limbs and hips, while parts of the anterior body and neck are rarely found in isolation. The animals were all adults or subadults (nearly adult individuals); no juveniles or hatchlings are known. Complete skeletons and large skeleton parts that include the hind limbs all rest dorsal (top) side up, as do the turtles. Also, they are mostly well-articulated, and the hind limbs are three-dimensionally preserved in a zigzag posture, with the feet often much deeper in the sediment than the hips.

In the first published discussion of the Trossingen "Plateosaurus" finds, Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed the preservation of the single complete skeleton then known. Similarly, Jaekel interpreted the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps, became mired and drowned. He interpreted partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water, and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation. In contrast, von Huene interpreted the sediment as <a href="Aeolian%20processes">aeolian deposits</a>, with the weakest animals, mostly subadults, succumbing to the harsh conditions in the desert and sinking into the mud of <a href="Ephemerality">ephemeral water holes</a>. He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not happen, and saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and trampling. Seemann developed a different scenario, in which "Plateosaurus" herds congregated on large water holes, and some herd members got pushed in. Light animals managed to get free, while heavy individuals got stuck and died.

A different school of thought developed almost half a century later, with palaeontologist <a href="David%20B.%20Weishampel">David Weishampel</a> suggesting that the skeletons from the lower layers stemmed from a herd that died catastrophically in a mudflow, while those in the upper layers accumulated over time. Weishampel explained the curious monospecific assemblage by theorising that "Plateosaurus" were common during this period. This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs in the collection of the Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, <a href="University%20of%20T%C3%BCbingen">University of Tübingen</a>, and has since become the standard explanation on most internet sites and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or starvation, and being concentrated by mudflows.

A detailed re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the <a href="University%20of%20Bonn">University of Bonn</a>, Germany, found that the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a>, is the only one explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of "Plateosaurus" and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging <a href="theropoda">theropods</a> were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.

Practically every imaginable posture has been suggested for "Plateosaurus" in the scientific literature at some point. Von Huene assumed <a href="digitigrade">digitigrade</a> <a href="bipedalism">bipedality</a> with erect hind limbs for the animals he excavated at Trossingen, with the backbone held at a steep angle (at least during rapid locomotion). In contrast, Jaekel, the main investigator of the Halberstadt material, initially concluded that the animals walked <a href="quadrupedalism">quadrupedally</a>, like lizards, with a sprawling limb position, <a href="plantigrade">plantigrade</a> feet, and <a href="Undulatory%20locomotion">laterally undulating</a> the body. Only a year later, Jaekel instead favoured a clumsy, <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>-like hopping, a change of heart for which he was mocked by German <a href="zoology">zoologist</a> Gustav Tornier, who interpreted the shape of the articulation surfaces in the hip and shoulder as typically reptilian. Fraas, the first excavator of the Trossingen <a href="lagerst%C3%A4tte">lagerstätte</a>, also favoured a reptilian posture. Müller-Stoll listed a number of characters required for an erect limb posture that "Plateosaurus" supposedly lacked, concluding that the lizard-like reconstructions were correct. However, most of these adaptations are actually present in "Plateosaurus".

From 1980 on, a better understanding of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of "Plateosaurus", led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that "Plateosaurus" could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and <a href="Peter%20Wellnhofer">Wellnhofer</a> insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.

The bipedal-quadrupedal consensus was changed by a detailed study of the forelimbs of "Plateosaurus" by <a href="Matthew%20Bonnan">Bonnan</a> and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that "Plateosaurus" was incapable of <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20motion">pronating</a> its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> and <a href="ulna">ulna</a> in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that "Plateosaurus" was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly twice as long as the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, and the fact that the <a href="centre%20of%20mass">centre of mass</a> rests squarely over the hind limbs.

"Plateosaurus" shows a number of <a href="cursorial">cursorial</a> adaptations, including an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated <a href="Metatarsal%20bones">metatarsus</a> and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian cursors, the <a href="Torque">moment arms</a> of the limb <a href="Extension%20%28kinesiology%29">extending</a> muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the <a href="calcaneus">calcaneum</a> is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, "Plateosaurus" probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, "Plateosaurus" must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb retraction. Reliance on <a href="Limb%20%28anatomy%29">limb</a> <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20motion">retraction</a> instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.

Important cranial characteristics (such as jaw articulation) of most "prosauropods" are closer to those of herbivorous reptiles than those of carnivorous ones, and the shape of the tooth <a href="Crown%20%28tooth%29">crown</a> is similar to that of modern herbivorous or omnivorous <a href="iguana">iguana</a>s. The maximum width of the crown was greater than that of the root for the teeth of most "prosauropods", including "Plateosaurus"; this results in a cutting edge similar to those of extant herbivorous or omnivorous reptiles. Paul Barrett proposed that prosauropods supplemented their mostly herbivorous diets with small prey or <a href="carrion">carrion</a>, thus making them omnivores.

So far, no fossil of "Plateosaurus" has been found with <a href="gastrolith">gastrolith</a>s (<a href="gizzard">gizzard</a> stones) in the stomach area. The old, widely cited idea that all large dinosaurs, implicitly also "Plateosaurus", swallowed gastroliths to digest food because of their relatively limited ability to deal with food orally has been refuted by a study on gastrolith abundance, weight, and surface structure in fossils compared to alligators and ostriches by Oliver Wings. The use of gastroliths for digestion seems to have developed on the line from basal theropods to birds, with a parallel development in "<a href="Psittacosaurus">Psittacosaurus</a>".

Similar to all non-avian dinosaurs studied to date, "Plateosaurus" grew in a pattern that is unlike that of both <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> mammals and birds. In the closely related sauropods with their typical <a href="physiology%20of%20dinosaurs">dinosaurian physiology</a>, growth was initially rapid, continuing somewhat more slowly well beyond sexual maturity, but was determinate, i.e. the animals stopped growing at a maximum size. Mammals grow rapidly, but sexual maturity falls typically at the end of the rapid growth phase. In both groups, the final size is relatively constant, with humans atypically variable. Extant reptiles show a sauropod-like growth pattern, initially rapid, then slowing after sexual maturity, and almost, but not fully, stopping in old age. However, their initial growth rate is much lower than in mammals, birds and dinosaurs. The reptilian growth rate is also very variable, so that individuals of the same age may have very different sizes, and final size also varies significantly. In extant animals, this growth pattern is linked to <a href="behavioural%20thermoregulation">behavioural thermoregulation</a> and a low <a href="metabolism">metabolic</a> rate (i.e. <a href="ectotherm">ectotherm</a>y), and is called "developmental plasticity". (Note that is not the same as neural <a href="developmental%20plasticity">developmental plasticity</a>).
"Plateosaurus" followed a trajectory similar to sauropods, but with a varied growth rate and final size as seen in extant reptiles, probably in response to environmental factors such as food availability. Some individuals were fully grown at only 4.8 metres' (16 ft) total length, while others reached . However, the bone microstructure indicates rapid growth, as in sauropods and extant mammals, which suggests <a href="warm-blooded">endothermy</a>. "Plateosaurus" apparently represents an early stage in the development of endothermy, in which endothermy was decoupled from developmental plasticity. This hypothesis is based on a detailed study of "Plateosaurus" long-bone histology conducted by Martin Sander and Nicole Klein of the University of Bonn. A further indication for endothermy is the avian-style lung of "Plateosaurus".

Long-bone histology also allows estimating the age a specific individual reached. Sander and Klein found that some individuals were fully grown at 12 years of age, others were still slowly growing at 20 years, and one individual was still growing rapidly at 18 years. The oldest individual found was 27 years and still growing; most individuals were between 12 and 20 years old. However, some may well have lived much longer, because the fossils from Frick and Trossingen are all animals that died in accidents, and not from old age. Due to the absence of individuals smaller than long, it is not possible to deduce a complete <a href="ontogeny">ontogenetic</a> series for "Plateosaurus" or determine the growth rate of animals less than 10 years of age.

Californication (album)

Californication is the seventh <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>. It was released on June 8, 1999, on <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> and was produced by <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>. "Californication" marked the return of <a href="John%20Frusciante">John Frusciante</a>, who had previously appeared on "<a href="Mother%27s%20Milk">Mother's Milk</a>" and "<a href="Blood%20Sugar%20Sex%20Magik">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a>", to replace <a href="Dave%20Navarro">Dave Navarro</a> as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's return was credited with changing the band's sound altogether, producing a notable shift in style from the music recorded with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, but also contained more varied themes than previous outings, including death, contemplations of suicide, <a href="California">California</a>, drugs, globalization, and travel.

"Californication" is the Chili Peppers' most commercially successful studio release internationally, with over 15 million copies sold worldwide, and more than 6 million in the United States alone. As of 2002, the album had sold over 4 million copies in Europe. The record produced several hits for the band, including "<a href="Otherside">Otherside</a>", "<a href="Californication%20%28song%29">Californication</a>" and the <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>-winning "<a href="Scar%20Tissue">Scar Tissue</a>". "Californication" peaked at number three on the U.S. <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. 

The record marked a significant change in style for the band: "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s Greg Tate noted that "while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, "Californication" dares to be spiritual and epiphanic". Another critic, Billboard's Paul Verna, mentioned that the album brought out "the group's softer, melodic side," as opposed to their previous six albums.

In 1984, the Red Hot Chili Peppers started off as a "funk-punk band, driven by Kiedis's exuberant rapping and Flea's manic slap-bass" (Sanneh, 2002). Guitarist <a href="John%20Frusciante">John Frusciante</a>, who had joined in 1988 at the age of 18, left the band in the middle of a 1992 tour that promoted their critically acclaimed album "<a href="Blood%20Sugar%20Sex%20Magik">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a>". It took over a year for the band to find a new guitarist with whom to record officially. <a href="Dave%20Navarro">Dave Navarro</a>, formerly of <a href="Jane%27s%20Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a>, was invited to join the Chili Peppers after <a href="Arik%20Marshall">Arik Marshall</a>, who had finished the remaining tour dates for "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", was fired. Navarro influenced the band's ensuing album, "<a href="One%20Hot%20Minute">One Hot Minute</a>", by incorporating various elements of <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> and <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a>, which was something for which the Chili Peppers had not previously been notable. Compared to "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", "One Hot Minute" was a commercial disappointment, selling only half of what "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" had originally sold. Navarro and the band parted ways in early 1998, clearing the way for Fruciante's eventual return.

In the years following his departure from the Chili Peppers, Frusciante had developed a vicious addiction to both heroin and cocaine that left him in poverty and near death. Friends convinced him to enter drug rehabilitation in January 1998. In April 1998, following Frusciante's three-month completion, bassist <a href="Flea%20%28musician%29">Flea</a> visited his former bandmate and openly invited him to re-join the band, an invitation Frusciante readily accepted. Within the week, reunited for the first time in six years, the foursome gathered to play and jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Through a number of lineup changes, the Red Hot Chili Peppers had released multiple compilation or greatest hits albums prior to Frusciante's return; Frusciante pushed for the group to change their "funk-punk" sound and become more of a "mellow-progressive rock act" for "Californication".

Much of the album was written in the band members' homes in the summer of 1998. Kiedis and Frusciante often spent days together discussing song creation, guitar riffs and lyrical content. Bass and percussion aspects of the record were constructed through jam sessions and the individual work of Flea and drummer <a href="Chad%20Smith">Chad Smith</a>.

Most of the material and lyrics throughout the songs in the album came from the "personal and professional turmoil" that different members of the band went through/were currently going through at the time. This resulted in the "sensitive approach that one might not expect from a band whose followers are skate-punks and fraternity boys". Anthony Kiedis's main point behind this album was to "tell tales of wandering souls who've lost their way searching for the American dream in California".

"Californication's" lyrics were derived from Anthony Kiedis' ideas, outlooks, and perceptions of life and its meaning. "Porcelain" resulted from Kiedis's meeting with a young mother at the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>, who was attempting to battle her alcohol addiction while living with her infant daughter. Kiedis also had a love interest in Yohanna Logan, a fashion designer whom Kiedis met while she was working in New York City. Kiedis involvement with Logan influenced his multiple examinations of love throughout "Californication", in songs such as "Porcelain" and "This Velvet Glove." Sarcasm was a concept that Kiedis had dealt with in the past, and he ultimately crafted a song around it. He was inspired by former bandmate <a href="Dave%20Navarro">Dave Navarro</a>, whom he considered to be the "King of Sarcasm". Frusciante approached the guitar line present in "Scar Tissue" as an attempt to use two notes that are played far apart, but produce a "cool rhythm". He had explored this technique on his first solo album, 1994's "<a href="Niandra%20Lades%20and%20Usually%20Just%20a%20T-Shirt">Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt</a>". Frusciante considers "Scar Tissue" to be a "very simple example of the technique, but I think it's a style that sounds like me". The guitarist made use of <a href="slide%20guitar">slide guitar</a>-playing for the solos in the song. The song "Emit Remmus", which is "summer time" spelled backwards, was inspired by Anthony's brief relationship with <a href="Melanie%20C">Melanie C</a> of the <a href="Spice%20Girls">Spice Girls</a>.

"Get on Top", a song which contains significant use of a <a href="wah-wah%20pedal">wah pedal</a>, was formed after a jam session conducted shortly after Frusciante had listened to <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28band%29">Public Enemy</a>: "I came up with [the rhythm to the song] on the way to rehearsal—just tapping it out with my foot." The understated guitar solo played in the middle of the song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought process after listening to <a href="Steve%20Howe%20%28guitarist%29">Steve Howe</a>'s guitar solo on <a href="Yes%20%28band%29">Yes</a>' "<a href="Siberian%20Khatru">Siberian Khatru</a>": "the band sounded really big—and they're playing really fast—and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on its own sort of shelf. For 'Get On Top' I wanted to play something that contrasted between the solo and the background." "Savior", a song found towards the end of the album, features heavy <a href="effects%20pedal">effects</a>, most notably an <a href="Electro-Harmonix">Electro-Harmonix</a> Micro Synth with 16-second <a href="Delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a>. Frusciante notes that the sound is "directly inspired by <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>'s playing in <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a>. If you listen to the actual notes, they're like a Clapton solo—they just don't sound like it because of the effects."

The hit "Around the World", which harkens back to the Chili Peppers' funk-influenced sound, was constructed by Frusciante at his home. The rhythm and beat, however, are intricate; this required him to play the song with the rest of the band rather than alone for them to understand it. The bass <a href="Lick%20%28music%29">lick</a> was composed in "maybe 15 minutes," according to Frusciante: "Flea is the best bass player in the world. His sense of timing and the way he thinks is so crazy." The title track of the album was among the most difficult for the band to complete. Frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar ensemble that would appropriately complement the poignant lyrical content, but encountered difficulty. The song was barely making progress, and would have been scrapped had it not been for Kiedis' urgency to include it on the album. Frusciante completed the final riff two days before recording, after drawing inspiration from <a href="The%20Cure">The Cure</a>'s soundtrack song to "<a href="Carnage%20Visors">Carnage Visors</a>". The title track was intended to represent Californian lifestyles and, more specifically, the "fake" nature which is associated with much of <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. It references <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> of <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a> and uses considerable imagery to capture the evocative nature of California.

The record was a change of style for the Chili Peppers, especially compared to their previous album, "<a href="One%20Hot%20Minute">One Hot Minute</a>", which combined various elements of <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> and <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a>. Although "Californication" still contains some <a href="funk%20rock">funk rock</a> songs (such as "Around the World", "Get on Top", "I Like Dirt", "Purple Stain" and "Right on Time"), it leaned towards more melodic riffs (for example, "<a href="Scar%20Tissue">Scar Tissue</a>" and "<a href="Otherside">Otherside</a>") and focused on songs with implemented structure rather than <a href="jam%20session">jams</a>.

The album featured a few outtakes that didn't appear on the studio album. "Gong Li" and "Instrumental #1" were released on the "<a href="Scar%20Tissue">Scar Tissue</a>" single. The instrumental "Teatro Jam" was released on the "<a href="Around%20the%20World%20%28Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20song%29">Around the World</a>" single while "How Strong" was featured on the "<a href="Otherside">Otherside</a>" single. "Instrumental #2" was released on a bonus disc for the album. In 2006, iTunes exclusively released "Fat Dance," "Over Funk" and "Quixoticelixer" along with the album for download. "Slowly, Deeply" an instrumental track, would later be released as a b-side to the "<a href="Universally%20Speaking">Universally Speaking</a>" single in 2003, while "Bunker Hill" would be re-worked on during the band's "Greatest Hits" sessions in 2003 and released on the "<a href="Fortune%20Faded">Fortune Faded</a>" single that same year.

In August and September 2014, unreleased demos from 1998 were leaked to the internet. Many of the demos were of songs that made the final album or released as b-sides; however, some were different from the final album version with the most notable differences being a reggae influenced version of the title track with different lyrics and a very different vocal melody, a version "Scar Tissue" with a longer intro, a slower version of "Purple Stain" with added lyrics and different chorus, "Porcelain Alice", the original version of "Porcelain" with different lyrics, an instrumental version of 'Quixoticelixer' (with the working title "New Wave Song"), "How Strong Is Your Love", the original version of "How Strong" and the original demos for "Fat Dance" and "Bunker Hill" (originally titled "These Are Not My Dreams of Bunker Hill"). The leaked demos also included never before heard songs such as "Plate of Brown", "Tellin' a Lie", "Mommason", "Andaman & Nicobar", "Boatman", "Sugar Sugar" and "Trouble in the Pub". In February 2015, a collection of rough mixes of outtakes from the "Californication" sessions was leaked. This group of songs, which were recorded on April 21, 1999 at The Village Studio, contains a version of "Trouble in the Pub" with vocals along with "Blondie", a song Frusciante mentioned in an interview as an album outtake however the song turns out only to be a rough mix of "Instrumental #2". An unmastered mix of the album also exists that features alternate versions of some songs, such as extended endings ("Easily"), extra verses ("Savior"), alternate choruses ("Around the World") and different guitar mixes ("How Strong").

<a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> had produced their two previous albums. However, the Chili Peppers decided to look for other producers for "Californication". <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a> had shown great interest in working with the band and asked to produce the album; however, the Chili Peppers chose to remain with Rubin for "Californication". Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought necessary for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. Recording took place at Cello Studios in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a>. In early 1999, following the recording process, the band played "Scar Tissue", "Otherside", and "Californication" to their managers, and it was decided that "Scar Tissue" would be the lead single for the album. To support their reunited line-up, the band played various <a href="prom">prom</a>s across the country to promote "Californication". It sprouted a competition, which called upon high school students to write essays on "how they could make their schools better, safer, happier, more rocking places, so that they didn't have to go to school afraid. If you wrote the essay, you got a free ticket to the show."

"Californication" was released on June 8, 1999, debuting at #5 but peaking at #3 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart. In Europe, the album peaked at #5 on the UK Top 40, #1 on the Finnish, Austrian, Swedish and New Zealand charts, and #2 on the Top 40 of France and The Netherlands. It was <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified</a> gold just over a month later, on July 22, 1999, and its continuing sales have resulted in it being certified six-times platinum. In March 2006, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums were made available to purchase on the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Music Store</a>. Albums bought there included new previously unreleased tracks ("Fat Dance", "Over Funk", and "Quixoticelixer").

In the United States the album debuted and peaked at number three on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> the week of June 26, 1999 with 189,000 copies sold. The next week it dropped to number seven and it was present on the chart for one hundred one weeks. It was certified six times platinum by the <a href="RIAA">RIAA</a> on June 28, 2016 for shipments of six millions.

In the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">United Kingdom</a> it debuted and peaked at number five on June 16, 1999, the next week it fell off to number seven; the album remained on the chart for one hundred sixty nine weeks. It was certified four times platinum by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">BPI</a> on September 2, 2016 denoting shipments of one million two hundred thousand units.

In Germany, it was the band's best-selling album, staying on the <a href="Media%20Control%20Charts">Media Control Charts</a> for 114 weeks (more than 2 years) and selling more than 750,000 copies, reaching 3× Gold.

"Californication" received favorable reviews in contrast to its less popular predecessor, "<a href="One%20Hot%20Minute">One Hot Minute</a>", and it was a greater success worldwide. "Rolling Stone" credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: "[his] vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic sensibility." Songs such as "Otherside" and "Porcelain" were called "<a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">Pumpkins</a>-esque", while the album as a whole was "epiphanal" and the "RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk's real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick." Other critics credited the album's success to the return of Frusciante. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Greg Prato said that the "obvious reason for [the band's] rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante", considering him to be the "quintessential RHCP guitarist". The album as a whole was "a "bona fide" Chili Peppers classic". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" also credits Frusciante with transforming the band's sound into a "more relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than ever before". Mark Woodlief of <a href="Ray%20Gun%20%28magazine%29">"Ray Gun"</a> commented that "'This Velvet Glove' strikes an intricate balance between a lush acoustic guitar foundation and anthemic rock," Woodlief continued "the disco intro to 'Parallel Universe' gives way to a scorching Western giddy-up motif in the chorus, and Frusciante's Hendrix-like excursions at the song's close."

While many critics found the band's new sound refreshing, "<a href="NME">NME</a>" criticized the Chili Peppers for rarely using their trademark funk sound, asking: "Can we have our brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this false empathy is starting to make my removed rib tingle." "Pitchfork", while considering the album a triumph over "One Hot Minute", felt "Californication" lacked the funk that was ever-present in "Blood Sugar Sex Magik". It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be "the best big-time American rock guitarist going right now". Critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> gave the album a one-star honorable mention (), describing the band as "New Age fuck fiends" and citing "Scar Tissue" and "Purple Stain" as highlights.

Over the years, "Californication" has maintained its popularity. "Scar Tissue" won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Song">Grammy Award for Best Rock Song</a> in 2000. The album was ranked number 399 on "Rolling Stone" magazine's 2003 list of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>" and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for <a href="AOL%20Sessions">AOL Sessions</a> that included "Scar Tissue" and "Californication". The album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers; five of the sixteen songs on their "<a href="Greatest%20Hits%20%28Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20album%29">Greatest Hits</a>" album were taken from "Californication".
The album received criticism for what Tim Anderson of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" called "excessive compression and distortion" in the process of digital mastering. "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>" labeled it as one of the victims of the <a href="loudness%20war">loudness war</a> and commented that it suffered from digital clipping so much that "even non-audiophile consumers complained about it". An early, alternately mastered version of the album with a different track listing and mixing, probably a pre-release candidate, has been circulated on the internet.

The information regarding accolades attributed to "Californication" is adapted from AcclaimedMusic.net
Immediately following the release of "Californication", the band embarked on a <a href="Californication%20Tour">world tour</a> to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close <a href="Woodstock%20%2799">Woodstock '99</a>, which became infamous for the resulting violence. The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields had gone out of control. When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix's song "Fire" to finish their set as a favor to Hendrix's sister, the disruption escalated into violence when several women, who had been <a href="crowd%20surfing">crowd surfing</a> and <a href="moshing">moshing</a>, were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed. Kiedis felt that "It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock any more. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in ... We woke up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing 'Fire'."

To kick off the band's European tour, the band staged a free show in Moscow's <a href="Red%20Square">Red Square</a>, on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000. Kiedis recalled the situation: "Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians that we needed a police escort to get near the stage." Following the European leg, the group did a show in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, at the <a href="Windows%20on%20the%20World">Windows on the World</a>, for <a href="KROQ-FM">KROQ</a> radio contest-winners, and then at the <a href="Big%20Day%20Out">Big Day Out</a> festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates. Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the "Californication" tour. As one of the last shows before the release of their next album "<a href="By%20the%20Way">By the Way</a>", the Chili Peppers played <a href="Rock%20in%20Rio">Rock in Rio 3</a>.

Internationalist (album)

Internationalist is the third <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by Australian <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Powderfinger">Powderfinger</a>. The album was released on 7 September 1998 and was often labelled Powderfinger's most adventurous work, with greater <a href="experimentation">experimentation</a> than in previous works.

"Internationalist" followed in the success of its predecessor, "<a href="Double%20Allergic">Double Allergic</a>", and was certified <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">five times platinum</a> in Australia. "Internationalist" received four <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards">ARIA Music Awards</a>, including "Album of the Year". The album produced four singles for the band; "<a href="The%20Day%20You%20Come">The Day You Come</a>", "<a href="Don%27t%20Wanna%20Be%20Left%20Out">Don't Wanna Be Left Out</a>/<a href="Good-Day%20Ray">Good-Day Ray</a>", "<a href="Already%20Gone%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">Already Gone</a>" and "<a href="Passenger%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">Passenger</a>", which all appeared on <a href="Triple%20J">Triple J</a>'s <a href="Triple%20J%20Hottest%20100">Hottest 100</a> poll in two consecutive years.

"Internationalist" received fairly positive reviewers in the Australian press, and cemented Powderfinger's position on the local music scene; however, the album failed to launch the band in the overseas market.

Powderfinger spent much of early 1997 <a href="concert">touring</a>, after the success of "<a href="Double%20Allergic">Double Allergic</a>". Songwriter <a href="Bernard%20Fanning">Bernard Fanning</a> then spent much of 1997 writing songs for "Internationalist" in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, drawing on inspiration from a mid-1997 band trip to the United States.

The album's title refers to <a href="escapism">escapism</a>—namely, the ability that an "<a href="wikt%3Ainternationalist">internationalist</a>" has to escape from <a href="racism">racial</a> and <a href="sociology">social</a> tension. When asked in a "Juice" interview, <a href="Bernard%20Fanning">Bernard Fanning</a> summarised the title of the album by stating;
"Internationalist" was recorded at <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>'s Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by American <a href="record%20producer">producer</a> <a href="Nick%20DiDia">Nick DiDia</a> for the first time. As the band had already prepared "about 30 or 40" songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. <a href="Bassist">Bassist</a> <a href="John%20Collins%20%28Australian%20musician%29">John Collins</a> said of DiDia; "Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was that he wanted to record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didn't want to play around too much." As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> by DiDia soon after. Powderfinger used the extra time to play <a href="table%20tennis">table tennis</a>, which was the band's recreation of choice during the "Internationalist" and "<a href="Odyssey%20Number%20Five">Odyssey Number Five</a>" recording sessions.

Collins described the album as not being as easy listening as their previous work, and that it contained numerous experiments in songwriting that they had not put into previous albums. Fanning later said "Internationalist" was "a better record" than "<a href="Double%20Allergic">Double Allergic</a>", but acknowledged that it was not as easily likeable—it was just an improvement in songwriting. Collins and Fanning acknowledged that the album's experimental nature could lose them some old fans, but the pair drew parallels with bands such as <a href="U2">U2</a>, who Collins said had "constantly re-invented themselves, and with success". He said Powderfinger's reinvention was as much for the band's own interest as it was for the "public's perception". Meanwhile, <a href="guitarist">guitarist</a> <a href="Ian%20Haug">Ian Haug</a> described the album as a "moderation" between "<a href="Parables%20for%20Wooden%20Ears">Parables for Wooden Ears</a>" ("the complicated beast") and "Double Allergic" ("totally simplified"), Powderfinger's two previous albums. He also agreed that the album was much more experimental, and described the album as the band's "most successful", as well as stating that the album that best replicated "the sound we have live".

Numerous songs on "Internationalist" were <a href="politics">politically</a> and <a href="sociology">socially</a> influenced, although the band denied it being a deliberate <a href="Motif%20%28narrative%29">motif</a>. Fanning explaining that the band did not intentionally discuss political issues, saying "we don't try to do anything in particular". He noted, however, that the songs, as his emotional responses to recent events, could inevitably be interpreted as being political. When "<a href="The%20Day%20You%20Come">The Day You Come</a>" was released, there was speculation that it alluded to <a href="Pauline%20Hanson">Pauline Hanson</a>'s <a href="One%20Nation%20%28Australia%29">One Nation</a> <a href="political%20party">political party</a>, although the band claimed the song was vague and didn't specifically refer to one person. Fanning said of "The Day You Come";

The first single from the album was "The Day You Come", a politically and socially influenced song. The band did not intend for it to be the first single, and released it only when they could not decide on anything else. Haug said it being "a pretty inoffensive song musically" helped Powderfinger make that decision. "The Day You Come" spent nine weeks on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA Charts</a>, peaking at #25.

The second single was the double <a href="a-side">a-side</a>, "<a href="Don%27t%20Wanna%20Be%20Left%20Out/Good-Day%20Ray">Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray</a>", released on 9 November 1998. "Don't Wanna Be Left Out", a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, was one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date. 'Don't Wanna Be Left Out' could be comfortably ranked with other Powderfinger songs such as 'Lighten My Load' and 'Rise Up'. Drummer <a href="Jon%20Coghill">Jon Coghill</a> described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so "fast and offbeat". The music video for "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" was unpopular and drew criticism from band members. "Good-Day Ray" was dedicated to Australian television presenter <a href="Ray%20Martin%20%28television%20presenter%29">Ray Martin</a> and his public disagreements with former "<a href="Media%20Watch%20%28TV%20program%29">Media Watch</a>" host <a href="Stuart%20Littlemore">Stuart Littlemore</a>. Its lyrics verged on <a href="punk%20rock">punk</a>, though Coghill denied that Powderfinger were a punk band. He also described the <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for "Good-Day Ray" as being one of the better videos the band had made.

"Internationalist"'s third single was "<a href="Already%20Gone%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">Already Gone</a>", released on 12 February 1999. The song was a tribute to <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> and their influence on Powderfinger's music. The fourth and final single from the album was "<a href="Passenger%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">Passenger</a>", released on 9 August 1999. "Passenger" was influenced by <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, and included a <a href="horn%20%28music%29">big horn</a> section, as well as backing vocals from <a href="folk%20music">folk</a> group <a href="Tiddas%20%28band%29">Tiddas</a>. "Passenger" won the <a href="ARIA%20Awards">ARIA Award</a> for "Song Of The Year" in 1999. The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films. "Passenger" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30. It appeared at #48 on <a href="MAX%20%28Australian%20TV%20channel%29">Max</a>'s top 100 songs from the 1990s list.

Powderfinger went on a nationwide tour after the release of "Internationalist", performing with British band <a href="Swervedriver">Swervedriver</a> and fellow Brisbane band <a href="Not%20From%20There">Not From There</a> in capital cities across Australia. In 1999, the band also toured with <a href="Something%20for%20Kate">Something for Kate</a> and <a href="Alex%20Lloyd">Alex Lloyd</a>. Collins described the process of choosing who the band would play with as a simple matter of choosing whose music the band preferred, stating "we had played with most of the bands, and if you're going on tour with someone you may as well go with someone you get along with and whose music you enjoy." Despite being fans of Swervedriver, who were renowned for "their capability to reproduce their album sound perfectly in the live setting" according to "Beat" Magazine's Neala Johnson, Fanning said Powderfinger would never attempt to replicate them, because he believed their live shows to be much more "emotionally powerful" than recordings.

With "Internationalist", Powderfinger first set their sights overseas, appearing at numerous <a href="music%20festival">music festival</a>s in the U.S., including <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a> in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult due to the lack of any homegrown fan support. He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as he had hoped. Coghill, however, described the showcases, and the performances in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a>, as "worthwhile" and "fun". After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of Canada. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as "people [in Australia] are going to get sick of you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially."

"Internationalist" debuted at the top of the <a href="ARIA%20Albums%20Chart">ARIA Albums Chart</a>, and was <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">certified gold</a> in its first week, selling over 35,000 copies. It then went on to go platinum, and is currently certified platinum five times, for 350,000 copies. At the 1999 <a href="ARIA%20Awards">ARIA Awards</a>, the album received three awards—"Album of the Year", "Best Rock Album", and "Best Cover Art". "The Day You Come" also won "Single of the Year". In 2000, "Passenger" was nominated for three awards, but did not win any.

Haug said he was amazed with the highly positive critical response the album had received, surprised that "even Molly <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Molly%20Meldrum">Meldrum</a><nowiki>]</nowiki> gave it nine out of ten." The positivity of the album's reception created a feeling of surrealism, and Haug told "Juice" Magazine "I wish someone would write a really bad [review]." Nonetheless, he appreciated the credibility the album helped Powderfinger develop. Coghill agreed with Haug on the album's popularity, stating "you couldn't ask for much better", and saying he really took notice of the album's positive critical commentary. "Juice"s Benedict Watts said it received "a level of universal praise not yet dished out on an Australian release since <a href="You%20Am%20I">You Am I</a>'s "<a href="Hi%20Fi%20Way">Hi Fi Way</a>"". Despite <a href="Polydor">Polydor</a> telling the band the album would be heavily marketed, Fanning still found its success surprising. "HIT"s Teresa Bolster suggested Fanning feared the worst during songwriting; "Celebrity Head", a song on the album, was seen as a "pre-emptive, scathing attack on music writers", which he argued was intended as a joke.

"Internationalist"s critical reception was positive, following in its chart success. "<a href="The%20Courier-Mail">The Courier-Mail</a>"s Nicola Six called it the band's most diverse album yet, using "The Day You Come" as an example; its "opening <a href="staccato">staccato</a> guitar <a href="riff">riff</a> to the way the bass blends with Bernard Fanning's almost-<a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> in the final chorus" made it the "perfect first single". Watts said it "brilliantly pre-empts the mood and progressive nature of the album", and <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>'s Jonathan Lewis described it as the best track on the album. "<a href="The%20Weekend%20Australian">The Weekend Australian</a>"'s Iain Shedden said it was "one of the best Australian rock songs of the decade".

"The Day You Come" was not the only single to draw praise; "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" was described as "surf guitar-fuelled", "Good Day Ray" as "thrashy", and "HIT"'s Teresa Bolster wrote that the released of the two as an A-side displayed the album's true scope to the public. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> approved of the "rocking" "Don't Wanna Be Left Out", but said Powderfinger sacrificed their uniqueness on "Good Day Ray", which Lewis argued was heavily <a href="Foo%20Fighters">Foo Fighters</a> influenced. Lewis approved of the "melodic" "Already Gone", while "Juice"s Simon Wooldridge said it and "Passenger" demonstrated Powderfinger's "flair for the big hook".

"Beat"'s Neala Johnson compared the album's political motifs to the <a href="Manic%20Street%20Preachers">Manic Street Preachers</a>—"an earnest, sometimes cynical, social and personal conscience displayed in the lyrics". Noel Mangel of "The Courier-Mail" said it had "a lightness of touch and boisterous spirit", especially compared to the distorted guitars on debut album "<a href="Parables%20for%20Wooden%20Ears">Parables for Wooden Ears</a>". MS Queensland's Lauren McKay said the album ranked up there with the best of <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a> and <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a>. "<a href="Time%20Off">Time Off</a>"s Geoff Nicholson said "Internationalist" was "a blend of shimmering pop songs and thought-provoking probing".


The second release of pressings of the album were released in late November 1998 which included a bonus disc featuring a live recording of Powderfinger's performance at the <a href="Sydney%20Opera%20House">Sydney Opera House</a> 25th birthday celebration on October 11, 1998.



"Internationalist" and singles from it have been nominated to win <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards">ARIA Music Awards</a> from the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a> (ARIA) in two consecutive years.

In 1999, "The Day You Come" was nominated to win the "Song of the Year" <a href="APRA%20Awards%20%28Australia%29">APRA Award</a> from the <a href="Australasian%20Performing%20Right%20Association">Australasian Performing Right Association</a>, and "Passenger" won the same award the following year. The same year, the tracks "Already Gone", "Good-Day Ray" and "Passenger" all featured in <a href="Triple%20J">Triple J</a>'s <a href="Triple%20J%20Hottest%20100">Hottest 100</a> list, and "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" and "The Day You Come" featured in the list in 1998. Australian music magazine "Juice" selected "Internationalist" as #80 of their top 100 albums of the 1990s. In September 2018, Australian radio station <a href="Double%20J%20%28radio%29">Double J</a> selected "Internationalist" as the number one Australian album of the 90's
