Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke

Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), was a <a href="List%20of%20landmark%20court%20decisions%20in%20the%20United%20States">landmark decision</a> by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>. It upheld <a href="Affirmative%20action%20in%20the%20United%20States">affirmative action</a>, allowing race to be one of several factors in <a href="College%20admissions%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Race%20and%20ethnicity">college admission policy</a>. However, the court ruled that specific <a href="racial%20quota">racial quota</a>s, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis%20School%20of%20Medicine">University of California, Davis School of Medicine</a>, were impermissible.

Although the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools, and had even ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities remained unresolved. Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the <a href="Equal%20Protection%20Clause">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. An earlier case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, "<a href="DeFunis%20v.%20Odegaard">DeFunis v. Odegaard</a>" (1974), was dismissed on procedural grounds.

Allan P. Bakke (), an engineer and former <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> officer, sought admission to medical school, but was rejected for admission by several due in part to his age. Bakke was in his early 30s while applying, and therefore considered too old by at least two institutions. After twice being rejected by the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis">University of California, Davis</a>, he brought suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the school's affirmative action program. The <a href="California%20Supreme%20Court">California Supreme Court</a> struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered Bakke admitted. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case amid wide public attention.

The case fractured the court; the nine justices issued a total of six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice <a href="Lewis%20F.%20Powell%20Jr.">Lewis F. Powell Jr.</a>; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. Finding diversity in the classroom to be a <a href="compelling%20state%20interest">compelling state interest</a>, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>. Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. The practical effect of "Bakke" was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the "Bakke" case was merely a <a href="plurality%20opinion">plurality opinion</a> or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in "<a href="Grutter%20v.%20Bollinger">Grutter v. Bollinger</a>".

In "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>" (1954), the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> ruled segregation by race in public schools to be unconstitutional. In the following fifteen years, the court issued landmark rulings in cases involving race and civil liberties, but left supervision of the desegregation of Southern schools mostly to lower courts. Among other progressive legislation, Congress passed the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, Title VI of which forbids racial discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal funding. By 1968, integration of public schools was well advanced. In that year, the Supreme Court revisited the issue of school desegregation in "<a href="Green%20v.%20County%20School%20Board">Green v. County School Board</a>", ruling that it was not enough to eliminate racially discriminatory practices; state governments were under an obligation to actively work to desegregate schools. The school board in "Green" had allowed children to attend any school, but few chose to attend those dominated by another race. In 1970, in "<a href="Swann%20v.%20Charlotte-Mecklenburg%20Board%20of%20Education">Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</a>", the Supreme Court upheld an order for <a href="Desegregation%20busing">busing</a> of students to desegregate a school system.

Although public universities were integrated by court decree, selective colleges and graduate programs, and the professions which stemmed from them, remained almost all white. Many African-Americans had attended inferior schools and were ill-prepared to compete in the admissions process. This was unsatisfactory to many activists of the late 1960s, who protested that given the African-American's history of discrimination and poverty, some preference should be given to minorities. This became a commonly held liberal position, and large numbers of public and private universities began <a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a> programs. Among these were the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis%20School%20of%20Medicine">University of California, Davis School of Medicine</a> (UC Davis or "the university"), which was founded in 1968 and had an all-white inaugural class. The faculty was concerned by this, and the school began a special admissions program "to compensate victims of unjust societal discrimination". The application form contained a question asking if the student wished to be considered disadvantaged, and, if so, these candidates were screened by a special committee, on which more than half the members were from minority groups. Initially, the entering class was 50 students, and eight seats were put aside for minorities; when the class size doubled in 1971, there were 16 seats which were to be filled by candidates recommended by the special committee. While nominally open to whites, no one of that race was admitted under the program, which was unusual in that a specific number of seats were to be filled by candidates through this program.

The first case taken by the Supreme Court on the subject of the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education was "<a href="DeFunis%20v.%20Odegaard">DeFunis v. Odegaard</a>" (1974). Marco DeFunis, a white man, had twice been denied admission to the <a href="University%20of%20Washington%20School%20of%20Law">University of Washington School of Law</a>. The law school maintained an affirmative action program, and DeFunis had been given a higher rating by admissions office staff than some admitted minority candidates. The Washington state trial court ordered DeFunis admitted, and he attended law school while the case was pending. The <a href="Washington%20Supreme%20Court">Washington Supreme Court</a> reversed the trial court, but the order was stayed, and DeFunis remained in school. The U.S. Supreme Court granted review and the case was briefed and argued, but by then, DeFunis was within months of graduation. The law school stated in its briefs that even if it won, it would not dismiss him. After further briefing on the question of <a href="mootness">mootness</a>, the Supreme Court dismissed the case, 5-4, holding that as DeFunis had almost completed his studies, there was no longer a <a href="Case%20or%20Controversy%20Clause">case or controversy</a> to decide. Justice <a href="William%20J.%20Brennan%2C%20Jr.">William Brennan</a>, in an opinion joined by the other three members of the minority, accused the court of "sidestepping" the issues, which "must inevitably return to the federal courts and ultimately again to this court".

Allan Paul Bakke (born 1940), a 35-year-old white male, applied to twelve medical schools in 1973. He had been a <a href="National%20Merit%20Scholar">National Merit Scholar</a> at <a href="Coral%20Gables%20Senior%20High%20School">Coral Gables Senior High School</a>, in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. He was accepted as an undergraduate at the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>, deferring tuition costs by joining <a href="Naval%20ROTC">Naval ROTC</a>. He graduated from the University of Minnesota with a <a href="Grading%20%28education%29%23United%20States">grade-point average</a> (GPA) of 3.51. In order to fulfill his ROTC requirements, he joined the Marine Corps and served four years, including a seven-month tour of duty in Vietnam as a commanding officer of an <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> battery. In 1967, having achieved the rank of <a href="captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>, he was granted an <a href="honorable%20discharge">honorable discharge</a>. Bakke then worked as an engineer at <a href="NASA">NASA</a>. He stated that his interest in medicine started in Vietnam, and increased at NASA, as he had to consider the problems of space flight and the human body there. But twelve medical schools rejected his application for admission.

Bakke had applied first to the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> and <a href="Northwestern%20University">Northwestern University</a>, in 1972, and both rejected him, making a point of his age, with Northwestern writing that it was above their limit. Medical schools at the time openly practiced age discrimination.

Bakke applied late to UC Davis in 1973 because his mother-in-law was ill. This delay may well have cost him admission: although his credentials were outstanding even among applicants not part of the special program, by the time his candidacy was considered under the school's <a href="rolling%20admission">rolling admission</a>s process, there were few seats left. His application reflected his anxiety about his age, referring to his years of sacrifice for his country as a cause of his interest in medicine.

Bakke received 468 points out of a possible 500 on the admissions committee’s rating scale in 1973. Earlier in the year, a rating of 470 had won automatic admission with some promising applicants being admitted with lower scores. Bakke had a science GPA of 3.44 and an overall GPA of 3.46 after taking science courses at night to qualify for medical school. On the <a href="Medical%20College%20Admissions%20Test">Medical College Admissions Test</a> (MCAT), Bakke scored in the 97th percentile in scientific knowledge, the 96th percentile in verbal ability, the 94th percentile in quantitative analysis, and the 72nd percentile in general knowledge. Bakke's MCAT score overall was 72; the average applicant to UC Davis scored a 69 and the average applicant under the special program a 33. In March 1973, Bakke was invited to UC Davis for an interview. Dr. Theodore West, who met with him, described Bakke as “a well-qualified candidate for admission whose main hardship is the unavoidable fact that he is now 33. … On the grounds of motivation, academic records, potential promise, endorsement by persons capable of reasonable judgments, personal appearance and decorum, maturity, and probable contribution to balance in the class, I believe Mr. Bakke must be considered as a very desirable applicant and I shall so recommend him.” About two months later in May 1973, Bakke received notice of his rejection.

Bakke complained to Dr. George Lowrey, chairman of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program. At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. If he was not accepted the second time, "he could then research the legal question. He had been a good candidate. I thought he'd be accepted and that would end the matter." Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The general counsel for the University of California said, "I don't think Storandt meant to injure the university. It's simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters." Storandt stated, "I simply gave Allan the response you'd give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and I had the feeling by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn't know this would be the case." Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the "Bakke" case, Storandt was fired.

Allan Bakke applied to UC Davis medical school again in 1974. He was interviewed twice: once by a student interviewer, who recommended his admission, and once by Dr. Lowrey, who in his report stated that Bakke "had very definite opinions which were based more on his personal viewpoints than on a study of the whole problem … He was very unsympathetic to the concept of recruiting minority students." Lowrey gave Bakke a poor evaluation, the only part of his application on which he did not have a high score. He was rejected again, although minorities were admitted in both years with significantly lower academic scores through the special program. Not all minority applicants whose admission was recommended under the program gained entry—some were rejected by the admissions committee. This, however, did not affect the number of minority students to be admitted, sixteen. Although 272 <a href="white%20people">white people</a> between 1971 and 1974 had applied under this program, none had been successful; in 1974 the special admissions committee summarily rejected all white students who asked for admission under the program. Only one black student and six <a href="Latino">Latino</a>s were admitted under the regular admissions program in that time period, though significant numbers of <a href="Asian%20Americans">Asian</a> students were given entry.

According to a 1976 "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" article, the dean of the medical school sometimes intervened on behalf of daughters and sons of the university's "special friends" in order to improve their chances. Among those who benefitted by Dean C. John Tupper's interventions (about five per year) was the son of an influential state assemblyman, who had not even filed an application. The special picks were ended by order of University of California President <a href="David%20S.%20Saxon">David S. Saxon</a> in 1976. Bakke's lawyer deemed it impossible to tell if these picks caused Bakke not to be admitted, but according to an attorney who filed an "<a href="amicus%20curiae">amicus curiae</a>" brief on behalf of the <a href="National%20Urban%20League">National Urban League</a> in support of affirmative action, the practice of dean's picks made the university reluctant to go into detail about its admission practices at trial, affecting its case negatively.

On June 20, 1974, following his second rejection from UC Davis, Bakke brought suit against <a href="UC%20Regents">the university's governing board</a> in the <a href="Superior%20Court%20of%20California">Superior Court of California</a>, <a href="Yolo%20County">Yolo County</a>. He sought an order admitting him on the ground that the special admission programs for minorities violated the U.S. and California constitutions, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. UC Davis's counsel filed a request that the judge, F. Leslie Manker, find that the special program was constitutional and legal, and argued that Bakke would not have been admitted even if there had been no seats set aside for minorities. On November 20, 1974, Judge Manker found the program unconstitutional and in violation of Title VI, "no race or ethnic group should ever be granted privileges or immunities not given to every other race." Manker ordered the medical school to disregard race as a factor, and to reconsider Bakke's application under a race-free system. After Manker entered final judgment in the case on March 7, 1975, both parties appealed, the university on March 20 because the program was struck down, and Bakke on April 17 because he was not ordered admitted.

Because of the important issues presented, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20California">Supreme Court of California</a> on June 26, 1975 ordered the appeal transferred to it, bypassing the intermediate appeals court. On March 19, 1976, the case was argued before the state supreme court. Nine "amicus curiae" briefs were filed by various organizations, the majority in support of the university's position. The California Supreme Court was considered one of the most liberal appellate courts, and it was widely expected that it would find the program to be legal. Nevertheless, on September 16, 1976, the court, in an opinion by Justice <a href="Stanley%20Mosk">Stanley Mosk</a>, upheld the lower-court ruling, 6–1. Mosk wrote that "no applicant may be rejected because of his race, in favor of another who is less qualified, as measured by standards applied without regard to race". Justice <a href="Matthew%20O.%20Tobriner">Matthew O. Tobriner</a> dissented, stating that Mosk's suggestion that the state open more medical schools to accommodate both white and minority was unrealistic due to cost: "It is a cruel hoax to deny minorities participation in the medical profession on the basis of such fanciful speculation." The court barred the university from using race in the admissions process and ordered it to provide evidence that Bakke would not have been admitted under a race-neutral program. When the university conceded its inability to do so in a petition for rehearing, the court on October 28, 1976 amended its ruling to order Bakke's admission and denied the petition.

The university requested that the U.S. Supreme Court stay the order requiring Bakke's admission pending its filing a petition asking for review. U.S. Supreme Court Justice <a href="William%20Rehnquist">William Rehnquist</a>, as <a href="circuit%20justice">circuit justice</a> for the <a href="Ninth%20Circuit">Ninth Circuit</a> (which includes California) granted the stay for the court in November 1976.

The university filed a petition for writ of <a href="certiorari">certiorari</a> in December 1976. The papers of some of the justices who participated in the "Bakke" case reveal that the case was three times considered by the court in January and February 1977. Four votes were needed for the court to grant certiorari, and it had at least that number each time, but was twice put over for reconsideration at the request of one of the justices. A number of civil rights organizations filed a joint brief as "amicus curiae", urging the court to deny review, on the grounds that the "Bakke" trial had failed to fully develop the issues—the university had not introduced evidence of past discrimination, or of bias in the MCAT. Nevertheless, on February 22, the court granted certiorari, with the case to be argued in its October 1977 term.
The parties duly filed their briefs. The university's legal team was now headed by former <a href="Solicitor%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Solicitor General</a> and <a href="Watergate">Watergate</a> special prosecutor <a href="Archibald%20Cox">Archibald Cox</a>, who had argued many cases before the Supreme Court. Cox wrote much of the brief, and contended in it that "the outcome of this controversy will decide for future generations whether blacks, Chicanos and other insular minorities are to have meaningful access to higher education and real opportunities to enter the learned professions". The university also took the position that Bakke had been rejected because he was unqualified. Reynold Colvin, for Bakke, argued that his client's rights under the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to equal protection of the laws had been violated by the special admission program. Fifty-eight "amicus curiae" briefs were filed, establishing a record for the Supreme Court that would stand until broken in the 1989 abortion case "<a href="Webster%20v.%20Reproductive%20Health%20Services">Webster v. Reproductive Health Services</a>". Future justice <a href="Ruth%20Bader%20Ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> signed the <a href="ACLU">ACLU</a>'s brief; Marco deFunis, the petitioner in the 1974 case dismissed for mootness, wrote the brief for <a href="Young%20Americans%20for%20Freedom">Young Americans for Freedom</a>.

In addition to the various other "amici", the United States filed a brief through the Solicitor General, as it may without leave of court under the <a href="Procedures%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court's rules</a>. When consideration of "Bakke" began in the new <a href="Presidency%20of%20Jimmy%20Carter">administration of President Jimmy Carter</a>, early drafts of the brief both supported affirmative action and indicated that the program should be struck down and Bakke admitted. This stance reflected the mixed support of affirmative action at that time by the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a>. Minorities and others in that party complained, and in late July 1977, Carter announced that the government's brief would firmly support affirmative action. That document, filed October 3, 1977 (nine days before oral argument), stated that the government supported programs tailored to make up for past discrimination, but opposed rigid set-asides. The United States urged the court to remand the case to allow for further fact-finding (a position also taken by civil rights groups in their "amicus" briefs).

While the case was awaiting argument, another white student, Rita Clancy, sued for admission to UC Davis Medical School on the same grounds as Bakke had. In September 1977, she was ordered admitted pending the outcome of the "Bakke" case. After "Bakke" was decided, the university dropped efforts to oust her, stating that as she had successfully completed one year of medical school, she should remain.

Oral argument in "Bakke" took place on October 12, 1977. There was intense public interest in the case; prospective attendees began to line up the afternoon before. The court session took two hours, with Cox arguing for the university, Colvin for Bakke, and Solicitor General <a href="Wade%20H.%20McCree">Wade H. McCree</a> for the United States. Colvin was admonished by Justice <a href="Byron%20White">Byron White</a> for arguing the facts, rather than the Constitution. Cox provided one of the few moments of levity during the argument when Justice <a href="Harry%20A.%20Blackmun">Harry A. Blackmun</a> wondered whether the set-aside seats could be compared to athletic scholarships. Cox was willing to agree, but noted that he was a Harvard graduate, and as for sporting success, "I don't know whether it's our aim, but we don't do very well."

Beginning the day after the argument, the justices lobbied each other through written memorandum. At a conference held among justices on October 15, 1977, they decided to request further briefing from the parties on the applicability of Title VI. The supplemental brief for the university was filed on November 16, and argued that Title VI was a statutory version of the <a href="Equal%20Protection%20Clause">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the Fourteenth Amendment and did not allow private plaintiffs, such as Bakke, to pursue a claim under it. Bakke's brief arrived the following day. Colvin submitted that Bakke did have a private right of action, and that his client did not want the university to suffer the remedy prescribed under Title VI for discriminatory institutions—loss of federal funding—but wanted to be admitted. In November, Justice Blackmun left Washington to have prostate surgery at the <a href="Mayo%20Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a>.

Blackmun's absence did not stem the flow of memos, notably one on November 22 from Justice <a href="Lewis%20F.%20Powell%2C%20Jr.">Lewis Powell</a>, analyzing the minority admissions program under the <a href="strict%20scrutiny">strict scrutiny</a> standard often applied when government treats some citizens differently from others based on a <a href="suspect%20classification">suspect classification</a> such as race. Concluding that the program did not meet the standard, and must be struck down, Powell's memorandum stated that affirmative action was permissible under some circumstances, and eventually formed much of his released opinion.

At the justices' December 9 conference, with Blackmun still absent, they considered the case. Counting heads, four justices (Chief Justice <a href="Warren%20E.%20Burger">Warren E. Burger</a> and Justices <a href="Potter%20Stewart">Potter Stewart</a>, Rehnquist, and <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a>) favored affirming the California Supreme Court's decision. Three (Justices Brennan, White, and <a href="Thurgood%20Marshall">Thurgood Marshall</a>) wanted to uphold the program. Justice Blackmun had not yet weighed in. Powell stated his views, after which Brennan, hoping to cobble together a five-justice majority to support the program, or at least to support the general principle of affirmative action, suggested to Powell that applying Powell's standard meant that the lower court decision would be affirmed in part and reversed in part. Powell agreed.

Even when Blackmun returned in early 1978, he was slow to make his position on "Bakke" known. It was not until May 1 that he circulated a memorandum to his colleagues's chambers, indicating that he would join Brennan's bloc, in support of affirmative action and the university's program. This meant that Powell was essential to either side being part of a majority. Over the following eight weeks, Powell fine-tuned his opinion to secure the willingness of each group to join part of it. The other justices began work on opinions that would set forth their views.

The Supreme Court's decision in "Bakke" was announced on June 28, 1978. The justices penned six opinions; none of them, in full, had the support of a majority of the court. In a <a href="plurality%20opinion">plurality opinion</a>, Justice Powell delivered the judgment of the court. Four justices (Burger, Stewart, Rehnquist, and Stevens) joined with him to strike down the minority admissions program and admit Bakke. The other four justices (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun) dissented from that portion of the decision, but joined with Powell to find affirmative action permissible under some circumstances, though subject to an intermediate scrutiny standard of analysis. They also joined with Powell to reverse that portion of the judgment of the California Supreme Court that forbade the university to consider race in the admissions process.

Justice Powell, after setting forth the facts of the case, discussed and found it unnecessary to decide whether Bakke had a private right of action under Title VI, assuming that was so for purposes of the case. He then discussed the scope of Title VI, opining that it barred only those racial classifications forbidden by the Constitution.

Turning to the program itself, Powell determined that it was not simply a goal, as the university had contended, but a racial qualification—assuming that UC Davis could find sixteen minimally qualified minority students, there were only 84 seats in the freshman class open to white students, whereas minorities could compete for any spot in the 100-member class. He traced the history of the jurisprudence under the Equal Protection Clause, and concluded that it protected all, not merely African Americans or only minorities. Only if it served a <a href="compelling%20state%20interest">compelling interest</a> could the government treat members of different races differently.

Powell noted that the university, in its briefs, had cited decisions where there had been race-conscious remedies, such as in the school desegregation cases, but found them inapposite as there was no history of racial discrimination at the University of California-Davis Medical School to remedy. He cited precedent that when an individual was entirely foreclosed from opportunities or benefits provided by the government and enjoyed by those of a different background or race, this was a <a href="suspect%20classification">suspect classification</a>. Such discrimination was only justifiable when necessary to a compelling governmental interest. He rejected assertions by the university that government had a compelling interest in boosting the number of minority doctors, and deemed too nebulous the argument that the special admissions program would help bring doctors to underserved parts of California—after all, that purpose would also be served by admitting white applicants interested in practicing in minority communities. Nevertheless, Powell opined that government had a compelling interest in a racially diverse student body.

In a part of the opinion concurred in by Chief Justice Burger and his allies, Powell found that the program, with its set-aside of a specific number of seats for minorities, did discriminate against Bakke, as less restrictive programs, such as making race one of several factors in admission, would serve the same purpose. Powell offered the example (set out in an appendix) of the admissions program at Harvard University as one he believed would pass constitutional muster—that institution did not set rigid quotas for minorities, but actively recruited them and sought to include them as more than a token part of a racially and culturally diverse student body. Although a white student might still lose out to a minority with lesser academic qualifications, both white and minority students might gain from non-objective factors such as the ability to play sports or a musical instrument. Accordingly, there was no constitutional violation in using race as one of several factors.

Powell opined that because the university had admitted that it could not prove that Bakke would not have been admitted even had there been no special admissions program, the portion of the California Supreme Court's decision ordering Bakke's admission was proper, and was upheld. Nevertheless, the state was entitled to consider race as one of several factors, and the portion of the California court's judgment which had ordered the contrary was overruled.

Brennan delivered the joint statement of four justices: Marshall, White, Blackmun and himself. In verbally introducing their opinion in the Supreme Court courtroom, Brennan stated that the "central meaning" of the "Bakke" decision was that there was a majority of the court in favor of the continuation of affirmative action. In the joint opinion, those four justices wrote, "government may take race into account when it acts not to demean or insult any racial group, but to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice". They suggested that any admissions program with the intention of remedying past race discrimination would be constitutional, whether that involved adding bonus points for race, or setting aside a specific number of places for them.

White issued an opinion expressing his view that there was not a private right of action under Title VI. Thurgood Marshall also wrote separately, recounting at length the history of discrimination against African-Americans, and concluding, "I do not believe that anyone can truly look into America's past and still find that a remedy for the effects of that past is impermissible." Blackmun subscribed to the idea of <a href="Color%20Consciousness">color consciousness</a>, declaring that, "in order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently. We cannot—we dare not—let the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial superiority."

Justice Stevens, joined by Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist, concurring in part and dissenting in part in the judgment, found it unnecessary to determine whether a racial preference was ever allowed under the Constitution. A narrow finding that the university had discriminated against Bakke, violating Title VI, was sufficient, and the court was correct to admit him. "It is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an issue in this case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate." According to Stevens, "[t]he meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from a federally funded program". He concluded, "I concur in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the judgment of the Supreme Court of California. To the extent that it purports to do anything else, I respectfully dissent."

Newspapers stressed different aspects of "Bakke", often reflecting their political ideology. The conservative "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" bannered Bakke's admission in its headline, while noting that the court had permitted affirmative action under some circumstances. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", a liberal newspaper, began its headline in larger-than-normal type, "Affirmative Action Upheld" before going on to note that the court had admitted Bakke and curbed quotas. "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>", in a headline, deemed "Bakke" "The Decision Everybody Won". According to Oxford University Chair of Jurisprudence <a href="Ronald%20Dworkin">Ronald Dworkin</a>, the court's decision "was received by the press and much of the public with great relief, as an act of judicial statesmanship that gave to each party in the national debate what it seemed to want most".

Attorney General <a href="Griffin%20Bell">Griffin Bell</a>, after speaking with President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, stated, "my general view is that affirmative action has been enhanced", and that such programs in the federal government would continue as planned. <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> Chair <a href="Eleanor%20Holmes%20Norton">Eleanor Holmes Norton</a> told the media "that the "Bakke" case has not left me with any duty to instruct the EEOC staff to do anything different".

<a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a> Professor <a href="Laurence%20Tribe">Laurence Tribe</a> wrote in 1979, "the Court thus upheld the kind of affirmative action plan used by most American colleges and universities, and disallowed only the unusually mechanical—some would say unusually candid, others would say unusually impolitic—approach taken by the Medical School" of UC Davis. <a href="Robert%20M.%20O%27Neil">Robert M. O'Neil</a> wrote in the "<a href="California%20Law%20Review">California Law Review</a>" the same year that only rigid quotas were foreclosed to admissions officers and even "relatively subtle changes in the process by which applications were reviewed, or in the resulting minority representation, could well produce a different alignment [of justices]". Law professor and future judge <a href="Robert%20Bork">Robert Bork</a> wrote in the pages of "The Wall Street Journal" that the justices who had voted to uphold affirmative action were "hard-core racists of reverse discrimination".

Allan Bakke had given few interviews during the pendency of the case, and on the day it was decided, went to work as usual in <a href="Palo%20Alto%2C%20California">Palo Alto</a>. He issued a statement through attorney Colvin expressing his pleasure in the result and that he planned to begin his medical studies that fall. Most of the lawyers and university personnel who would have to deal with the aftermath of "Bakke" doubted the decision would change very much. The large majority of affirmative action programs at universities, unlike that of the UC Davis medical school, did not use rigid numerical quotas for minority admissions and could continue. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of "Bakke", the Supreme Court's decision "permits admission officers to operate programs which grant racial preferences—provided that they do not do so as blatantly as was done under the sixteen-seat 'quota' provided at Davis".

Allan Bakke, "America's best known freshman", enrolled at the UC Davis medical school on September 25, 1978. Seemingly oblivious to the questions of the press and the shouts of protesters, he stated only "I am happy to be here" before entering to register. When the university declined to pay his legal fees, Bakke went to court, and on January 15, 1980, was awarded $183,089. Graduating from the UC Davis medical school in 1982 at age 42, he went on to a career as an anesthesiologist at the <a href="Mayo%20Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> and at the Olmsted Medical Group in <a href="Rochester%2C%20Minnesota">Rochester, Minnesota</a>.

In 1996, Californians <a href="initiatives%20and%20referendums%20in%20the%20United%20States">by initiative</a> banned the state's use of race as a factor to consider in public schools' admission policies. The university's <a href="University%20of%20California%20Regents">Board of Regents</a>, led by <a href="Ward%20Connerly">Ward Connerly</a>, voted to end race as a factor in admissions. The regents, to secure a diverse student body, implemented policies such as allowing the top 4% of students in California high schools guaranteed admission to the <a href="University%20of%20California%20System">University of California System</a>—this, it was felt, would aid minority inner-city students.

Dworkin warned in 1978 that "Powell's opinion suffers from fundamental weaknesses, and if the Court is to arrive at a coherent position, far more judicial work remains to be done than a relieved public yet realizes". The Supreme Court has continued to grapple with the question of affirmative action in higher education. In the 2003 case of "<a href="Grutter%20v.%20Bollinger">Grutter v. Bollinger</a>", it reaffirmed Justice Powell's opinion in "Bakke" in a majority opinion, thus rendering moot concerns expressed by lower courts that "Bakke" might not be binding precedent due to the fractured lineup of justices in a <a href="plurality%20opinion">plurality opinion</a>. The court's decision in the 2013 case of "<a href="Fisher%20v.%20University%20of%20Texas%20%282013%29">Fisher v. University of Texas</a>" made alterations to the standards by which courts must judge affirmative action programs, but continued to permit race to be taken into consideration in university admissions, while forbidding outright quotas.

Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics

Nine cities submitting bids to host the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> and <a href="2012%20Summer%20Paralympics">2012 Summer Paralympics</a> were recognised by the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC). The Committee shortlisted five of them—<a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and <a href="Paris">Paris</a>—from which London eventually prevailed; thus becoming the first city to host the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> for <a href="London%20Olympics">a third time</a>. The bidding process for the 2012 Olympics was considered one of the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC. Paris was seen by some as the front-runner for much of the campaign, but skillful lobbying by London's supporters and an inspirational final presentation by <a href="Sebastian%20Coe">Sebastian Coe</a> led to the success of its bid.

After a technical evaluation of the nine original bids, the top five were shortlisted on 18 May 2004, becoming official candidates. The remaining applicant cities—<a href="Havana">Havana</a>, <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> and <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>—were eliminated. Four of the five candidate cities were prominent national capitals, which lent an increased competitive interest to the final bidding phase. Paris and Madrid earned the top scores during the application phase, but in early 2005, a more thorough evaluation of the candidates put Paris and London in a close race that became tighter as the final vote approached. On 6 July 2005, in a four-round <a href="exhaustive%20ballot">exhaustive ballot</a> of the IOC (gathered at the <a href="117th%20IOC%20Session">117th IOC Session</a> in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>), Moscow, New York City and Madrid were eliminated in the first three rounds. London won the final round by a margin of four votes over Paris and secured the right to host the 2012 Olympics.

In the month after the election, members of the Paris 2012 delegation argued that the London delegation had violated IOC rules. The key points in the accusations were London 2012's abortive athlete incentive initiative and lobbying by then-British Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>. A public statement by IOC President <a href="Jacques%20Rogge">Jacques Rogge</a> dismissed these accusations, stating that the competition had been fair. Another controversy occurred during the bidding process when an undercover investigation by British television series "<a href="Panorama%20%28TV%20series%29">Panorama</a>" revealed a corruption scandal associated with IOC member <a href="Ivan%20Slavkov">Ivan Slavkov</a> and Olympic agents, who offered to deliver votes from IOC members to any 2012 Olympic bid in return for financial favours. Still recovering from the effects of the <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympic%20bid%20scandal">Salt Lake City scandal</a>, the IOC reacted swiftly and punitively toward the rule-breaking individuals.

The Olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city's application to the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) by its <a href="National%20Olympic%20Committee">National Olympic Committee</a> (NOC) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the IOC during an ordinary session. The process is governed by the <a href="Olympic%20Charter">Olympic Charter</a>, as stated in Chapter 5, Rule 34.

Since 1999, the process has consisted of two phases. During the first phase, which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline, the "applicant cities" are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organisation. This information allows the IOC to analyse the cities' hosting capacities and the strengths and weaknesses of their plans. Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports, the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is the true candidature stage: the accepted applicant cities (from now on referred to as "candidate cities") are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended, more detailed, candidature file. These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a group composed of IOC members, representatives of <a href="List%20of%20international%20sport%20federations">international sport federations</a>, NOCs, athletes, the <a href="International%20Paralympic%20Committee">International Paralympic Committee</a>, and international experts in various fields. The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four-day inspection visits to each of the candidate cities, where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of the themes covered in the candidature file. The Evaluation Commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the IOC members up to one month before the electing IOC Session.

The IOC Session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the Olympics. The election is made by the assembled active IOC members (excluding honorary and honour members), each possessing one vote. Members from countries that have a city taking part in the election cannot vote while the city is in the running. The voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an <a href="absolute%20majority">absolute majority</a> of votes; if this does not happen in the first round, the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins. In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes, a special runoff vote is carried out, with the winner proceeding to the next round. After each round, the eliminated bid is announced. Following the announcement of the host city, the successful bid delegation signs the "Host City Contract" with the IOC, which delegates the responsibilities of the Games organisation to the city and respective NOC.

The deadline to submit applications for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was 15 July 2003. The nine cities that submitted bids before that date also met the 15 January 2004 deadline for submission of the first phase questionnaire. Through analysis of the questionnaires, the IOC gave a <a href="weighted%20average">weighted-average</a> score to each city based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire's eleven themes: political and social support, general <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a>, sports venues, Olympic Village, environment, accommodation, transport, security, past experience, finance, and legacy. If a bid's score was higher than six (IOC's predefined benchmark score), the city was considered highly capable of hosting the Games; otherwise, its chances were very slim. On 18 May 2004, the IOC announced the cities accepted as candidates:


The five highest-rated applicants progressed to the next phase as official candidate cities. As stipulated, the IOC granted them the right to use the <a href="Olympic%20rings">Olympic rings</a> on their candidature emblem, together with a label identifying each as a Candidate City.

By 15 November 2004, all candidates had submitted their candidature files to the IOC. After a period of analysis by the IOC, the cities were visited by the IOC Evaluation Commission, consisting of twelve members and chaired by <a href="Morocco">Moroccan</a> IOC member <a href="Nawal%20El%20Moutawakel">Nawal El Moutawakel</a>. The four-day visits occurred between 3 February and 17 March 2005:


The Parisian bid suffered two setbacks during the inspection: a number of strikes and demonstrations coincided with the visit, and a report was released stating that <a href="Guy%20Drut">Guy Drut</a>, IOC member and one of the key members of Paris's bid team, faced charges over alleged political party financial corruption.

On 6 June 2005, the IOC released the inspection team's evaluation reports of the five candidate cities. Although these documents did not contain scores or rankings, the report for Paris was considered the most positive, followed closely by London, which had narrowed most of the gap observed at the time of the first-phase evaluation in 2004. New York City and Madrid also obtained very positive evaluations, while Moscow was considered the weakest bid. On the same day, New York City's bid suffered a major setback following the report that the <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">State of New York</a> refused to fund <a href="West%20Side%20Stadium">West Side Stadium</a>, a New York 2012 centrepiece. The New York City campaign devised an alternative plan within a week, but such a major change with only one month remaining before the final vote damaged the city's chances.

Throughout the bidding process and leading up to the vote at the <a href="117th%20IOC%20Session">117th IOC Session</a>, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as its bid was the city's third in recent history (previous bids being for <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics%20bids">1992</a> and <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics%20bids">2008</a>). London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin, but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of <a href="Sebastian%20Coe">Sebastian Coe</a> as the head of London 2012, on 19 May 2004. In late August 2004, reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris. In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest. On 1 July 2005, IOC president <a href="Jacques%20Rogge">Jacques Rogge</a>, when asked who the winner would be, told the assembled press, "I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less."

The opening ceremony of the 117th IOC Session was held at the <a href="Esplanade%20-%20Theatres%20on%20the%20Bay">Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay</a> in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> on 5 July 2005. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Singapore">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Lee%20Hsien%20Loong">Lee Hsien Loong</a> was the guest of honour and officially opened the session. Song, dance and martial arts exhibitions with the theme "One Voice, One Rhythm, One World" began the ceremony.

On 6 July 2005, the election day, the IOC Session was held at the Raffles City Convention Centre. It began at 1:00 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> with the one-hour final presentations of the candidate cities, followed by a half-hour press briefing, in the following order: Paris, New York City, Moscow, London and Madrid. The bid presentations ended at 9:00 UTC and a presentation of the Evaluation Commission's final report preceded the election. Of the 116 active IOC members, 17 could not vote in the first round, leaving 99 members able to exert their voting rights.

The electronic ballot began at 10:26 UTC, and the first three rounds eliminated Moscow, New York City and Madrid, respectively. After a city was eliminated, members from that city's country were allowed to vote in the following rounds. London and Paris made it to the fourth and final round of voting, which concluded at 10:45 UTC. An hour later, at 11:49 UTC, London was formally announced as the winner by Jacques Rogge. Approximately one billion viewers watched the announcement on live television.

After the announcement, the ballot results were published: London gathered more votes in the first, third and final rounds, while Madrid won the second round despite falling short on votes in the third round and being eliminated. The competitiveness of the bids from Paris and London was ultimately demonstrated by a four-vote difference in the final round.

In December 2003, the British prime minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> spoke about the London bid during a "sports breakfast" he hosted during a summit in <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. Blair mentioned the bid in context of the positive legacy of the <a href="2002%20Commonwealth%20Games">2002 Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>: "It was partly the success of the Commonwealth Games that inspired our bid for the Olympics." Since the IOC expressly forbids any international promotion of bids before the final candidature phase, it wrote to leading British officials asking for an explanation concerning the alleged violation. The chairmen of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Games%20Federation">Commonwealth Games Federation</a> and the <a href="British%20Olympic%20Association">British Olympic Association</a>, and spokesmen from <a href="Downing%20Street">Downing Street</a> and London 2012 denied any violation of the IOC's ethical code, insisting that Blair's comments were taken out of context as there was no intention to promote the bid. Nevertheless, to prevent future ethical clashes, <a href="barrister">barrister</a> <a href="Michael%20Beloff">Michael Beloff</a> was appointed the ethics commissioner for the London bid two months later.

On 4 August 2004, <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="Panorama%20%28TV%20series%29">Panorama</a>" broadcast the results of a year-long investigation in which the reporters posed as consultants from a fictitious firm "New London Ventures", which was supposed to represent businesses interested in bringing the 2012 Olympics to London. The report unveiled how some Olympic agents could guarantee votes from certain IOC members to the London bid, in exchange for favours or money. The undercover team secretly filmed its encounter with one of these agents, Goran Takac, who presented them to <a href="Ivan%20Slavkov">Ivan Slavkov</a>, an IOC member and the <a href="Bulgarian%20Olympic%20Committee">Bulgarian Olympic Committee</a>'s president. Slavkov stated he was open to negotiation since he had not made up his mind about which 2012 candidate city would get his vote. Takac mentioned that Slavkov's position on the IOC was an advantage to bypass the rigid rules concerning meetings with other members, and that Slavkov's services fee was included on the initial figures given to the reporters.

In the days leading to the programme's broadcast, the IOC Ethics Commission launched an enquiry to investigate the accusations made in the documentary. Even though the "Panorama" reporters clearly stated that the London bid was nowhere associated with the investigation, the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement, hoping to distance themselves from the scandal: "What I have to make clear is that London 2012 knew nothing about this—we have nothing to hide," said <a href="Alan%20Pascoe">Alan Pascoe</a>, a London 2012 vice chairman, committing to "do everything we can to co-operate [with the IOC enquiry] and take this story off the running order". <a href="Sebastian%20Coe">Sebastian Coe</a>, also a vice chairman at the time, reaffirmed Pascoe's words and assured "London 2012 has acted properly and ethically throughout the bidding process." After watching the documentary, IOC members and officials cleared London 2012 of any wrongdoing.

Following the broadcast, the IOC provisionally suspended Ivan Slavkov and forbade him from attending the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a>. Jacques Rogge claimed he was "an angry man because some people are not playing by the rules," underlining that "Under my leadership, I can stress there is zero tolerance for unethical behaviour". An IOC Ethics Commission report released on 25 October 2004 condemned Slavkov and backed the veracity of the BBC's investigation: "the complete recording of the meeting between Mr Slavkov and the two journalists reveals that: ...at no time and in no way did Mr Slavkov object to this discussion of the terms of a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of IOC members whom he and Mr Takac were likely to be able to influence". Knowing about the accusation, Slavkov argued that he attended the meeting with the purpose of trying to frame the supposed corrupters, however the Ethics Commission report further stated that "at no point does it emerge from the meeting that Mr Slavkov's sole intention was to catch in the act these corrupters of IOC members." It goes on to say that Slavkov received "no mandate to 'find the real roots of corruption'" and that he was to profit monetarily from Takac's services. The report concluded: 
"Mr Slavkov tarnished the honour and reputation of the Olympic Movement and the IOC... Indeed, an IOC member's involvement in this 'negotiation' lent credibility to the hypothesis advanced by the journalists that there were within the IOC members and agents who could corrupt other IOC members."
On 7 July 2005, during the 117th IOC Session, Ivan Slavkov was expelled from the organisation following an 84–12 voting by the IOC members.

The Paris delegation, led by <a href="Bertrand%20Delano%C3%AB">Bertrand Delanoë</a>, argued that Tony Blair and the London delegation had broken the IOC rules. On 11 July 2005, Delanoë stated: "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee. I do not say that they were flirting with the yellow line, I say that they crossed the yellow line". A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes, which included free flights, food, vouchers for long-distance calling and other financial accommodations. Immediately after announcing the initiative, London withdrew it, most likely as a result of Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a "bidding war". Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal, an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street. It was not until 4 August 2005 that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement: "I made it very clear that, in my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out". Delanoë's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders; Claude Goasguen, president of the <a href="Union%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement">Union for a Popular Movement</a> (UMP) party of the <a href="Council%20of%20Paris">Council of Paris</a>, stated: "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".

Even before the election, tensions grew between the French and British delegations, already in Singapore. The Paris bid team considered submitting a complaint against London bid consultants Jim Sloman and Rod Sheard after they stated that the <a href="Stade%20de%20France">Stade de France</a> was not adequate for athletics, an action that goes against the IOC rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid. The London team promptly denied that the two men were under contract with the bid at that time, and underlined that their opinions did not reflect the views of the London bid.

On 23 December 2005, Alex Gilady, an <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i IOC member and a member of the IOC's London 2012 Co-ordination Commission, suggested that Madrid should have tied for second spot with Paris in the third round of voting, but did not do so because <a href="Greece">Greek</a> member Lambis Nikolaou pressed the wrong button. He further postulated that if this had happened, Madrid would have beaten Paris in the resulting runoff ballot for second place, and gone on to beat London in the final round. However, Craig Reedie, a British IOC member, dismissed these words, commenting that a claim "that an unnamed member 'might' have done something which 'might' have brought about something else which 'might' have brought about a different result is 'the kind of tittle-tattle that happens after many an IOC vote'."

By the end of 2005, Lambis Nikolaou denied Gilady's claims: "All this speculation surrounding my role in the third round of voting for the 2012 candidates is totally unfounded. I state that I did not vote in the third round as I had announced at the time of the vote." This statement was confirmed by the IOC voting numbers, which demonstrate that, even if Nikolaou had voted for Madrid, the city would have failed to beat Paris in the third voting round.

Then-French President <a href="Jacques%20Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> became the subject of controversy the day before the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> was due to pick a host city. Chirac made comments stating that "the only worse food than British food is Finnish" and "the only thing the British have done for Europe's agriculture is mad cow disease". Not only were Chirac's comments considered unsportsmanlike where the normal etiquette is not to criticize rival cities, there were two IOC members from Finland who would vote in the final ballot. While Paris was widely acknowledged as the front runner, the narrow loss to London led many to believe that Chirac's comments were at fault.

Besides the initial nine applicant cities, other cities also wished to bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but the bids were not internally selected by the NOC (in case of more than one bidding city from the same country), were not put forward to the IOC, or were withdrawn before filing the necessary paperwork.

The Nigerian capital, <a href="Abuja">Abuja</a>, planned to present a bid to become the first African city to stage the Olympic Games, but ended up not filling its application. In Asia, three cities were interested in holding the Games, but did not officially submit a bid: <a href="Hyderabad%2C%20India">Hyderabad</a>, <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>, and <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>. In South America, the Brazilian Olympic Committee chose Rio de Janeiro over <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28city%29">São Paulo</a>, and if Rio de Janeiro had been selected by the IOC, it would have been the first Olympiad staged in South America (four years on, Rio de Janeiro did land the <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016 Games</a>).
In <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> initially planned to gain hosting rights for 2012 after losing the <a href="Bids%20for%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Olympics bidding process</a>, but because Vancouver landed the <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a>, the Canadian city cancelled these plans. In the United States, the city of New York was picked by the <a href="United%20States%20Olympic%20Committee">United States Olympic Committee</a> (USOC) over <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, although several other cities submitted candidatures to become the American candidate for the 2012 Olympics; these included <a href="Houston%2C%20Texas">Houston</a>, <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> (in cooperation with nearby <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore</a>), <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="Dallas%2C%20Texas">Dallas</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle</a> and <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a> (in cooperation with nearby <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando</a>). Several European cities wanted to follow the likes of London, Madrid, Moscow and Paris, and were thus hopeful to gain their NOC's support. Germany chose Leipzig over <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, and <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, while in Spain, <a href="Seville">Seville</a> lost out to Madrid. Other referenced cities were <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, <a href="Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a>, <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> and <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>.

Moonraker (novel)

Moonraker is the third novel by the British author <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> to feature his fictional British <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a>. It was published by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay that was too short for a full novel so he added the passage of the <a href="Contract%20bridge">bridge</a> game between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In the latter half of the novel, Bond is seconded to Drax's staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a nuclear warhead, and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, "Moonraker" is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, complaining about the lack of exotic locations.

"Moonraker", like Fleming's previous novels, was well received by critics. "Moonraker" plays on a number of 1950s fears, including attack by rockets (following the <a href="V-2%20rocket">V-2</a> strikes of the Second World War), <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet communism</a>, the re-emergence of <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a> and the "threat from within" posed by both ideologies. Fleming examines Englishness, and the novel shows the virtues and strength of England. Adaptations include a broadcast on South African radio in 1956 starring <a href="Bob%20Holness">Bob Holness</a> and a 1958 "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" comic strip. The novel's name was used in 1979 for the <a href="Moonraker%20%28film%29">eleventh official film</a> in the <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> Bond series and the fourth to star <a href="Roger%20Moore">Roger Moore</a> as Bond; the plot was significantly changed from the novel to include excursions into space.

The British <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a> is asked by his superior, <a href="M%20%28James%20Bond%29">M</a>, to join him at M's club, <a href="Blades%20Club">Blades</a>. A club member, the multi-millionaire businessman <a href="Hugo%20Drax">Sir Hugo Drax</a>, is winning considerable money playing <a href="Contract%20bridge">bridge</a>, seemingly against the odds. M suspects Drax is cheating, and while claiming indifference, is concerned as to why a multi-millionaire and national hero would cheat. Bond confirms Drax's deception and manages to turn the tables—aided by a pack of stacked cards—and wins £15,000.

Drax is the product of a mysterious background, purportedly unknown even to himself. Presumed to have been a British Army soldier during the Second World War, he was badly injured and stricken with amnesia in the explosion of a bomb planted by a German saboteur at a British field headquarters. After extensive rehabilitation in an army hospital, he returned home to become a wealthy industrialist. After building his fortune and establishing himself in business and society, Drax started building the "Moonraker", Britain's first <a href="nuclear%20missile">nuclear missile</a> project, intended to defend Britain against its <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> enemies. The Moonraker rocket was to be an upgraded <a href="V-2%20rocket">V-2 rocket</a> using <a href="liquid%20hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a> and <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> as <a href="Rocket%20propellant">propellants</a>; to withstand the ultra-high combustion temperatures of its engine, it used <a href="columbite">columbite</a>, in which Drax had a monopoly. Because the rocket's engine could withstand high heat, the Moonraker was able to use these powerful fuels, greatly expanding its effective range.

After a <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a> security officer working at the project is shot dead, M assigns Bond to replace him and also to investigate what has been going on at the missile-building base, located between <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and <a href="Deal%2C%20Kent">Deal</a> on the south coast of England. All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police <a href="Special%20Branch">Special Branch</a> officer working undercover as Drax's personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, concluding that the man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast.

Drax's henchman Krebs is caught by Bond snooping through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers the truth about the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with those in a notebook picked from Drax's pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret radio homing station—intended to serve as a beacon for the missile's guidance system—in the heart of London. While she is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.

Drax tells Bond that he was never a British soldier and has never suffered from amnesia: his real name is <a href="Graf">Graf</a> Hugo von der Drache, the German commander of a <a href="Werwolf">Werwolf</a> commando unit. He was the saboteur whose team placed the car bomb at the army field headquarters, only to be injured himself in the detonation. The amnesia story was simply a cover he used while recovering in hospital, in order to avoid Allied retribution, although it would lead to a whole new British identity. Drax remains a dedicated Nazi, bent on revenge against England for the wartime defeat of his Fatherland and his prior history of social slights suffered as a youth growing up in an English boarding school before the war. He explains that he now means to destroy London, with a <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a>-supplied nuclear warhead that has been secretly fitted to the Moonraker. He also plans to play the <a href="stock%20market">stock market</a> the day before <a href="Insider%20trading">to make a huge profit</a> from the imminent disaster.

Brand and Bond are imprisoned where the blast from the Moonraker's engines will incinerate them, to leave no trace of them once the Moonraker is launched. Before the firing, the couple escape. Brand gives Bond the proper coordinates to redirect the gyros and send the Moonraker into the sea. Having been in collaboration with Soviet Intelligence all along, Drax and his henchman attempt to escape by Soviet submarine—only to be killed as the vessel flees through the waters onto which the Moonraker has been re-targeted. After their debriefing at headquarters, Bond meets up with Brand, expecting her company—but they part ways after she reveals that she is engaged to a fellow Special Branch officer.

In early 1953 the film producer <a href="Alexander%20Korda">Alexander Korda</a> read a proof copy of "<a href="Live%20and%20Let%20Die%20%28novel%29">Live and Let Die</a>", and informed its author, <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>, that he was excited by the book, but that it would not make a good basis for a film. Fleming told the producer that his next book was to be an expansion of an idea for a screenplay, set in London and Kent, adding that the location would allow "for some wonderful film settings".
Fleming undertook a significant amount of background research in preparation for writing "Moonraker"; he asked his fellow correspondent on "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>", Anthony Terry, for information on the Second World War German <a href="Resistance%20movement">resistance</a> force—the <a href="Werwolf">Werewolves</a>—and German V-2 rockets. The latter was a subject on which he wrote to the science fiction writer <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> and the <a href="British%20Interplanetary%20Society">British Interplanetary Society</a>. Fleming also visited the <a href="Wimpole%20Street">Wimpole Street</a> psychiatrist Eric Strauss to discuss the traits of <a href="megalomania">megalomania</a>cs; Strauss lent him the book "Men of Genius", which provided the link between megalomania and childhood thumb-sucking. Fleming used this information to give Drax <a href="diastema">diastema</a>, a common result of thumb-sucking. According to his biographer <a href="Andrew%20Lycett">Andrew Lycett</a>, Fleming "wanted to make "Moonraker" his most ambitious and personal novel yet." Fleming, a keen card player, was fascinated by the background to the 1890 <a href="royal%20baccarat%20scandal">royal baccarat scandal</a>, and when in 1953 he met a woman who had been present at the game, he questioned her so intently that she burst into tears.

In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, travelled to their <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, "<a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28novel%29">Casino Royale</a>", which had been published in April 1953, and "Live and Let Die", whose publication was imminent. He began writing "Moonraker" on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for "Books and Bookmen" magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: "I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he felt like he was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years." He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he "had to more or less graft the first half of the book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".

Fleming considered a number of titles for the story; his first choice had been "The Moonraker", until <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> reminded him of a novel of the same name by <a href="F.%20Tennyson%20Jesse">F. Tennyson Jesse</a>. Fleming then considered "The Moonraker Secret", "The Moonraker Plot", "The Inhuman Element", "Wide of the Mark", "The Infernal Machine", "Mondays are Hell" and "Out of the Clear Sky". <a href="George%20Wren%20Howard">George Wren Howard</a> of Jonathan Cape suggested "Bond & the Moonraker", "The Moonraker Scare" and "The Moonraker Plan", while his friend, the writer <a href="William%20Plomer">William Plomer</a>, suggested "Hell is Here"; the final choice of "Moonraker" was a suggestion by Wren Howard.

Although Fleming provided no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">novel series</a> as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom have written books on behalf of <a href="Ian%20Fleming%20Publications">Ian Fleming Publications</a>—put the events of "Moonraker" in 1953; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place in May of that year.

The locations draw from Fleming's personal experiences. "Moonraker" is the only Bond novel that takes place solely in Britain, which gave Fleming the chance to write about the England he cherished, such as the Kent countryside, including the <a href="White%20Cliffs%20of%20Dover">White Cliffs of Dover</a>, and London clubland. Fleming owned a cottage in <a href="St%20Margaret%27s%20at%20Cliffe">St Margaret's at Cliffe</a>, near Dover, and he went to great lengths to get the details of the area right, including lending his car to his stepson to time the journey from London to Deal for the car chase passage. Fleming used his experiences of London clubs for the background of the Blades scenes. As a clubman, he enjoyed membership of <a href="Boodle%27s">Boodle's</a>, <a href="White%27s">White's</a> and the <a href="Portland%20Club%20%28London%29">Portland Club</a>, and a combination of Boodles and the Portland Club is thought to be the model for Blades; the author <a href="Michael%20Dibdin">Michael Dibdin</a> found the scene in the club to be "surely one of the finest things that Ian Fleming ever did."

The early chapters of the novel centre on Bond's private life, with Fleming using his own lifestyle as a basis for Bond's. Fleming used further aspects of his private life, such as his friends, as he had done in his previous novels: Hugo Drax was named after his brother-in-law <a href="Hugo%20Charteris">Hugo Charteris</a> and a navy acquaintance Admiral Sir <a href="Reginald%20Drax">Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax</a>, while Fleming's friend Duff Sutherland (described as "a scruffy looking chap") was one of the bridge players at Blades. The name of the Scotland Yard superintendent, Ronnie Vallance, was made up from those of <a href="Ronald%20Howe">Ronald Howe</a>, the actual assistant commissioner at the Yard, and of Vallance Lodge & Co., Fleming's accountants. Other elements of the plot came from Fleming's knowledge of wartime operations carried out by <a href="T-Force">T-Force</a>, a secret British Army unit formed to continue the work of the Fleming-established <a href="30%20Assault%20Unit">30 Assault Unit</a>.

According to the author <a href="Raymond%20Benson">Raymond Benson</a>, "Moonraker" is a deeper and more introspective book than Fleming's previous work, which allows the author to develop the characters further. As such, Bond "becomes something more than ... [the] cardboard figure" that he had been in the previous two novels. The start of the book concentrates on Bond at home and his daily routines, which Fleming describes as "Elastic office hours from around ten until six, ... evenings spent playing cards in the company of a few close friends, ... or making love, with rather cold passion, to one of three similarly disposed married women." This lifestyle was largely modelled on Fleming's own, which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing "a sourness" in the author's character. According to Chancellor, two of Bond's other vices were also displayed in the book: his fondness for gambling—illegal except in private members clubs in 1955—and excessive drink and drug taking, neither of which were frowned upon in post-war upper class circles. In preparation for beating Drax at cards, Bond consumes a vodka martini, a carafe of vodka shared with M, two bottles of champagne and a brandy; he also mixes a quantity of <a href="Benzedrine">Benzedrine</a>, an <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>, into a glass of the champagne. According to "The Times" journalist and historian <a href="Ben%20Macintyre">Ben Macintyre</a>, to Fleming the alcohol consumption "meant relaxation, ritual and reliability". Benzedrine was regularly taken by troops during the war to remain awake and alert, and Fleming was an occasional consumer.

Drax is physically abnormal, as are many of Bond's later adversaries. He has very broad shoulders, a large head and protruding teeth with diastema; his face is badly scarred from a wartime explosion. According to the writers <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a> and Benson—both of whom subsequently wrote Bond novels—Drax is the most successful villain in the Bond canon. Amis considers this to be "because the most imagination and energy has gone into his portrayal. He lives in the real world ... [and] his physical presence fills "Moonraker". The view is shared by Chancellor, who considers Drax "perhaps the most believable" of all Fleming's villains. The cultural historian <a href="Jeremy%20Black%20%28historian%29">Jeremy Black</a> writes that as with <a href="Le%20Chiffre">Le Chiffre</a> and Mr Big—the villains of the first two Bond novels—Drax's origins and war history are vital to an understanding of the character. Like several other antagonists in the Bond canon, Drax was German, reminding readers of a familiar threat in 1950s Britain. Because Drax is without a girlfriend or wife he is, according to the norms of Fleming and his works, abnormal in Bond's world.

Benson considers Brand to be one of the weakest female roles in the Bond canon and "a throwback to the rather stiff characterization of <a href="Vesper%20Lynd">Vesper Lynd</a>" from "Casino Royale". Brand's lack of interest in Bond removes sexual tension from the novel; she is unique in the canon for being the one woman that Bond does not seduce. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and <a href="Tony%20Bennett%20%28sociologist%29">Tony Bennett</a> write that the perceived reserve shown by Brand to Bond was not due to frigidity, but to her engagement to a fellow police officer.

M is another character who is more fully realised than in the previous novels, and for the first time in the series he is shown outside a work setting at the Blades club. It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show £100,000 in cash or <a href="gilt-edged%20securities">gilt-edged securities</a>. Amis, in his study "<a href="The%20James%20Bond%20Dossier">The James Bond Dossier</a>", considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book "<a href="On%20Her%20Majesty%27s%20Secret%20Service%20%28novel%29">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a>" it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year.

Benson analysed Fleming's writing style and identified what he described as the "Fleming Sweep": a stylistic technique that sweeps the reader from one chapter to another using 'hooks' at the end of each chapter to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next: Benson feels that the sweep in "Moonraker" was not as pronounced as Fleming's previous works, largely due to the lack of action sequences in the novel.

According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th-century British spy novels, in "Moonraker" Fleming uses a technique closer to the detective story than to the thriller genre. This manifests itself in Fleming placing clues to the plot line throughout the story, and leaving Drax's unveiling of his plan until the later chapters. Black sees that the pace of the novel is set by the launch of the rocket (there are four days between Bond's briefing by M and the launch) while Amis considers that the story to have a "rather hurried" ending.

"Moonraker" uses a literary device Fleming employs elsewhere, that of having a seemingly trivial incident between the main characters—the card game—that leads to the uncovering of a greater incident—the main plot involving the rocket. Dibdin sees gambling as the common link, thus the card game acts as an "introduction to the ensuing encounter ... for even higher stakes". Savoye sees this concept of competition between Bond and villain as a "notion of game and the eternal fight between Order and Disorder", common throughout the Bond stories.

Parker describes the novel as "a hymn to England", and highlights Fleming's description of the white cliffs of Dover and the heart of London as evidence. Even the German Krebs is moved by the sight of the Kent countryside in a country he hates. The novel places England—and particularly London and Kent—in the front line of the cold war, and the threat to the location further emphasises its importance. Bennett and Woollacott consider that "Moonraker" defines the strengths and virtues of England and Englishness as being the "quiet and orderly background of English institutions", which are threatened by the disturbance Drax brings.

The literary critic <a href="Meir%20Sternberg">Meir Sternberg</a> considers the theme of English identity can be seen in the confrontation between Drax and Bond. Drax—whose real name is German for dragon—is in opposition to Bond, who takes the role of <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a> in the conflict.

As with "Casino Royale" and "Live and Let Die", "Moonraker" involves the idea of the "traitor within". Drax, real name Graf Hugo von der Drache, is a "megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman", while Krebs bears the same name as Hitler's <a href="Hans%20Krebs%20%28Wehrmacht%20general%29">last Chief of Staff</a>. Black sees that, in using a German as the novel's main enemy, "Fleming ... exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s. Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press." "Moonraker" uses two of the foes feared by Fleming, the Nazis and the Soviets, with Drax being German and working for the Soviets; in "Moonraker" the Soviets were hostile and provided not just the atomic bomb, but support and logistics to Drax. "Moonraker" played on fears of the audiences of the 1950s of rocket attacks from overseas, fears grounded in the use of the V-2 rocket by the Nazis during the Second World War. The story takes the threat one stage further, with a rocket based on English soil, aimed at London and "the end of British invulnerability".

"Moonraker" was published in the UK by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the first impression was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by <a href="Macmillan%20Publishers">Macmillan</a> on 20 September that year. In October 1956 <a href="Pan%20Books">Pan Books</a> published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies before the end of the year. In December that year the US paperback was published under the title "Too Hot to Handle" by <a href="Permabooks">Permabooks</a>. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.

Fleming's friend—and neighbour in Jamaica—<a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> considered "Moonraker" to be the best thing Fleming had written to that point: "although as usual too far-fetched, not quite so much so as the last two ... His observation is extraordinary and his talent for description vivid." Fleming received numerous letters from readers complaining about the lack of exotic locations; one of which protested "We want taking out of ourselves, not sitting on the beach in Dover."

<a href="Julian%20Symons">Julian Symons</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>", found "Moonraker" "a disappointment", and considered that "Fleming's tendency ... to parody the form of the thriller, has taken charge in the second half of this story." <a href="Maurice%20Richardson">Maurice Richardson</a>, in his review for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", was more welcoming: "Do not miss this", he urged, saying that "Mr. Fleming continues to be irresistibly readable, however incredible". Hilary Corke, writing in "<a href="The%20Listener%20%28magazine%29">The Listener</a>", thought that "Fleming is one of the most accomplished of thriller-writers", and considered that "Moonraker" "is as mercilessly readable as all the rest". Corke warned Fleming away from being over-dramatic, declaring that "Mr Fleming is evidently far too accomplished to need to lean upon these blood-and-thunder devices: he could keep our hair on end for three hundred pages without spilling more blood than was allowed to <a href="Shylock">Shylock</a>." The reviewer in "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>" considered that Fleming "administers stimuli with no mean hand ... 'Astonish me!' the addict may challenge: Mr Fleming can knock him sideways."

<a href="John%20Metcalf%20%28writer%29">John Metcalf</a> for "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" thought the book "utterly disgraceful—and highly enjoyable ... without ["Moonraker"] no forthcoming railway journey should be undertaken", although he also considered that it was "not one of Mr. Fleming's best". <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", was equivocal, saying "I don't know anyone who writes about gambling more vividly than Fleming and I only wish the other parts of his books lived up to their gambling sequences". Richard Lister in the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>" thought that "Mr. Fleming is splendid; he stops at nothing." Writing for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", Al Manola believed that the "British tradition of rich mystery writing, copious description and sturdy heroism all blend nicely" in "Moonraker", providing what he considered was "probably the best action novel of the month".

 The actor <a href="John%20Payne%20%28actor%29">John Payne</a> attempted to take up the option on the film rights to the book in 1955, but nothing came of the attempt. The <a href="Rank%20Organisation">Rank Organisation</a> also came to an agreement to make a film, but this likewise fell through. 

The novel was not one of Fleming's stories acquired by <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> in 1961; in 1969 the company acquired the rights and commissioned <a href="Gerry%20Anderson">Gerry Anderson</a> to produce and co-write a screenplay. Anderson and <a href="Tony%20Barwick">Tony Barwick</a> prepared a 70-page treatment that was never filmed, but some elements were similar to the final screenplay of "<a href="The%20Spy%20Who%20Loved%20Me%20%28film%29">The Spy Who Loved Me</a>".

The first adaptation of "Moonraker" was for South African radio in 1956, with <a href="Bob%20Holness">Bob Holness</a> providing the voice of Bond. According to "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", "listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob's cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination". The novel was adapted as a <a href="James%20Bond%20%28comic%20strip%29">comic strip</a> that was published in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" newspaper and syndicated worldwide. The adaptation was written by <a href="Henry%20Gammidge">Henry Gammidge</a> and illustrated by <a href="John%20McLusky">John McLusky</a>, and ran daily from 30 March to 8 August 1959. <a href="Titan%20Books">Titan Books</a> reprinted the strip in 2005 along with "Casino Royale" and "Live and Let Die" as a part of the "Casino Royale" anthology.

"Moonraker" was used as the title for <a href="Moonraker%20%28film%29">the eleventh James Bond film</a>, produced by Eon Productions and released in 1979. Directed by <a href="Lewis%20Gilbert">Lewis Gilbert</a> and produced by <a href="Albert%20R.%20Broccoli">Albert R. Broccoli</a>, the film features <a href="Roger%20Moore">Roger Moore</a> in his fourth appearance as Bond. The Nazi-inspired element of Drax's motivation in the novel was indirectly preserved with the "master race" theme of the film's plot. Since the screenplay was original, Eon Productions and <a href="Glidrose%20Publications">Glidrose Publications</a> authorised the film's writer, <a href="Christopher%20Wood%20%28writer%29">Christopher Wood</a>, to produce his second novelization based on a film; this was entitled "<a href="James%20Bond%20and%20Moonraker">James Bond and Moonraker</a>". Elements of "Moonraker" were also used in the 2002 film "<a href="Die%20Another%20Day">Die Another Day</a>", with a scene set in the Blades club. The actress <a href="Rosamund%20Pike">Rosamund Pike</a>, who plays Miranda Frost in the film, later said that her character was originally to have been named Gala Brand.

Jomo Kenyatta

Jomo Kenyatta ( – 22 August 1978) was a <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>n <a href="anti-colonial">anti-colonial</a> activist and politician who governed Kenya as its <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Kenya">Prime Minister</a> from 1963 to 1964 and then as its first <a href="President%20of%20Kenya">President</a> from 1964 to his death in 1978. He was the country's first indigenous head of government and played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from <a href="Kenya%20Colony">a colony</a> of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> into an independent republic. Ideologically an <a href="African%20nationalist">African nationalist</a> and <a href="conservative">conservative</a>, he led the <a href="Kenya%20African%20National%20Union">Kenya African National Union</a> (KANU) party from 1961 until his death.
Kenyatta was born to <a href="Kikuyu%20people">Kikuyu</a> farmers in <a href="Kiambu">Kiambu</a>, <a href="British%20East%20Africa">British East Africa</a>. Educated at a <a href="mission%20school">mission school</a>, he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the <a href="Kikuyu%20Central%20Association">Kikuyu Central Association</a>. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow's <a href="Communist%20University%20of%20the%20Toilers%20of%20the%20East">Communist University of the Toilers of the East</a>, <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a>, and the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a>. In 1938, he published <a href="Facing%20Mount%20Kenya">an anthropological study of Kikuyu life</a> before working as a farm labourer in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Influenced by his friend <a href="George%20Padmore">George Padmore</a>, he embraced anti-colonialist and <a href="Pan-African">Pan-African</a> ideas, co-organising the 1945 <a href="Pan-African%20Congress">Pan-African Congress</a> in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. He returned to Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the <a href="Kenya%20African%20Union">Kenya African Union</a>, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from <a href="White%20Kenyans">white settlers</a>. In 1952, he was among the <a href="Kapenguria%20Six">Kapenguria Six</a> arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Mau Mau Uprising</a>. Although protesting his innocence—a view shared by later historians—he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at <a href="Lokitaung">Lokitaung</a> until 1959 and then exiled in <a href="Lodwar">Lodwar</a> until 1961.
On his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the <a href="Kenyan%20general%20election%2C%201963">1963 general election</a>. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the <a href="Kenya%20Colony">Kenya Colony</a> into an independent republic, of which he became President in 1964. Desiring a <a href="one-party%20state">one-party state</a>, he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited KANU's only rival—<a href="Jaramogi%20Oginga%20Odinga">Oginga Odinga</a>'s leftist <a href="Kenya%20People%27s%20Union">Kenya People's Union</a>—from competing in elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and its European minority, although his relations with the <a href="Indians%20in%20Kenya">Kenyan Indians</a> were strained and Kenya's army clashed with <a href="Somali-Kenyan%20conflict">Somali separatists</a> in the <a href="North%20Eastern%20Province%20%28Kenya%29">North Eastern Province</a> during the <a href="Shifta%20War">Shifta War</a>. His government pursued <a href="capitalist">capitalist</a> economic policies and the "Africanisation" of the economy, prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries. Education and healthcare were expanded, while UK-funded land redistribution favoured KANU loyalists and exacerbated ethnic tensions. Under Kenyatta, Kenya joined the <a href="Organisation%20of%20African%20Unity">Organisation of African Unity</a> and the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, espousing a pro-<a href="Western%20world">Western</a> and <a href="anti-communism">anti-communist</a> foreign policy amid the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. Kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by <a href="Daniel%20arap%20Moi">Daniel arap Moi</a>.
Kenyatta was a controversial figure. Prior to Kenyan independence, many of its white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, he was given the honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the <a href="Father%20of%20the%20Nation">Father of the Nation</a>, securing support from both the black majority and white minority with his message of reconciliation. Conversely, his rule was criticised as dictatorial, <a href="authoritarian">authoritarian</a>, and <a href="neo-colonialism">neo-colonial</a>, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread corruption.

A member of the <a href="Kikuyu%20people">Kikuyu people</a>, Kenyatta was born in the village of Nginda. Birth records were not then kept among the Kikuyu, and Kenyatta's date of birth is not known. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested he was likely born in 1890, although a fuller analysis by Jeremy Murray-Brown suggested a birth "circa" 1897 or 1898. Kenyatta's father was named Muigai, and his mother Wambui. They lived in a homestead near the <a href="River%20Thiririka">River Thiririka</a>, where they raised crops and bred sheep and goats. Muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he could afford to keep several wives, each living in a separate "nyūmba" (woman's hut).

Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock. When he was ten, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition from childhood. Wambui subsequently bore another son, Kongo, shortly before Muigai died. In keeping with Kikuyu tradition, Wambui then married her late husband's younger brother, Ngengi. Kenyatta then took the name of Kamau wa Ngengi ("Kamau, son of Ngengi"). Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai. Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward the three boys, and Wambui decided to take her youngest son to live with her parental family further north. It was there that she died, and Kenyatta—who was very fond of the younger Muigai—travelled to collect his infant half-brother. Kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, Kongo wa Magana, and assisted the latter in his role as a <a href="Traditional%20medicine">traditional healer</a>.

In November 1909, Kenyatta left home and enrolled as a pupil at the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> Mission (CSM) at <a href="Thogoto">Thogoto</a>. The missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission. While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a>, where he learnt stories from the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, and was taught to read and write in <a href="English%20language">English</a>. He also performed chores for the mission, including washing the dishes and weeding the gardens. He was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo. The longer the pupils stayed, the more they came to resent the patronising way many of the British missionaries treated them.

Kenyatta's academic progress was unremarkable, and in July 1912 he became an apprentice to the mission's carpenter. That year, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing <a href="catechism">catechism</a>. In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a> ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, but it was an important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognised as an adult. Asked to take a <a href="Christian%20name">Christian name</a> for his upcoming baptism, he first chose both John and Peter after <a href="Apostles">Jesus' apostles</a>. Forced by the missionaries to choose just one, he chose Johnstone, the "-stone" chosen as a reference to Peter. Accordingly, he was <a href="Baptism">baptised</a> as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914. After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends. Having completed his apprenticeship to the carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused. He then requested that the mission recommend him for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.

Kenyatta moved to <a href="Thika">Thika</a>, where he worked for an engineering firm run by Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages from a bank in Nairobi, 25 miles away. Kenyatta left the job when he became seriously ill; he recuperated at a friend's house in the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission. At the time, the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> was engaged in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, and the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> had recruited many Kikuyu. One of those who joined was Kongo, who disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate. Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like other Kikuyu he moved to live among the <a href="Maasai%20people">Maasai</a>, who had refused to fight for the British. Kenyatta lived with the family of an aunt who had married a Maasai chief, adopting Maasai customs and wearing Maasai jewellery, including a beaded belt known as "kinyata" in the <a href="Kikuyu%20language">Kikuyu language</a>. At some point, he took to calling himself "Kinyata" or "Kenyatta" after this garment.

In 1917, Kenyatta moved to <a href="Narok">Narok</a>, where he was involved in transporting livestock to Nairobi, before relocating to Nairobi to work in a store selling farming and engineering equipment. In the evenings, he took classes in a church mission school. Several months later he returned to Thika before obtaining employment building houses for the Thogota Mission. He also lived for a time in <a href="Dagoretti">Dagoretti</a>, where he became a retainer for a local sub-chief, Kioi; in 1919 he assisted Kioi in putting the latter's case in a land dispute before a Nairobi court. Desiring a wife, Kenyatta entered a relationship with <a href="Grace%20Wahu">Grace Wahu</a>, who had attended the CMS School in <a href="Kabete">Kabete</a>; she initially moved into Kenyatta's family homestead, although she joined Kenyatta in Dagoretti when Ngengi drove her out. On 20 November 1920 she gave birth to Kenyatta's son, Peter Muigui. In October 1920, Kenyatta was called before the Thogota Kirk Session and suspended from taking <a href="Holy%20Communion">Holy Communion</a>; the suspension was in response to his drinking and his relations with Wahu out of wedlock. The church insisted that a traditional Kikuyu wedding would be inadequate, and that he must undergo a Christian marriage; this took place on 8 November 1922. Kenyatta had initially refused to cease drinking, but in July 1923 officially renounced alcohol and was allowed to return to Holy Communion.

In April 1922, Kenyatta began working as a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been appointed water superintendent for Nairobi's municipal council. He earned 250 <a href="East%20African%20shilling">shillings</a> a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence and a growing sense of self-confidence. Kenyatta lived in the <a href="Kilimani">Kilimani</a> neighbourhood of Nairobi, although financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; he referred to this latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighbourhood. He had sufficient funds that he could lend money to European clerks in the offices, and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by Nairobi, which included cinemas, football matches, and imported British fashions.

<a href="Anti-imperialism">Anti-imperialist</a> sentiment was on the rise among both native and Indian communities in Kenya following the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a> and the Russian <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>. Many indigenous Africans resented having to carry "<a href="kipande">kipande</a>" identity certificates at all times, being forbidden from growing coffee, and paying taxes without political representation. Political upheavals occurred in Kikuyuland—the area inhabited largely by the Kikuyu—following World War I, among them the campaigns of <a href="Harry%20Thuku">Harry Thuku</a> and the <a href="East%20African%20Association">East African Association</a>, resulting in the government massacre of 21 native protesters in March 1922. Kenyatta had not taken part in these events, perhaps so as not to disrupt his lucrative employment prospects.

Kenyatta's interest in politics stemmed from his friendship with <a href="James%20Beauttah">James Beauttah</a>, a senior figure in the <a href="Kikuyu%20Central%20Association">Kikuyu Central Association</a> (KCA). Beauttah took Kenyatta to a political meeting in <a href="Pumwani">Pumwani</a>, although this led to no firm involvement at the time. In either 1925 or early 1926, Beauttah moved to Uganda, although remained in contact with Kenyatta. When the KCA wrote to Beauttah and asked him to travel to <a href="London">London</a> as their representative, he declined, but recommended that Kenyatta—who had a good command of English—go in his place. Kenyatta accepted, probably on the condition that the Association matched his pre-existing wage. He thus became the group's secretary.

It is likely that the KCA purchased a motorbike for Kenyatta, which he used to travel around Kikuyuland and neighbouring areas inhabited by the <a href="Meru%20people">Meru</a> and <a href="Embu%20people">Embu</a>, helping to establish new KCA branches. In February 1928, he was part of a KCA party that visited Government House in Nairobi to give evidence in front of the <a href="Hilton%20Young%20Commission">Hilton Young Commission</a>, which was then considering a federation between Kenya, Uganda, and <a href="Tanganyika">Tanganyika</a>. In June, he was part of a KCA team which appeared before a <a href="select%20committee">select committee</a> of the <a href="Legislative%20Council%20of%20Kenya">Kenyan Legislative Council</a> to express concerns about the recent introduction of Land Boards. Introduced by the British <a href="Governor%20of%20Kenya">Governor of Kenya</a>, <a href="Edward%20Grigg%2C%201st%20Baron%20Altrincham">Edward Grigg</a>, these Land Boards would hold all land in native reserves in trust for each tribal group. Both the KCA and the <a href="Kikuyu%20Association">Kikuyu Association</a> opposed these Land Boards, which treated Kikuyu land as collectively-owned rather than recognising individual Kikuyu land ownership. Also in February, his daughter, Wambui Margaret, was born. 
By this point he was increasingly using the name "Kenyatta", which had a more African appearance than "Johnstone".

In May 1928, the KCA launched a Kikuyu-language magazine, "Muĩgwithania" (roughly translated as "The Reconciler" or "The Unifier"), in which it published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and raise funds for the KCA. Kenyatta was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating into Kikuyu. Aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism, Kenyatta's took a cautious approach to campaigning, and in "Muĩgwithania" he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: "The first thing [about the Empire] is that all people are governed justly, big or small – equally. The second thing is that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered." This did not prevent Grigg from writing to the authorities in London requesting permission to shut the magazine down.

After the KCA raised sufficient funds, in February 1929 Kenyatta sailed from <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a> to Britain. Grigg's administration could not stop Kenyatta's journey but asked London's <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a> not to meet with him. He initially stayed at the <a href="West%20African%20Students%27%20Union">West African Students' Union</a> premises in <a href="West%20London%20%28sub%20region%29">West London</a>, where he met <a href="Ladipo%20Solanke">Ladipo Solanke</a>. He then lodged with a prostitute; both this and Kenyatta's lavish spending brought concern from the Church Mission Society. His landlord subsequently impounded his belongings due to unpaid debt. In the city, Kenyatta met with <a href="W.%20McGregor%20Ross">W. McGregor Ross</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Empire%20Society">Royal Empire Society</a>, Ross briefing him on how to deal with the Colonial Office. Kenyatta became friends with Ross' family, and accompanied them to social events in <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>. He also contacted anti-imperialists active in Britain, including the <a href="League%20Against%20Imperialism">League Against Imperialism</a>, <a href="Fenner%20Brockway">Fenner Brockway</a>, and <a href="Kingsley%20Martin">Kingsley Martin</a>. Grigg was in London at the same time and, despite his opposition to Kenyatta's visit, agreed to meet with him at the <a href="Rhodes%20Trust">Rhodes Trust</a> headquarters in April. At the meeting, Kenyatta raised the land issue and Thuku's exile, the atmosphere between the two being friendly. In spite of this, following the meeting, Grigg convinced <a href="Special%20Branch">Special Branch</a> to monitor Kenyatta.

Kenyatta developed contacts with radicals to the left of the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>, including several <a href="Communism">communists</a>. In the summer of 1929, he left London and travelled by <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> to <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> before returning to London in October. Kenyatta was strongly influenced by his time in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Back in England, he wrote three articles on the Kenyan situation for the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a>'s newspapers, the "<a href="Morning%20Star%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Daily Worker</a>" and "Sunday Worker". In these, his criticism of British imperialism was far stronger than it had been in "Muĩgwithania". These communist links concerned many of Kenyatta's <a href="liberalism">liberal</a> patrons. In January, Kenyatta met with <a href="Drummond%20Shiels">Drummond Shiels</a>, the <a href="Under-Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>, at the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>. Kenyatta told Shiels that he was not affiliated with communist circles and was unaware of the nature of the newspaper which published his articles. Shiels advised Kenyatta to return home to promote Kikuyu involvement in the constitutional process and discourage violence and extremism. 
After eighteen months in Europe, Kenyatta had run out of money. The <a href="Anti-Slavery%20International">Anti-Slavery Society</a> advanced him funds to pay off his debts and return to Kenya. Although Kenyatta enjoyed life in London and feared arrest if he returned home, he sailed back to Mombasa in September 1930. On his return, his prestige among the Kikuyu was high because of his time spent in Europe.

In his absence, <a href="female%20genital%20mutilation">female genital mutilation</a> (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, <a href="Campaign%20against%20female%20genital%20mutilation%20in%20colonial%20Kenya">supported the abolition of this traditional practice</a>, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would damage the structure of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of an American missionary, <a href="Hulda%20Stumpf">Hulda Stumpf</a>, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta met with church representatives. He expressed the view that although personally opposing FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and argued that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through educating people about its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and <a href="John%20Arthur">John Arthur</a>—the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya—later expelled Kenyatta from the church, citing what he deemed dishonesty during the debate. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.

In May 1931, Kenyatta and <a href="Parmenas%20Mockerie">Parmenas Mockerie</a> sailed for Britain, intent on representing the KCA at a <a href="Joint%20Committee%20of%20Parliament">Joint Committee of Parliament</a> on the future of East Africa. Kenyatta would not return to Kenya for fifteen years. In Britain, he spent the summer attending an <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a> <a href="summer%20school">summer school</a> and <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a> gatherings. In June, he visited <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, Switzerland to attend a <a href="Save%20the%20Children">Save the Children</a> conference on African children. In November, he met the Indian independence leader <a href="Mohandas%20Gandhi">Mohandas Gandhi</a> while in London. That month, he enrolled in the <a href="Woodbrooke%20Quaker%20Study%20Centre">Woodbrooke Quaker College</a> in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, where he remained until the spring of 1932, attaining a certificate in English writing.

In Britain, Kenyatta befriended an Afro-Caribbean Marxist, <a href="George%20Padmore">George Padmore</a>, who was working for the Soviet-run <a href="Comintern">Comintern</a>. Over time, he became Padmore's protégé. In late 1932, he joined Padmore in Germany. Before the end of the year, the duo relocated to Moscow, where Kenyatta studied at the <a href="Communist%20University%20of%20the%20Toilers%20of%20the%20East">Communist University of the Toilers of the East</a>. There he was taught arithmetic, geography, natural science, and political economy, as well as <a href="Marxism-Leninism">Marxist-Leninist</a> doctrine and the history of the Marxist-Leninist movement. Many Africans and members of the African diaspora were attracted to the institution because it offered free education and the opportunity to study in an environment where they were treated with dignity, free from the <a href="institutionalised%20racism">institutionalised racism</a> present in the U.S. and British Empire. Kenyatta complained about the food, accommodation, and poor quality of English instruction. There is no evidence that he joined the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, and one of his fellow students later characterised him as "the biggest reactionary I have ever met." Kenyatta also visited <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, probably as part of an official guided tour.

The emergence of Germany's <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi</a> government shifted political allegiances in Europe; the Soviet Union pursued formal alliances with France and Czechoslovakia, and thus reduced its support for the movement against British and French colonial rule in Africa. As a result, Comintern disbanded the <a href="International%20Trade%20Union%20Committee%20of%20Negro%20Workers">International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers</a>, with which both Padmore and Kenyatta were affiliated. Padmore resigned from the Soviet Communist Party in protest, and was subsequently vilified in the Soviet press. Both Padmore and Kenyatta left the Soviet Union, the latter returning to London in August 1933. The British authorities were highly suspicious of Kenyatta's time in the Soviet Union, suspecting that he was a Marxist-Leninist, and following his return the <a href="MI5">MI5</a> intelligence service intercepted and read all of his mail.

Kenyatta continued writing articles, reflecting Padmore's influence. Between 1931 and 1937 he wrote several articles for the "<a href="Negro%20Worker">Negro Worker</a>" and joined the newspaper's editorial board in 1933. He also produced an article for a November 1933 issue of "<a href="Labour%20Monthly">Labour Monthly</a>", and in May 1934 had a letter published in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>". He also wrote the entry on Kenya for "Negro", an anthology edited by <a href="Nancy%20Cunard">Nancy Cunard</a> and published in 1934. In these, he took a more radical position than he had in the past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually alone among political Kenyans; figures like Thuku and <a href="Jesse%20Kariuki">Jesse Kariuki</a> were far more moderate in their demands. The pro-independence sentiments that he was able to express in Britain would not have been permitted in Kenya itself.

Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta worked as a <a href="Informant%20%28linguistics%29">linguistic informant</a> for the Phonetics Department at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> (UCL); his Kikuyu voice recordings assisted <a href="Lilias%20Armstrong">Lilias Armstrong</a>'s production of "The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu". The book was published under Armstrong's name, although Kenyatta claimed he should have been listed as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a <a href="phonetics">phonetics</a> course from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled by a grant from the <a href="International%20African%20Institute">International African Institute</a>, he also took a <a href="social%20anthropology">social anthropology</a> course under <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Malinowski">Bronisław Malinowski</a> at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a> (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white Europeans.
Over the course of his studies, Kenyatta and Malinowski became close friends. Fellow course-mates included the anthropologists <a href="Audrey%20Richards">Audrey Richards</a>, <a href="Lucy%20Mair">Lucy Mair</a>, and <a href="Elspeth%20Huxley">Elspeth Huxley</a>. Another of his fellow LSE students was <a href="Prince%20Peter%20of%20Greece%20and%20Denmark">Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark</a>, who invited Kenyatta to stay with him and his mother, <a href="Princess%20Marie%20Bonaparte">Princess Marie Bonaparte</a>, in Paris during the spring of 1936.

Kenyatta returned to his former dwellings at 95 Cambridge Street, but did not pay his landlady for over a year, owing over £100 in rent. This angered Ross and contributed to the breakdown of their friendship. He then rented a <a href="Camden%20Town">Camden Town</a> flat with his friend Dinah Snock, whom he met at an anti-imperialist rally in <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a>. Kenyatta socialised at the <a href="Student%20Movement%20House">Student Movement House</a> in <a href="Russell%20Square">Russell Square</a>, which he had joined in the spring of 1934, and befriended Africans in the city. To earn money, he worked as one of 250 black <a href="Extra%20%28acting%29">extras</a> in the film "<a href="Sanders%20of%20the%20River">Sanders of the River</a>", filmed at <a href="Shepperton%20Studios">Shepperton Studios</a> in Autumn 1934. Several other Africans in London criticised him for doing so, arguing that the film degraded black people. Appearing in the film also allowed him to meet and befriend its star, the African-American <a href="Paul%20Robeson">Paul Robeson</a>.

In 1935, <a href="Second%20Italo-Ethiopian%20War">Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia)</a>, incensing Kenyatta and other Africans in London; he became the honorary secretary of the <a href="International%20African%20Friends%20of%20Abyssinia">International African Friends of Abyssinia</a>, a group established by Padmore and <a href="C.%20L.%20R.%20James">C. L. R. James</a>. When Ethiopia's monarch <a href="Haile%20Selassie">Haile Selassie</a> fled to London in exile, Kenyatta personally welcomed him at <a href="London%20Waterloo%20station">Waterloo station</a>. This group developed into a wider <a href="pan-Africanism">pan-Africanist</a> organisation, the <a href="International%20African%20Service%20Bureau">International African Service Bureau</a> (IASB), of which Kenyatta became one of the vice chairs. Kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across Britain for groups like the IASB, the <a href="Workers%27%20Educational%20Association">Workers' Educational Association</a>, <a href="British%20Committee%20of%20the%20Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress of Great Britain</a>, and the <a href="League%20of%20Coloured%20Peoples">League of Coloured Peoples</a>. In October 1938, he gave a talk to the Manchester Fabian Society in which he described British colonial policy as <a href="fascism">fascism</a> and compared the treatment of indigenous people in East Africa to the <a href="Anti-Jewish%20legislation%20in%20prewar%20Nazi%20Germany">treatment of Jews</a> in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. In response to these activities, the British Colonial Office reopened their file on him, although could not find any evidence that he was engaged in anything sufficiently seditious to warrant prosecution.

Kenyatta assembled the essays on Kikuyu society written for Malinowski's class and published them as "<a href="Facing%20Mount%20Kenya">Facing Mount Kenya</a>" in 1938. Featuring an introduction written by Malinowski, the book reflected Kenyatta's desire to use anthropology as a weapon against colonialism. In it, Kenyatta challenged the Eurocentric view of history by presenting an image of a golden African past by emphasising the perceived order, virtue, and self-sufficiency of Kikuyu society. Utilising a <a href="structural%20functionalism">functionalist</a> framework, he promoted the idea that traditional Kikuyu society had a cohesion and integrity that was better than anything offered by European colonialism. In this book, Kenyatta made clear his belief that the rights of the individual should be downgraded in favour of the interests of the group. The book also reflected his changing views on female genital mutilation; where once he opposed it, he now unequivocally supported the practice, downplaying the medical dangers that it posed to women.

The book's jacket cover featured an image of Kenyatta in traditional dress, wearing a skin cloak over one shoulder and carrying a spear. The book was published under the name "Jomo Kenyatta", the first time that he had done so; the term "Jomo" was close to a Kikuyu word describing the removal of a sword from its scabbard. "Facing Mount Kenya" was a commercial failure, selling only 517 copies, but was generally well received; an exception was among white Kenyans, whose assumptions about the Kikuyu being primitive savages in need of European civilisation it challenged. Murray-Brown later described it as "a propaganda "tour de force". No other African had made such an uncompromising stand for tribal integrity." Bodil Folke Frederiksen, a scholar of <a href="development%20studies">development studies</a>, referred to it as "probably the most well-known and influential African scholarly work of its time", while for fellow scholar Simon Gikandi, it was "one of the major texts in what has come to be known as the invention of tradition in colonial Africa".

After the United Kingdom entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in September 1939, Kenyatta and Stock moved to the <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> village of <a href="Storrington">Storrington</a>. Kenyatta remained there for the duration of the war, renting a flat and a small plot of land to grow vegetables and raise chickens. He settled into rural Sussex life, and became a regular at the village pub, where he gained the nickname "Jumbo". In August 1940, he took a job at a local farm as an agricultural worker—allowing him to evade <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">military conscription</a>—before working in the tomato greenhouses at <a href="Lindfield%2C%20West%20Sussex">Lindfield</a>. He attempted to join the local <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a>, but was turned down. On 11 May 1942 he married an English woman, Edna Grace Clarke, at <a href="Register%20office%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chanctonbury Registry Office</a>. In August 1943, their son, Peter Magana, was born.

Intelligence services continued monitoring Kenyatta, noting that he was politically inactive between 1939 and 1944. In Sussex, he wrote an essay for the <a href="United%20Society%20for%20Christian%20Literature">United Society for Christian Literature</a>, "My People of Kikuyu and the Life of Chief Wangombe", in which he called for his tribe's political independence. He also began—although never finished—a novel partly based on his life experiences. He continued to give lectures around the country, including to groups of East African soldiers stationed in Britain. He became frustrated by the distance between him and Kenya, telling Edna that he felt "like a general separated by 5000 miles from his troops". While he was absent, Kenya's authorities banned the KCA in 1940.

Kenyatta and other senior IASB members began planning the fifth <a href="Pan-African%20Congress">Pan-African Congress</a>, held in Manchester in October 1945. They were assisted by <a href="Kwame%20Nkrumah">Kwame Nkrumah</a>, a <a href="Gold%20Coast%20%28British%20colony%29">Gold Coast</a> (Ghanaian) who arrived in Britain earlier that year. Kenyatta spoke at the conference, although made no particular impact on the proceedings. Much of the debate that took place centred on whether indigenous Africans should continue pursuing a gradual campaign for independence or whether they should seek the military overthrow of the European imperialists. The conference ended with a statement declaring that while delegates desired a peaceful transition to African self-rule, Africans "as a last resort, may have to appeal to force in the effort to achieve Freedom". Kenyatta supported this resolution, although was more cautious than other delegates and made no open commitment to violence. He subsequently authored an IASB pamphlet, "Kenya: The Land of Conflict", in which he blended political calls for independence with romanticised descriptions of an idealised pre-colonial African past.

After British victory in World War II, Kenyatta received a request to return to Kenya in September 1946, sailing back that month. He decided not to bring Edna—who was pregnant with a second child—with him, aware that if they joined him in Kenya their lives would be made very difficult by the colony's racial laws. On his arrival in Mombasa, Kenyatta was greeted by his first wife and their children. He built a bungalow at <a href="Gatundu">Gatundu</a>, near to where he was born, and began farming his 32-acre estate. Kenyatta met with the new Governor of Kenya, <a href="Philip%20Euen%20Mitchell">Philip Euen Mitchell</a>, and in March 1947 accepted a post on an African Land Settlement Board, holding the post for two years. He also met with <a href="Mbiyu%20Koinange">Mbiyu Koinange</a> to discuss the future of the <a href="Koinange%20Independent%20Teachers%27%20College">Koinange Independent Teachers' College</a> in <a href="Githungui">Githungui</a>, Koinange appointing Kenyatta as its Vice-Principal. In May 1947, Koinange moved to England, leaving Kenyatta to take full control of the college. Under Kenyatta's leadership, additional funds were raised for the construction of school buildings and the number of boys in attendance rose from 250 to 900. It was also beset with problems, including a decline in standards and teachers' strikes over non-payment of wages. Gradually, the number of enrolled pupils fell. Kenyatta built a friendship with Koinange's father, a Senior Chief, who gave Kenyatta one of his daughters to take as his third wife.
She bore him another child, but later died in childbirth. In 1951, he married his fourth wife, <a href="Ngina%20Kenyatta">Ngina</a>, who was one of the few female students at his college; she then gave birth to a daughter.

In August 1944, the <a href="Kenya%20African%20Union">Kenya African Union</a> (KAU) had been founded; at that time it was the only active political outlet for indigenous Africans in the colony. At its June 1947 <a href="annual%20general%20meeting">annual general meeting</a>, KAU's President <a href="James%20Gichuru">James Gichuru</a> stepped down and Kenyatta was elected as his replacement. Kenyatta began to draw large crowds wherever he travelled in Kikuyuland, and Kikuyu press began describing him as the "Saviour", "Great Elder", and "Hero of Our Race". He was nevertheless aware that to achieve independence, KAU needed the support of other indigenous tribes and ethnic groups. This was made difficult by the fact that many Maasai and <a href="Luo%20people%20of%20Kenya%20and%20Tanzania">Luo</a>—tribes traditionally hostile to the Kikuyu—regarded him as an advocate of Kikuyu dominance. He insisted on intertribal representation on the KAU executive and ensured that party business was conducted in <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>, the "lingua franca" of indigenous Kenyans.

To attract support from Kenya's Indian community, he made contact with <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, the first <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20India">Prime Minister</a> of the new Indian republic. Nehru's response was supportive, sending a message to Kenya's Indian minority reminding them that they were the guests of the indigenous African population. Relations with the white minority remained strained; for most white Kenyans, Kenyatta was their principal enemy, an agitator with links to the Soviet Union who had the impertinence to marry a white woman. They too increasingly called for further Kenyan autonomy from the British government, but wanted continued white-minority rule and closer links to the white-minority governments of South Africa, <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a>, and <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>; they viewed Britain's <a href="Attlee%20ministry">newly elected Labour government</a> with great suspicion. The white Electors' Union put forward a "Kenya Plan" which proposed greater white settlement in Kenya, bringing Tanganyika into the British Empire, and incorporating it within their new <a href="British%20East%20African%20Dominion">British East African Dominion</a>. In April 1950, Kenyatta was present at a joint meeting of KAU and the <a href="East%20African%20Indian%20National%20Congress">East African Indian National Congress</a> in which they both expressed opposition to the Kenya Plan.

By 1952, Kenyatta was widely recognised as a national leader, both by his supporters and his opponents. As KAU leader, he was at pains to oppose all illegal activity, including workers' strikes. He called on his supporters to work hard, and to abandon laziness, theft, and crime. He also insisted that in an independent Kenya, all racial groups would be safeguarded. Kenyatta's gradualist and peaceful approach contrasted with the growth of the <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Mau Mau Uprising</a>, as armed guerrilla groups began targeting the white minority and members of the Kikuyu community who did not support them. By 1959, the Mau Mau had killed around 1,880 people. For many young Mau Mau militants, Kenyatta was regarded as a hero, and they included his name in the oaths they gave to the organisation; such oathing was a Kikuyu custom by which individuals pledged allegiance to another. Kenyatta publicly distanced himself from the Mau Mau. In April 1952, he began a speaking tour in which he denounced the Mau Mau to assembled crowds, insisting that independence must be achieved through peaceful means. In August he attended a much-publicised mass meeting in Kiambu where—in front of 30,000 people—he said that "Mau Mau has spoiled the country. Let Mau Mau perish forever. All people should search for Mau Mau and kill it." Despite Kenyatta's vocal opposition to the Mau Mau, KAU had moved towards a position of greater militancy. At its 1951 AGM, more militant African nationalists had taken senior positions and the party officially announced its call for Kenyan independence within three years. In January 1952, KAU members formed a secret Central Committee devoted to direct action, formulated along a <a href="Clandestine%20cell%20system">cell structure</a>. Whatever Kenyatta's views on these developments, he had little ability to control them. He was increasingly frustrated, and—without the intellectual companionship he experienced in Britain—felt lonely.

In October 1952, Kenyatta was arrested and driven to Nairobi, where he was taken aboard a plane and flown to <a href="Lokitaung">Lokitaung</a>, northwest Kenya, one of the most remote locations in the country. From there he wrote to his family to let them know of his situation. Kenya's authorities believed that detaining Kenyatta would help quell civil unrest. Many white settlers wanted him exiled, but the government feared this would turn him into a martyr for the anti-colonialist cause. They thought it better that he be convicted and imprisoned, although at the time had nothing to charge him with, and so began searching his personal files for evidence of criminal activity. Eventually, they charged him and five senior KAU members with masterminding the Mau Mau, a proscribed group. The historian John M. Lonsdale stated that Kenyatta had been made a "scapegoat", while the historian A. B. Assensoh later suggested that the authorities "knew very well" that Kenyatta was not involved in the Mau Mau, but that they were nevertheless committed to silencing his calls for independence.

The trial took place in <a href="Kapenguria">Kapenguria</a>, a remote area near the Ugandan border that the authorities hoped would not attract crowds or attention. Together, Kenyatta, <a href="Bildad%20Kaggia">Bildad Kaggia</a>, <a href="Fred%20Kubai">Fred Kubai</a>, <a href="Paul%20Ngei">Paul Ngei</a>, <a href="Achieng%20Oneko">Achieng Oneko</a> and <a href="Kung%27u%20Karumba">Kung'u Karumba</a>—the "<a href="Kapenguria%20Six">Kapenguria Six</a>"—were put on trial. The defendants assembled an international and multiracial team of defence lawyers, including <a href="Chaman%20Lall">Chaman Lall</a>, <a href="H.%20O.%20Davies">H. O. Davies</a>, <a href="Fitz%20Remedios%20Santana%20de%20Souza">F. R. S. De Souza</a>, and <a href="Dudley%20Thompson">Dudley Thompson</a>, led by British barrister and Member of Parliament <a href="Denis%20Nowell%20Pritt">Denis Nowell Pritt</a>. Pritt's involvement brought much media attention; during the trial he faced government harassment and was sent death threats. The judge selected, <a href="Ransley%20Thacker">Ransley Thacker</a>, had recently retired from the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Kenya">Supreme Court of Kenya</a>; the government knew he would be sympathetic to their case and gave him £20,000 to oversee it. The trial lasted five months: <a href="Rawson%20Macharia">Rawson Macharia</a>, the main prosecution witness, turned out to have perjured himself; the judge had only recently been awarded an unusually large pension and maintained secret contact with the then colonial Governor <a href="Evelyn%20Baring%2C%201st%20Baron%20Howick%20of%20Glendale">Evelyn Baring</a>. The prosecution failed to produce any strong evidence that Kenyatta or the other accused had any involvement in managing the Mau Mau.

In April 1953, Judge Thacker found the defendants guilty. He sentenced them to seven years' <a href="hard%20labour">hard labour</a>, to be followed by indefinite restriction preventing them from leaving a given area without permission. In addressing the court, Kenyatta stated that he and the others did not recognise the judge's findings; they claimed that the government had used them as scapegoats as a pretext to shut down KAU. The historian Wunyabari O. Maloba later characterised it as "a rigged political trial with a predetermined outcome". The government followed the verdict with a wider crackdown, banning KAU in June 1953, and closing down most of the independent schools in the country, including Kenyatta's. It appropriated his land at Gatundu and demolished his house.

Kenyatta and the others were returned to Lokitaung, where they resided on <a href="Remand%20%28detention%29">remand</a> while awaiting the results of the <a href="appeal">appeal</a> process. Pritt pointed out that Thacker had been appointed magistrate for the wrong district, a technicality voiding the whole trial; the Supreme Court of Kenya concurred and Kenyatta and the others were freed in July 1953, only to be immediately re-arrested. The government took the case to the <a href="East%20African%20Court%20of%20Appeal">East African Court of Appeal</a>, which reversed the Supreme Court's decision in August. The appeals process resumed in October 1953, and in January 1954 the Supreme Court upheld the convictions against all but Oneko. Pritt finally took the case to the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> in London, but they refused his petition without providing an explanation. He later noted that this was despite the fact his case was one of the strongest he had ever presented during his career. According to Murray-Brown, it is likely that political, rather than legal considerations, informed their decision to reject the case.

During the appeal process, a prison had been built at Lokitaung, where Kenyatta and the four others were then interned. The others were made to break rocks in the hot sun but Kenyatta, because of his age, was instead appointed their cook, preparing a daily diet of beans and <a href="mielie-meal">mielie-meal</a>. In 1955, <a href="P.%20de%20Robeck">P. de Robeck</a> became the District Officer, after which Kenyatta and the other inmates were treated more leniently. In April 1954, they had been joined by a captured Mau Mau commander, <a href="Waruhiu%20Itote">Waruhiu Itote</a>; Kenyatta befriended him, and gave him English lessons. By 1957, the inmates had formed into two rival cliques, with Kenyatta and Itote on one side and the other KAU members—now calling themselves the "National Democratic Party"—on the other. In one incident, one of his rivals made an unsuccessful attempt to stab Kenyatta at breakfast. Kenyatta's health had deteriorated in prison; manacles had caused problems for his feet and he had <a href="eczema">eczema</a> across his body.

Kenyatta's imprisonment transformed him into a political martyr for many Kenyans, further enhancing his status. A Luo anti-colonial activist, <a href="Jaramogi%20Oginga%20Odinga">Jaramogi Oginga Odinga</a>, was the first to publicly call for Kenyatta's release, an issue that gained growing support among Kenya's anti-colonialists. In 1955, the British writer <a href="Montagu%20Slater">Montagu Slater</a>—a socialist sympathetic to Kenyatta's plight—released "The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta", a book which raised the profile of the case. In 1958, Rawson Macharia, the key witness in the state's prosecution of Kenyatta, signed an affidavit swearing that his evidence against Kenyatta had been false; this was widely publicised. By the late 1950s, the imprisoned Kenyatta had become a symbol of African nationalism across the continent.

His sentence served, in April 1959 Kenyatta was released from Lokitaung. The administration then placed a restricting order on Kenyatta, forcing him to reside in the remote area of <a href="Lodwar">Lodwar</a>, where he had to report to the district commissioner twice a day. There, he was joined by his wife Ngina. In October 1961 she bore him another son, <a href="Uhuru%20Kenyatta">Uhuru</a>, and later on another daughter, Nyokabi, and a further son, Muhoho. Kenyatta spent two years in Lodwar. The Governor of Kenya, <a href="Patrick%20Muir%20Renison">Patrick Muir Renison</a>, insisted that it was necessary; in a March 1961 speech, he described Kenyatta an "African leader to darkness and death" and stated that if he were released, violence would erupt.

This indefinite detention was widely interpreted internationally as a reflection of the cruelties of British imperialism. Calls for his release came from the Chinese government, India's Nehru, and Tanganyika's Prime Minister <a href="Julius%20Nyerere">Julius Nyerere</a>. Kwame Nkrumah—whom Kenyatta had known since the 1940s and who was now President of a newly independent Ghana—personally raised the issue with British Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a> and other UK officials, with the Ghanaian government offering Kenyatta asylum in the event of his release. Resolutions calling for his release were produced at the <a href="All-African%20Peoples%27%20Conference">All-African Peoples' Conference</a>s held in <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> in 1960 and <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> in 1961. Internal calls for his release came from Kenyan Asian activists in the <a href="Kenya%20Indian%20Congress">Kenya Indian Congress</a>, while a colonial government commissioned poll revealed that most of Kenya's indigenous Africans wanted this outcome.

By this point, it was widely accepted that Kenyan independence was inevitable, the British Empire having been dismantled throughout much of Asia and Macmillan having made his "<a href="Wind%20of%20Change%20%28speech%29">Wind of Change</a>" speech. In January 1960, the British government made its intention to free Kenya apparent. It invited representatives of Kenya's anti-colonial movement to <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Conferences%20%28Kenya%29">discuss the transition</a> at London's <a href="Lancaster%20House">Lancaster House</a>. An agreement was reached that an election would be called for a new 65-seat Legislative Council, with 33 seats reserved for black Africans, 20 for other ethnic groups, and 12 as 'national members' elected by a pan-racial electorate. It was clear to all concerned that Kenyatta was going to be the key to the future of Kenyan politics.

After the Lancaster House negotiations, the anti-colonial movement had split into two parties, the <a href="Kenya%20African%20National%20Union">Kenya African National Union</a> (KANU), which was dominated by Kikuyu and Luo, and the <a href="Kenya%20African%20Democratic%20Union">Kenya African Democratic Union</a> (KADU), which was led largely by members of smaller ethnic groups like the Kalenjin and Maasai. In May 1960, KANU nominated Kenyatta as its President, although the government vetoed it, insisting that he had been an instigator of the Mau Mau. KANU then declared that it would refuse to take part in any government unless Kenyatta was freed. KANU campaigned on the issue of Kenyatta's detainment in the <a href="Kenyan%20general%20election%2C%201961">February 1961 election</a>, where it gained a majority of votes. KANU nevertheless refused to form a government, which was instead created through a KADU-led coalition of smaller parties. Kenyatta had kept abreast of these developments, although he had refused to back either KANU or KADU, instead insisting on unity between the two parties.

Renison decided to release Kenyatta before Kenya achieved independence. He thought public exposure to Kenyatta prior to elections would make the populace less likely to vote for a man Renison regarded as a violent extremist. In April 1961, the government flew Kenyatta to <a href="Maralal">Maralal</a>, where he maintained his innocence of the charges but told reporters that he bore no grudges. He reiterated that he had never supported violence or the illegal oathing system used by the Mau Mau, and denied having ever been a Marxist, stating: "I shall always remain an African Nationalist to the end". In August, he was moved to Gatundu in Kikuyuland, where he was greeted by a crowd of 10,000. There, the colonial government had built him a new house to replace that they had demolished. Now a free man, he travelled to cities like Nairobi and Mombasa to make public appearances.
After his release, Kenyatta set about trying to ensure that he was the only realistic option as Kenya's future leader. In August he met with Renison at Kiambu, and was interviewed by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="Face%20to%20Face%20%28British%20TV%20series%29">Face to Face</a>". In October 1961, Kenyatta formally joined KANU and accepted its presidency. In January 1962 he was elected unopposed as KANU's representative for the <a href="Murang%27a">Fort Hall</a> constituency in the legislative council after its sitting member, <a href="Kariuki%20Njiiri">Kariuki Njiiri</a>, resigned.

Kenyatta travelled elsewhere in Africa, visiting Tanganyika in October 1961 and Ethiopia in November at the invite of their governments. A key issue facing Kenya was a border dispute in <a href="North%20Eastern%20Province%20%28Kenya%29">North East Province</a>, alongside Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region and claimed it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta disagreed, insisting the land remain Kenyan. In June 1962, Kenyatta travelled to <a href="Mogadishu">Mogadishu</a> to discuss the issue with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.

Kenyatta sought to gain the confidence of the white settler community. In 1962, the white minority had produced 80% of the country's exports and were a vital part of its economy, yet between 1962 and 1963 they were emigrating at a rate of 700 a month; Kenyatta feared that this white exodus would cause a <a href="brain%20drain">brain drain</a> and <a href="Labour%20shortage">skills shortage</a> that would be detrimental to the economy. He was also aware that the confidence of the white minority would be crucial to securing Western investment in Kenya's economy. Kenyatta made it clear that when in power, he would not sack any white civil servants unless there were competent black individuals capable of replacing them. He was sufficiently successful that several prominent white Kenyans backed KANU in the subsequent election.

In 1962 he returned to London to attend one of the Lancaster House conferences. There, KANU and KADU representatives met with British officials to formulate a new constitution. KADU desired a federalist state organised on a system they called "<a href="Majimbo">Majimbo</a>" with six largely autonomous regional authorities, a two-chamber legislature, and a central Federal Council of Ministers who would select a rotating chair to serve as head of government for a one-year term. Renison's administration and most white settlers favoured this system as it would prevent a strong central government implementing radical reform. KANU opposed "Majimbo", believing that it served entrenched interests and denied equal opportunities across Kenya; they also insisted on an elected head of government. At Kenyatta's prompting, KANU conceded to some of KADU's demands; he was aware that he could amend the constitution when in office. The new constitution divided Kenya into six regions, each with a regional assembly, but also featured a strong central government and both an upper and lower house. It was agreed that a temporary coalition government would be established until independence, several KANU politicians being given ministerial posts. Kenyatta accepted a minor position, that of the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs and Economic Planning.

The British government considered Renison too ill at ease with indigenous Africans to oversee the transition to independence and thus replaced him with <a href="Malcolm%20MacDonald">Malcolm MacDonald</a> as Governor of Kenya in January 1963. MacDonald and Kenyatta developed a strong friendship; the Briton referred to the latter as "the wisest and perhaps strongest as well as most popular potential Prime Minister of the independent nation to be". MacDonald sped up plans for Kenyan independence, believing that the longer the wait, the greater the opportunity for radicalisation among African nationalists. An election was scheduled for May, with self-government in June, followed by full independence in December.

The <a href="Kenyan%20general%20election%2C%201963">May 1963 general election</a> pitted Kenyatta's KANU against KADU, the <a href="Akamba%20People%27s%20Party">Akamba People's Party</a>, and various independent candidates. KANU was victorious with 83 seats out of 124 in the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Kenya%29">House of Representatives</a>; a KANU majority government replaced the pre-existing coalition. On 1 June 1963, Kenyatta was sworn in as prime minister of the autonomous Kenyan government. Kenya remained a monarchy, with Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> as its head of state. In November 1963, Kenyatta's government introduced a law making it a criminal offence to disrespect the Prime Minister, exile being the punishment. Kenyatta's personality became a central aspect of the creation of the new state. In December, Nairobi's Delamere Avenue was renamed Kenyatta Avenue, and a bronze statue of him was erected beside the country's <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Kenya%29">National Assembly</a>. Photographs of Kenyatta were widely displayed in shop windows, and his face was also printed on the new currency. In 1964, <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> published a collection of Kenyatta's speeches under the title of "Harambee!".

Kenya's first cabinet included not only Kikuyu but also members of the Luo, Kamba, Kisii, and Maragoli tribal groups.
In June 1963, Kenyatta met with Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President <a href="Milton%20Obote">Milton Obote</a> in Nairobi. The trio discussed the possibility of merging their three nations (plus Zanzibar) into a single <a href="East%20African%20Federation">East African Federation</a>, agreeing that this would be accomplished by the end of the year. Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass. Many radical voices in Kenya urged him to pursue the project; in May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this was true.

Continuing to emphasise good relations with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at <a href="Nakuru">Nakuru</a>. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. Throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals remained out of work, unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.

A celebration to mark independence was held in a specially constructed stadium on 12 December 1963. During the ceremony, <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>—representing the British monarchy—formally handed over control of the country to Kenyatta. Also in attendance were leading figures from the Mau Mau. In a speech, Kenyatta described it as "the greatest day in Kenya's history and the happiest day in my life." He had flown Edna and Peter over for the ceremony, and in Kenya they were welcomed into Kenyatta's family by his other wives.

Disputes with Somalia over the Northern Frontier District (NFD) continued; for much of Kenyatta's rule, Somalia remained the major threat to his government. To deal with sporadic violence in the region by Somali "<a href="shifta">shifta</a>" guerrillas, Kenyatta sent soldiers into the region in December 1963 and gave them broad powers of arrest and seizure in the NFD in September 1964. British troops were assigned to assist the Kenyan Army in the region. Kenyatta also faced domestic opposition: in January 1964, sections of the army launched a mutiny in Nairobi, and Kenyatta called on the British Army to put down the rebellion. Similar armed uprisings had taken place that month in neighbouring Uganda and Tanganyika. Kenyatta was outraged and shaken by the mutiny. He publicly rebuked the mutineers, emphasising the need for law and order in Kenya. To prevent further military unrest, he brought in a review of the salaries of the army, police, and prison staff, leading to pay rises. Kenyatta also wanted to contain parliamentary opposition and at Kenyatta's prompting, in November 1964 KADU officially dissolved and its representatives joined KANU. Two of the senior members of KADU, <a href="Ronald%20Ngala">Ronald Ngala</a> and <a href="Daniel%20arap%20Moi">Daniel arap Moi</a>, subsequently became some of Kenyatta's most loyal supporters. Kenya therefore became a "de facto" one-party state.

In December 1964, Kenya was officially proclaimed a republic. Kenyatta became its executive president, combining the roles of <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>. Over the course of 1965 and 1966, several constitutional amendments enhanced the president's power. For instance, a May 1966 amendment gave the president the ability to order the detention of individuals without trial if he thought the security of the state was threatened. Seeking the support of Kenya's second largest ethnic group, the Luo, Kenyatta appointed the Luo Oginga Odinga as his Vice President. The Kikuyu—who made up around 20 percent of population—still held most of the country's important government and administrative positions. This contributed to a perception among many Kenyans that independence had simply seen the dominance of a British elite replaced by the dominance of a Kikuyu elite.

Kenyatta's calls to forgive and forget the past were a keystone of his government. He preserved some elements of the old colonial order, particularly in relation to [Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. The police and military structures were left largely intact. White Kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white Kenyans <a href="Bruce%20Mackenzie">Bruce Mackenzie</a> and <a href="Humphrey%20Slade">Humphrey Slade</a> being among Kenyatta's top officials. Kenyatta's government nevertheless rejected the idea that the European and Asian minorities could be permitted <a href="dual%20citizenship">dual citizenship</a>, expecting these communities to offer total loyalty to the independent Kenyan state. His administration pressured whites-only social clubs to adopt multi-racial entry policies, and in 1964 schools formerly reserved for European pupils were opened to Africans and Asians.

Kenyatta's government believed it necessary to cultivate a united Kenyan national culture. To this end, it made efforts to assert the dignity of indigenous African cultures which missionaries and colonial authorities had belittled as "primitive". An <a href="East%20African%20Literature%20Bureau">East African Literature Bureau</a> was created to publish the work of indigenous writers. The <a href="Kenya%20Cultural%20Centre">Kenya Cultural Centre</a> supported indigenous art and music, and hundreds of traditional music and dance groups were formed; Kenyatta personally insisted that such performances were held at all national celebrations. Support was given to the preservation of historic and cultural monuments, while street names referencing colonial figures were renamed and symbols of colonialism—like the statue of British settler <a href="Hugh%20Cholmondeley%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Delamere">Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere</a> in Nairobi city centre—were removed. The government encouraged the use of Swahili as a national language, although English remained the main medium for parliamentary debates and the language of instruction in schools and universities. The historian Robert M. Maxon nevertheless suggested that "no national culture emerged during the Kenyatta era", most artistic and cultural expressions reflecting particular ethnic groups rather than a broader sense of Kenyanness, while Western culture remained heavily influential over the country's elites.

Independent Kenya had an economy heavily moulded by colonial rule; agriculture dominated while industry was limited, and there was a heavy reliance on exporting primary goods while importing capital and manufactured goods. Under Kenyatta, the structure of this economy did not fundamentally change, remaining externally oriented and dominated by <a href="multinational%20corporation">multinational corporation</a>s and foreign capital. Kenyatta's economic policy was <a href="capitalism">capitalist</a> and <a href="entrepreneurial">entrepreneurial</a>, with no serious socialist policies being pursued; its focus was on achieving <a href="economic%20growth">economic growth</a> as opposed to equitable redistribution. The government passed laws to encourage foreign investment, recognising that Kenya needed foreign-trained specialists in scientific and technical fields to aid its economic development. Under Kenyatta, Western companies regarded Kenya as a safe and profitable place for investment; between 1964 and 1970, large-scale foreign investment and industry in Kenya nearly doubled.

In contrast to his economic policies, Kenyatta publicly claimed he would create a <a href="democratic%20socialism">democratic socialist</a> state with an equitable distribution of economic and social development. In 1965, when <a href="Thomas%20Mboya">Thomas Mboya</a> was minister for economic planning and development, the government issued a <a href="session%20paper">session paper</a> titled "African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya", in which it officially declared its commitment to what it called an "<a href="African%20socialism">African socialist</a>" economic model. The session proposed a <a href="mixed%20economy">mixed economy</a> with an important role for private capital, with Kenyatta's government specifying that it would only consider <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> in instances where national security was at risk. Left-wing critics highlighted that the image of "African socialism" portrayed in the document provided for no major shift away from the colonial economy.

Kenya's agricultural and industrial sectors were dominated by Europeans and its commerce and trade by Asians; one of Kenyatta's most pressing issues was to bring the economy under indigenous control. There was growing black resentment towards the Asian domination of the small business sector, with Kenyatta's government putting pressure on Asian-owned businesses, intending to replace them with African-owned counterparts. The 1965 session paper promised an "Africanization" of the Kenyan economy, with the government increasingly pushing for "black capitalism". The government established the <a href="Industrial%20and%20Commercial%20Development%20Corporation">Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation</a> to provide loans for black-owned businesses, and secured a 51% share in the <a href="Kenya%20National%20Assurance%20Company">Kenya National Assurance Company</a>. In 1965, the government established the <a href="Kenya%20National%20Trading%20Corporation">Kenya National Trading Corporation</a> to ensure indigenous control over the trade in essential commodities, while the Trade Licensing Act of 1967 prohibited non-citizens from involvement in the rice, sugar, and maize trade. During the 1970s, this expanded to cover the trade in soap, cement, and textiles. Many Asians who had retained British citizenship were affected by these measures. Between late 1967 and early 1968, growing numbers of Kenyan Asians migrated to Britain; in February 1968 large numbers migrated quickly before <a href="Immigration%20Act%201971">a legal change revoked their right to do so</a>. Kenyatta was not sympathetic to those leaving: "Kenya's identity as an African country is not going to be altered by the whims and malaises of groups of uncommitted individuals."

Under Kenyatta, corruption became widespread throughout the government, civil service, and business community. Kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963. Their acquisitions in the Central, Rift Valley, and Coast Provinces aroused great anger among landless Kenyans. His family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property. The Kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business, Kenyatta personally owning the Leonard Beach Hotel. Other businesses they were involved with included ruby mining in <a href="Tsavo%20East%20National%20Park">Tsavo National Park</a>, the casino business, the charcoal trade—which was causing significant deforestation—and the ivory trade. The Kenyan press, which was largely loyal to Kenyatta, did not delve into this issue; it was only after his death that publications appeared revealing the scale of his personal enrichment. Kenyan corruption and Kenyatta's role in it was better known in Britain, although many of his British friends—including McDonald and Brockway—chose to believe Kenyatta was not personally involved.

The question of land ownership had deep emotional resonance in Kenya, having been a major grievance against the British colonialists. As part of the Lancaster House negotiations, Britain's government agreed to provide Kenya with £27 million with which to buy out white farmers and redistribute their land among the indigenous population. To ease this transition, Kenyatta made McKenzie, a white farmer, the Minister of Agriculture and Land. Kenyatta's government encouraged the establishment of private land-buying companies that were often headed by prominent politicians. The government sold or leased lands in the former White Highlands to these companies, which in turn subdivided them among individual shareholders. In this way, the land redistribution programs favoured the ruling party's chief constituency. Kenyatta himself expanded the land that he owned around Gatundu. Kenyans who made claims to land on the basis of ancestral ownership often found the land given to other people, including Kenyans from different parts of the country. Voices began to condemn the redistribution; in 1969, the MP <a href="Jean-Marie%20Seroney">Jean-Marie Seroney</a> censured the sale of historically <a href="Nandi%20people">Nandi</a> lands in the Rift to non-Nandi, describing the settlement schemes as "Kenyatta's colonization of the rift".

In part fuelled by high rural unemployment, Kenya witnessed growing rural-to-urban migration under Kenyatta's government. This exacerbated urban unemployment and housing shortages, with squatter settlements and slums growing up and urban crime rates rising. Kenyatta was concerned by this, and promoted the reversal of this rural-to-urban migration, but in this was unsuccessful. Kenyatta's government was eager to control the country's trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy. To this end it emphasised social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions, and in 1965 transformed the Kenya Federation of Labour into the Central Organization of Trade (COT), a body which came under strong government influence. No strikes could be legally carried out in Kenya without COT's permission. There were also measures to Africanise the civil service, which by mid-1967 had become 91% African. During the 1960s and 1970s the <a href="public%20sector">public sector</a> grew faster than the private sector. The growth in the public sector contributed to the significant expansion of the indigenous <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> in Kenyatta's Kenya.

The government oversaw a massive expansion in education facilities. In June 1963, Kenyatta ordered the Ominda Commission to determine a framework for meeting Kenya's educational needs. Their report set out the long-term goal of universal free primary education in Kenya but argued that the government's emphasis should be on secondary and higher education to facilitate the training of indigenous African personnel to take over the civil service and other jobs requiring such an education. Between 1964 and 1966, the number of primary schools grew by 11.6%, and the number of secondary schools by 80%. By the time of Kenyatta's death, Kenya's first universities—the <a href="University%20of%20Nairobi">University of Nairobi</a> and <a href="Kenyatta%20University">Kenyatta University</a>—had been established. Although Kenyatta died without having attained the goal of free, universal primary education in Kenya, the country had made significant advances in that direction, with 85% of Kenyan children in primary education, and within a decade of independence had trained sufficient numbers of indigenous Africans to take over the civil service.

Another priority for Kenyatta's government was improving access to healthcare services. It stated that its long-term goal was to establish a system of free, universal medical care. In the short-term, its emphasis was on increasing the overall number of doctors and registered nurses while decreasing the number of expatriates in those positions. In 1965, the government introduced free medical services for out-patients and children. By Kenyatta's death, the majority of Kenyans had access to significantly better healthcare than they had had in the colonial period. Before independence, the average life expectancy in Kenya was 45, but by the end of the 1970s it was 55, the second highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. This improved medical care had resulted in declining mortality rates while birth rates remained high, resulting in a rapidly growing population; from 1962 to 1979, Kenya's population grew by just under 4% a year, the highest rate in the world at the time. This put a severe strain on social services; Kenyatta's government promoted <a href="family%20planning">family planning</a> projects to stem the birth-rate, but these had little success.

In part due to his advanced years, Kenyatta rarely travelled outside of Eastern Africa. Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved in the affairs of other states, including those in the <a href="East%20African%20Community">East African Community</a>. Despite his reservations about any immediate East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the <a href="Treaty%20for%20East%20African%20Co-operation">Treaty for East African Co-operation</a>. In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the <a href="East%20African%20Economic%20Community">East African Economic Community</a>, reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration. He also took on a mediating role during the <a href="Congo%20Crisis">Congo Crisis</a>, heading the <a href="Organisation%20of%20African%20Unity">Organisation of African Unity</a>'s Conciliation Commission on the Congo.

Facing the pressures of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, Kenyatta officially pursued a policy of "positive non-alignment". In reality, his foreign policy was pro-Western and in particular pro-British. Kenya became a member of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth</a>, using this as a vehicle to put pressure on the white-minority <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia. Britain remained one of Kenya's foremost sources of foreign trade; British aid to Kenya was among the highest in Africa. In 1964, Kenya and the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding, one of only two military alliances Kenyatta's government made; the British <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> trained Kenyatta's own bodyguards. Commentators argued that Britain's relationship with Kenyatta's Kenya was a <a href="Neo-colonialism">neo-colonial</a> one, with the British having exchanged their position of political power for one of influence. The historian Poppy Cullen nevertheless noted that there was no "dictatorial neo-colonial control" in Kenyatta's Kenya.

Although many white Kenyans accepted Kenyatta's rule, he remained opposed by white <a href="far%20right%20politics">far right</a> activists; while in London at the <a href="1964%20Commonwealth%20Prime%20Ministers%27%20Conference">July 1964 Commonwealth Conference</a>, he was assaulted by <a href="Martin%20Webster">Martin Webster</a>, a British <a href="Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazi</a>. Kenyatta's relationship with the United States was also warm; the <a href="United%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">United States Agency for International Development</a> played a key role in helping respond to a maize shortage in <a href="Kamba%20people">Kambaland</a> in 1965. Kenyatta also maintained a warm relationship with Israel, including when other East African nations endorsed Arab hostility to the state; he for instance permitted Israeli jets to refuel in Kenya on their way back from the <a href="Entebbe%20raid">Entebbe raid</a>. In turn, in 1976 the Israelis warned of a plot by the <a href="Palestinian%20Liberation%20Army">Palestinian Liberation Army</a> to assassinate him, a threat he took seriously.

Kenyatta and his government were anti-communist, and in June 1965 he warned that "it is naive to think that there is no danger of imperialism from the East. In world power politics the East has as much designs upon us as the West and would like to serve their own interests. That is why we reject Communism. " His governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist. When Chinese Communist official <a href="Zhou%20Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a> visited Dar es Salaam, his statement that "Africa is ripe for revolution" was clearly aimed largely at Kenya. In 1964, Kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of Chinese armaments that passed through Kenyan territory on its way to Uganda. Obote personally visited Kenyatta to apologise. In June 1967, Kenyatta declared the Chinese Chargé d'Affairs "persona non grata" in Kenya and recalled the Kenyan ambassador from <a href="Peking">Peking</a>. Relations with the Soviet Union were also strained; Kenyatta shut down the Lumumba Institute—an educational organisation named after the Congolese independence leader <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a>—on the basis that it was a front for Soviet influence in Kenya.

Kenyatta made clear his desire for Kenya to become a one-party state, regarding this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. In the first five years of independence, he consolidated control of the central government, removing the autonomy of Kenya's provinces to prevent the entrenchment of ethnic power bases. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist quicker economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations, and in 1969 passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which terminated grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.

A major focus for Kenyatta during the first three and a half years of Kenya's independence were the divisions within KANU itself. Opposition to Kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of <a href="Pio%20Pinto">Pio Pinto</a> in February 1965. Kenyatta condemned the assassination of the prominent leftist politician, although UK intelligence agencies believed that his own bodyguard had orchestrated the murder. Relations between Kenyatta and Odinga were strained, and at the March 1966 party conference, Odinga's post—that of party vice president—was divided among eight different politicians, greatly limiting his power and ending his position as Kenyatta's automatic successor. Between 1964 and 1966, Kenyatta and other KANU conservatives had been deliberately trying to push Odinga to resign from the party. Under growing pressure, in 1966 Odinga stepped down as state vice president, claiming that Kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt socialist policies. Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he became head of the new <a href="Kenya%20Peoples%20Union">Kenya Peoples Union</a> (KPU). In its manifesto, the KPU stated that it would pursue "truly socialist policies" like the nationalisation of public utilities; it claimed Kenyatta's government "want[ed] to build a capitalist system in the image of Western capitalism but are too embarrassed or dishonest to call it that." The KPU were legally recognised as the <a href="official%20opposition">official opposition</a>, thus restoring the country's <a href="two%20party%20system">two party system</a>.

The new party was a direct challenge to Kenyatta's rule, and he regarded it as a communist-inspired plot to oust him. Soon after the KPU's creation, the Kenyan Parliament amended the constitution to ensure that the defectors—who had originally been elected on the KANU ticket—could not automatically retain their seats and would have to stand for re-election. This resulted in the <a href="Kenyan%20parliamentary%20by-elections%2C%201966">election of June 1966</a>. The Luo increasingly rallied around the KPU, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although Kenyatta's government officially disavowed this violence. KANU retained the support of all national newspapers and the government-owned radio and television stations. Of the 29 defectors, only 9 were re-elected on the KPU ticket; Odinga was among them, having retained his Central Nyanza seat with a high majority. Odinga was replaced as Vice President by <a href="Joseph%20Murumbi">Joseph Murumbi</a>, who in turn would be replaced by Moi.

In July 1969, Mboya—a prominent and popular Luo KANU politician—was assassinated by a Kikuyu. Kenyatta had reportedly been concerned that Mboya, with U.S. backing, could remove him from the presidency, and across Kenya there were suspicions voiced that Kenyatta's government was responsible for Mboya's death. The killing sparked tensions between the Kikuyu and other ethnic groups across the country, with riots breaking out in Nairobi. In October 1969, Kenyatta visited <a href="Kisumu">Kisumu</a>, located in Luo territory, to open a hospital. On being greeted by a crowd shouting KPU slogans, he lost his temper. When members of the crowd started throwing stones, Kenyatta's bodyguards opened fire on them, killing and wounding several. In response to the rise of KPU, Kenyatta had introduced oathing, a Kikuyu cultural tradition in which individuals came to Gatundu to swear their loyalty to him. Journalists were discouraged from reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported when they tried to do so. Many Kenyans were pressured or forced to swear oaths, something condemned by the country's Christian establishment. In response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in September 1969, and Kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in Gatundi.

Kenyatta's government resorted to un-democratic measures to restrict the opposition. It used laws on detention and deportation to perpetuate its political hold. In 1966, it passed the Public Security (Detained and Restricted Persons) Regulations, allowing the authorities to arrest and detain anyone "for the preservation of public security" <a href="Indefinite%20detention%20without%20trial">without putting them on trial</a>. In October 1969 the government banned the KPU, and arrested Odinga before putting him under indefinite detainment. With the organised opposition eliminated, from 1969, Kenya was once again a "de facto" one-party state. The <a href="Kenyan%20general%20election%2C%201969">December 1969 general election</a>—in which all candidates were from the ruling KANU—resulted in Kenyatta's government remaining in power, but many members of his government lost their parliamentary seats to rivals from within the party. Over coming years, many other political and intellectual figures considered hostile to Kenyatta's rule were detained or imprisoned, including Seroney, <a href="Flomena%20Chelagat">Flomena Chelagat</a>, <a href="George%20Anyona">George Anyona</a>, <a href="Martin%20Shikuku">Martin Shikuku</a>, and <a href="Ng%C5%A9g%C4%A9%20wa%20Thiong%27o">Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o</a>. Other political figures who were critical of Kenyatta's administration, including Ronald Ngala and <a href="Josiah%20Mwangi%20Kariuki">Josiah Mwangi Kariuki</a>, were killed in incidents that many speculated were government assassinations.

For many years, Kenyatta had suffered health problems. He had a mild stroke in 1966, and a second in May 1968. He suffered from <a href="gout">gout</a> and heart problems, all of which he sought to keep hidden from the public. By 1970, he was increasingly feeble and senile, and by 1975 Kenyatta had—according to Maloba—"in effect ceased to actively govern". Four Kikuyu politicians—Koinange, <a href="James%20Gichuru">James Gichuru</a>, <a href="Njoroge%20Mungai">Njoroge Mungai</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Njonjo">Charles Njonjo</a>—formed his inner circle of associates, and he was rarely seen in public without one of them present. This clique faced opposition from KANU back-benchers spearheaded by Kariuki; in March 1975, he was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered, and his body dumped in the <a href="Ngong%20Hills">Ngong Hills</a>. After Kariuku's murder, Maloba noted, there was a "noticeable erosion" of support for Kenyatta and his government. Thenceforth, when the president spoke to crowds, they no longer applauded his statements.

In 1977, Kenyatta had several further strokes or heart attacks. On 22 August 1978, he died of a heart attack in the State House, Mombasa. The Kenyan government had been preparing for Kenyatta's death since at least his 1968 stroke; it had requested British assistance in organising his <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> as a result of the UK's longstanding experience in this area. McKenzie had been employed as a go-between, and the structure of the funeral was orchestrated to deliberately imitate that of deceased British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. In doing so, senior Kenyans sought to project an image of their country as a modern nation-state rather than one incumbent on tradition. The funeral took place at <a href="St.%20Andrew%27s%20Church%2C%20Nairobi">St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church</a>, six days after Kenyatta's death. Britain's heir to the throne, <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>, attended the event, a symbol of the value that the British government perceived in its relationship with Kenya. African heads of state also attended, including Nyerere, <a href="Idi%20Amin">Idi Amin</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Kaunda">Kenneth Kaunda</a>, and <a href="Hastings%20Banda">Hastings Banda</a>, as did India's <a href="Morarji%20Desai">Morarji Desai</a> and Pakistan's <a href="Muhammad%20Zia-ul-Haq">Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq</a>. His body was buried in a mausoleum in the parliament grounds.

Kenyatta's succession had been an issue of debate since independence, and Kenyatta had not unreservedly nominated a successor. The Kikuyu clique surrounding him had sought to amend the constitution to prevent vice president Moi—who was from the <a href="Kalenjin%20people">Kalenjin people</a> rather than the Kikuyu—from automatically becoming acting president, but their attempts failed amid sustained popular and parliamentary opposition. After Kenyatta's death, the transition of power proved smooth, surprising many international commentators. As vice president, Moi was sworn in as acting president for a 90-day interim period. In October he was unanimously elected KANU President and subsequently declared President of Kenya itself. Moi emphasised his loyalty to Kenyatta—"I followed and was faithful to him until his last day, even when his closest friends forsook him"—and there was much expectation that he would continue the policies inaugurated by Kenyatta. He nevertheless criticised the corruption, <a href="land%20grabbing">land grabbing</a>, and capitalistic ethos that had characterised Kenyatta's period and expressed <a href="populism">populist</a> tendencies by emphasising a closer link to the poor. In 1982 he would amend the Kenyan constitution to create a "de jure" one-party state.

Kenyatta was an African nationalist, and was committed to the belief that European colonial rule in Africa must end. Like other anti-colonialists, he believed that under colonialism, the human and natural resources of Africa had been used not for the benefit of Africa's population but for the enrichment of the colonisers and their European homelands. For Kenyatta, independence meant not just self-rule, but an end to <a href="Racial%20segregation">the colour bar</a> and to the patronising attitudes and racist slang of Kenya's white minority. According to Murray-Brown, Kenyatta's "basic philosophy" throughout his life was that "all men deserved the right to develop peacefully according to their own wishes". Kenyatta expressed this in his statement that "I have stood always for the purposes of human dignity in freedom, and for the values of tolerance and peace." This approach was similar to the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's ideology of "African humanism".

Murray-Brown noted that "Kenyatta had always kept himself free from ideological commitments", while the historian William R. Ochieng observed that "Kenyatta articulated no particular social philosophy". Similarly, Assensoh noted that Kenyatta was "not interested in social philosophies and slogans". Several commentators and biographers described him as being politically <a href="Conservatism">conservative</a>, an ideological viewpoint likely bolstered by his training in functionalist anthropology. He pursued, according to Maloba, "a conservatism that worked in concert with imperial powers and was distinctly hostile to radical politics".

Kenyatta biographer <a href="Guy%20Arnold">Guy Arnold</a> described the Kenyan leader as "a pragmatist and a moderate", noting that his only "radicalism" came in the form of his "nationalist attack" on imperialism. Arnold also noted that Kenyatta "absorbed a great deal of the British approach to politics: pragmatism, only dealing with problems when they become crises, [and] tolerance as long as the other side is only talking". Donald Savage noted that Kenyatta believed in "the importance of authority and tradition", and that he displayed "a remarkably consistent view of development through self-help and hard work". Kenyatta was also an elitist and encouraged the emergence of an elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for a renewal of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism.

While in Britain, Kenyatta made political alliances with individuals committed to Marxism and to radical Pan-Africanism, the idea that African countries should politically unify; some commentators have posthumously characterised Kenyatta as a Pan-Africanist. Maloba observed that during the colonial period Kenyatta had embraced "radical Pan African activism" that differed sharply from the "deliberate conservative positions, especially on the question of African liberation" that he espoused while Kenya's leader. As leader of Kenya, Kenyatta published two collected volumes of his speeches: "Harambee" and "Suffering Without Bitterness". The material included in these publications was carefully selected so as to avoid mention of the radicalism he exhibited while in Britain during the 1930s.

Kenyatta had been exposed to Marxist-Leninist ideas through his friendship with Padmore and the time spent in the Soviet Union, but had also been exposed to Western forms of <a href="liberal%20democracy">liberal democratic</a> government through his many years in Britain. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934. As Kenya's leader, Kenyatta rejected the idea that Marxism offered a useful framework for analysing his country's socio-economic situation. The academics Bruce J. Berman and John M. Lonsdale argued that Marxist frameworks for analysing society influenced some of his beliefs, such as his view that British colonialism had to be destroyed rather than simply reformed. Kenyatta nevertheless disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and <a href="Ras%20T.%20Makonnen">Ras T. Makonnen</a>, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive.

Assensoh suggested that Kenyatta initially had socialist inclinations but "became a victim of capitalist circumstances"; conversely, Savage stated that "Kenyatta's direction was hardly towards the creation of a radical new socialist society", and Ochieng called him "an African capitalist". When in power, Kenyatta displayed a preoccupation with individual and "mbari" land rights that were at odds with any socialist-oriented collectivisation. According to Maloba, Kenyatta's government "sought to project capitalism as an African ideology, and communism (or socialism) as alien and dangerous".

Kenyatta was a flamboyant character, with an extroverted personality. According to Murray-Brown, he "liked being at the centre of life", and was always "a rebel at heart" who enjoyed "earthly pleasures". One of Kenyatta's fellow LSE students, Elspeth Huxley, referred to him as "a showman to his finger tips; jovial, a good companion, shrewd, fluent, quick, devious, subtle, [and] flesh-pot loving". Kenyatta liked to dress elaborately; throughout most of his adult life, he wore finger rings and while studying at university in London took to wearing a <a href="fez">fez</a> and cloak and carrying a silver-topped black cane. He adopted his surname, "Kenyatta", after the name of a beaded belt he often wore in early life. As President he collected a variety of expensive cars.

Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta had the ability to "appear all things to all men", also displaying a "consummate ability to keep his true purposes and abilities to himself", for instance concealing his connections with communists and the Soviet Union from both members of the British Labour Party and Kikuyu figures at home. This deviousness was sometimes interpreted as dishonesty by those who met him. Referring to Kenyatta's appearance in 1920s Kenya, Murray-Brown stated the leader presented himself to Europeans as "an agreeable if somewhat seedy 'Europeanized' native" and to indigenous Africans as "a sophisticated man-about-town about whose political earnestness they had certain reservations".

Simon Gikandi argued that Kenyatta, like some of his contemporaries in the Pan-African movement, was an "Afro-Victorian", someone whose identity had been shaped "by the culture of colonialism and colonial institutions", especially those of the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. During the 1920s and 1930s, Kenyatta cultivated the image of a "colonial gentleman"; in England, he displayed "pleasant manners" and a flexible attitude in adapting to urban situations dissimilar to the lands he had grown up in. A. R. Barlow, a member of the Church of Scotland Mission at Kikuyu, met with Kenyatta in Britain, later relating that he was impressed by how Kenyatta could "mix on equal terms with Europeans and to hold his end up in spite of his handicaps, educationally and socially." The South African <a href="Peter%20Abrahams">Peter Abrahams</a> met Kenyatta in London, noting that of all the black men involved in the city's Pan-Africanist movement, he was "the most relaxed, sophisticated and 'westernized' of the lot of us". As President, Kenyatta often reminisced nostalgically about his time in England, referring to it as "home" on several occasions. Berman and Lonsdale described his life as being preoccupied with "a search for the reconciliation of the Western modernity he embraced and an equally valued Kikuyuness he could not discard". Gikandi argued that Kenyatta's "identification with Englishness was much more profound than both his friends and enemies have been willing to admit".

Kenyatta has also been described as a talented orator, author, and editor. He had dictatorial and autocratic tendencies, as well as a fierce temper that could emerge as rage on occasion. Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta could be "quite unscrupulous, even brutal" in using others to get what he wanted, but that he never displayed any physical cruelty or <a href="nihilism">nihilism</a>. Kenyatta had no racist impulses regarding white Europeans, as can, for instance, be seen through his marriage to a white English woman. He told his daughter that "the English are wonderful people to live with in England." He welcomed white support for his cause, so long as it was generous and unconditional, and spoke of a Kenya in which indigenous Africans, Europeans, Arabs, and Indians could all regard themselves as Kenyans, working and living alongside each other peacefully. He nevertheless exhibited a general dislike of Indians, believing that they exploited indigenous Africans in Kenya.

A polygamist, Kenyatta had three wives. He viewed <a href="monogamy">monogamy</a> through an anthropological lens as an interesting Western phenomenon but did not adopt the practice himself, instead having sexual relations with a wide range of women throughout his life. Murray-Brown characterised Kenyatta as an "affectionate father" to his children, but one who was frequently absent. Kenyatta had two children from his first marriage with Grace Wahu: son Peter Muigai Kenyatta (born 1920), who later became a deputy minister; and daughter <a href="Margaret%20Kenyatta%20%28born%201928%29">Margaret Kenyatta</a> (born 1928). Margaret served as mayor of Nairobi between 1970 and 1976 and then as Kenya's ambassador to the United Nations from 1976 to 1986. Of these children, it was Margaret who was Kenyatta's closest confidante.

During his trial, Kenyatta described himself as a Christian, stating that "I do not follow any particular denomination. I believe in Christianity as a whole." Arnold stated that in England, Kenyatta's adherence to Christianity was "desultory". While in London, Kenyatta had taken an interest in the <a href="atheism">atheist</a> speakers at <a href="Speakers%27%20Corner">Speakers' Corner</a> in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>, while an Irish Muslim friend had unsuccessfully urged Kenyatta to convert to <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. During his imprisonment, Kenyatta read up on Islam, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> through books supplied to him by Stock. The Israeli diplomat Asher Naim visited him in this period, noting that although Kenyatta was "not a religious man, he was appreciative of the Bible". Despite portraying himself as a Christian, he found the attitudes of many European missionaries intolerable, in particular their readiness to see everything African as evil. In "Facing Mount Kenya", he challenged the missionaries' dismissive attitude toward <a href="ancestor%20veneration">ancestor veneration</a>, which he instead preferred to call "ancestor communion". In that book's dedication, Kenyatta invoked "ancestral spirits" as part of "the Fight for African Freedom."

Within Kenya, Kenyatta came to be regarded as the "Father of the Nation", and was given the unofficial title of "Mzee", a Swahili term meaning "grand old man". From 1963 until his death, a <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a> surrounded him in the country, one which deliberately interlinked Kenyan nationalism with Kenyatta's own personality. This use of Kenyatta as a popular symbol of the nation itself was furthered by the similarities between their names. He came to be regarded as a <a href="father%20figure">father figure</a> not only by Kikuyu and Kenyans, but by Africans more widely.

After 1963, Maloba noted, Kenyatta became "about the most admired post-independence African leader" on the world stage, one who Western countries hailed as a "beloved elder statesman." His opinions were "most valued" by both conservative African politicians and Western leaders. On becoming Kenya's leader, his anti-communist positions gained favour in the West, and some pro-Western governments gave him awards; in 1965 he, for instance, received medals from both <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Pope Paul VI</a> and the South Korean government.

In 1974, Arnold referred to Kenyatta as "one of the outstanding African leaders now living", someone who had become "synonymous with Kenya". He added that Kenyatta had been "one of the shrewdest politicians" on the continent, regarded as "one of the great architects of African nationalist achievement since 1945". Kenneth O. Nyangena characterised him as "one of the greatest men of the twentieth century", having been "a beacon, a rallying point for suffering Kenyans to fight for their rights, justice and freedom" whose "brilliance gave strength and aspiration to people beyond the boundaries of Kenya". In 2018, Maloba described him as "one of the legendary pioneers of modern African nationalism". In their examination of his writings, Berman and Lonsdale described him as a "pioneer" for being one of the very first Kikuyu to write and publish; "his representational achievement was unique".

Maxon noted that in the areas of health and education, Kenya under Kenyatta "achieved more in a decade and a half than the colonial state had accomplished in the preceding six decades." By the time of Kenyatta's death, Kenya had gained higher life expectancy rates than most of Sub-Saharan Africa. There had been an expansion in primary, secondary, and higher education, and the country had taken what Maxon called "giant steps" toward achieving its goal of universal primary education for Kenyan children. Another significant success had been in dismantling the colonial-era system of racial segregation in schools, public facilities, and social clubs peacefully and with minimal disruption.

During much of his life, Kenya's white settlers had regarded Kenyatta as a malcontent and an agitator; for them, he was a figure of hatred and fear. As noted by Arnold, "no figure in the whole of British Africa, with the possible exception of [Nkrumah], excited among the settlers and the colonial authorities alike so many expressions of anger, denigration and fury as did Kenyatta." As the historian Keith Kyle put it, for many whites Kenyatta was "Satan Incarnate". This white animosity reached its apogee between 1950 and 1952. By 1964, this image had largely shifted, and many white settlers referred to him as "Good Old Mzee". Murray-Brown expressed the view that for many, Kenyatta's "message of reconciliation, 'to forgive and forget', was perhaps his greatest contribution to his country and to history."

To Ochieng, Kenyatta was "a personification of conservative social forces and tendencies" in Kenya. Towards the end of his presidency, many younger Kenyans—while respecting Kenyatta's role in attaining independence—regarded him as a <a href="reactionary">reactionary</a>. Those desiring a radical transformation of Kenyan society often compared Kenyatta's Kenya unfavourably with its southern neighbour, Nyerere's Tanzania. The criticisms that leftists like Odinga made of Kenyatta's leadership were similar to those that the intellectual <a href="Frantz%20Fanon">Frantz Fanon</a> had made of post-colonial leaders throughout Africa. Drawing upon Marxist theory, Jay O'Brien, for instance, argued that Kenyatta had come to power "as a representative of a would-be bourgeoisie", a coalition of "relatively privileged petty bourgeois African elements" who wanted simply to replace the British colonialists and "Asian commercial bourgeoisie" with themselves. He suggested that the British supported Kenyatta in this, seeing him as a bulwark against growing worker and peasant militancy who would ensure continued neo-colonial dominance.

Providing a similar leftist critique, the Marxist writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o stated that "here was a black Moses who had been called by history to lead his people to the promised land of no exploitation, no oppression, but who failed to rise to the occasion". Ngũgĩ saw Kenyatta as a "twentieth-century tragic figure: he could have been a Lenin, a Mao Tse-Tung, or a Ho Chi Minh; but he ended up being a Chiang Kai-Shek, a Park-Chung Hee, or a Pinochet." Ngũgĩ was among Kenyan critics who claimed that Kenyatta treated Mau Mau veterans dismissively, leaving many of them impoverished and landless while seeking to remove them from the centre stage of national politics. In other areas Kenyatta's government also faced criticism; it for instance made little progress in advancing women's rights in Kenya.

Assensoh argued that in his life story, Kenyatta had a great deal in common with Ghana's Nkrumah. Simon Gikandi noted that Kenyatta, like Nkrumah, was remembered for "initiating the discourse and process that plotted the narrative of African freedom", but at the same time both were "often remembered for their careless institution of presidential rule, one party dictatorship, ethnicity and cronyism. They are remembered both for making the dream of African independence a reality and for their invention of postcolonial authoritarianism."
In 1991, the Kenyan lawyer and human rights activist Gibson Kamau Kuria noted that in abolishing the federal system, banning independent candidates from standing in elections, setting up a unicameral legislature, and relaxing restrictions on the use of emergency powers, Kenyatta had laid "the groundwork" for Moi to further advance dictatorial power in Kenya during the late 1970s and 1980s.

Kenyatta was accused by Kenya's Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission in its 2013 report of using his authority as President to allocate large tracts of land to himself and his family across Kenya. The Kenyatta family is among Kenya's biggest landowners. 
During the 1990s, there was still much frustration among tribal groups, namely in the Nandi, Nakuru, Uasin-Gishu, and Trans-Nzoia Districts, that under Kenyatta's government they had not regained the lands taken by European settlers and that more of their land had been sold to those regarded as "foreigners"—Kenyans from other tribes. Among these groups there were widespread calls for restitution and in 1991 and 1992 there were violent attacks against many of those who obtained land through Kenyatta's patronage in these areas. The violence continued sporadically until 1996, with an estimated 1500 killed and 300,000 displaced in the Rift Valley.

Horace Greeley

Horace Greeley (February 3, 1811 – November 29, 1872) was an American author and statesman who was the founder and <a href="newspaper%20editor">editor</a> of the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>", among the great newspapers of its time. Long active in politics, he served briefly as a congressman from New York, and was the unsuccessful candidate of the new <a href="Liberal%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Liberal Republican</a> party in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201872">1872 presidential election</a> against incumbent President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>.

Greeley was born to a poor family in <a href="Amherst%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Amherst, New Hampshire</a>. He was apprenticed to a printer in Vermont and went to New York City in 1831 to seek his fortune. He wrote for or edited several publications and involved himself in <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> politics, taking a significant part in <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>'s successful 1840 presidential campaign. The following year, he founded the "Tribune", which became the highest-circulating newspaper in the country through weekly editions sent by mail. Among many other issues, he urged the settlement of the American West, which he saw as a land of opportunity for the young and the unemployed. He popularized the slogan "<a href="Go%20West%2C%20young%20man">Go West, young man</a>, and grow up with the country." He endlessly promoted utopian reforms such as socialism, vegetarianism, agrarianism, feminism, and temperance, while hiring the best talent he could find.

Greeley's alliance with <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a> and <a href="Thurlow%20Weed">Thurlow Weed</a> led to him serving three months in the House of Representatives, where he angered many by investigating Congress in his newspaper. In 1854, he helped found and may have named the <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republican Party</a>. Republican newspapers across the nation regularly reprinted his editorials. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, he mostly supported Lincoln, though he urged the president to commit to the end of slavery before he was willing to do so. After <a href="Lincoln%27s%20assassination">Lincoln's assassination</a>, he supported the <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> in opposition to President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>. He broke with Republican President <a href="Ulysses%20Grant">Ulysses Grant</a> because of corruption and Greeley's sense that Reconstruction policies were no longer needed.

Greeley was the new Liberal Republican Party's presidential nominee in 1872. He lost in a landslide despite having the additional support of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democratic Party</a>. He was devastated by the death of his wife, who died five days before the election, and died himself three weeks later, before the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> had met.

Horace Greeley was born on February 3, 1811, on a farm about five miles from <a href="Amherst%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Amherst, New Hampshire</a>. He could not breathe for the first twenty minutes of his life. It is suggested that this deprivation may have caused him to develop <a href="Asperger%27s%20syndrome">Asperger's syndrome</a>—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life. He was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of <a href="History%20of%20Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="History%20of%20New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>.

Greeley was the son of poor farmers Zaccheus and Mary (Woodburn) Greeley. Zaccheus was not successful, and moved his family several times, as far west as Pennsylvania. Horace attended the local schools, and was a brilliant student.

Seeing the boy's intelligence, some neighbors offered to pay Horace's way at <a href="Phillips%20Exeter%20Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a>, but the Greeleys were too proud to accept charity. In 1820, Zaccheus's financial reverses caused him to flee New Hampshire with his family lest he be imprisoned for debt, and settle in Vermont. Even as his father struggled to make a living as a hired hand, Horace Greeley read everything he could—the Greeleys had a neighbor who let Horace use his library. In 1822, Horace ran away from home to become a <a href="Printer%27s%20devil">printer's apprentice</a>, but was told he was too young.

In 1826, at age 15, he was made a printer's apprentice to Amos Bliss, editor of the "Northern Spectator", a newspaper in <a href="Poultney%20%28town%29%2C%20Vermont">East Poultney, Vermont</a>. There, he learned the mechanics of a printer's job, and acquired a reputation as the town encyclopedia, reading his way through the local library. When the paper closed in 1830, the young man went west to join his family, living near <a href="Erie%2C%20Pennsylvania">Erie, Pennsylvania</a>. He remained there only briefly, going from town to town seeking newspaper employment, and was hired by the "Erie Gazette". Although ambitious for greater things, he remained until 1831 to help support his father. While there, he became a <a href="Universalist">Universalist</a>, breaking from his <a href="Congregationalist">Congregationalist</a> upbringing.

In late 1831, Greeley went to New York City to seek his fortune. There were many young printers in New York who had likewise come to the metropolis, and he could only find short-term work. In 1832, Greeley worked as an employee of the publication "Spirit of the Times". He built his resources and set up a print shop in that year. In 1833, he tried his hand with <a href="Horatio%20D.%20Sheppard">Horatio D. Sheppard</a> at editing a daily newspaper, the "New York Morning Post", which was not a success. Despite this failure and its attendant financial loss, Greeley published the thrice-weekly "Constitutionalist", which mostly printed lottery results.

On March 22, 1834, he published the first issue of "The New-Yorker" in partnership with Jonas Winchester. It was less expensive than other literary magazines of the time and published both contemporary ditties and political commentary. Circulation reached 9,000, then a sizable number, yet it was ill-managed and eventually fell victim to the economic <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>. He also published the campaign news sheet of the new <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> in New York for the 1834 campaign, and came to believe in its positions, including free markets with government assistance in developing the nation.

Soon after his move to New York City, Greeley met <a href="Mary%20Young%20Cheney%20Greeley">Mary Young Cheney</a>. Both were living at a boarding house run on the diet principles of <a href="Sylvester%20Graham">Sylvester Graham</a>, eschewing meat, alcohol, coffee, tea, and spices, as well as abstaining from the use of tobacco. Greeley was subscribing to Graham's principles at the time, and to the end of his life rarely ate meat. Mary Cheney, a schoolteacher, moved to North Carolina to take a teaching job in 1835. They were married in <a href="Warrenton%2C%20North%20Carolina">Warrenton, North Carolina</a> on July 5, 1836, and an announcement duly appeared in "The New-Yorker" eleven days later. Greeley had stopped over in Washington, D.C. on his way south to observe Congress. He took no honeymoon with his new wife, returning to work while his wife took up a teaching job in New York City.

One of the positions taken by "The New-Yorker" was that the unemployed of the cities should seek lives in the developing American West (in the 1830s, the West encompassed today's Midwestern states). The harsh winter of 1836–1837 and the financial crisis that developed soon after made many New Yorkers homeless and destitute. In his journal, Greeley urged new immigrants to buy guide books on the West, and Congress to make public lands available for purchase at cheap rates to settlers. He told his readers, "Fly, scatter through the country, go to the Great West, anything rather than remain here ... the West is the true destination." In 1838, he advised "any young man" about to start in the world, "Go to the West: there your capabilities are sure to be appreciated and your energy and industry rewarded."

In 1838, Greeley met Albany editor <a href="Thurlow%20Weed">Thurlow Weed</a>. Weed spoke for a liberal faction of the Whigs in his newspaper the Albany "Evening Journal". He hired Greeley as editor of the state Whig newspaper for the upcoming campaign. The newspaper, the "Jeffersonian", premiered in February 1838 and helped elect the Whig candidate for governor, <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a>. In 1839, Greeley worked for several journals, and took a month-long break to go as far west as Detroit.

Greeley was deeply involved in the campaign of the Whig candidate for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201840">1840</a>, <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>. He published the major Whig periodical the "Log Cabin", and also wrote many of the pro-Harrison songs that marked the campaign. These songs were sung at mass meetings, many organized and led by Greeley. According to biographer Robert C. Williams, "Greeley's lyrics swept the country and roused Whig voters to action." Funds raised by Weed helped distribute the "Log Cabin" widely. Harrison and his running mate <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> were easily elected.

By the end of the 1840 campaign, the "Log Cabin"'s circulation had risen to 80,000 and Greeley decided to establish a daily newspaper, the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>". At the time, New York had many newspapers, dominated by <a href="James%20Gordon%20Bennett%2C%20Sr.">James Gordon Bennett</a>'s "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>", which with a circulation of about 55,000 had more readers than its combined competition. As technology advanced, it became cheaper and easier to publish a newspaper, and the daily press came to dominate the weekly, which had once been the more common format for news periodicals. Greeley borrowed money from friends to get started, and published the first issue of the "Tribune" on April 10, 1841 — the day of a memorial parade in New York for President Harrison, who had died after a month in office and been replaced by Vice President Tyler.

In the first issue, Greeley promised that his newspaper would be a "new morning Journal of Politics, Literature, and General Intelligence". New Yorkers were not initially receptive; the first week's receipts were $92 and expenses $525. The paper was sold for a cent a copy by newsboys who purchased bundles of papers at a discount. The price of advertising was initially four cents a line, but was quickly raised to six cents. Through the 1840s, the "Tribune" was four pages, that is, a single sheet folded. It initially had 600 subscribers and 5,000 copies were sold of the first issue.

In the early days, Greeley's chief assistant was <a href="Henry%20J.%20Raymond">Henry J. Raymond</a>, who a decade later founded "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". To place the "Tribune" on a sound financial footing, Greeley sold a half-interest in it to attorney <a href="Thomas%20McElrath">Thomas McElrath</a>, who became publisher of the "Tribune" (Greeley was editor) and ran the business side. Politically, the "Tribune" backed Kentucky Senator <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, who had unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination that fell to Harrison, and supported Clay's <a href="American%20System%20%28economic%20plan%29">American System</a> for development of the country. Greeley was one of the first newspaper editors to have a full-time correspondent in Washington, an innovation quickly followed by his rivals. Part of Greeley's strategy was to make the "Tribune" a newspaper of national scope, not merely local. One factor in establishing the paper nationally was the "Weekly Tribune", created in September, 1841 when the "Log Cabin" and "The New-Yorker" were merged. With an initial subscription price of $2 a year, this was sent to many across the United States by mail, and was especially popular in the Midwest. In December 1841, Greeley was offered the editorship of the national Whig newspaper, the "<a href="Madisonian">Madisonian</a>". He demanded full control, and declined when not given it.

Greeley, in his paper, initially supported the Whig program. As divisions between Clay and President Tyler became apparent, he supported the Kentucky senator and looked to a Clay nomination for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">1844</a>. However, when Clay was nominated by the Whigs, he was defeated by the Democrat, former Tennessee governor <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>, though Greeley worked hard on Clay's behalf. Greeley had taken positions in opposition to slavery as editor of "The New-Yorker" in the late 1830s, opposing the annexation of the slaveholding <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> to the United States. In the 1840s, Greeley became an increasingly vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery.

Greeley hired <a href="Margaret%20Fuller">Margaret Fuller</a> in 1844 as first literary editor of the "Tribune", for which she wrote over 200 articles. She lived with the Greeley family for several years, and when she moved to Italy, he made her a foreign correspondent. He promoted the work of <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>, serving as literary agent and seeing to it that Thoreau's work was published. <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> also benefited from Greeley's promotion. Historian <a href="Allan%20Nevins">Allan Nevins</a> explained:

Greeley, who had met his wife at a Graham boarding house, became enthusiastic about other social movements that did not last, and promoted them in his paper. He subscribed to the views of <a href="Charles%20Fourier">Charles Fourier</a>, a French social thinker, then recently deceased, <a href="Fourierism%23Social%20life">who proposed</a> the establishment of settlements called "phalanxes" with a given number of people from various walks of life, who would function as a corporation and among whose members profits would be shared. Greeley, in addition to promoting <a href="Fourierism">Fourierism</a> in the "Tribune", was associated with two such settlements, both of which eventually failed, though the town that eventually developed on the site of the one in Pennsylvania was after his death renamed <a href="Greeley%2C%20Pennsylvania">Greeley</a>.

In November 1848, Congressman <a href="David%20S.%20Jackson">David S. Jackson</a>, a Democrat, of New York's 6th district was unseated for election fraud. Jackson's term was to expire in March 1849, but during the 19th century Congress convened annually in December, making it important to fill the seat. Under the laws then in force, the Whig committee from the Sixth District chose Greeley to run in the special election for the remainder of the term, though they did not select him as their candidate for the seat in the following Congress. The Sixth District, or Sixth Ward as it was commonly called, was mostly Irish-American, and Greeley proclaimed his support for Irish efforts towards independence from Great Britain. He easily won the November election, and took his seat when Congress convened in December 1848. Greeley's selection was procured by the influence of his ally, Thurlow Weed.

As a congressman for three months, Greeley introduced legislation for a <a href="Homestead%20Act">homestead act</a> that would allow settlers who improved land to purchase it at low rates—a fourth of what speculators would pay. He was quickly noticed because he launched a series of attacks on legislative privileges, taking note of which congressmen were missing votes, and questioning the office of <a href="House%20Chaplain">House Chaplain</a>. This was enough to make him unpopular. But he outraged his colleagues when on December 22, 1848 the "Tribune" published evidence that many congressmen had been paid excessive sums as travel allowance. In January 1849, Greeley supported a bill that would have corrected the issue, but it was defeated. He was so disliked, he wrote a friend, that he had "divided the House into two parties—one that would like to see me extinguished and the other that wouldn't be satisfied without a hand in doing it."

Other legislation, all failed, introduced by Greeley included attempts to end flogging in the Navy, and to ban alcohol from its ships. He tried to change the name of the United States to "Columbia", abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and increase tariffs. One lasting effect of the term of Congressman Greeley was his friendship with a fellow Whig, serving his only term in the House, Illinois's <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Greeley's term ended after March 3, 1849, and he returned to New York and the "Tribune", having, according to Williams, "failed to achieve much except notoriety".

By the end of the 1840s, Greeley's "Tribune" was not only solidly established in New York as a daily paper, it was highly influential nationally through its weekly edition, which circulated in rural areas and small towns. Journalist <a href="Bayard%20Taylor">Bayard Taylor</a> deemed its influence in the Midwest second only to that of the Bible. According to Williams, the "Tribune" could mold public opinion through Greeley's editorials more effectively than could the president. Greeley sharpened those skills over time, laying down what future Secretary of State <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a>, who worked for the "Tribune" in the 1870s, deemed the "Gospel according to St. Horace".

The "Tribune" remained a Whig paper, but Greeley took an independent course. In <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201848">1848</a>, he had been slow to endorse the Whig presidential nominee, General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, a Louisianan and hero of the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. Greeley opposed both the war and the expansion of slavery into the new territories seized from Mexico, and feared Taylor would support expansion as president. Greeley considered endorsing former President <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, candidate of the <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soil Party</a>, but finally endorsed Taylor, who was elected; the editor was rewarded for his loyalty with the congressional term. Greeley vacillated on support for the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a>, which gave victories to both sides of the slavery issue, before finally opposing it. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201852">1852 presidential campaign</a>, he supported the Whig candidate, General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>, but savaged the Whig platform for its support of the Compromise. "We defy it, execrate it, spit upon it." Such party divisions contributed to Scott's defeat by former New Hampshire senator <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>.

In 1853, with the party increasingly divided over the slavery issue, Greeley printed an editorial disclaiming the paper's identity as Whig and declaring it to be nonpartisan. He was confident that the paper would not suffer financially, trusting in reader loyalty. Some in the party were not sorry to see him go: the "Republic", a Whig organ, mocked Greeley and his beliefs: "If a party is to be built up and maintained on Fourierism, <a href="Mesmerism">Mesmerism</a>, <a href="Maine%20Liquor%20laws">Maine Liquor laws</a>, Spiritual Rappings, Kossuthism, Socialism, <a href="Abolitionism">Abolitionism</a>, and forty other <a href="-ism">isms</a>, we have no disposition to mix with any such companions." When in 1854, Illinois Senator <a href="Stephen%20Douglas">Stephen Douglas</a> introduced his <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Bill</a>, allowing residents of each territory to decide whether it would be slave or free, Greeley strongly fought the legislation in his newspaper. After it passed, and the <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">Border War</a> broke out in <a href="Kansas%20Territory">Kansas Territory</a>, Greeley was part of efforts to send free-state settlers there, and to arm them. In return, proponents of slavery recognized Greeley and the "Tribune" as adversaries, stopping shipments of the paper to the South and harassing local agents. Nevertheless, by 1858, the "Tribune" reached 300,000 subscribers through the weekly edition, and it would continue as the foremost American newspaper through the years of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>.

The Kansas–Nebraska Act helped destroy the Whig Party, but a new party with opposition to the spread of slavery at its heart had been under discussion for some years. Beginning in 1853, Greeley participated in the discussions that led to the founding of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> and may have coined its name. Greeley attended the first New York state Republican Convention in 1854, and was disappointed not to be nominated either for governor or lieutenant governor. The switch in parties coincided with the end of two of his longtime political alliances: in December 1854, Greeley wrote that the political partnership between Weed, <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William Seward</a> (who was by then senator after serving as governor) and himself was ended "by the withdrawal of the junior partner". Greeley was angered over patronage disputes, and felt Seward was courting the rival "The New York Times" for support.

In 1853, Greeley purchased a farm in rural <a href="Chappaqua%2C%20New%20York">Chappaqua, New York</a>, where he experimented with farming techniques. In 1856, he designed and built <a href="Rehoboth%20%28Chappaqua%2C%20New%20York%29">Rehoboth</a>, one of the first concrete structures in the United States.

The "Tribune" continued to print a wide variety of material. In 1851, its managing editor <a href="Charles%20Anderson%20Dana">Charles Dana</a> recruited <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> as a foreign correspondent in London. Marx collaborated with <a href="Friedrich%20Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> on his work for the "Tribune", which continued for over a decade, covering 500 articles. Greeley felt compelled to print, "Mr. Marx has very decided opinions of his own, with some of which we are far from agreeing, but those who do not read his letters are neglecting one of the most instructive sources of information on the great questions of current European politics."

Greeley sponsored a host of reforms, including pacifism and feminism and especially the ideal of the hard-working free laborer. Greeley demanded reforms to make all citizens free and equal. He envisioned virtuous citizens who would eradicate corruption. He talked endlessly about progress, improvement, and freedom, while calling for harmony between labor and capital. Greeley's editorials promoted social democratic reforms, and were widely reprinted. They influenced the free-labor ideology of the Whigs and the radical wing of the Republican Party, especially in promoting the free-labor ideology. Before 1848 he sponsored an American version of Fourierist socialist reform. but backed away after the failed revolutions of 1848 in Europe. To promote multiple reforms Greeley hired a roster of writers who later became famous in their own right, including <a href="Margaret%20Fuller">Margaret Fuller</a>, <a href="Charles%20Anderson%20Dana">Charles Anderson Dana</a>, <a href="George%20William%20Curtis">George William Curtis</a>, <a href="William%20Henry%20Fry">William Henry Fry</a>, <a href="Bayard%20Taylor">Bayard Taylor</a>, <a href="Julius%20Chambers">Julius Chambers</a> and <a href="Henry%20Jarvis%20Raymond">Henry Jarvis Raymond</a>, who later co-founded "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". For many years <a href="George%20Ripley%20%28transcendentalist%29">George Ripley</a> was the staff literary critic. <a href="Jane%20Swisshelm">Jane Swisshelm</a> was one of the first women hired by a major newspaper.

In 1859, Greeley traveled across the continent to see the West for himself, to write about it for the "Tribune", and to publicize the need for a <a href="transcontinental%20railroad">transcontinental railroad</a>. He also planned to give speeches to promote the Republican Party. In May 1859, he went to Chicago, and then to <a href="Lawrence%2C%20Kansas">Lawrence</a> in <a href="Kansas%20Territory">Kansas Territory</a>, and was unimpressed by the local people. Nevertheless, after speaking before the 1st ever Kansas Republican Party Convention at <a href="Osawatomie%2C%20Kansas">Osawatomie, Kansas</a>, Greeley took one of the first stagecoaches to Denver, seeing the town then in course of formation as a mining camp of the <a href="Pike%27s%20Peak%20Gold%20Rush">Pike's Peak Gold Rush</a>. Sending dispatches back to the "Tribune", Greeley took the <a href="Overland%20Trail">Overland Trail</a>, reaching <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>, where he conducted a two-hour interview with the <a href="Mormon">Mormon</a> leader, <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a>, the first newspaper interview Young had given. Greeley encountered Native Americans, and was sympathetic, but like many of his time, deemed Indian culture inferior. In California, he toured widely and gave many addresses.

Although he remained on cordial terms with Senator Seward, Greeley never seriously considered supporting him in his bid for the Republican nomination for president. Instead, during the run-up to the <a href="1860%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1860 Republican National Convention</a> in Chicago, he pressed the candidacy of former Missouri representative <a href="Edward%20Bates">Edward Bates</a>, an opponent of the spread of slavery who had freed his own slaves. In his newspaper, in speeches, and in conversation, Greeley pushed Bates as a man who could win the North and even make inroads in the South. Nevertheless, when one of the <a href="dark%20horse%20candidate">dark horse candidate</a>s for the Republican nomination, Abraham Lincoln, came to New York to give <a href="Cooper%20Union%20speech">an address</a> at <a href="Cooper%20Union">Cooper Union</a>, Greeley urged his readers to go hear Lincoln, and was among those who accompanied him to the platform. Greeley thought of Lincoln as a possible nominee for vice president.

Greeley attended the convention as a substitute for a delegate from Oregon who was unable to attend. In Chicago, he promoted Bates but deemed his cause hopeless and felt that Seward would be nominated. In conversations with other delegates, he predicted that, if nominated, Seward could not carry crucial battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Greeley's estrangement from Seward was not widely known, giving the editor more credibility. Greeley (and Seward) biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen noted that it is uncertain how great a part Greeley played in Seward's defeat by Lincoln—he had little success gaining delegates for Bates. On the first two ballots, Seward led Lincoln, but on the second only by a small margin. After the third ballot, on which Lincoln was nominated, Greeley was seen among the Oregon delegation, a broad smile on his face. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian <a href="Doris%20Kearns%20Goodwin">Doris Kearns Goodwin</a>, "it is hard to imagine Lincoln letting Greeley's resentment smolder for years as Seward did".

Seward's forces made Greeley a target of their anger at the senator's defeat. One subscriber cancelled, regretting the three-cent stamp he had to use on the letter; Greeley supplied a replacement. When he was attacked in print, Greeley responded in kind. He launched a campaign against corruption in the <a href="New%20York%20Legislature">New York Legislature</a>, hoping voters would defeat incumbents and the new legislators would elect him to the Senate when Seward's term expired in 1861 (senators were until 1913 elected by state legislatures). But his main activity during the campaign of 1860 was boosting Lincoln and denigrating the other presidential candidates. He made it clear that a Republican administration would not interfere with slavery where it already was, and denied that Lincoln was in favor of voting rights for African Americans. He kept up the pressure until Lincoln was elected in November.

Lincoln soon let it be known that Seward would be <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>, meaning he would not be a candidate for re-election to the Senate. Weed wanted <a href="William%20M.%20Evarts">William M. Evarts</a> elected in his place, while the anti-Seward forces in New York gathered around Greeley. The crucial battleground was the Republican caucus, as the party held the majority in the legislature. Greeley's forces did not have enough votes to send him to the Senate, but they had enough strength to block Evarts's candidacy. Weed threw his support to <a href="Ira%20Harris">Ira Harris</a>, who had already received several votes, and who was chosen by the caucus and elected by the legislature in February 1861. Weed was content to have blocked the editor, and stated that he had "paid the "first" installment on a large debt to Mr. Greeley".

After Lincoln's election, there was talk of secession in the South. The "Tribune" was initially in favor of peaceful separation, with the South becoming a separate nation. According to an editorial on November 9:

Similar editorials appeared through January 1861, after which "Tribune" editorials took a hard line on the South, opposing concessions. Williams concludes that "for a brief moment, Horace Greeley had believed that peaceful secession might be a form of freedom preferable to civil war". This brief flirtation with disunion would have consequences for Greeley—it was used against him by his opponents when he ran for president in 1872.

In the days leading up to <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln's inauguration</a>, the "Tribune" headed its editorial columns each day, in large capital letters: "No compromise!/No concession to traitors!/The Constitution as it is!" Greeley attended the inauguration, sitting close to Senator Douglas, as the "Tribune" hailed the beginning of Lincoln's presidency. When southern forces <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">attacked Fort Sumter</a>, the "Tribune" regretted the loss of the fort, but applauded the fact that war to subdue the rebels, who formed the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>, would now take place. The paper criticized Lincoln for not being quick to use force.

Through the spring and early summer of 1861, Greeley and the "Tribune" beat the drum for a Union attack. "On to Richmond", a phrase coined by a "Tribune" <a href="stringer%20%28journalism%29">stringer</a>, became the watchword of the newspaper as Greeley urged the occupation of the rebel capital of Richmond before the <a href="Confederate%20Congress">Confederate Congress</a> could meet on July 20. In part because of the public pressure, Lincoln sent the half-trained <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> into the field at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Manassas">First Battle of Manassas</a> in mid-July where it was soundly beaten. The defeat threw Greeley into despair, and he may have suffered a nervous breakdown.

Restored to health by two weeks at the farm he had purchased in Chappaqua, Greeley returned to the "Tribune" and a policy of general backing of the Lincoln administration, even having kind words to say about Secretary Seward, his old foe. He was supportive even during the military defeats of the first year of the war. Late in 1861, he proposed to Lincoln through an intermediary that the president provide him with advance information as to its policies, in exchange for friendly coverage in the "Tribune". Lincoln eagerly accepted, "having him firmly behind me will be as helpful to me as an army of one hundred thousand men."

By early 1862, however, Greeley was again sometimes critical of the administration, frustrated by the failure to win decisive military victories, and perturbed at the president's slowness to commit to the emancipation of the slaves once the Confederacy was defeated, something the "Tribune" was urging in its editorials. This was a change in Greeley's thinking which began after First Manassas, a shift from preservation of the Union being the primary war purpose to wanting the war to end slavery. By March, the only action against slavery that Lincoln had backed was a proposal for compensated emancipation in the <a href="border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a> that had remained loyal to the Union, though he signed legislation abolishing slavery in the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a>. Lincoln supposedly asked a "Tribune" correspondent, "What in the world is the matter with Uncle Horace? Why can't he restrain himself and wait a little while?"

Greeley's prodding of Lincoln culminated in a letter to him on August 19, 1862, reprinted on the following day in the "Tribune" as the "Prayer of Twenty Millions". By this time, Lincoln had informed his Cabinet of the preliminary <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> he had composed, and Greeley was told of it the same day the prayer was printed. In his letter, Greeley demanded action on emancipation, and strict enforcement of the <a href="Confiscation%20Acts">Confiscation Acts</a>. Lincoln must "fight slavery with liberty", and not fight "wolves with the devices of a sheep".

Lincoln's reply would become famous, much more so than the prayer that provoked it. "My paramount object in this struggle "is" to save the Union, and is "not" either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing "any" slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing "all" the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do "not" believe it would help to save the Union." Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife <a href="Frances%20Seward">Frances</a> complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a "great boon of freedom". According to Williams, "Lincoln's war for Union was now also Greeley's war for emancipation."

After the Union victory <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">at Gettysburg</a> in early July 1863, the "Tribune" wrote that the rebellion would be quickly "stamped out". A week after the battle, the <a href="New%20York%20City%20draft%20riots">New York City draft riots</a> erupted. Greeley and the "Tribune" were generally supportive of <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">conscription</a>, though feeling that the rich should not be allowed to evade it by hiring substitutes. Support for the draft made them targets of the mob, and the <a href="New%20York%20Tribune%20Building">"Tribune" Building</a> was surrounded, and at least once invaded. Greeley secured arms from the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> and 150 soldiers kept the building secure. Mary Greeley and her children were at the farm in Chappaqua; a mob threatened them, but dispersed without doing harm.

In August 1863, Greeley was requested by a firm of Hartford publishers to write a history of the war. Greeley agreed, and over the next eight months penned a 600-page volume, which would be the first of two, entitled "The American Conflict". The books were very successful, selling a total of 225,000 copies by 1870, a large sale for the time.

Throughout the war, Greeley played with ideas as to how to settle it. In 1862, Greeley had approached the French minister to Washington, <a href="Henri%20Mercier">Henri Mercier</a>, to discuss a mediated settlement. However, Seward rejected such talks and the prospect of European intervention receded after the bloody Union victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Antietam</a> in September 1862. In July 1864, Greeley received word that there were Confederate commissioners in Canada, empowered to offer peace. In fact, the men were in <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Niagara Falls</a>, Canada to aid <a href="Peace%20Democrats">Peace Democrats</a> and otherwise undermine the Union war effort. but they played along when Greeley journeyed to Niagara Falls, at Lincoln's request: the president was willing to consider any deal that included reunion and emancipation. The Confederates had no credentials and were unwilling to accompany Greeley to Washington under safe conduct. Greeley returned to New York, and the episode, when it became public, embarrassed the administration. Lincoln said nothing publicly concerning Greeley's credulous conduct, but privately indicated that he had no confidence in him anymore.

Greeley did not initially support Lincoln for nomination in 1864, casting about for other candidates. In February, he wrote in the "Tribune" that Lincoln could not be elected to a second term. Nevertheless, no candidate made a serious challenge to Lincoln, who was nominated in June, which the "Tribune" applauded slightly. In August, fearing a Democratic victory and acceptance of the Confederacy, Greeley engaged in a plot to get a new convention to nominate another candidate, with Lincoln withdrawing. The plot came to nothing. Once <a href="Battle%20of%20Atlanta">Atlanta was taken</a> by Union forces on September 3, Greeley became a fervent supporter of Lincoln. Greeley was gratified both by <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">Lincoln's re-election</a> and continued Union victories.

As the war drew to a close in April 1865, Greeley and the "Tribune" urged magnanimity towards the defeated Confederates, arguing that making martyrs of Confederate leaders would only inspire future rebels. This talk of moderation ceased when <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln was assassinated</a> by <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a>. Many concluded that Lincoln had fallen as the result of a final rebel plot, and the new president, <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, offered $100,000 for the capture of fugitive Confederate president <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>. After the rebel leader was caught, Greeley initially advocated that "punishment be meted out in accord with a just verdict".

Through 1866, Greeley editorialized that Davis, who was being held at <a href="Fortress%20Monroe">Fortress Monroe</a>, should either be set free or put on trial. Davis's wife <a href="Varina%20Davis">Varina</a> urged Greeley to use his influence to gain her husband's release. In May 1867, a Richmond judge set bail for the former Confederate president at $100,000. Greeley was among those who signed the <a href="bail%20bond">bail bond</a>, and the two men met briefly at the courthouse. This act resulted in public anger against Greeley in the North. Sales of the second volume of his history (published in 1866) declined sharply. Subscriptions to the "Tribune" (especially the "Weekly Tribune") also dropped off, though they recovered during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201868">1868 election</a>.

Initially supportive of Andrew Johnson's lenient <a href="Reconstruction%20era">Reconstruction</a> policies, Greeley soon became disillusioned, as the president's plan allowed the quick formation of state governments without securing <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> for the freedman. When Congress convened in December 1865, and gradually took control of Reconstruction, he was generally supportive, as <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> pushed hard for universal male suffrage and civil rights for freedmen. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866, but lost badly, and for Senate in the legislative election held in early 1867, losing to <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a>.

As president and Congress battled, Greeley remained firmly opposed to the president, and when <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">Johnson was impeached</a> in March 1868, Greeley and the "Tribune" strongly supported his removal, attacking Johnson as "an aching tooth in the national jaw, a screeching infant in a crowded lecture room," and declaring, "There can be no peace or comfort till he is out." Nevertheless, the president was acquitted by the Senate, much to Greeley's disappointment. Also in 1868, Greeley sought the Republican nomination for governor, but was frustrated by the Conkling forces. Greeley supported the successful Republican presidential nominee, General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201868">1868 election</a>.

In 1868, <a href="Whitelaw%20Reid">Whitelaw Reid</a> joined the "Tribune" 's staff as managing editor. In Reid, Greeley found a reliable second-in-command. Also on the Tribune's staff in the late 1860s was <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>; <a href="Henry%20George">Henry George</a> sometimes contributed pieces, as did <a href="Bret%20Harte">Bret Harte</a>. In 1870, <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a> joined the staff as an editorial writer. Greeley soon pronounced Hay the most brilliant at that craft ever to write for the "Tribune".

Greeley maintained his interest in <a href="American%20Union%20of%20Associationists">associationism</a>. Beginning in 1869, he was heavily involved in an attempt to found a utopia, called the <a href="Union%20Colony%20of%20Colorado">Union Colony of Colorado</a>, on the prairie in a scheme led by <a href="Nathan%20Meeker">Nathan Meeker</a>. The new town of <a href="Greeley%2C%20Colorado">Greeley</a>, <a href="Colorado%20Territory">Colorado Territory</a> was named after him. He served as treasurer and lent Meeker money to keep the colony afloat. In 1871, Greeley published a book "What I Know About Farming", based on his childhood experience and that from his country home in Chappaqua.

Greeley continued to seek political office, running for <a href="Comptroller%20of%20New%20York">state comptroller</a> in 1869 and the House of Representatives in 1870, losing both times. In 1870, President Grant offered Greeley the post of minister to Santo Domingo (today, the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>), which he declined.

As had been the case for much of the 19th century, political parties continued to be formed and to vanish after the Civil War. In September 1871, Missouri Senator <a href="Carl%20Schurz">Carl Schurz</a> formed the <a href="Liberal%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Liberal Republican Party</a>, founded on opposition to President Grant, opposition to corruption, and support of civil service reform, lower taxes, and land reform. He gathered around him an eclectic group of supporters whose only real link was their opposition to Grant, whose administration had proved increasingly corrupt. The party needed a candidate, with a presidential election upcoming. Greeley was one of the best-known Americans, as well as being a perennial candidate for office. He was more minded to consider a run for the Republican nomination, fearing the effect on the "Tribune" should he bolt the party. Nevertheless, he wanted to be president, as a Republican if possible, if not, as a Liberal Republican.

The Liberal Republican national convention met in Cincinnati in May 1872. Greeley was spoken of as a possible candidate, as was Missouri Governor <a href="Benjamin%20Gratz%20Brown">Benjamin Gratz Brown</a>. Schurz was ineligible as foreign-born. On the first ballot, Supreme Court Justice <a href="David%20Davis%20%28Supreme%20Court%20justice%29">David Davis</a> led, but Greeley took a narrow lead on the second ballot. Former minister to Britain <a href="Charles%20Francis%20Adams%2C%20Sr.">Charles Francis Adams</a> took the lead, but on the sixth ballot, after a "spontaneous" demonstration staged by Reid, Greeley gained the nomination, with Brown as vice presidential candidate.
The Democrats, when they met in Baltimore in July, faced a stark choice—either nominate Greeley, long a thorn in their side, or split the anti-Grant vote and go to certain defeat. They chose the former, and even adopted the Liberal Republican platform, calling for equal rights for African Americans. This was the first time one man had been nominated for president by two political parties. Greeley resigned as editor of the "Tribune" for the campaign, and, unusually for the time, embarked on a speaking tour to bring his message to the people. As it was more usual for candidates for major office to not actively campaign, he was attacked as a seeker after office. Nevertheless, in late July, Greeley (and others, such as former Ohio governor <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>) thought he would very likely be elected. Greeley campaigned on a platform of intersectional reconciliation, arguing that the war was over and the issue of slavery was resolved. It was time to restore normality and end the continuing military occupation of the South.

The Republican counterattack was well-financed, accusing Greeley of support for everything from treason to the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. The anti-Greeley campaign was famously and effectively summed up in the cartoons of <a href="Thomas%20Nast">Thomas Nast</a>, whom Grant later credited with a major role in his re-election. Nast's cartoons showed Greeley giving bail money for Jefferson Davis, throwing mud on Grant, and shaking hands with John Wilkes Booth across Lincoln's grave. The <a href="Cr%C3%A9dit%20Mobilier%20of%20America%20scandal">Crédit Mobilier scandal</a>—corruption in the financing of the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a>—broke in September, but Greeley was unable to take advantage of the Grant administration's ties to the scandal as he had stock in the railroad himself, and some alleged it had been given to him in exchange for favorable coverage.

Greeley's wife Mary had returned ill from a trip to Europe in late June. Her condition worsened in October, and he effectively broke off campaigning after October 12 to be with her. She died on October 30, plunging him into despair a week before the election. Poor results for the Democrats in those states that had elections for other offices in September and October presaged defeat for Greeley, and so it proved. He received 2,834,125 votes to 3,597,132 for Grant, who secured 286 electors to 66 chosen for Greeley. The editor-turned-candidate won only six states (out of 37): Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas.

Greeley resumed the editorship of the "Tribune", but quickly learned there was a movement under way to unseat him. He found himself unable to sleep, and after a final visit to the "Tribune" on November 13 (a week after the election) remained under medical care. At the recommendation of a family physician, Greeley was sent to <a href="Choate%20House%20%28New%20York%29">Choate House</a>, the asylum of Dr. <a href="George%20Choate">George Choate</a> at <a href="Pleasantville%2C%20New%20York">Pleasantville, New York</a>. There, he continued to worsen, and died on November 29, with his two surviving daughters and Whitelaw Reid at his side.

His death came before the Electoral College balloted. His 66 electoral votes were divided among four others, principally Indiana governor-elect <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Hendricks">Thomas A. Hendricks</a> and Greeley's vice presidential running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown.

Although Greeley had requested a simple funeral, his daughters ignored his wishes and arranged a grand affair at the <a href="Fourth%20Universalist%20Society%20in%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York">Church of the Divine Paternity</a>, later the <a href="Fourth%20Universalist%20Society%20in%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York">Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York</a>, where Greeley was a member. He is buried in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>'s <a href="Green-Wood%20Cemetery">Green-Wood Cemetery</a>. Among the mourners were old friends, "Tribune" employees including Reid and Hay, his journalistic rivals, and a broad array of politicians, led by President Grant.
Despite the venom that had been spewed over him in the presidential campaign, Greeley's death was publicly mourned. "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>", which had printed Nast's cartoons, wrote, "Since the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, the death of no American has been so sincerely deplored as that of Horace Greeley; and its tragical circumstances have given a peculiarly affectionate pathos to all that has been said of him." <a href="Henry%20Ward%20Beecher">Henry Ward Beecher</a> wrote in the "<a href="The%20Outlook%20%28New%20York%29">Christian Union</a>", "when Horace Greeley died, unjust and hard judgment of him died also". <a href="Harriett%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriett Beecher Stowe</a> noted Greeley's eccentric dress, "That poor white hat! If, alas, it covered many weaknesses, it covered also much strength, much real kindness and benevolence, and much that the world will be better for".

Historian Iver Bernstein says:

Greeley's view of freedom was based in the desire that all should have the opportunity to better themselves. According to his biographer, Erik S. Lunde, "a dedicated social reformer deeply sympathetic to the treatment of poor white males, slaves, free blacks, and white women, he still espoused the virtues of self-help and free enterprise". Van Deusen stated: "His genuine human sympathies, his moral fervor, even the exhibitionism that was a part of his makeup, made it inevitable that he should crusade for a better world. He did so with apostolic zeal."

Nevertheless, Greeley's effectiveness as a reformer was undermined by his idiosyncrasies: according to Williams, he "must have looked like an apparition, a man of eccentric habits dressed in an old linen coat that made him look like a farmer who came into town for supplies". Van Deusen wrote, "Greeley's effectiveness as a crusader was limited by some of his traits and characteristics. Culturally deficient, he was to the end ignorant of his own limitations, and this ignorance was a great handicap."

The "Tribune" remained under that name until 1924, when it merged with the <a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York "Herald"</a> to become the <a href="New%20York%20Herald-Tribune">New York "Herald-Tribune"</a>, which was published until 1966. The name survived until 2013, when the "<a href="International%20Herald-Tribune">International Herald-Tribune</a>" became the "<a href="International%20New%20York%20Times">International New York Times</a>".

There is a statue of Greeley in <a href="City%20Hall%20Park%2C%20Manhattan">City Hall Park</a> in New York, donated by the Tribune Association. Cast in 1890, it was not dedicated until 1916. A second statue of Greeley is located in <a href="Greeley%20Square">Greeley Square</a> in <a href="Midtown%20Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>. Greeley Square, at Broadway and 33rd Street, was named by the New York City Common Council in a vote after Greeley's death. Van Deusen concluded his biography of Greeley:

Winfield Scott Hancock

Winfield Scott Hancock (February 14, 1824 – February 9, 1886) was a career <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> officer and the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> nominee for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201880">1880</a>. He served with distinction in the Army for four decades, including service in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> and as a <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">general</a> in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. Known to his Army colleagues as "Hancock the Superb", he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> in 1863. One military historian wrote, "No other Union general at Gettysburg dominated men by the sheer force of their presence more completely than Hancock." As another wrote, "his tactical skill had won him the quick admiration of adversaries who had come to know him as the 'Thunderbolt of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>'." His military service continued after the Civil War, as Hancock participated in the military <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a> of <a href="Southern%20United%20States">the South</a> and the Army's presence at the Western <a href="Frontier%23United%20States">frontier</a>.

Hancock's reputation as a war hero at Gettysburg, combined with his status as a Unionist and supporter of states' rights, made him a potential presidential candidate. His noted integrity was a counterpoint to the corruption of the era, for as President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> said,If, when we make up our estimate of a public man, conspicuous both as a soldier and in civil life, we are to think first and chiefly of his manhood, his integrity, his purity, his singleness of purpose, and his unselfish devotion to duty, we can truthfully say of Hancock that he was through and through pure gold.When the Democrats nominated him for President in 1880, he ran a strong campaign, but was narrowly defeated by <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a>.

Winfield Scott Hancock and his <a href="Twin%23Monozygotic%20twins">identical twin</a> brother Hilary Baker Hancock were born on February 14, 1824, in Montgomery Square, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, a hamlet just northwest of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in present-day <a href="Montgomery%20Township%2C%20Montgomery%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Montgomery Township</a>. The twins were the sons of Benjamin Franklin Hancock and Elizabeth Hoxworth Hancock. Winfield was named after <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>, a prominent general in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

The Hancock and Hoxworth families had lived in <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Montgomery County</a> for several generations, and were of <a href="English%20American">English</a>, <a href="Scottish%20American">Scottish</a> and <a href="Welsh%20American">Welsh</a> descent. Benjamin Hancock was a schoolteacher when his sons were born. A few years after their birth, he moved the family to <a href="Norristown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Norristown</a>, the county seat, and began to practice law. Benjamin was also a deacon in the <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> church and participated in municipal government (as an avowed <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a>).

Hancock was at first educated at <a href="Norristown%20Academy">Norristown Academy</a>, but removed to the <a href="Public%20school%20%28government%20funded%29">public schools</a> when the first one opened in Norristown in the late 1830s. In 1840, <a href="Joseph%20Fornance">Joseph Fornance</a>, the local Congressman, nominated Hancock to the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point</a>. Hancock's progress at West Point was average. He graduated 18th in his class of 25 in 1844, and he was assigned to the <a href="infantry">infantry</a>.

Hancock was commissioned a <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> <a href="Second%20Lieutenant%23United%20States">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="6th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">6th U.S. Infantry</a> regiment, and initially was stationed in <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a> in the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20South">Red River</a> Valley. The region was quiet at the time, and Hancock's time there was uneventful. Upon the outbreak of <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">war with Mexico</a> in 1846, Hancock worked to secure himself a place at the front. Initially assigned to recruiting duties in <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, he proved so adept at signing up soldiers that his superiors were reluctant to release him from his post. By July 1847, however, Hancock was permitted to join his regiment in <a href="Puebla%2C%20Puebla">Puebla</a>, Mexico, where they made up a part of the army led by his namesake, General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>.

Scott's army moved farther inland from Puebla unopposed and attacked <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> from the south. During that campaign in 1847, Hancock first encountered battle at <a href="Battle%20of%20Contreras">Contreras</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Churubusco">Churubusco</a>. He was appointed a brevet <a href="First%20Lieutenant%23United%20States">first lieutenant</a> for gallant and meritorious service in those actions. Hancock was wounded in the knee at Churubusco and developed a fever. Although he was well enough to join his regiment at <a href="Battle%20of%20Molino%20del%20Rey">Molino del Rey</a>, fever kept Hancock from participating in the final <a href="Battle%20of%20Chapultepec">breakthrough to Mexico City</a>, something he would regret for the rest of his life. After the final victory, Hancock remained in Mexico with the 6th Infantry until the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Guadalupe%20Hidalgo">treaty of peace</a> was signed in 1848.

Hancock served in a number of assignments as an army <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Quartermaster%20Corps">quartermaster</a> and <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>, mostly in <a href="Fort%20Snelling%2C%20Minnesota">Fort Snelling</a>, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. It was in St. Louis that he met Almira ("Allie") Russell and they married on January 24, 1850. Allie gave birth to two children, Russell in 1850 and Ada in 1857, but both children died before their parents. Hancock was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">captain</a> in 1855 and assigned to <a href="Fort%20Myers%2C%20Florida">Fort Myers</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Hancock's young family accompanied him to his new posting, where Allie Hancock was the only woman on the post.

Hancock's tour in Florida coincided with the end of the <a href="Seminole%20War">Third Seminole War</a>. His duties were primarily those of a <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>, and he did not see action in that campaign. As the situation in Florida began to settle down, Hancock was reassigned to <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>. He served in the West during the partisan warfare of "<a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">Bleeding Kansas</a>", and in the <a href="Utah%20Territory">Utah Territory</a>, where the 6th Infantry arrived after the <a href="Utah%20War">Utah War</a>. Following the resolution of that conflict, Hancock was stationed in southern <a href="California">California</a> in November 1858. He remained there, joined by Allie and the children, until the Civil War broke out in 1861, serving as a captain and assistant quartermaster under future <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> General <a href="Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a>. In California, Hancock became friendly with a number of southern officers, most significantly <a href="Lewis%20A.%20Armistead">Lewis A. Armistead</a> of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Armistead and the other southerners left to join the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a>, while Hancock remained in the service of the United States.

Hancock returned east to assume quartermaster duties for the rapidly growing <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>, but was quickly promoted to <a href="Brigadier%20General%23United%20States">brigadier general</a> on September 23, 1861, and given an <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="brigade">brigade</a> to command in the division of Brig. Gen. <a href="William%20Farrar%20Smith">William F. "Baldy" Smith</a>, <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>. He earned his "Superb" nickname in the <a href="Peninsula%20Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a>, in 1862, by leading a critical counterattack in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Williamsburg">Battle of Williamsburg</a>; army commander <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> telegraphed to Washington that "Hancock was superb today" and the appellation stuck. McClellan did not follow through on Hancock's initiative, however, and Confederate forces were allowed to withdraw unmolested.

In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>, Hancock assumed command of the 1st Division, <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">II Corps</a>, following the mortal wounding of Maj. Gen. <a href="Israel%20B.%20Richardson">Israel B. Richardson</a> in the horrific fighting at "Bloody Lane". Hancock and his staff made a dramatic entrance to the battlefield, galloping between his troops and the enemy, parallel to the Sunken Road. His men assumed that Hancock would order counterattacks against the exhausted Confederates, but he carried orders from McClellan to hold his position. He was promoted to major general of volunteers on November 29, 1862. He led his division in the disastrous attack on Marye's Heights in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a> the following month and was wounded in the abdomen. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a>, his division covered Maj. Gen. <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>'s withdrawal and Hancock was wounded again. His corps commander, Maj. Gen. <a href="Darius%20N.%20Couch">Darius N. Couch</a>, transferred out of the Army of the Potomac in protest of actions Hooker took in the battle and Hancock assumed command of II Corps, which he would lead until shortly before the war's end.

Hancock's most famous service was as a new corps commander at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, July 1 to 3, 1863. After his friend, Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20F.%20Reynolds">John F. Reynolds</a>, was killed early on July 1, Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20G.%20Meade">George G. Meade</a>, the new commander of the Army of the Potomac, sent Hancock ahead to take command of the units on the field and assess the situation. Hancock thus was in temporary command of the "left wing" of the army, consisting of the <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">I</a>, II, <a href="III%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">III</a>, and <a href="XI%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">XI Corps</a>. This demonstrated Meade's high confidence in him, because Hancock was not the most senior Union officer at Gettysburg at the time. Hancock and the more senior XI Corps commander, Maj. Gen. <a href="Oliver%20O.%20Howard">Oliver O. Howard</a>, argued briefly about this command arrangement, but Hancock prevailed and he organized the Union defenses on <a href="Cemetery%20Hill">Cemetery Hill</a> as more numerous Confederate forces drove the I and XI Corps back through the town. He had the authority from Meade to withdraw the forces, so he was responsible for the decision to stand and fight at Gettysburg. At the conclusion of the day's action, Maj. Gen. <a href="Henry%20Warner%20Slocum">Henry Warner Slocum</a> arrived on the field and assumed command until Gen. Meade arrived after midnight.

On July 2, Hancock's II Corps was positioned on <a href="Cemetery%20Ridge">Cemetery Ridge</a>, roughly in the center of the Union line, while Confederate <a href="Full%20General%20%28CSA%29">General</a> <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> launched assaults on both ends of the line. On the Union left, <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28CSA%29">Lt. Gen.</a> <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a>'s assault smashed the III Corps and Hancock sent in his 1st Division, under Brig. Gen. <a href="John%20C.%20Caldwell">John C. Caldwell</a>, to reinforce the Union in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg%2C%20Second%20Day%23Wheatfield">Wheatfield</a>. As Lt. Gen. <a href="A.P.%20Hill">A.P. Hill</a>'s corps continued the attack toward the Union center, Hancock rallied the defenses and rushed units to the critical spots. First, he issued the Third Brigade of his Third Division under Colonel George Willard into the fray to stop the advance of Confederate Brigadier General William Barksdale's Brigade. In one famous incident, he sacrificed a regiment, the <a href="1st%20Minnesota%20Volunteer%20Infantry">1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, by ordering it to advance and charge a Confederate brigade four times its size, causing the Minnesotans to suffer 87% casualties. While costly to the regiment, this heroic sacrifice bought time to organize the defensive line and saved the day for the Union army. Following the action toward his right, he met the <a href="13th%20Vermont%20Infantry">13th Vermont Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, a First Corps unit which had come from Cemetery Hill to help quell the crisis. Hancock sent them out to recover some artillery pieces Confederates had taken and were pulling away. The Vermonters were successful. Having stabilized his line, he turned his attention to the sound of fighting on East Cemetery Hill. There, with darkness falling, Confederates from Major General <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a>'s Division had gotten into Union batteries and were fighting the cannoneers hand-to-hand. Hancock sent the First Brigade of his Third Division, under Colonel Samuel S. Carroll, to the fighting. The brigade was crucial in flushing the enemy out of the batteries and dispatching them back down the face of East Cemetery Hill.

On July 3, Hancock continued in his position on Cemetery Ridge and thus bore the brunt of <a href="Pickett%27s%20Charge">Pickett's Charge</a>. During the massive Confederate artillery bombardment that preceded the infantry assault, Hancock was prominent on horseback in reviewing and encouraging his troops. When one of his subordinates protested, "General, the corps commander ought not to risk his life that way," Hancock is said to have replied, "There are times when a corps commander's life does not count." During the infantry assault, his old friend, now <a href="Brig.%20Gen.%20%28CSA%29">Brig. Gen.</a> <a href="Lewis%20A.%20Armistead">Lewis A. Armistead</a>, leading a brigade in <a href="Maj.%20Gen.%20%28CSA%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="George%20Pickett">George Pickett</a>'s division, was wounded and died two days later. Hancock could not meet with his friend because he had just been wounded himself, a severe wound caused by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. Helped from his horse by aides, and with a <a href="tourniquet">tourniquet</a> applied to staunch the bleeding, he removed the saddle nail himself and, mistaking its source, remarked wryly, "They must be hard up for ammunition when they throw such shot as that." News of Armistead's mortal wounding was brought to Hancock by a member of his staff, Captain <a href="Henry%20H.%20Bingham">Henry H. Bingham</a>. Despite his pain, Hancock refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was resolved. He had been an inspiration for his troops throughout the three-day battle. Hancock later received the thanks of the <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> for "... his gallant, meritorious and conspicuous share in that great and decisive victory."

Hancock suffered from the effects of his Gettysburg wound for the rest of the war. After recuperating in Norristown, he performed recruiting services over the winter and returned in the spring to field command of the II Corps for Lt. Gen. <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s 1864 <a href="Overland%20Campaign">Overland Campaign</a>, but he never regained full mobility and his former youthful energy. Nevertheless, he performed well at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Wilderness">Battle of the Wilderness</a> and commanded a critical breakthrough assault of the Mule Shoe at the "Bloody Angle" in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Spotsylvania%20Court%20House">Battle of Spotsylvania Court House</a> on May 12, shattering the Confederate defenders in his front, including the <a href="Stonewall%20Brigade">Stonewall Brigade</a>. His corps suffered enormous losses during a futile assault Grant ordered at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cold%20Harbor">Cold Harbor</a>.

After Grant's army slipped past Lee's army to cross the <a href="James%20River%20%28Virginia%29">James River</a>, Hancock found himself in a position from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support <a href="William%20Farrar%20Smith">William Farrar Smith</a>'s assaults on the lightly held <a href="Petersburg%2C%20Virginia">Petersburg</a> defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and had been on the field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost. After his corps participated in the assaults at <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Deep%20Bottom">Deep Bottom</a>, Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the <a href="Regular%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">regular army</a>, effective August 12, 1864.

Hancock's only significant military defeat occurred during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>. His II Corps moved south of the city, along the <a href="Wilmington%20and%20Weldon%20Railroad">Wilmington and Weldon Railroad</a>, tearing up track. On August 25, Confederate Maj. Gen. <a href="Henry%20Heth">Henry Heth</a> attacked and overran the faulty Union position at <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Ream%27s%20Station">Reams's Station</a>, shattering the II Corps, capturing many prisoners. Despite a later victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Boydton%20Plank%20Road">Hatcher's Run</a>, the humiliation of Reams's Station contributed, along with the lingering effects of his Gettysburg wound, to his decision to give up field command in November. He left the II Corps after a year in which it had suffered over 40,000 casualties, but had achieved significant military victories. His next assignment was to command the ceremonial <a href="First%20Veteran%20Corps">First Veteran Corps</a>. He performed more recruiting, commanded the Middle Department, and relieved Maj. Gen. <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a> in command of forces in the now-quiet <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>. He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army for his service at Spotsylvania, effective March 13, 1865.

At the close of the war, Hancock was assigned to supervise the execution of the <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20assassination">Lincoln assassination</a> conspirators. Lincoln had been assassinated on April 14, 1865, and by May 9 of that year, a military commission had been convened to try the accused. The actual assassin, <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a>, was already dead, but the trial of his co-conspirators proceeded quickly, resulting in convictions. President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> ordered the executions to be carried out on July 7. Although he was reluctant to execute some of the less-culpable conspirators, especially <a href="Mary%20Surratt">Mary Surratt</a>, Hancock carried out his orders, later writing that "every soldier was bound to act as I did under similar circumstances."

After the executions, Hancock was assigned command of the newly organized <a href="Middle%20Military%20Department">Middle Military Department</a>, headquartered in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>. In 1866, on Grant's recommendation, Hancock was promoted to major general and was transferred, later that year, to command of the military <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Missouri">Department of the Missouri</a>, which included the states of <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, and <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>. Hancock reported to <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a>, Kansas, and took up his new posting. Soon after arriving, he was assigned by General <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">Sherman</a> to lead an expedition to negotiate with the <a href="Cheyenne">Cheyenne</a> and <a href="Sioux">Sioux</a>, with whom relations had worsened since the <a href="Sand%20Creek%20massacre">Sand Creek massacre</a>. The negotiations got off to a bad start, and after Hancock ordered the burning of an abandoned Cheyenne village in central Kansas, relations became worse than when the expedition had started. There was little loss of life on either side, but the mission could not be called a success.

Hancock's time in the West was brief. President Johnson, unhappy with the way Republican generals were governing the South under <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>, sought replacements for them. The general who offended Johnson the most was <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking. Although neither man was pleased with the change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>.

Hancock's new assignment found him in charge of the <a href="Fifth%20Military%20District">Fifth Military District</a>, covering <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. Almost immediately upon arriving, Hancock ingratiated himself with the white conservative population by issuing his General Order Number 40 of November 29, 1867. In that order, written while traveling to New Orleans, Hancock expressed sentiments in support of President Johnson's policies, writing that if the residents of the district conducted themselves peacefully and the civilian officials perform their duties, then "the military power should cease to lead, and the civil administration resume its natural and rightful dominion." The order continued:

Hancock's order encouraged white Democrats across the South who hoped to return to civilian government more quickly, but discomforted blacks and Republicans in the South who feared a return to the antebellum ways of conservative white dominance.

Hancock's General Order Number 40 was quickly condemned by Republicans in Washington, especially by the <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radicals</a>, while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless of the situation in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew to the extent that he was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201868">the 1868 election</a>. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.

Following <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">General Grant's</a> 1868 presidential victory, the Republicans were firmly in charge in Washington. As a result, Hancock found himself transferred, this time away from the sensitive assignment of reconstructing the South and into the relative backwater that was the <a href="Department%20of%20Dakota">Department of Dakota</a>. The Department covered <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, <a href="Montana%20Territory">Montana</a>, and <a href="Dakota%20Territory">the Dakotas</a>. As in his previous Western command, Hancock began with a conference of the Indian chiefs, but this time was more successful in establishing a peaceful intent. Relations worsened in 1870, however, as an army expedition committed <a href="Marias%20massacre">a massacre</a> against the <a href="Blackfoot">Blackfeet</a>. Relations with the <a href="Sioux">Sioux</a> also became contentious as a result of white encroachment into the <a href="Black%20Hills">Black Hills</a>, in violation of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Laramie%20%281868%29">Treaty of Fort Laramie</a>. Still, war was averted, for the time being, and most of Hancock's command was peaceful.

It was during this tour that Hancock had the opportunity to contribute to the creation of <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>. In August 1870, he ordered the 2nd Cavalry at <a href="Fort%20Ellis">Fort Ellis</a> to provide a military escort for General <a href="Henry%20D.%20Washburn">Henry D. Washburn</a>'s planned exploration of the Yellowstone Region. The expedition, which was a major impetus in creating the park, became known as the <a href="Washburn-Langford-Doane%20Expedition">Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition</a>. Hancock's order led to the assignment of Lt. <a href="Gustavus%20Cheyney%20Doane">Gustavus Cheyney Doane</a> and a troop of 5 cavalrymen from Fort Ellis to escort the expedition. In 1871, Captain <a href="John%20W.%20Barlow">John W. Barlow</a> during his exploration of the Yellowstone region formally named a summit on what would become the southern boundary of the park <a href="Mount%20Hancock%20%28Wyoming%29">Mount Hancock</a> to honor the general's decision to provide the escort.

In 1872, <a href="George%20Meade">General Meade</a> died, leaving Hancock the army's senior major general. This entitled him to a more prominent command, and President Grant, still desirous to keep Hancock from a Southern post, assigned him command of the <a href="Division%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Division of the Atlantic</a>, headquartered at <a href="Fort%20Columbus">Fort Columbus</a> on <a href="Governors%20Island">Governors Island</a>, in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. The vast department covered the settled northeast area of the country and was militarily uneventful with the exception of the army's involvement in the <a href="Great%20Railroad%20Strike%20of%201877">Great Railroad Strike of 1877</a>. When railroad workers went on strike to protest wage cuts, the nation's transportation system was paralyzed. The governors of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland asked President Hayes to call in federal troops to re-open the railways. Once federal troops entered the cities, most of the strikers melted away, but there were some violent clashes.

All the while Hancock was posted in New York, he did his best to keep his political ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' <a href="1876%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1876 convention</a>, but was never a serious contender as New York governor <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a> swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20States%29">electoral crisis</a> of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.

Hancock's name had been proposed several times for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock's chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, and the previous Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to run again due to poor health. Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Hendricks">Thomas A. Hendricks</a>, <a href="Allen%20G.%20Thurman">Allen G. Thurman</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Johnson%20Field">Stephen Johnson Field</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard">Thomas F. Bayard</a>. Hancock's neutrality on the <a href="Gold%20standard%23The%20gold%20exchange%20standard">monetary question</a>, and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, more than any other candidate, had nationwide support. When the <a href="1880%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic convention</a> assembled in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati</a> in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but did not have a majority. By the second ballot, Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and <a href="William%20Hayden%20English">William Hayden English</a> of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> was chosen as his running mate.

The Republicans <a href="1880%20Republican%20National%20Convention">nominated</a> <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a>, a Congressman from <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and a skillful politician. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the <a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>, but needed to add a few of the Northern states to their total to win the election. The practical differences between the parties were few, and the Republicans were reluctant to attack Hancock personally because of his heroic reputation. The one policy difference the Republicans were able to exploit was a statement in the Democratic platform endorsing "a <a href="Tariff%20in%20American%20history">tariff</a> for revenue only". Garfield's campaigners used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, a group that would benefit by a high protective tariff. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority. In the end, the Democrats and Hancock failed to carry any of the Northern states they had targeted, with the exception of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. Hancock lost the election to Garfield. Garfield polled only 39,213 more votes than Hancock, the popular vote being 4,453,295 for Garfield and 4,414,082 for Hancock. The electoral count, however, had a much larger spread: Garfield polled 214 electoral votes and Hancock only 155.
Hancock took his electoral defeat in stride and attended Garfield's inauguration. Following the election, Hancock carried on as commander of the Division of the Atlantic. He was elected president of the <a href="National%20Rifle%20Association">National Rifle Association</a> in 1881, explaining that "The object of the NRA is to increase the military strength of the country by making skill in the use of arms as prevalent as it was in the days of the Revolution." Hancock was a Charter Director and the first president of the <a href="Military%20Service%20Institution%20of%20the%20United%20States">Military Service Institution of the United States</a> from 1878 until his death in 1886. He was commander-in-chief of the <a href="Military%20Order%20of%20the%20Loyal%20Legion%20of%20the%20United%20States">Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States</a> veterans organization from 1879 until his death in 1886. He was the author of "Reports of Major General W. S. Hancock upon Indian Affairs", published in 1867. Hancock's last major public appearance was to preside over the funeral of President Grant in 1885, although he also made a less publicized trip that year to Gettysburg.

Hancock died in 1886 at Governors Island, still in command of the Military Division of the Atlantic, the victim of an infected <a href="carbuncle">carbuncle</a>, complicated by <a href="Diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes</a>. He is buried in <a href="Montgomery%20Cemetery%20%28West%20Norriton%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania%29">Montgomery Cemetery</a> in <a href="West%20Norriton%20Township%2C%20Montgomery%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">West Norriton Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania</a>, near <a href="Norristown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Norristown</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. Although he outlived both of his children, he was survived by the three grandchildren fathered by his son, Russell. Hancock's wife, Almira, published "Reminiscences of Winfield Scott Hancock" in 1887.

In 1893, Republican General <a href="Francis%20Amasa%20Walker">Francis A. Walker</a> wrote,Although I did not vote for General Hancock, I am strongly disposed to believe that one of the best things the nation has lost in recent years has been the example and the influence of that chivalric, stately, and splendid gentleman in the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. Perhaps much which both parties now recognize as having been unfortunate and mischievous during the past thirteen years would have been avoided had General Hancock been elected.

Winfield Scott Hancock is memorialized in a number of statues:
The original Winfield Scott Hancock Elementary School, located at Arch and East Spruce Streets in Norristown, Pennsylvania, was built in 1895 in memory of the General who grew up not far from the site. It was replaced in 1962 by a new building still in use by the <a href="Norristown%20Area%20School%20District">Norristown Area School District</a> only a few blocks away at Arch and Summit Streets, which is also named after General Hancock. The original 1895 building still stands and is used by a community non-profit organization.

A <a href="Pennsylvania%20historical%20markers">Pennsylvania historical marker</a> was dedicated September 11, 1947 along Bethlehem Pike (<a href="PA%20309">PA 309</a>), just north of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20202%20in%20Pennsylvania">US 202</a>, where Hancock was born.
Hancock's portrait adorns U.S. currency on the $2 Silver Certificate series of 1886. Approximately 1,500 to 2,500 of these bills survive today in numismatic collections. Hancock's bill is ranked number 73 on a list of "100 Greatest American Currency Notes".

The <a href="actor">actor</a> <a href="Barney%20Phillips">Barney Phillips</a> played Hancock in the 1962 episode, "The Truth Teller" on the <a href="Television%20syndication">syndicated</a> <a href="anthology%20series">anthology series</a>, "<a href="Death%20Valley%20Days">Death Valley Days</a>", hosted by <a href="Stanley%20Andrews">Stanley Andrews</a>.

Harold Larwood

Harold Larwood (14 November 1904 – 22 July 1995) was a professional <a href="cricketer">cricketer</a> for <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> and <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> between 1924 and 1938. A right-arm <a href="Fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a> who combined unusual speed with great accuracy, he was considered by many commentators to be the finest bowler of his generation. He was the main exponent of the bowling style known as "<a href="bodyline">bodyline</a>", the use of which during the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) tour of Australia in 1932–33 caused a furore that brought about a premature and acrimonious end to his international career.

A <a href="Coal%20mining">coal miner's</a> son who began working in the mines at the age of 14, Larwood was recommended to Nottinghamshire on the basis of his performances in club cricket, and rapidly acquired a place among the country's leading bowlers. He made his <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> debut in 1926, in only his second season in <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>, and was a member of the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201928%E2%80%9329">1928–29 touring side</a> that retained <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> in Australia. The advent of the Australian batsman <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a> ended a period of English cricket supremacy; Larwood and other bowlers were completely dominated by Bradman during <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201930">Australia's victorious tour of 1930</a>. Thereafter, under the guidance of England's combative captain <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a>, the fast <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a> or bodyline bowling attack was developed. With Larwood as its spearhead the tactic was used with considerable success in the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201932%E2%80%9333">1932–33 Test series</a> in Australia. The Australians' description of the method as "unsportsmanlike" soured cricketing relations between the two countries; during subsequent efforts to heal the breach, Larwood refused to apologise for his bowling, since he was carrying out his captain's instructions. He never played for England after the 1932–33 tour, but continued his county career with considerable success for several more seasons.

In 1949, after years out of the limelight, Larwood was elected to honorary membership of the MCC. The following year he and his family were encouraged by former opponent <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> to emigrate and settle in Australia, where he was warmly welcomed, in contrast to the reception accorded him in his cricketing days. He worked for a soft drinks firm, and as an occasional reporter and commentator on Tests against visiting England sides. He paid several visits to England, and was honoured at his old county ground, <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>, where a stand was named after him. In 1993, at the age of 88, he was appointed a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> (MBE) in belated recognition of his services to cricket. He died two years later.

Harold Larwood was born on 14 November 1904 in the <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> village of Nuncargate, near the coal mining town of <a href="Kirkby-in-Ashfield">Kirkby-in-Ashfield</a>. He was the fourth of five sons born to Robert Larwood, a miner, and his wife Mary, née Sharman. Robert was a man of rigid principles, a disciplinarian <a href="Teetotalism">teetotaller</a> who was treasurer of the local <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> chapel. His chief pastime was playing cricket for the village team, which he captained. Harold Larwood's biographer Duncan Hamilton writes that for Robert, cricket represented, "along with his dedication to God ... the core of his life".

From the age of five, Harold attended Kirkby Woodhouse school. Over the years this small village school produced, besides Larwood, four other international cricketers who became his contemporaries in the Nottinghamshire <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">county side</a>: <a href="William%20Whysall">William "Dodge" Whysall</a>, <a href="Sam%20Staples">Sam Staples</a>, <a href="Bill%20Voce">Bill Voce</a> and <a href="Joe%20Hardstaff%20junior">Joe Hardstaff junior</a>. On leaving the school in 1917, when he was 13, Harold was employed at the local miners' <a href="cooperative">cooperative</a> store, before beginning work the following year at Annesley Colliery in charge of a team of <a href="Pit%20pony">pit ponies</a>. He had shown an early talent for cricket, and began to play for Nuncargate's second team in 1918. Playing against experienced adults, in his first season he took 76 wickets at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 4.9. By 1920 he was in the first team, alongside his father, playing in <a href="Plimsoll%20shoe">plimsolls</a> because the family could not afford to buy him proper cricket boots.

Despite his short stature (at 18 he was only 5 feet 4 inches tall), Larwood had acquired considerable stamina and upper body strength from his long shifts at the mine and could bowl at a disconcertingly fast speed. Among those who watched his rising prowess as a fast bowler was <a href="Joe%20Hardstaff%20senior">Joe Hardstaff senior</a>, the Nottinghamshire and England cricketer who lived in Nuncargate. Hardstaff, who had worked with Robert Larwood at the mine, suggested to the youthful bowler that he should attend a trial at the county ground. In April 1923 father and son made the journey to <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>.

In the practice nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> batsman <a href="George%20Gunn">George Gunn</a> thought he looked more like a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything to escape from the mine, even for a single summer.

In the 1923 season, under the eye of the county's coach, <a href="James%20Iremonger">James Iremonger</a>, Larwood concentrated on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a few inches in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in <a href="Bowling%20%28cricket%29%23Bowling%20tactics">line and length</a>, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce <a href="Swing%20bowling">swing</a>. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.

Larwood was first called for full county duty on 20 August 1924, against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, at Trent Bridge. He bowled 26 overs in all, conceded 71 runs and took the wicket of <a href="Vallance%20Jupp">Vallance Jupp</a>, an experienced Test <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>. His assessment of his performance was negative: "I wasn't ready". Iremonger was much more positive, assuring Larwood that his bowling required only fine tuning. Larwood had also gained the support of the county captain, <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a>, a powerful personality who decided that the new recruit had the makings of a future Test match bowler. "The best way to deal with him", Carr said later, "was as if he was my own son". Carr played a major part in encouraging and developing the young bowler's talents, and acted as Larwood's guiding spirit throughout the latter's career.

Larwood had to wait until June 1925 for his next county match, which was against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a> in <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>. Although Nottinghamshire lost the game, Larwood took three wickets, including that of Yorkshire's leading batsman <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a>. From that point he became a regular member of the county side; he finished the season with 73 wickets at an average of 18.01, with best match figures of 11 for 41 against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. From time to time he showed good form as a batsman, his best score being 70 against Northamptonshire.

Larwood began the 1926 county season in good form; during a drawn match against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>, he twice took the wicket of <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a>, England's premier batsman and an influential voice with the national selectors. The <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201926">Australians</a> were in England, to defend <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> in a five-match Test series, and Carr had been appointed to captain England. Hobbs was convinced that Larwood was good enough to play for his country; this recommendation may have prompted the young bowler's inclusion in a "Test Trial" match at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, early in June. Larwood took five wickets in the match, but was not selected for the first Test, which in any event was ruined by rain after barely an hour's play. For the second Test, due to begin at Lord's on 26 June, the selectors took a gamble and selected the youthful Larwood. His reaction when told by Carr was to protest that he was not good enough; Carr assured him that he was.

The Lord's Test was drawn, with neither side coming near to winning. Larwood took three high-profile wickets—<a href="Charlie%20Macartney">Charlie Macartney</a>, <a href="Jack%20Gregory%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Gregory</a> and the Australian captain <a href="Herbie%20Collins">H.L. Collins</a>—while conceding 136 runs. He thought his performance "wasn't great ... I wasted a lot of energy". He was not selected for the Third or Fourth Tests, both of which ended in draws; after the fourth match Carr, whose leadership had been criticised and whose batting form was poor, was replaced as England's captain by <a href="Percy%20Chapman">Percy Chapman</a> for the series' decisive match at <a href="the%20Oval">the Oval</a>. Primarily at the urging of Hobbs, Larwood was recalled for this critical game. On a tumultuous final day the Australians, needing 415 to win, were bowled out for 125, the main bowling honours being shared between Larwood (3 wickets for 34) and the 49-year-old veteran <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a> (4 for 44), who had first appeared for England in 1899, five years before Larwood was born. The victory meant that England had secured the Ashes for the first time since 1912. Among many tributes recognising Larwood's performance was one from the former England captain <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a>, who predicted a big future, but noted that "he must guard against bowling just short of a length".

In the 1926 season as a whole, Larwood took 137 wickets at 18.31; with the bat he scored 451 runs at 12.88. No Tests were played in 1927; Larwood's performances for Nottinghamshire, however, lifted him to the top of the national bowling averages—100 wickets at 16.95—and he was chosen as one of the five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">"Wisden" Cricketers of the Year</a>. His efforts could not quite secure the <a href="County%20Championship%20%28cricket%29">County Championship</a> title for Nottinghamshire; they finished second after losing their final match to <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>. The 1927 season saw the first appearance in the Nottinghamshire side of Bill Voce, a 17-year-old ex-miner who, after beginning as a slow <a href="left-arm%20orthodox%20spin">left-arm orthodox spin</a> bowler, later became Larwood's principal fast bowling partner for county and country. At the season's end, Larwood was married, in a quiet and private ceremony, to Lois Bird, a miner's daughter whom he had first met in 1925.

Larwood did not join the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC)'s weak team that toured South Africa in 1927–28 under the inexperienced <a href="R.T.%20Stanyforth">R.T. Stanyforth</a>. During 1928 Larwood appeared in two Tests against an emergent <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> side that was playing its first series. He took six wickets in these matches, but his best performances that season were for Nottinghamshire. With 138 wickets at 14.51, Larwood once again headed the national bowling averages. As a batsman, his 626 runs at an average of 26.08 included his first century, 101 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> against Gloucestershire.

On the basis of his form, Larwood was an obvious choice for the MCC touring side that Chapman took to Australia in the English winter of 1928–29. In an early game against <a href="Victoria%20cricket%20team">Victoria</a> he took 7 for 51 in the state's first innings and scored 79 when MCC batted. One of his victims in the match was <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a>, the Australian Test <a href="opening%20batsman">opening batsman</a>, who let slip his opinion that Larwood was "not really fast". According to the journalist and future Australian Test player <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, Ponsford was then targeted by Larwood. A month later at <a href="Brisbane%20Exhibition%20Ground">Brisbane</a>, in the first Test of the series, Larwood dismissed him cheaply, twice; in the second Test, at <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney</a>, Ponsford scored 5 before a rapid delivery from Larwood broke a bone in his hand; Ponsford did not play again that summer.

England won the Brisbane Test by a record margin of 675 runs. Larwood took 6 for 32 in the Australian first innings, bowling at a speed that "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>"s S.J. Southerton described as "faster than I have ever seen him". According to Jardine's biographer Christopher Douglas, this bowling, which included a spell of 3 wickets in 5 overs for 9 runs, delivered a lasting blow to Australian morale and was a major factor in England's ultimate series victory. The match saw a low-key Test debut by <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>, who scored 18 and 1 and was dropped for the second Test, before being rapidly reinstated for the third. England maintained their ascendancy during the second, third and fourth Tests, though with decreasing victory margins; Australia finally achieved success in the last match, giving England a 4–1 series victory. A combination of hard pitches, stifling heat, and long matches reduced Larwood's effectiveness as the tour progressed. He finished the Test series with 18 wickets at 40.22, behind <a href="George%20Geary">George Geary</a> (19 at 25.11) and <a href="Jack%20White%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201891%29">Jack White</a> (25 at 30.80). In all first-class matches on the tour, Larwood took 40 wickets at 31.35; as a batsman he scored 367 runs, averaging 26.21. Larwood's occasional tactic of bowling <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a>, that is, in the direction of the batsman's legs to a concentration of <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> fielders, had been noted by the Australian former bowler <a href="Arthur%20Mailey">Arthur Mailey</a>. In his report on the fourth Test, Mailey wrote, Larwood resorted to his "famous leg theory" after receiving severe punishment from the Australian batsman <a href="Archie%20Jackson">Archie Jackson</a>, but the change brought no success: "All theories and all bowlers were alike to [Jackson]".

Southerton's tour report refers to the crowds' reactions to the England team, and in particular to the "barracking" of Larwood. This, he says, only once reached unacceptable proportions—during the game against Victoria that took place between the fourth and fifth Tests. This disturbance was apparently sparked by Chapman's decision to put Larwood on to bowl against Victoria's weakest batsman, <a href="Bert%20Ironmonger">Bert Ironmonger</a>. In general, Southerton felt that crowd noise was no worse than that accorded to previous touring teams and that, "objectionable though it may appear to be to us in England, it has grown up with Australian cricket and is recognised by the public out there as part of their day's enjoyment". Larwood's view was that "it was a bit too thick at times ... I got called every name you can imagine, and every four-letter word you can think of was used against me". The Surrey <a href="Amateur%20sports%23Cricket">amateur</a> batsman <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a>, was likewise a target of the crowds, and as a result formed a cordial dislike for Australians—which was fully reciprocated.

Back in England for the 1929 season, Larwood made three Test appearances against the visiting South Africans, for modest returns: a total of eight wickets at 23.25, and with the bat 50 runs at 12.50. He was injured during the third Test, and thus missed the last two games of the series and several county matches. His overall bowling figures for the 1929 season were less impressive than in the two previous years; with 117 wickets at 21.66 he fell to 25th place in the national averages. The 20-year-old Voce, whose fast-medium bowling style had now fully developed, was the county's most successful bowler. Together, Larwood and Voce helped Nottingham to secure the County Championship that had narrowly evaded them two years earlier.

Ahead of the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201930">Australians' visit to England in 1930</a> there was some confidence in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 side was largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong, especially in batting. England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match. Larwood's active participation was curtailed by an attack of <a href="gastritis">gastritis</a>; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs.

His illness meant that Larwood missed the second Test, at Lord's, which saw Australia score a record 729 for 6 including a rapid 254 from Bradman, at the time the highest individual Test score in England. Australia won the game by seven wickets, to draw level 1–1 in the five-match series. Larwood returned to the England side for the third Test, at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley, Leeds</a>. He later claimed that his first ball to Bradman, before the batsman had scored, was a <a href="Bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> that touched the edge of the bat and was caught by the <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a>, <a href="George%20Duckworth">George Duckworth</a>: "You could hear the snick all over the ground". The umpire, however, gave Bradman not out. Bradman went on to compile 334, beating his record score of two weeks earlier. Larwood's one wicket in the Australian innings cost 139 runs; England were saved from probable defeat when the game was shortened by rain. The England selectors dropped Larwood from the team for the fourth Test, in which Bradman was limited to 14 runs, but the game was rained off after just over two days' play. Larwood was recalled for the final Test at the Oval that, as in 1926, would determine the series victor. In a game with no time limit, Australia replied to England's 405 with 695 (Bradman 232), then dismissed England for 251 to win by an innings and 39 runs. Larwood's single wicket—Bradman, for the first time in Tests—cost 132 runs. In the three Tests in which he played, Larwood took 4 wickets for 292; Bradman, he admitted, had "pasted me unmercifully". Commentators recognised the danger that Bradman presented to English hopes; the former England bowler <a href="Percy%20Fender">Percy Fender</a>, who was captain of Surrey and a respected cricket journalist, was convinced that "something new will have to be introduced to curb Bradman". Warner was explicit: "England must evolve a new type of bowler and develop fresh ideas and strange tactics to curb his almost uncanny skill".

Apart from his treatment by Bradman, Larwood was successful in 1930, rising to fourth place in the national bowling averages (99 wickets at 16.38). He also batted well on occasions, including a not-out century against Northamptonshire. He was not selected for the 1930–31 tour of South Africa, and for the next two years he concentrated mainly on domestic cricket. He made one Test appearance in 1931, against New Zealand, in a rain-ruined game in which he neither batted nor bowled. He headed the domestic bowling averages in 1931 and 1932, in the latter year with 162 wickets at 12.86, the best seasonal figures of his career. However, because of his poor Test record in 1930, Larwood thought his chances of selection for the 1932–33 tour to Australia were slim. The 1932 Test trial was limited to half a day's play, during which Larwood bowled 15 overs for a single wicket. Nevertheless, to his great relief he was selected for the tour, as was Voce, who had been England's most successful bowler during the South African tour of 1930–31.

In 1931, with the 1932–33 series in mind, the selectors had appointed Jardine as England's captain. In his efforts to build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy, the new captain consulted widely. Along with other observers, including Duckworth (who had kept wicket for England during the 1930 Oval Test) he thought that Bradman showed a dislike for fast, rising balls, and had been shaken when one such delivery from Larwood had hit him in the chest. This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers; a clip of film from the Oval match appeared to confirm that Bradman had flinched. This, to Jardine, suggested the basis of a plan: a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally.

Leg theory bowling was not new; Larwood, Voce and others had employed it, generally for short periods, as had several Australians including <a href="John%20Scott%20%28Australian%20cricketer%2C%20born%201888%29">Jack Scott</a>, who in 1928–29 dismissed Jardine and Herbert Sutcliffe using this tactic. What Jardine planned was a sustained leg stump attack, used in conjunction with a semicircle of close leg-side fielders ready to pounce on any mistimed shot. He found a willing ally in Carr, who, though no longer playing Test cricket, still captained Nottinghamshire and had, according to Hamilton, "an almost carnivorous appetite for trying to humiliate the Australians and grinding them, and especially Bradman, into the dirt". At a private dinner at the Piccadilly Hotel, which Jardine and Carr arranged shortly after the announcement of the 1932–33 touring party, Larwood and Voce were quizzed about leg theory. Larwood later recalled the conversation thus:

In pursuit of his plans, Jardine took advice on fielding positions from <a href="Frank%20Foster%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Foster</a>, who had bowled a form of medium-fast leg theory during the 1911–12 series in Australia with much success, taking 32 wickets at 21.63. Larwood did not at the time consider Jardine's proposed tactics as either novel or controversial. His priority was to contain Bradman, so "any scheme that would keep him in check appealed to me a great deal". In county matches following the Piccadilly Hotel dinner, Larwood and Voce tried the tactics out, with mixed results. Two <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a> batsmen sustained injuries as their side struggled with the unfamiliar bowling, at one stage losing 8 wickets for 52 runs. However, Glamorgan, reckoned to be a weak batting side, scored more than 500 against the experimental attack; spectators, including the future cricket writer and commentator <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a>, were puzzled by the ineffectiveness of the bowling. Arlott later reasoned that what appeared weak bowling on English pitches would be a different proposition on the much faster Australian pitches. Hostile fast bowling was not confined to Larwood and Voce; in Yorkshire's match against Surrey at The Oval, <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a> bowled a series of bouncers, bringing protests from Hobbs and press criticism from Warner.

The MCC party that sailed for Australia on 17 September 1932 contained four fast bowlers: Larwood, Voce, Bowes and <a href="Gubby%20Allen">G.O. "Gubby" Allen</a>, the <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> amateur. Warner was manager of the side; he had captained two tours to Australia prior to 1914 and was a popular figure there. The manager's role, as the tour's historian Laurence Le Quesne remarks, was at the time less influential than that of the captain, who had absolute authority on the field of play.

Prior to the Test series, the party played matches against State sides and selected Australian elevens. The intended fast leg theory attack was not revealed until the fifth of these games, against "An Australian XI" (including Bradman), which began at <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne</a> on 18 November. Larwood dismissed Bradman for low scores in each of the Australian innings, writing later: "It was a refreshing sight to see [him] clumsily waving his bat in the air". Hobbs, who having retired from Test cricket was reporting the tour for London's "<a href="The%20Star%20%28London%29">The Star</a>" newspaper, thought that the bowling had shaken Bradman's confidence: "He was drawing away, sure proof that he didn't like the bumpers". The English tactics in the game offended the crowds and so upset <a href="H.V.%20Evatt">H.V. Evatt</a> (later leader of the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, then a <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court judge</a>) that he lost all desire to watch any of that year's Tests.

The first Test began at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 2 December 1932, and was played in a tense and heated atmosphere. Bradman, whose discomfort and poor form against the tourists' bowling in the preparatory games had become sources of anxiety, was prevented from playing by illness. England won the game by 10 wickets; Larwood's match figures were 10 for 124, with only limited use of fast leg theory. The match's most successful batsman was Australia's <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a>, who scored 187 in his side's first innings, attacking both the orthodox and leg theory attacks in a "death or glory" approach. During the match <a href="Hugh%20Buggy">Hugh Buggy</a>, a reporter for the "<a href="Melbourne%20Herald">Melbourne Herald</a>", used the word "bodyline" to describe the English leg theory bowling. The term was soon universally adopted in Australia, though English sources continued to refer to "leg theory". The second Test, at Melbourne beginning 30 December, was played on a much slower pitch that blunted the English pace attack. Larwood was further handicapped by pains from sore feet, caused by a new pair of boots. Bradman returned to the Australian side and scored a century, guiding his team to victory by 111 runs; his success led many commentators to suppose that fast leg theory would thenceforth prove ineffective. The series was tied 1–1 and, in the words of the writer-historian <a href="Ronald%20Blythe">Ronald Blythe</a>, "all was sweetness and light".

The third Test, which began at <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide</a> on 13 January 1933, has been characterised by "Wisden" as "probably the most unpleasant [Test match] ever played". <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a>, the Australian captain, was struck over the heart by a ball from Larwood and was incapacitated for several minutes. Larwood had been bowling to an orthodox field; on Woodfull's resumption, to the crowd's amazed hostility, Jardine switched to the leg theory attack. "What could be clearer", wrote Swanton, "than that at the root of these leg-theory tactics was the threat of physical injury?". Larwood then knocked Woodfull's bat from his hands, bringing further demonstrations from the crowd. Later in the innings a Larwood delivery struck <a href="Bert%20Oldfield">Bert Oldfield</a> on the head, causing his retirement from the match. The crowd's reaction was such that Larwood thought a full-scale invasion of the pitch might follow: "If one man jumps the fence the whole mob will go for us".
England eventually won by 338 runs; Larwood's total of seven wickets in the match was exceeded by Allen's eight, earned by orthodox style fast bowling. While the game was still in progress, the <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Board of Control</a> cabled the MCC, protesting the English tactics with a direct accusation of unsportsmanlike conduct. In reply, MCC rejected the Australian Board's charges and insisted that they withdraw the charge of bad sportsmanship. The row escalated into high diplomatic and political circles, and drew in the Australian prime minister, <a href="Joseph%20Lyons">Joseph Lyons</a>, the governor of South Australia, <a href="Alexander%20Hore-Ruthven%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gowrie">Sir Alexander Hore-Ruthven</a>, and the British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Dominion%20Affairs">Dominions secretary</a>, <a href="James%20Henry%20Thomas">J.H. Thomas</a>. Ultimately it was decided that the matter should be referred to the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">Imperial Cricket Conference</a> (ICC), with a view to a possible change in the rules relating to bowling. Jardine had stated that he would not lead his team in another Test unless the "unsportsmanlike" charge was withdrawn. On 8 February, two days before the fourth Test was due to begin at <a href="The%20Gabba">Brisbane</a>, the Australian Board clarified that, while they continued to find bodyline objectionable, "we do not consider the sportsmanship of your team as being in question".

In the fourth Test, which England won to retain the Ashes, Larwood curtailed his use of bodyline on an unreceptive pitch. The match passed without untoward incident; on the final day came news of the death of Archie Jackson, who had been ill for months with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. Two days earlier he had sent Larwood a telegram: "Congratulations magnificent bowling good luck in all matches"; Larwood kept this as a souvenir for the rest of his life. In the final Test, at Sydney, several Australian batsmen were hit, but their improving technique against this style of bowling enabled them to score 435, their highest innings total of the series. Larwood's main contribution to this game was as a batsman; sent in as a <a href="nightwatchman%20%28cricket%29">nightwatchman</a>, he batted well into the following day to score 98. In the Australians' second innings Larwood suffered a serious injury to his left foot, the legacy of much bowling on hard, unyielding pitches. Although he could no longer bowl, Jardine would not let him leave the field while Bradman was still batting, believing that Larwood's continuing presence represented a psychological threat. When Bradman was out, he and Larwood left the field together, although no words were exchanged. England won the match to secure a 4–1 series victory.

The injury ended Larwood's tour at that point. While the rest of the team fulfilled the final Australian fixtures before embarking on a short tour of New Zealand, Larwood returned to England on board SS "Otranto". In the Test matches he had been England's most successful bowler, with 33 wickets at 19.52. As a batsman he had scored 145 runs, averaging 24.16. In all first-class matches on the tour he took 64 wickets at 13.89 and scored 358 runs at 23.45.

On his return home, despite massive press and public interest Larwood was bound by his contract with the MCC to remain silent until the main party returned. On 7 May 1933, the day after their arrival, he gave in a "Sunday Express" article a strong defence of what he continued to call "leg theory". Woodfull, he said, was too slow, and Bradman too scared:
"Richardson and McCabe played me all right, Woodfull and Bradman could not". He was highly critical of the Australian crowds who, he said, knew nothing of cricket—all they wanted was for Bradman to score runs. In mid-May, in a hastily prepared, ghost-written book entitled "Bodyline?" that was serialised in the "<a href="Sunday%20Dispatch">Sunday Dispatch</a>", Larwood elaborated on his themes of Australian batting failures and crowd hooliganism. By this time the 1933 cricket season was in full swing; bodyline bowling was being widely practised, by Bowes, Voce and by the fast bowlers in the visiting West Indies touring side, <a href="Learie%20Constantine">Learie Constantine</a> and <a href="Manny%20Martindale">E.A. Martindale</a>. Larwood's writings were inconvenient for the MCC committee which, now more aware of the intimidatory aspects of bodyline, was revising its position and was more inclined to appease Australian feelings.

The injury to Larwood's foot meant that he scarcely bowled for Nottinghamshire in 1933. However, such was his drawing power that the county continued to play him as a batsman until mid-July, when his unfitness prematurely ended his season. Meanwhile, on 28 April the Australian Board had unilaterally adopted a regulation that specifically outlawed bodyline bowling in Australia; MCC's initial response was to declare this law impractical, but as the events of the season unfolded they modified their stance. The ICC meeting on 31 July produced no immediate resolution, but did elicit a verbal promise from the MCC that bodyline would not be used in the projected 1934 tour by the Australians. In exchanges of telegrams with the Australian Board, the MCC still contrived to avoid a specific commitment, while emphasising that they had "always agreed that a form of bowling which is obviously a direct attack by the bowler upon the batsman would be an offence against the spirit of the game". On that basis, the Australian Board agreed to the 1934 tour.

By the beginning of the 1934 season Larwood was fit again, and it was anticipated that he would play in the Tests. Jardine had earlier issued an unequivocal statement that he would not play. By way of confirming their commitment not to use bodyline, the MCC committee decided that Larwood should apologise to the Australians for his bowling on the 1932–33 tour. No such apology had been requested from Jardine; Larwood refused to do so, insisting that he had bowled precisely as instructed by his captain. Shortly before the second Test, he wrote in the "Sunday Dispatch" that he was unrepentant about leg theory, adding: "I doubt if I shall ever play against [the Australians] again, at least in big cricket". Larwood's Test career thus ended. In its review of the 1934 season, "Wisden" commented: "No greater disservice was ever done to English cricket than when Larwood was induced to dash into print and become responsible for statements which put him beyond the pale of being selected for England".

Larwood continued to play for Nottinghamshire for several more seasons, with considerable success: 82 wickets at 17.25 in 1934, 102 at 22.70 in 1935 and in 1936, his <a href="Benefit%20%28sports%29">benefit season</a>, 119 at 12.97. The 18-year-old future Test batsman <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>, in his second county match for Middlesex, faced Larwood in June 1936; he later recorded that Larwood and Voce were the most accurate fast bowlers he ever faced, and that Larwood was the fastest. The benefit season yielded the then county record sum of £2,098. In the English winter of 1936–37, while an MCC team led by Allen toured Australia, Larwood took a coaching job in India. The climate and the food disagreed with him, and he returned home early. His bowling achievements in 1937 were modest: 70 wickets at 24.57. Larwood's relations with Nottinghamshire had steadily deteriorated since Carr's dismissal from the captaincy in 1934; his foot problem returned, and was aggravated by a <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> injury to his left knee. In 1938, after a few matches, he left the county by mutual agreement and retired from first-class cricket. In his first-class career he took 1,427 wickets at 17.51, and scored 7,290 runs at 19.91 including three centuries. In Tests he took 78 wickets at 28.35 and scored 485 runs at 19.40.

After playing League cricket for <a href="Blackpool%20Cricket%20Club">Blackpool</a> in 1939, on the outbreak of war Larwood left the game altogether, to work away from the public eye as a <a href="market%20garden">market garden</a>er. In 1946 he used his savings to buy a <a href="Confectionery%20store">sweet shop</a> in Blackpool. Although he generally kept away from organised cricket and avoided all personal publicity, he was persuaded to attend a farewell luncheon for Don Bradman at the end of the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australians' 1948 tour</a>. He and Bradman exchanged polite courtesies, though he was warmly welcomed by other members of the Australian team, including their premier fast bowler <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a>. The following year Larwood became one of 26 former professional Test cricketers awarded honorary membership of the MCC. This recognition, he said, went some way to help heal the hurt he had felt over his treatment by the game's ruling body 15 years earlier.

In the economic austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, that he would find better prospects and a warm welcome in Australia, and he decided to emigrate there with his family, which by then included five daughters. On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on <a href="SS%20Orontes">SS "Orontes"</a>, the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously. On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by the former prime minister <a href="Ben%20Chifley">Ben Chifley</a>. Despite a housing shortage, the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of <a href="Kingsford%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kingsford</a>, and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.

From time to time Larwood supplemented his wages by commenting on cricket for newspapers and broadcasters. At first he was treated with some suspicion by English touring teams; in 1950–51 when he visited the English dressing room he received a cold reception from the England captain, <a href="Freddie%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">F.R. Brown</a>. Four years later, according to Larwood, he was kept out of the dressing room by <a href="Trevor%20Bailey">Trevor Bailey</a>, the 1954–55 team's vice captain—though Bailey denied that this ever happened. However, from the early 1960s onwards Larwood was often visited by members of England teams, and he became a regular and welcome guest in English dressing rooms. He sometimes went to cricket events where he often met Don Bradman; relations between the two, though outwardly cordial, remained essentially cold.

In 1977 Larwood attended the <a href="Centenary%20Test%23Centenary%20Test%2C%201977%20at%20the%20Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Centenary Test match</a> at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, along with many survivors of old Ashes battles. As on similar past occasions he had to be persuaded to go; later he would describe it as "one of the best days of my life". His presence created considerable interest among generations of cricket followers to whom the bodyline series was distant history. Later that year he visited England, and watched England's cricketers play Australia at Trent Bridge, his old home ground; this was one of several trips he made to his home country, the last of which was in 1980. In 1982, the 50th anniversary of the bodyline series was commemorated with much publicity, some of which brought a revival of hate mail and hostility towards Larwood.

As he grew older, Larwood increasingly spoke out on current cricket issues. He was particularly critical of the proliferation of protective clothing in the 1970s, and considered <a href="Ian%20Botham">Ian Botham</a>, the England all-rounder, over-rated: his bowling "wouldn't burst a paper bag". He was unimpressed by the 1984 Australian television miniseries "<a href="Bodyline%20%28miniseries%29">Bodyline</a>" which he considered inaccurate and at risk of reawakening ill-feelings he thought best forgotten. In 1985 he was given honorary life membership of the Sydney Cricket Ground and, in England, the Larwood and Voce Stand was opened at Trent Bridge. In June 1993, in the <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen's Birthday Honours List</a>, Larwood was appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">MBE</a> for services to cricket. Of this award, "<a href="Today%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Today</a>" newspaper commented: "At last the ruling classes honour the man who carried the can for their savage arrogance".

In his final years, Larwood withdrew his claims that Bradman had been frightened of him, and acknowledged his Australian foe as the greatest batsman of all time. He was gradually losing his sight, although he retained his alertness, and on his 90th birthday was able to join in a game of garden cricket with his great-grandchildren. He died in hospital on 22 July 1995, following a brief illness, in his 91st year. He was cremated, and his ashes placed in a memorial wall at Holy Trinity Anglican Church in <a href="Kingsford%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kingsford</a>. A plaque with a simple inscription was placed on the wall by his daughters. His wife Lois died in 2001, and her ashes were placed alongside his.

Larwood has been widely acknowledged as the greatest fast bowler of his generation and, according to his "Wisden" obituary, was "one of the rare fast bowlers in the game's long history to spread terror in opposition ranks by the mere mention of his name". Timing technology was primitive in his day, but various tests indicated speeds of between 90 and 100 mph (140 to 160 km/h). Fingleton commented that Larwood was "about twice as fast as anyone out there", indicating a match in progress at Trent Bridge. However, one Australian from an earlier cricketing generation, <a href="Ernie%20Jones%20%28Australian%20sportsman%29">Ernie Jones</a>, dismissed Larwood: "He wouldn't knock a dint in a pound of butter on a hot day".

At around 5 feet 7 inches, Larwood was short for a fast bowler, although he had long arms in relation to his height. His lower bowling trajectory helped the ball to retain speed. His side-on bowling action, following a smooth and almost soundless approach, was described by the "<a href="The%20Guardian">Manchester Guardian</a>"s cricket correspondent <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> as "absolutely classical, left side showing down the wicket before the arm swung over with a thrilling vehement rhythm". Facing Larwood at his fastest was, according to Hamilton, "akin to a public stoning". Hobbs, who batted against him many times in county matches, thought him not just the fastest but the most accurate bowler he had ever seen. Among later fast bowlers influenced by Larwood's style was Ray Lindwall, Australia's bowling star of the 1940s and 1950s, who watched the bodyline series as a schoolboy and modelled his own action on Larwood's.

Larwood claimed that he did not intend to hit batsmen, though "I didn't shed any crocodile tears if a batsman was hit in the thigh". In a press interview in 1990 he further admitted that he "might sometimes have bowled at a batsman's ribs, but never at his head". He did from time to time inflict serious injuries on his opponents: <a href="Reg%20Sinfield">Reg Sinfield</a> of Gloucestershire, <a href="Patsy%20Hendren">Patsy Hendren</a> of Middlesex, and <a href="Jock%20Cameron">H.B. Cameron</a> of South Africa were all carried unconscious from the field after being hit by high-speed deliveries. Many others suffered discomfort in the form of bruises and minor fractures. In Australia, in the wake of the bodyline series, a <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> song summed up many apprehensive batsmen's feelings:

Bobcat

The bobcat ("Lynx rufus") is a <a href="North%20America">North America</a>n <a href="Felidae">cat</a> that appeared during the <a href="Irvingtonian">Irvingtonian</a> stage of around 1.8 million years ago (<a href="Appearance%20event%20ordination">AEO</a>). Containing 2 recognized <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, it ranges from southern <a href="Canada">Canada</a> to central <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, including most of the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>. The bobcat is an adaptable <a href="predator">predator</a> that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to <a href="local%20extinction">local extinction</a> ("extirpation") by <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s and domestic animals. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized genus "<a href="Lynx">Lynx</a>". It is smaller on average than the <a href="Canada%20lynx">Canada lynx</a>, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as large as the <a href="cat">domestic cat</a>. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby (or "bobbed") tail, from which it derives its name.

Though the bobcat prefers <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s and <a href="hare">hare</a>s, it hunts <a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="chicken">chicken</a>s, <a href="goose">geese</a> and other <a href="bird">bird</a>s, small <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, and <a href="deer">deer</a>. Prey selection depends on location and <a href="habitat">habitat</a>, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to <a href="territorial%20marking">mark its territorial boundaries</a>, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months.

Although bobcats have been hunted extensively by humans, both for sport and fur, their population has proven resilient though declining in some areas. The elusive predator features in <a href="Mythologies%20of%20the%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American mythology</a> and the folklore of European settlers.

There had been debate over whether to classify this species as "Lynx rufus" or "Felis rufus" as part of a wider issue regarding whether the four species of "Lynx" should be given their own <a href="genus">genus</a>, or be placed as a <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> of "<a href="Felis">Felis</a>". The genus "Lynx" is now accepted, and the bobcat is listed as "Lynx rufus" in modern taxonomic sources.

Johnson et al. reported "Lynx" shared a <a href="clade">clade</a> with the <a href="Puma%20%28genus%29">puma</a>, leopard cat ("<a href="Prionailurus">Prionailurus</a>"), and domestic cat ("<a href="Felis">Felis</a>") lineages, dated to 7.15 million years ago (<a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>); "Lynx" diverged first, approximately 3.24 million years ago.

The bobcat is believed to have evolved from the <a href="Eurasian%20lynx">Eurasian lynx</a>, which crossed into North America by way of the <a href="Bering%20Land%20Bridge">Bering Land Bridge</a> during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern <a href="Canada%20lynx">Canada lynx</a>. Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may <a href="blynx">sometimes occur</a>.

Thirteen bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics:

This subspecies division has been challenged, given a lack of clear geographic breaks in their ranges and the minor differences between subspecies. The latest revision of cat taxonomy in 2017, by the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognises only two subspecies, based on phylogeographic and genetic studies, although the status of <a href="Mexican%20bobcat">Mexican bobcat</a>s ("Lynx rufus esquinapae" and "Lynx rufus oaxacensis") remains under review:

The bobcat resembles other species of the genus "Lynx", but is on average the smallest of the four. Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish-brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail. Its spotted patterning acts as camouflage. The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short, black tufts. Generally, an off-white color is seen on the lips, chin, and underparts. Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions are darkest. Kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots. A few <a href="Melanism">melanistic</a> bobcats have been sighted and captured in Florida. They appear black, but may still exhibit a spot pattern.

The face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils. The nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red, and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell. It is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.

The adult bobcat is long from the head to the base of the tail, averaging ; the stubby tail adds and its "bobbed" appearance gives the species its name. An adult stands about at the shoulders. Adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of . The largest bobcat accurately measured on record weighed , although unverified reports have them reaching . Furthermore, a June 20, 2012 report of a New Hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal's weight at . The largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern Canada and northern New England of the subspecies "L. r. gigas", while the smallest are from the southeastern subspecies "L. r. floridanus", particularly those in the southern <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachians</a>. The bobcat is muscular, and its hind legs are longer than its front legs, giving it a bobbing gait. At birth, it weighs and is about in length. By its first birthday, it weighs about .

The cat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats. A <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> size comparison study in the eastern United States found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens, suggesting differing <a href="natural%20selection">selection constraints</a> for the sexes.

The bobcat is <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a>, and is active mostly during twilight. It keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight, and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise. Each night, it moves from along its habitual route. This behavior may vary seasonally, as bobcats become more <a href="diurnal%20animal">diurnal</a> during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey, which are more active during the day in colder weather.

Bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on the sex and the distribution of prey. The home range is <a href="territorial%20marking">marked</a> with feces, <a href="Urine%20spraying%23Felidae">urine scent</a>, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. Its den smells strongly of the bobcat.

The sizes of bobcats' home ranges vary significantly; a <a href="World%20Conservation%20Union">World Conservation Union</a> (IUCN) summary of research suggests ranges from . One study in Kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area. Transient bobcats were found to have both larger (roughly ) and less well-defined home ranges. Kittens had the smallest range at about . Dispersal from the <a href="birth">natal</a> range is most pronounced with males.

Reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal. One study found a large variation in male range sizes, from in summer up to in winter. Another found that female bobcats, especially those which were reproductively active, expanded their home range in winter, but that males merely shifted their range without expanding it, which was consistent with numerous earlier studies. Other research in various American states has shown little or no seasonal variation.

Like most felines, the bobcat is largely solitary, but ranges often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are more tolerant of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges. Given their smaller range sizes, two or more females may reside within a male's home range. When multiple territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas.

In line with widely differing estimates of home range size, population density figures are divergent, from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey. The average is estimated at one bobcat per . A link has been observed between population density and sex ratio. One study noted a dense, unhunted population in California had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female. When the density decreased, the sex ratio skewed to 0.86 males per female. Another study observed a similar ratio, and suggested the males may be better able to cope with the increased competition, and this helped limit reproduction until various factors lowered the density.

The bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food, but eats heavily when prey is abundant. During lean periods, it often preys on larger animals, which it can kill and return to feed on later. The bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce. Its preference is for mammals weighing about . Its main prey varies by region. In the eastern United States, it is the <a href="eastern%20cottontail">eastern cottontail</a> species, and in the north it is the <a href="snowshoe%20hare">snowshoe hare</a>. When these prey species exist together, as in New England, they are the primary food sources of the bobcat. In the far south, the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by <a href="cotton%20rat">cotton rat</a>s as the primary food source. Birds up to the size of an adult <a href="swan">swan</a> are also taken in ambushes, along with their fledglings and eggs. The bobcat is an <a href="generalist%20and%20specialist%20species">opportunistic</a> predator that, unlike the more specialized Canada lynx, readily varies its prey selection. Diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat's principal prey; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet.

The bobcat hunts animals of different sizes, and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly. With small animals, such as <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s (including <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s), <a href="bird">bird</a>s, <a href="fish">fish</a> including small <a href="shark">shark</a>s, and <a href="insect">insect</a>s, it hunts in areas known to be abundant in prey, and will lie, crouch, or stand, and wait for victims to wander close. It then pounces, grabbing its prey with its sharp, retractable claws. For slightly larger animals, such as geese, rabbits, and hares, it stalks from cover and waits until prey comes within before rushing in to attack. Less commonly, it feeds on larger animals, such as young <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s, and other carnivores, such as <a href="Fisher%20%28animal%29">fisher</a>s (primarily female), <a href="fox">fox</a>es, <a href="mink">mink</a>s, <a href="American%20marten">martens</a>, <a href="skunk">skunk</a>s, small <a href="dog">dog</a>s, and domesticated <a href="cat">cat</a>s. Bobcats are considered the major predatory threat to the endangered <a href="whooping%20crane">whooping crane</a>. Bobcats are also occasional hunters of <a href="livestock">livestock</a> and <a href="poultry">poultry</a>. While larger species, such as <a href="cattle">cattle</a> and <a href="horse">horse</a>s, are not known to be attacked, bobcats do present a threat to smaller <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>s, such as <a href="sheep">sheep</a> and <a href="goat">goat</a>s. According to the <a href="National%20Agricultural%20Statistics%20Service">National Agricultural Statistics Service</a>, bobcats killed 11,100 sheep in 2004, comprising 4.9% of all sheep predator deaths. However, some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified, as bobcats have been known to <a href="scavenge">scavenge</a> on the remains of livestock kills by other animals.

It has been known to kill <a href="deer">deer</a>, especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were <a href="fawn">fawn</a>s, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.

The bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other midsized predators of a similar <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>. Research in <a href="Maine">Maine</a> has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and <a href="coyote">coyote</a> or <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the <a href="Interspecific%20competition">interspecific relationship</a> affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.

The average bobcat lifespan is 7 years long and rarely exceeds 10 years. The oldest wild bobcat on record was 16 years old, and the oldest captive bobcat lived to be 32.

Bobcats generally begin <a href="mating">breeding</a> by their second summer, though females may start as early as their first year. <a href="Sperm%20production">Sperm production</a> begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake a number of different behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behavior%23Felidae">mates with her</a>. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an <a href="estrous%20cycle">estrous cycle</a> of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.

The female raises the young alone. One to six, but usually two to four, kittens are born in April or May, after roughly 60 to 70 days of <a href="gestation">gestation</a>. Sometimes, a second litter is born as late as September. The female generally gives birth in an enclosed space, usually a small cave or hollow log. The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day. They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months. Within three to five months, they begin to travel with their mother. They hunt by themselves by fall of their first year, and usually disperse shortly thereafter. In Michigan, however, they have been observed staying with their mother as late as the next spring.

Bobcat tracks show four toes without claw marks, due to their retractable claws. The tracks can range in size from ; the average is about 1.8 inches. When walking or trotting, the tracks are spaced roughly apart. The bobcat can make great strides when running, often from .

Like all cats, the bobcat 'directly registers', meaning its hind prints usually fall exactly on top of its fore prints. Bobcat tracks can be generally distinguished from <a href="feral%20cat">feral</a> or house cat tracks by their larger size: about 2.0 in (13 cm²) versus 1.5 in (10 cm²).

The adult bobcat has relatively few predators other than humans. However seldomly, it may be killed in interspecific conflict by several larger predators or fall prey to them. <a href="Cougar">Cougar</a>s and <a href="Gray%20wolf">gray wolves</a> can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> as well as elsewhere. <a href="Coyote">Coyote</a>s have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a> "(Ursus americanus)" fighting over a carcass is confirmed. Like other "Lynx" species, bobcats probably avoid encounters with bears, in part because they are likely to lose kills to them or may be rarely be attacked by them. Bobcat remains have occasionally been found in the resting sites of male <a href="fisher%20%28animal%29">fisher</a>s. <a href="American%20alligator">American alligator</a>s ("Alligator mississippensis") have been filmed opportunistically preying on adult bobcats in the southeast United States. 

Kittens may be taken by several predators, including owls (almost entirely <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a>s), <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, <a href="fox">fox</a>es, and <a href="bear">bear</a>s, as well as other adult male bobcats; when prey populations are not abundant, fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood. <a href="Golden%20eagle">Golden eagle</a>s ("Aquila chrysaetos") have been reportedly observed preying on bobcats.

Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and starvation are the other leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. <a href="Cannibalism%20%28zoology%29">Cannibalism</a> has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.

The bobcat may have external <a href="Parasitism">parasites</a>, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, especially those of rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>", but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, "<a href="Lynxacarus%20morlani">Lynxacarus morlani</a>", has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.

The bobcat is an adaptable animal. It prefers woodlands—<a href="deciduous">deciduous</a>, <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a>, or mixed—but unlike the other "Lynx" species, it does not depend exclusively on the deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.

The bobcat's range does not seem to be limited by human populations, as long as it can find a suitable habitat; only large, intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species. The animal may appear in back yards in "urban edge" environments, where human development intersects with natural habitats. If chased by a dog, it usually climbs up a tree.

The historical range of the bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and as far south as the Mexican state of <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, and it still persists across much of this area. In the 20th century, it was thought to have lost territory in the US <a href="Midwest">Midwest</a> and parts of the Northeast, including southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, and much of Missouri, mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices. While thought to no longer exist in western New York and Pennsylvania, multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats (including dead specimens) have been recently reported in New York's <a href="Southern%20Tier">Southern Tier</a> and in <a href="central%20New%20York">central New York</a>, and a bobcat was captured in 2018 on a tourist boat in Downtown <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. In addition, bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern Indiana, and one was recently killed near Albion, Michigan. In early March, 2010, a bobcat was sighted (and later captured by animal control authorities) in a parking garage in downtown <a href="Houston">Houston</a>. By 2010, bobcats appear to have recolonized many states, occurring in every state except Delaware.

Its population in Canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the Canadian lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a> and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.

It is listed in Appendix II of the <a href="Convention%20on%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Fauna%20and%20Flora">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES), which means it is not considered threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely monitored. The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found in a number of <a href="protected%20areas%20of%20the%20United%20States">protected areas of the United States</a>, its principal territory. Estimates from the <a href="US%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">US Fish and Wildlife Service</a> placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. It is listed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor.
The species is considered endangered in Ohio, Indiana, and New Jersey. It was removed from the threatened list of Illinois in 1999 and of Iowa in 2003. In Pennsylvania, limited hunting and trapping are once again allowed, after having been banned from 1970 to 1999. The bobcat also suffered population decline in New Jersey at the turn of the 19th century, mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">habitat fragmentation</a>; by 1972, the bobcat was given full legal protection, and was listed as endangered in the state in 1991. "L. r. escuinipae", the subspecies found in Mexico, was for a time considered endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, but was delisted in 2005.

The bobcat has long been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but has maintained a high population, even in the southern United States, where it is extensively hunted. In the 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat <a href="fur%20clothing">fur</a> caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly. Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter, when hunting season is generally open.

Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, which can lead to reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.

In bobcats using urban habitats in California, the use of <a href="rodenticide">rodenticide</a>s has been linked to both secondary poisoning by consuming poisoned rats and mice, and to increased rates of severe mite infestation (known as notoedric mange), as an animal with a poison-weakened immune system is less capable of fighting off mange. Liver autopsies in California bobcats that have succumbed to notoedric mange have revealed chronic rodenticide exposure. Alternative rodent control measures such as vegetation control and use of traps have been suggested to alleviate this issue.

In <a href="Mythologies%20of%20the%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American mythology</a>, the bobcat is often twinned with the figure of the <a href="Coyote%20%28mythology%29">coyote</a> in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are associated with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the <a href="Nez%20Perce%20tribe">Nez Perce</a> folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. <a href="Claude%20L%C3%A9vi-Strauss">Claude Lévi-Strauss</a> argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.

In a <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> tale, the bobcat is outwitted by a rabbit, which gives rise to its spots. After trapping the rabbit in a tree, the bobcat is persuaded to build a fire, only to have the embers scattered on its fur, leaving it singed with dark brown spots. The <a href="Mohave%20people">Mohave</a> believed dreaming habitually of beings or objects would afford them their characteristics as supernatural powers. Dreaming of two deities, cougar and lynx, they thought, would grant them the superior hunting skills of other tribes. European settlers to the Americas also admired the cat, both for its ferocity and its grace, and in the United States, it "rests prominently in the anthology of ... national folklore."

Grave artifacts from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the <a href="Illinois%20River">Illinois River</a> revealed a complete skeleton of a young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the <a href="Hopewell%20tradition">Hopewell culture</a>. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village and not in the mounts themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.

Talyllyn Railway

The Talyllyn Railway () is a <a href="narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> <a href="heritage%20railway">preserved</a> railway in <a href="Wales">Wales</a> running for from <a href="Tywyn">Tywyn</a> on the <a href="Mid-Wales">Mid-Wales</a> coast to <a href="Nant%20Gwernol%20railway%20station">Nant Gwernol</a> near the village of <a href="Abergynolwyn">Abergynolwyn</a>. The line was opened in 1865 to carry <a href="slate">slate</a> from the quarries at <a href="Bryn%20Eglwys">Bryn Eglwys</a> to Tywyn, and was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">Act of Parliament</a> to carry passengers using steam haulage. Despite severe under-investment, the line remained open, and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a <a href="heritage%20railway">heritage railway</a> by volunteers.

Since preservation, the railway has operated as a <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a>, expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages. In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001, the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary, and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of <a href="Tywyn%20Wharf%20railway%20station">Tywyn Wharf station</a> took place, including a much-expanded facility for the <a href="Narrow%20Gauge%20Railway%20Museum">Narrow Gauge Railway Museum</a>.

The fictional <a href="Skarloey%20Railway">Skarloey Railway</a>, which formed part of "<a href="The%20Railway%20Series">The Railway Series</a>" of children's books by <a href="W.%20V.%20Awdry">The Rev. W. Awdry</a>, was based on the Talyllyn Railway. The preservation of the line inspired the <a href="Ealing%20Comedy">Ealing Comedy</a> film "<a href="The%20Titfield%20Thunderbolt">The Titfield Thunderbolt</a>".

The origin of the railway's name is uncertain: it may refer to the parish of <a href="Tal-y-llyn%2C%20Gwynedd">Tal-y-llyn</a>, which contains its eastern terminus, or it may come from <a href="Tal-y-llyn%20Lake">Tal-y-llyn</a>, a large glacial <a href="ribbon%20lake">ribbon lake</a> at the foot of <a href="Cadair%20Idris">Cadair Idris</a> further east. The <a href="Track%20gauge">gauge</a> of the <a href="Track%20%28rail%20transport%29">track</a> is unusual, and was shared by only three other public railways in the United Kingdom: the <a href="Corris%20Railway">Corris Railway</a> and the <a href="Plynlimon%20and%20Hafan%20Tramway">Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway</a> both a few miles from the Talyllyn, and the <a href="Campbeltown%20and%20Machrihanish%20Light%20Railway">Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway</a> in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>.

<a href="Slate%20industry%20in%20Wales">Slate quarrying</a> began in the hills above Tywyn in the 1830s, but although many small quarries and test levels were established, only one major quarry was developed in the region, at <a href="Bryn%20Eglwys">Bryn Eglwys</a>, north east of the town. Underground working began in the early 1840s, and by 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by <a href="packhorse">packhorse</a> to the wharf at <a href="Pennal">Pennal</a>, transferred to boats for a river trip to <a href="Aberdyfi">Aberdyfi</a> (or the Anglicised Aberdovey still commonly used), and then finally loaded into seagoing vessels, a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry's output. In 1861 the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> cut off supplies of <a href="cotton">cotton</a> to the <a href="Cotton%20mill">mills</a> of the north west of England and as a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was <a href="William%20McConnel">William McConnel</a> of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> who, in 1859, had purchased <a href="Hengwrt">Hengwrt Hall</a> near <a href="Dolgellau">Dolgellau</a>, north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company, which leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of <a href="Machynlleth">Machynlleth</a>.
McConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output. He focused on providing rail transport for the isolated quarry, and in April 1864 he reached agreement with local landowners to purchase the land necessary to build a railway towards Tywyn and onwards to the port of Aberdyfi. Construction was well underway by July 1864. The standard gauge <a href="Aberystwyth%20and%20Welsh%20Coast%20Railway">Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway</a> was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth, however, and in 1863 had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway. This was despite the line's initial isolation from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the <a href="Afon%20Dyfi">Afon Dyfi</a> to the south. An <a href="Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Act of Parliament</a> (28 and 29 <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Vict</a>, cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> on 5 July 1865, and the company appointed <a href="The%20Spooners%20of%20Porthmadog">James Swinton Spooner</a> as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> inspector <a href="Henry%20Whatley%20Tyler">Captain Henry Tyler</a> could make an initial inspection and report.

Tyler's report led to an unusual alteration, as it was discovered that the internal width of the <a href="Overpass%23Railway">overbridges</a> was only , but the railway's <a href="List%20of%20Talyllyn%20Railway%20rolling%20stock%23Carriages">passenger carriages</a> were wide, leaving only clearance on either side, which was less than the minimum required <a href="Engineering%20tolerance">clearance</a> of . To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges to allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors, which would allow passengers to get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway which is shared (albeit for different reasons) with the neighbouring Corris Railway. Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No. 1 suffered from excessive "vertical motion" and No. 2 was said to suffer from "horizontal oscillation". No. 1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of <a href="trailing%20wheel">trailing wheel</a>s was added to reduce the rear overhang, and the <a href="Suspension%20%28vehicle%29%23Springs%20and%20dampers">springs</a> on No. 2 were adjusted and the <a href="crank%20pin">crank pin</a>s shortened to reduce its oscillation.

Tyler did not approve the opening until his listed improvements were completed, although slate trains and unofficial passenger trains were running in 1865. During November of that 1866, Tyler returned to Tywyn and re-inspected the railway following which, subject to some further minor improvements, he approved its formal opening for passenger service. The first public passenger timetable was issued in December 1866, and the first purpose-built, steam-worked, narrow gauge public railway in Britain opened for service.

The railway opened with two locomotives, one carriage and several goods vehicles in use and was operated under a "<a href="Signalling%20block%20systems">one engine in steam</a>" policy to ensure that two trains could not collide. Initially the working locomotive was housed in a wooden shed at Ty Dwr on the mineral line above <a href="Abergynolwyn%20railway%20station">Abergynolwyn station</a>, while the main engineering works at were constructed. The Pendre works opened on 17 February 1867 and from then on trains began working from Pendre instead of Abergynolwyn.

At the time of the line's opening, stations were provided at Pendre and Abergynolwyn. In 1867, the halt at opened, followed by and in 1873. Some time shortly after the opening of the railway a branch to Abergynolwyn village was provided. A steep <a href="cable%20railway">incline</a> dropped from the mineral line east of Abergynolwyn station to the village below, where a series of tram lines radiated. Coal, building materials and general goods were delivered down the incline and the contents of the village <a href="cesspit">cesspit</a>s were hauled back up for disposal along the lineside.

The railway used <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s from the start, unlike its neighbour the horse-drawn Corris Railway. The original two locomotives, although of entirely different design, were both purchased from <a href="Fletcher%2C%20Jennings%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Fletcher, Jennings & Co.</a> of <a href="Whitehaven">Whitehaven</a> in <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>, and both are still in service, 150 years on, although so many of their parts have been replaced down the years that much of their present-day component metal is not original. The Talyllyn's rare gauge is thought to have been adopted to match that of the Corris Railway, and the line's two original steam locomotives were among the earliest locomotives built for such a narrow gauge. No. 1 "<a href="Talyllyn%20%28locomotive%29">Talyllyn</a>" is an <a href="0-4-2">0-4-2</a>ST (<a href="Tank%20locomotive%23Saddle%20tank">saddle tank</a>) and No. 2 "<a href="Dolgoch%20%28locomotive%29">Dolgoch</a>" is an <a href="0-4-0">0-4-0</a>WT (<a href="well%20tank">well tank</a>). The line carried slate from the quarry to the wharf at Tywyn and general goods along its length. Public passenger trains initially ran between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre stations only; quarrymen were carried on unofficial trains that continued on from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline in Nant Gwernol gorge.

The line operated successfully during its early years, serving the quarry and the local district. By 1880, Bryn Eglwys employed 300 workers and was producing of finished slate per year, all shipped via the railway. Passenger traffic was substantial, rising from 11,500 passengers carried in 1867 to over 23,000 (roughly equivalent to 40,000 passenger journeys) in 1877.

From the 1880s onwards the "<a href="Corris%20Railway%20Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a>" was a popular option with tourists. This used <a href="charabanc">charabanc</a>s to link the Talyllyn and Corris railways via Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cadair Idris, returning on <a href="Cambrian%20Railways">Cambrian Railways</a> trains. The last two decades of the 19th century saw a decline in the demand for slate and many smaller quarries fell on hard times, including Bryn Eglwys, where by 1890 production had halved to a year. In 1896, production at the <a href="Penrhyn%20Quarry">Penrhyn Quarry</a> in north Wales, one of the largest producers of slate, was stopped due to labour disputes, resulting in a temporary increase in demand at other quarries. McConnel expanded production at Bryn Eglwys to take advantage of the sudden demand, but only with the aim of maximising profits during the remainder of his lease, which was to expire in 1910. He built new trial levels without proper provision for the removal of <a href="overburden">overburden</a> and pushed the limits of safe working in the existing chambers. As McConnel's lease drew to its close, there was no prospect of a further lessee coming forward and work began on dismantling the quarry's equipment.

The Bryn Eglwys quarry was the primary employer in the Abergynolwyn district, so its closure caused significant distress. In 1910, local landowner <a href="Henry%20Haydn%20Jones">Henry Haydn Jones</a> was elected the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">MP</a> for <a href="Merionethshire">Merioneth</a>. He understood the importance of Bryn Eglwys, and at the end of the year he purchased the quarry company for just over £5000. The quarry re-opened in January 1911, though Haydn Jones did not have <a href="capital%20%28economics%29">capital</a> to invest in the quarry. The first workings reopened were on the "Broad Vein", which yielded relatively hard slate that was less popular and therefore difficult to sell. The lack of an available market for this output forced the quarry to switch to extracting softer slate from the "Narrow Vein" but, because Haydn Jones could not afford to open new workings into the Narrow Vein, he resorted to the dangerous practice of narrowing the columns that supported the roofs of the underground chambers. This practice had begun under McConnel's ownership and Haydn Jones continued it throughout his ownership of the quarry. A brief construction boom after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> saw production return to around per year.

The 1920s also saw an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain recovered from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At the end of the day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by <a href="Gravity%20railway">gravity</a>. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.

The lease on Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was extended on an annual basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on other days. Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in the quarry gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway as long as he was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom. Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the <a href="Aberllefenni%20Slate%20Quarry">Aberllefenni Slate Quarry</a> purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway. On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.

The author and biographer <a href="L.%20T.%20C.%20Rolt">Tom Rolt</a>, visited the line in 1949, along with the locomotive engineer <a href="David%20Curwen">David Curwen</a>. In the summer of 1950, Rolt wrote a letter to the "<a href="Birmingham%20Post">Birmingham Post</a>" newspaper suggesting that a rescue of the Talyllyn be undertaken. He received sufficient positive response for a meeting of interested enthusiasts to be held on 11 October 1950 at the Imperial Hotel in Birmingham. Around 70 people, including <a href="Patrick%20Whitehouse">Patrick Whitehouse</a>, attended the meeting, with Rolt proposing the formation of a committee to look into the acquisition of the railway. With the support of the meeting, the committee – with Rolt as chairman and Whitehouse as Secretary – met for the first time on 23 October and immediately entered into negotiation with Haydn Jones' executors.

The transfer of ownership to the committee was legally complex, but both parties agreed that all shares in the railway company would be transferred from Haydn Jones' estate to a new company called Talyllyn Holdings Ltd., whose board consisted of two directors from the executors and two from the committee. The transfer took place on 8 February 1951, at which point the newly formed Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society effectively took control of the railway. The Society immediately began to publicise its efforts, hoping to raise funds and find further volunteers to help reopen the railway, and by May nearly 650 members had joined the society. The railway re-opened under the control of the Society for the first time on the <a href="Whit%20Monday">Whit Monday</a> bank holiday, 14 May 1951, with trains running between Wharf and Rhydyronen stations. Regular trains began to run on 4 June and continued through the summer, with David Curwen acting as the first Chief Mechanical Engineer.

Another early addition to the locomotive fleet was No. 6 "<a href="Douglas%20%28locomotive%29">Douglas</a>", donated to the society by the Birmingham engineering firm Abelsons Ltd. This locomotive was built for the <a href="British%20military%20narrow%20gauge%20railways">depot railway</a> serving <a href="RAF%20Calshot">RAF Calshot</a> where it worked until 1945, and, after rebuilding from its original gauge, it entered service in 1954. Through the 1950s the volunteers and staff members of the TRPS rebuilt the line and rescued it from its state of decay, during a period characterised by a "<a href="Boy%27s%20Own%20Paper">"Boy's Own" comic</a> spirit of adventure, involving enthusiasm, ingenuity and a fair degree of irresponsibility".

On 22 May 1957 the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> produced a live <a href="Outside%20broadcasting">outside broadcast</a> from the railway, during which <a href="Wynford%20Vaughan%20Thomas">Wynford Vaughan Thomas</a> and <a href="Huw%20Weldon">Huw Weldon</a> commentated on a trip from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500 passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience. The following year locomotive No. 1 "Talyllyn" returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.

An important development during this period was the establishment of the <a href="Narrow%20Gauge%20Railway%20Museum">Narrow Gauge Railway Museum</a> at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by <a href="Diageo">Guinness</a> from their recently closed <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Gate%20Brewery">St. James's Gate Brewery</a> railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the nucleus of the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old <a href="gunpowder%20magazine">gunpowder store</a> at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.

The 1960s proved to be a decade of consolidation for the Talyllyn. Pendre works underwent several much-needed expansions, adding additional covered storage for carriages and more workshop room. Modern machine tools, along with proper lighting and a new power supply were added. Substantial improvements to Tywyn Wharf station were also made, along with continued relaying and upgrading of the track to Abergynolwyn. Passenger numbers continued to climb after the 1957 BBC broadcast; in 1960, 67,000 passenger journeys were made, increasing to 78,500 in 1964. In response to this growing popularity the railway undertook a programme of new rolling stock construction.

By the early 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was in need of major improvements. Before preservation, the station had contained only a fan of sidings, which meant that there was no way for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A <a href="passing%20loop">loop</a> was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre, but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.

As passenger numbers continued to grow during the late 1960s it became clear that further motive power was needed, especially as the rebuilt No. 1 was not performing well. The Talyllyn's unusual track gauge and restricted loading gauge meant that it was unlikely that a locomotive could be found that could work on the line unaltered, so in 1969 a gauge steam locomotive was purchased from the <a href="Bord%20na%20Mona">Bord na Mona</a> (Irish Peat Board) with a view to rebuilding it for use on the Talyllyn. This locomotive was unofficially known as "Irish Pete", a nod to its original use.

The preservation society had long held ambitions to extend the railway along the former mineral extension from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline, and as early as 1959 work had begun to trace the owners of the land that the extension traversed. Planning began in the mid-1960s, but construction did not start until 1968 when the winding house for the Abergynolwyn village incline was demolished. To bring the line up to passenger standards some of the curves needed to be eased, and this required blasting work, as the line runs on a narrow ledge on the hillside at this point. The extension and new station at Nant Gwernol were opened on 22 May 1976 by Wynford Vaughan Thomas who drove in the ceremonial "<a href="golden%20spike">golden spike</a>" to complete the extension. Despite this official opening ceremony, minor work still remained to bring the extension to the standard required to run regular passenger trains, but regular train services began on 29 May 1976.
Although the extension of the railway was completed in 1976, work in the vicinity continued with the creation of footpaths connecting to the new station. A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge and connecting the station with the existing path on the east side of the river. The bridge and paths were opened on 3 May 1980 by <a href="Gordon%20Parry%2C%20Baron%20Parry">Lord Parry</a>, the chairman of the <a href="Visit%20Wales">Wales Tourist Board</a>. By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger numbers were no longer increasing. After 1973, the peak year for passengers on the Talyllyn with 186,000 passenger journeys made, numbers were to decline consistently until the 1990s. Preliminary work on the conversion of "Irish Pete" for use on the Talyllyn, which had begun in the early 1970s, was put on hold in 1975 and the chassis and boiler were put into storage at Pendre.

With passenger numbers falling and the line extended to Nant Gwernol, the railway entered a period of consolidation. By 1987, the <a href="boiler">boiler</a> on locomotive No. 6 "Douglas" was life expired and in need of replacement. Consideration was given to reviving the project to build a new locomotive from the components of "Irish Pete" instead of purchasing a new boiler for "Douglas" and in early 1988 work recommenced on the rebuilding of the ex-Bord na Mona locomotive. A new design for an 0-4-2 side tank locomotive was prepared by the railway's Chief Engineer John Bate, which reused the chassis and boiler from the locomotive with a new superstructure and the addition of trailing wheels, and the new locomotive, officially named "<a href="Tom%20Rolt%20%28locomotive%29">Tom Rolt</a>" after the Preservation Society's first chairman, was put into service on 6 May 1991. During this period further expansions of both Tywyn Wharf and Pendre stations were undertaken and Abergynolwyn station, which had been rebuilt as part of the Nant Gwernol extension in the 1970s, was expanded further to provide an additional attraction at the eastern end of the line.

One major anomaly remained in the railway's operations: the 1889 <a href="Regulation%20of%20Railways%20Act%201889">Regulation of Railways Act</a> had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with <a href="Brake%20%28railway%29%23Continuous%20brakes">continuous brakes</a>. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, on the basis that the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, but by the end of the 1990s the <a href="HM%20Railway%20Inspectorate">Railway Inspectorate</a> was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100 years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by <a href="Air%20brake%20%28rail%29">air brake pumps</a> mounted on the locomotives.

The Preservation Society celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001, and as part of the year of celebrations a major new project was launched to once more extend and improve facilities at Tywyn Wharf station. For many years the station had been home to semi-permanent buildings housing the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, but the new plans for the station included the construction of a new two-storey building to house the museum and the extension of the existing station building to house a new cafe and booking office. Work began on the first phase of the project in January 2002. In 2003 the railway received a £682,500 <a href="National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%23Good%20causes">Heritage Lottery</a> grant towards the £1,170,000 cost of redeveloping Wharf station, and the new station and museum were officially opened by <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a> and <a href="Camilla%2C%20The%20Duchess%20of%20Cornwall">The Duchess of Cornwall</a> on 13 July 2005. The railway has seen a steady increase in passengers carried since the turn of the <a href="3rd%20millennium">millennium</a>, with nearly 51,000 passenger bookings and 95,500 passenger journeys recorded in 2006, although this figure is still only around half the peak figure carried in 1973. In 2011, the railway celebrated 60 years of preservation, and received an <a href="Engineering%20Heritage%20Award">Engineering Heritage Award</a> from the <a href="Institute%20of%20Mechanical%20Engineers">Institute of Mechanical Engineers</a> in recognition of its importance in Welsh industrial heritage.

The railway struggled financially for several years after the banking collapse of 2007, but slowly began to recover. In 2008 a large amount of equipment was purchased from the gauge military railway at RNAD Trecwn, including a large quantity of track components and three diesel locomotives. In 2011, the railway celebrated the 60th anniversary of its rescue by the volunteers of 1951.

In April 2012, locomotive No.2 "Dolgoch" appeared at the Steel Steam and Stars Gala at the <a href="Llangollen%20Railway">Llangollen Railway</a>, running on a temporary section of narrow gauge track. This was the first time that "Dolgoch" had operated away from its home railway in 146 years. In June 2013 the railway was awarded the <a href="Queen%27s%20Award%20for%20Voluntary%20Service">Queen's Award for Voluntary Service</a>. 2015 was the 150th anniversary of the official opening of the railway, and this was celebrated with a series of events throughout the year.

The Talyllyn Railway remains a successful and popular tourist attraction. The original 1860s locomotives and passenger stock still run regularly alongside the roster of more modern rolling stock. The railway is promoted as one of "<a href="The%20Great%20Little%20Trains%20of%20Wales">The Great Little Trains of Wales</a>", a joint marketing scheme launched in 1970 that encompasses ten narrow gauge railways in the country, mostly found in north and mid Wales.

In 2003 the railway employed 13 full-time staff, plus the equivalent of an extra six part-time staff in the summer and some 350 volunteers.

The railway operates a programme of special events throughout the year. These have include in the past the Have-A-Go Gala, Tom Rolt Steam and Vintage Rally and have a Victorian Week. Current events include children's Duncan Days. Since 1984 there has been an annual running event called <a href="Race%20the%20Train">Race the Train</a>, which follows the railway track from Tywyn to Abergynolwyn and back again. The challenge is for runners to complete the cross country route faster than the train, which takes around 1 hour 45 minutes.

The Young Members Group (YMG) are members and volunteers of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society who are between the ages of 14 and 25. On occasions during the peak season, the Railway has held Young Members Days in which the youngest qualified people available that day run the railway.

The main terminus of the line is at (originally known as King's Station, after a local landowner), where the railway's administrative headquarters and the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum are located. When the line carried traffic from the quarry, slates were transferred to the <a href="Cambrian%20Railways">Cambrian Railways</a> on the <a href="transhipment">transhipment</a> sidings. Leaving Wharf station, which stands at an elevation of above sea level, the line passes immediately under the A493 <a href="Machynlleth">Machynlleth</a> to <a href="Dolgellau">Dolgellau</a> road and enters a long <a href="Cutting%20%28transportation%29">cutting</a> that climbs towards , at a maximum <a href="Grade%20%28slope%29%23Railways">gradient</a> of 1 in 60. On the left (north) side of the cutting there was once a long siding used for gravity <a href="Shunt%20%28railway%20operations%29">shunting</a> of wagons into the sidings at Wharf station. The railway runs through the cutting for about , before passing under another road bridge and passing the <a href="Motive%20power%20depot">locomotive and carriage sheds</a> and works at Pendre.
From Pendre, the railway passes over a gated <a href="level%20crossing">level crossing</a> and runs beside an industrial estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge and on to Hendy, the first of five <a href="Minor%20halts%20on%20the%20Talyllyn%20Railway">minor halts</a>, which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the <a href="River%20Fathew">Fathew</a> valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the valley floor, although this is where some of the steepest gradients on the line are to be found. The <a href="ruling%20gradient">ruling gradient</a> of the line is 1 in 60.

More local halts follow at Fach Goch, and Cynfal, the latter having a small platform. The section from Cynfal to was relaid in 1951 using rail purchased from the Corris Railway after the latter line's closure in 1948. Rhydyronen, a <a href="request%20stop">request stop</a>, was the first intermediate station built on the line, opening in 1867. A siding at the station was shortened in 1957 and removed completely circa 1975. A short steep climb under a road bridge follows the station, followed by a slight downhill gradient. Unlike the Ffestiniog Railway, the Talyllyn was not designed to be worked as a gravity line, however this is the only downhill section between Pendre and Nant Gwernol. Another minor halt follows at Tynllwynhen, before the passing loop and request stop at .
Above Brynglas, the line crosses the Cwm Pandy stream and enters a shallow cutting, climbing as it goes. The cutting ends at a road overbridge after which the line runs through open countryside as it starts to ascend the valley side on a ledge. After approximately it enters woodlands west of , climbing steadily, then curves to the south east and crosses the Dolgoch gorge on the Dolgoch viaduct, which carries the line above the Dolgoch ravine. Dolgoch station is immediately east of the viaduct, situated on a left-hand curve at above sea level, and is the main intermediate station on the line, being popular with tourists visiting the nearby <a href="Dolgoch%20Falls">falls</a>. The railway continues in a north easterly direction, curving through the woods and climbing the valley side. It shortly passes Quarry Siding, where a halt and passing loop are located; this is the site of a small old <a href="shale">shale</a> quarry, the rock from which was used for <a href="Track%20ballast">ballasting</a> on the railway. A large permanent way and storage shed opened on the site in 2013. The line continues its ascent towards <a href="Abergynolwyn%20railway%20station">Abergynolwyn station</a>, situated on a ledge cut into the hillside.

The original terminus of the statutory railway was Abergynolwyn, beyond which the railway continued as a long mineral extension, now converted for passenger use. The extension was originally sharply curved, as the line turns south east into the steeply sided Nant Gwernol gorge but these curves were eased when conversion for passenger use took place in 1976. The whole section is within woods, now owned by the <a href="Forestry%20Commission">Forestry Commission</a>. Shortly after crossing over the forestry road the line reaches Ty Dwr, where the original locomotive shed stood from 1865 until it was demolished after Pendre works opened in 1867, although the slate water tower continued in use into the 1950s.

After passing the site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending at the foot of the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The original line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. <a href="Nant%20Gwernol%20railway%20station">Nant Gwernol station</a>, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on the site of the sidings.
The village of <a href="Abergynolwyn">Abergynolwyn</a> was built to house the quarrymen of Bryn Eglwys and their families, and to serve the village an <a href="Cable%20railway">incline</a> with winding house was laid three quarters of the way along the mineral extension. The winding house for the incline stood on the narrow ledge, with the mineral line passing through it. The two-track incline dropped over a distance of . At its foot, the line crossed the Nant Gwernol on a girder bridge. Immediately after the bridge, short lines branched off to the east from a wagon <a href="Turntable%20%28railroad%29">turntable</a> to the coal yard and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a <a href="slate%20%28writing%29">writing slate</a> factory (later a carpenter's yard). The main branch then split to form a storage loop, with a further wagon turntable and a longer branch serving the houses and school to the north east. The main branch continued north, crossing the main road then passing between the two main terraces in the village before ending in a turntable and a final short line connecting to the Capel Jerusalem chapel. The village incline was lifted during the early years of preservation, to provide much needed rail to replace the existing track. The winding house was demolished in 1968 to allow realignment of the railway to form the extension to Nant Gwernol.

Until the closure of the quarries in 1946, the line east from Abergynolwyn was worked as a mineral tramway – only slate and goods trains serving Bryn Eglwys ran on this section. The quarry lay about south-east of Nant Gwernol station and above it, with a further mineral tramway connecting the quarry with the railway. What is now Nant Gwernol station was the terminus of the Talyllyn Railway proper. Here the line fanned out into a set of sidings where inbound trains were left and outbound slate trains assembled. The sidings were located on a narrow ledge in the side of the Nant Gwernol gorge.

Rising south-east from the end of the sidings was the long, double track gravity operated, Alltwyllt Incline, from the top of which the Galltymoelfre Tramway ran south-east towards the quarry for about . The tramway was laid in light <a href="Rail%20profile%23History">bridge rail</a> and worked for its entire existence using horses. The tramway ended at the foot of the Cantrybedd Incline, a long double track, gravity operated incline. This final incline rose to the north edge of Bryn Eglwys quarry, reaching a height of above sea level.

The line has six steam locomotives for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used for shunting and to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable at the same time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul. The railway also owns 23 carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.
The railway is <a href="Single%20track%20%28rail%29">single track</a>, so special measures have to be taken to prevent collisions. Before preservation, the railway operated a "<a href="Signalling%20block%20systems">one engine in steam</a>" policy, but with growing passenger numbers it became necessary to install passing loops and a more stringent method of single line control was introduced. The line is worked by Electric Key <a href="Token%20%28railway%20signalling%29">tokens</a>, which authorise the driver to enter a section of single line, and these are interlocked to prevent more than one token being withdrawn for a section at any one time. There is a loop at Pendre, which was used from the opening of the railway for shunting purposes, and further loops were installed at Brynglas in 1953 and Quarry Siding in 1963. When the Nant Gwernol extension opened in 1976, Abergynolwyn also became a passing loop. Between Abergynolwyn and Nant Gwernol the line is controlled by staff and ticket operation, which is controlled by the Abergynolwyn Blockman when on Duty.

Each passing loop is controlled by a small <a href="signal%20box">signal box</a>, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the <a href="Signalman%20%28rail%29">blockman</a> allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, it is the responsibility of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.

The Talyllyn Railway is represented in "<a href="The%20Railway%20Series">The Railway Series</a>" books by the <a href="W.V.%20Awdry">Reverend W. Awdry</a> and the spin-off TV series "<a href="Thomas%20%26amp%3B%20Friends">Thomas & Friends</a>" as the <a href="Skarloey%20Railway">Skarloey Railway</a>; most of the fictional locomotives are based on real-life equivalents. Awdry visited the line on a family holiday in the early days of preservation and became involved as a volunteer soon afterwards. Several of the stories in "The Railway Series" come from his real-life experiences at the Talyllyn, and some of the books contain full-page illustrations of Talyllyn locomotives.

The preservation of the Talyllyn Railway by volunteers was the inspiration for the 1953 film "<a href="The%20Titfield%20Thunderbolt">The Titfield Thunderbolt</a>", an <a href="Ealing%20Studios">Ealing Studios</a> comedy about a group of villagers attempting to run a service on a disused <a href="branch%20line">branch line</a> after closure. <a href="T.%20E.%20B.%20Clarke">T. E. B. Clarke</a>, the script writer for the film, had heard about the preservation of the Talyllyn and spent a day on the railway in 1951, and some of the early incidents in preservation were incorporated into the film. In the book "Railway Adventure" Tom Rolt recalled that he had hoped the film might be produced on the Talyllyn, but it was eventually filmed on the recently closed <a href="Camerton%2C%20Somerset">Camerton</a> branch of the <a href="Bristol%20and%20North%20Somerset%20Railway">Bristol and North Somerset Railway</a> branch line along the <a href="Cam%20Brook%20valley">Cam Brook valley</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>.

Roger Waters

George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English songwriter, singer, bassist, and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> band <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>. Waters initially served as the bassist, but following the departure of songwriter <a href="Syd%20Barrett">Syd Barrett</a> in 1968, he also became their lyricist, co-lead vocalist, and conceptual leader.

Pink Floyd achieved international success with the <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>s "<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>" (1973), "<a href="Wish%20You%20Were%20Here%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Wish You Were Here</a>" (1975), "<a href="Animals%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Animals</a>" (1977), and "<a href="The%20Wall">The Wall</a>" (1979). By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over the use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987.

Waters' solo work includes the studio albums "<a href="The%20Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Hitch%20Hiking">The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</a>" (1984), "<a href="Radio%20K.A.O.S.">Radio K.A.O.S.</a>" (1987)"," "<a href="Amused%20to%20Death">Amused to Death</a>" (1992)"," and "<a href="Is%20This%20the%20Life%20We%20Really%20Want%3F">Is This the Life We Really Want?</a>" (2017). In 2005, he released "", an <a href="opera">opera</a> translated from <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Roda-Gil">Étienne</a> and Nadine Roda-Gils' <a href="libretto">libretto</a> about the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>.

In 1990, Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, "<a href="The%20Wall%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Live%20in%20Berlin">The Wall – Live in Berlin</a>", with an attendance of 450,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the U.S. <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1996 and the <a href="UK%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame">UK Music Hall of Fame</a> in 2005. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Mason, Wright and <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a> for the <a href="Live%208">Live 8</a> global awareness event, the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999; he performed "The Dark Side of the Moon" in its entirety for his <a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon%20Live">world tour of 2006–2008</a>, and in 2010 began the <a href="The%20Wall%20Live%20%282010%E2%80%9313%29">"Wall Live"</a> tour, the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20concert%20tours">highest-grossing of all time by a solo artist</a>.

Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913–2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914–1944), in <a href="Great%20Bookham">Great Bookham</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. His father, the son of a <a href="coal%20miner">coal miner</a> and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party</a> member. In the early years of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Waters' father was a <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a> who drove an ambulance during <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>.

Waters' father later changed his stance on <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a>, joined the <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> and was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, <a href="Royal%20Fusiliers">Royal Fusiliers</a> as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943. He was killed five months later on 18 February 1944 at <a href="Aprilia%2C%20Lazio">Aprilia</a>, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Anzio">Battle of Anzio</a>, when Roger was five months old. He is commemorated at the <a href="Cassino%20War%20Cemetery">Cassino War Cemetery</a>. On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio. Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and raised them there. Waters' earliest memory is of the <a href="Victory%20over%20Japan%20Day">V-J Day</a> celebrations.

Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the <a href="Cambridgeshire%20High%20School%20for%20Boys">Cambridgeshire High School for Boys</a> (now <a href="Hills%20Road%20Sixth%20Form%20College">Hills Road Sixth Form College</a>) with <a href="Syd%20Barrett">Syd Barrett</a>, while future Pink Floyd guitarist <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a> lived nearby on Mill Road and attended <a href="the%20Perse%20School">the Perse School</a>. At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth <a href="Campaign%20for%20Nuclear%20Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> (YCND), having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation. He was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school's <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and rugby teams. Waters was unhappy at school, saying: "I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one ... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers."

Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his childhood in Cambridge, he met future Pink Floyd founder members <a href="Nick%20Mason">Nick Mason</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wright%20%28musician%29">Richard Wright</a> in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the <a href="University%20of%20Westminster">University of Westminster</a>) school of architecture. Waters enrolled there in 1962, after a series of aptitude tests indicated he was well-suited to that field. He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering.

By September 1963, Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. They usually called themselves Sigma 6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided occasional vocals. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a <a href="tearoom">tearoom</a> in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic.

When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963, the remaining members asked Barrett and guitarist <a href="Bob%20Klose">Bob Klose</a> to join. Waters switched to the bass and by January 1964, the group became known as the Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. Sometime during late 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and by early 1966, Pink Floyd.

By early 1966, Barrett was Pink Floyd's frontman, guitarist, and songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP "<a href="The%20Piper%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Dawn">The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</a>", released in August 1967. Waters contributed the song "<a href="Take%20Up%20Thy%20Stethoscope%20and%20Walk">Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk</a>" (his first sole writing credit) to the album. By late 1967, Barrett's deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour, rendered him "unable or unwilling" to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd's singer-songwriter and lead guitarist. In early March 1968 Pink Floyd met with managers <a href="Peter%20Jenner">Peter Jenner</a> and <a href="Andrew%20King%20%28music%20manager%29">Andrew King</a> of <a href="Blackhill%20Enterprises">Blackhill Enterprises</a> to discuss the band's future. Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band "agreed to Blackhill's entitlement in perpetuity" regarding "past activities". The band's new manager <a href="Steve%20O%27Rourke">Steve O'Rourke</a> made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of David Gilmour in April 1968.

Filling the void left by Barrett's departure in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter and lyricist, shared lead vocals with Gilmour and sometimes Wright, and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. He wrote most of the lyrics to the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his departure, starting with "The Dark Side of the Moon" (1973) and ending with "The Final Cut" (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album since "<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>" has been a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>. With lyrics written entirely by Waters, "The Dark Side of the Moon" was one of the most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005. According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, "Dark Side of the Moon" is the world's second bestselling album and the United States' 21st-bestselling album.

Waters produced thematic ideas that became the impetus for the Pink Floyd concept albums "The Dark Side of the Moon" (1973), "<a href="Wish%20You%20Were%20Here%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Wish You Were Here</a>" (1975), "<a href="Animals%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Animals</a>" (1977) and "<a href="The%20Wall">The Wall</a>" (1979)—written largely by Waters—and "<a href="The%20Final%20Cut%20%28album%29">The Final Cut</a>" (1983)—written entirely by Waters. He referred or alluded to the cost of war and the loss of his father throughout his work, from "<a href="Corporal%20Clegg">Corporal Clegg</a>" ("<a href="A%20Saucerful%20of%20Secrets">A Saucerful of Secrets</a>", 1968) and "<a href="Free%20Four">Free Four</a>" ("<a href="Obscured%20by%20Clouds">Obscured by Clouds</a>", 1972) to "<a href="Us%20and%20Them%20%28song%29">Us and Them</a>" from "The Dark Side of the Moon", "<a href="When%20the%20Tigers%20Broke%20Free">When the Tigers Broke Free</a>", first used in the feature film, "<a href="Pink%20Floyd%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Wall">The Wall</a>" (1982), later included with "<a href="The%20Fletcher%20Memorial%20Home">The Fletcher Memorial Home</a>" on "The Final Cut", an album dedicated to his father. The theme and composition of "The Wall" was influenced by his upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

The double album "The Wall" was written almost entirely by Waters and is largely based on his life story. Having sold over 23 million <a href="RIAA%20certification">RIAA certified units</a> in the US as of 2013, is one of the top three bestselling albums of all time in America, according to RIAA. Pink Floyd hired <a href="Bob%20Ezrin">Bob Ezrin</a> to co-produce the album and cartoonist <a href="Gerald%20Scarfe">Gerald Scarfe</a> to illustrate the sleeve art. The band embarked on <a href="The%20Wall%20Tour%20%281980%E2%80%9381%29">The Wall Tour</a> of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of "The Wall" was on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.

In March 1983, the last Waters–Gilmour–Mason collaboration, "The Final Cut", was released. The album was subtitled: "A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd". Waters wrote all the album's lyrics and music. His lyrics were critical of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> government of the day and mention Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> by name. At the time Gilmour did not have any new material, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour's name "disappeared" from the production credits, though he retained his pay. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine gave the album five stars, with <a href="Kurt%20Loder">Kurt Loder</a> describing it as "a superlative achievement" and "art rock's crowning masterpiece". Loder viewed the work as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album".

Amidst creative differences, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985 and began a legal battle with the band regarding their continued use of the name and material. In December 1985, Waters issued a statement to EMI and CBS invoking the "Leaving Member" clause in his contract. In October 1986, he initiated <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> proceedings to formally dissolve the Pink Floyd partnership. In his submission to the High Court he called Pink Floyd a "spent force creatively". Gilmour and Mason opposed the application and announced their intention to continue as Pink Floyd. Waters claims to have been forced to resign like Wright had been years earlier, and decided to leave Pink Floyd based on legal considerations, stating: "if I hadn't, the financial repercussions would have wiped me out completely." In December 1987, Waters and Pink Floyd reached an agreement. According to Mason:

Waters was released from his contractual obligation with O'Rourke, and he retained the copyrights to the "Wall" concept and the inflatable "Animals "pig. Pink Floyd released three studio albums without him: "<a href="A%20Momentary%20Lapse%20of%20Reason">A Momentary Lapse of Reason</a>" (1987), "<a href="The%20Division%20Bell">The Division Bell</a>" (1994) and "<a href="The%20Endless%20River">The Endless River</a>" (2014). In 2005, Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity." In 2013, he said he regretted the lawsuit, saying:

Following the release of "The Final Cut", Waters embarked on a solo career. In 1984, he released his first solo album, "<a href="The%20Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Hitch%20Hiking">The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</a>", a project about a man's dreams across one night that dealt with Waters' feelings about monogamy and family life versus "the call of the wild". In the end the character, Reg, chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album featured guitarist <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, jazz saxophonist <a href="David%20Sanborn">David Sanborn</a>, and artwork by Gerald Scarfe. Kurt Loder described "The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking" as a "strangely static, faintly hideous record". "Rolling Stone" rated the album a "rock bottom one star". Years later, Mike DeGagne of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> praised the album for its "ingenious symbolism" and "brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm", rating it four out of five stars.

Waters began touring in support of the album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a selection of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted <a href="The%20Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Hitch%20Hiking%20%28tour%29">his tour</a> in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. The tour suffered from poor ticket sales and some performances at larger venues were cancelled; Waters estimated that he lost £400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff—North America Tour 1985. "The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking" has been certified Gold by the RIAA.

In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated movie "<a href="When%20the%20Wind%20Blows%20%281986%20film%29">When the Wind Blows</a>", based on the <a href="Raymond%20Briggs">Raymond Briggs</a> <a href="When%20the%20Wind%20Blows%20%28comics%29">book of the same name</a>. His backing band featuring <a href="Paul%20Carrack">Paul Carrack</a> was credited as "The Bleeding Heart Band". In 1987, Waters released "<a href="Radio%20K.A.O.S.">Radio K.A.O.S.</a>", a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who has the ability to physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state of the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987.

In November 1989, the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a> fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of the largest and most elaborate rock concerts in history, "<a href="The%20Wall%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Live%20in%20Berlin">The Wall – Live in Berlin</a>", on the vacant terrain between <a href="Potsdamer%20Platz">Potsdamer Platz</a> and the <a href="Brandenburg%20Gate">Brandenburg Gate</a>. The show reported an official attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers. <a href="Leonard%20Cheshire">Leonard Cheshire</a> asked him to do the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters' group of musicians included <a href="Joni%20Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a>, <a href="Van%20Morrison">Van Morrison</a>, <a href="Cyndi%20Lauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>, <a href="Bryan%20Adams">Bryan Adams</a>, <a href="Scorpions%20%28band%29">Scorpions</a>, and <a href="Sin%C3%A9ad%20O%27Connor">Sinéad O'Connor</a>. Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the U.S. <a href="7th%20Airborne%20Command%20and%20Control%20Squadron">7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron</a>. Designed by Mark Fisher, the Wall was 25 metres tall and 170 metres long and was built across the set. Scarfe's inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale, and although many rock icons received invitations to the show, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright, did not. Waters released a live double-album of the performance, which has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

In 1990, Waters hired manager <a href="Mark%20Fenwick">Mark Fenwick</a> and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia. He released his third studio album, "<a href="Amused%20to%20Death">Amused to Death</a>", in 1992. The record is heavily influenced by the events of the <a href="Tiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989">Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television. The title was derived from the book "<a href="Amusing%20Ourselves%20to%20Death">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a>" by <a href="Neil%20Postman">Neil Postman</a>. <a href="Patrick%20Leonard">Patrick Leonard</a>, who worked on "A Momentary Lapse of Reason", co-produced the album. <a href="Jeff%20Beck">Jeff Beck</a> played lead guitar on many of the album's tracks, which were recorded with a cast of musicians at ten different recording studios. It is Waters' most critically acclaimed solo recording, garnering comparison to his work with Pink Floyd. Waters described the record as, a "stunning piece of work", ranking the album with "Dark Side of the Moon" and "The Wall" as one of the best of his career. The album had one hit, the song "<a href="What%20God%20Wants">What God Wants</a>, Pt. 1", which reached number 35 in the UK in September 1992 and number 5 on "Billboard"s <a href="Hot%20Mainstream%20Rock%20Tracks">Mainstream Rock Tracks</a> chart in the US. "Amused to Death" was certified Silver by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a>. Sales of "Amused to Death" topped out at around one million and there was no tour in support of the album. Waters would first perform material from it seven years later during his <a href="In%20the%20Flesh%20%281999-2002%20concert%20tour%20by%20Roger%20Waters%29">In the Flesh tour</a>. In 1996, Waters was inducted into the US and UK <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Halls of Fame</a> as a member of Pink Floyd.

In 1999, after a 12-year hiatus from touring and a seven-year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US; though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones. The tour eventually stretched across the world and spanned three years. A concert film was released on CD and DVD, "<a href="In%20the%20Flesh%20%E2%80%93%20Live">In the Flesh – Live</a>". During the tour, Waters played two new songs "Flickering Flame" and "Each Small Candle" as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival">Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts</a>, playing 15 Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalogue.

<a href="Miramax">Miramax</a> announced in 2004 that a production of "The Wall" was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent role in the creative direction. Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from "The Wall", but also songs from "Dark Side of the Moon", "Wish You Were Here" and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material. On the night of 1 May 2004, recorded extracts from the opera, including its <a href="overture">overture</a>, were played on the occasion of the "<a href="Enlargement%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Welcome Europe</a>" celebrations in the accession country of <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. Gert Hof mixed recorded excerpts from the opera into a continuous piece of music which was played as an accompaniment to a large light and fireworks display over <a href="Grand%20Harbour">Grand Harbour</a> in <a href="Valletta">Valletta</a>. In July 2004, Waters released two new tracks online: "To Kill the Child", inspired by the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, and "Leaving Beirut", an anti-war song inspired by his travels in the Middle East as a teenager.

In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for their final performance together at the 2005 <a href="Live%208">Live 8</a> concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's only appearance with Waters since their final performance of "The Wall" at Earls Court London 24 years earlier. They played a 23-minute set consisting of "<a href="Speak%20to%20Me">Speak to Me</a>/<a href="Breathe%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Breathe</a>"/"<a href="Breathe%20%28Reprise%29">Breathe (Reprise)</a>", "<a href="Money%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Money</a>", "<a href="Wish%20You%20Were%20Here%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Wish You Were Here</a>", and "<a href="Comfortably%20Numb">Comfortably Numb</a>". Waters told the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be "slight" considering his and Gilmour's continuing musical and ideological differences. Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he "agreed to roll over for one night only". In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the <a href="UK%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame">UK Music Hall of Fame</a> by <a href="Pete%20Townshend">Pete Townshend</a> of <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a>.

In September 2005, Waters released ' (pronounced , French for "it will be fine"; Waters added the subtitle, "There is Hope"), an opera in three acts translated from the late <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Roda-Gil">Étienne Roda-Gil</a>'s French libretto based on the historical subject of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. ' was released as a double CD album, featuring baritone <a href="Bryn%20Terfel">Bryn Terfel</a>, soprano <a href="Ying%20Huang%20%28soprano%29">Ying Huang</a> and tenor <a href="Paul%20Groves%20%28tenor%29">Paul Groves</a>. Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had begun rewriting the libretto in English in 1989, and said about the composition: "I've always been a big fan of Beethoven's choral music, <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Borodin">Borodin</a> ... This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that's where my tastes lie in classical and choral music." Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused instead on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would "take in stride", a sign Pink Floyd biographer <a href="Mark%20Blake%20%28writer%29">Mark Blake</a> believes is "a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy". "" reached number 5 on the "Billboard" Classical Music Chart in the United States.

In June 2006, Waters commenced <a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon%20Live">The Dark Side of the Moon Live</a> tour, a two-year, world-spanning effort that began in Europe in June and North America in September. The first half of the show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters' solo material, while the second half included a complete live performance of the 1973 Pink Floyd album "The Dark Side of the Moon", the first time in over three decades that Waters had performed the album. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of "The Wall". He used elaborate staging by concert lighting designer <a href="Marc%20Brickman">Marc Brickman</a> complete with laser lights, fog machines, pyrotechnics, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a "handler" dressed as a butcher, and a full 360-degree <a href="quadraphonic%20sound">quadraphonic sound</a> system was used. Nick Mason joined Waters for "The Dark Side of the Moon" set and the encores on select 2006 tour dates. Waters continued touring in January 2007 in Australia and New Zealand, then Asia, Europe, South America, and back to North America in June.

In March 2007, the Waters song "Hello (I Love You)" was featured in the science fiction film "<a href="The%20Last%20Mimzy">The Last Mimzy</a>". The song plays over the film's end credits. He released it as a single, on CD and via download, and described it as "a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity's best and worst instincts, and how a child's innocence can win the day". He performed at California's <a href="Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Coachella Festival</a> in April 2008 and was to be among the headlining artists performing at <a href="Live%20Earth%20India%202008%23Live%20Earth%20India%202008">Live Earth 2008</a> in Mumbai, India in December 2008, but the concert was cancelled in light of the <a href="2008%20Mumbai%20attacks">26 November terrorist attacks</a> in Mumbai. In April 2008, Waters discussed a possible new album with the tentative name "Heartland".

In June 2010, he released a cover of "<a href="We%20Shall%20Overcome">We Shall Overcome</a>", a protest song rewritten and arranged by <a href="Guy%20Carawan">Guy Carawan</a> and <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>. He performed with Gilmour at the Hoping Foundation Benefit Evening in July 2010. The set comprised a cover of the <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a> song "<a href="To%20Know%20Him%20Is%20to%20Love%20Him">To Know Him Is to Love Him</a>", which was played in early Pink Floyd soundchecks, followed by "Wish You Were Here", "Comfortably Numb", and "Another Brick in the Wall (Part Two)".

In September 2010, Waters commenced the <a href="The%20Wall%20Live%20%28concert%20tour%29">Wall Live</a> tour, an updated version of the original Pink Floyd shows, featuring a complete performance of "The Wall". Waters told the Associated Press that the tour would likely be his last, stating: "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, but I still have the fire in my belly, and I have something to say. I have a swan song in me and I think this will probably be it."

At <a href="The%20O2%20Arena">The O2 Arena</a> in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing "Comfortably Numb", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for "Outside the Wall". For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. As of 2013, The Wall Live is the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20concert%20tours">highest-grossing tour of all time by a solo artist</a>. Waters performed at at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, Waters headlined the <a href="Newport%20Folk%20Festival">Newport Folk Festival</a> in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>. Waters was accompanied by the band <a href="My%20Morning%20Jacket">My Morning Jacket</a> and two singers from the group <a href="Lucius%20%28band%29">Lucius</a>.

On 3 May 2016, Waters was announced as one of the headline performers at the <a href="Desert%20Trip">Desert Trip</a> music festival and performed twice on 9 and 16 October 2016. In October 2016, Waters announced that he would return to North America in 2017 with a new tour, ""<a href="Us%20%2B%20Them%20Tour">Us + Them</a>"", a mixture of his Pink Floyd and solo material. The tour title is derived from the track "<a href="Us%20and%20Them%20%28song%29">Us and Them</a>," from "The Dark Side of the Moon".

On 16 February 2017, Waters announced his fourth solo album, "<a href="Is%20This%20the%20Life%20We%20Really%20Want%3F">Is This the Life We Really Want?</a>". It was released on 2 June 2017, his first solo album since "Amused to Death" almost 25 years earlier. The album was produced by <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a> producer <a href="Nigel%20Godrich">Nigel Godrich</a>; Godrich was critical of Waters' earlier solo work, and encouraged him to make a concise album showcasing his lyrics. The album was promoted with the <a href="Us%20%2B%20Them%20Tour">Us + Them Tour</a>.

In 2018, Waters narrated an adaptation of <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky%20discography">Igor Stravinsky's</a> theatrical work "<a href="The%20Soldier%27s%20Tale">The Soldier's Tale</a>" recorded with the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival. It was released on 26 October via Sony Classical Masterworks.

In 1969, Waters married his childhood sweetheart <a href="Judith%20Trim">Judith Trim</a>, a successful potter; she was featured on the gatefold sleeve of the original release of "<a href="Ummagumma">Ummagumma</a>", but excised from subsequent CD reissues. They had no children and divorced in 1975. Trim died in 2001.

In 1976, Waters married <a href="Carolyne%20Christie">Lady Carolyne Christie</a>, the niece of the <a href="Lawrence%20Dundas%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Zetland">3rd Marquess of Zetland</a>. His marriage to Christie produced a son, <a href="Harry%20Waters">Harry Waters</a>, a musician who has played keyboards with his father's touring band since 2002, and a daughter, India Waters, who has worked as a model. Christie and Waters divorced in 1992. In 1993, Waters married Priscilla Phillips; they had one son, Jack Fletcher. Their marriage ended in 2001. In 2004, Waters became engaged to actress and filmmaker Laurie Durning (born 1963); the two married on 14 January 2012 and filed for divorce in September 2015.

Waters is an <a href="Atheism">atheist</a>.

After the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> and subsequent <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> disaster, Waters performed "Wish You Were Here" with Eric Clapton during a benefit concert on the American network <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. He was outspoken against the <a href="Hunting%20Act%202004">Hunting Act of 2004</a>, and performed a concert for, and attended marches supporting, the <a href="Countryside%20Alliance">Countryside Alliance</a>. Waters explained that whether he supported hunting or not, it was important to defend it as a right. He left the UK soon afterwards. He clarified in October 2005 that he had not left the country in protest against the hunting legislation but for family reasons, and that he often returned to the UK.

After leaving Britain, he moved to <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a> in New York with his fiancé Laurie Durning. In June 2007, Waters became a spokesman for <a href="Millennium%20Promise">Millennium Promise</a>, a non-profit organisation that helps fight extreme poverty and <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. He wrote an opinion piece for <a href="CNN">CNN</a> in support of the topic. In July, he participated in the American leg of the <a href="Live%20Earth%20concert%2C%20New%20York%20City">Live Earth</a> concert, an international multi-venue concert aimed at raising awareness about global climate change, featuring the Trenton Youth Choir and his trademarked inflatable pig. Waters told <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> why he thinks "The Wall" is still relevant today:

In 2012, Waters led a benefit for United States military veterans called Stand Up for Heroes. He invited a music group of combat wounded veterans called <a href="MusiCorps">MusiCorps</a> to perform with him. In June 2013, Waters and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for <a href="Chelsea%20Manning">Chelsea Manning</a>.

In June 2009 he spoke against the <a href="Israeli%20West%20Bank%20barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> and later that year, pledged his support to the <a href="Gaza%20Freedom%20March">Gaza Freedom March</a>. In 2011 he announced that he had joined the <a href="Boycott%2C%20Divestment%20and%20Sanctions">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions</a> (BDS) movement in solidarity with Palestinians against <a href="Israeli-occupied%20territories">Israeli occupation</a>. He has said he is disillusioned with UK foreign policy towards Israel. In October 2016 Waters lost four million dollars in sponsorship after <a href="American%20Express">American Express</a> refused to fund his North America tour due to his anti-Israel rhetoric at a previous festival sponsored by the financial company.

In November 2016, <a href="Citibank">Citibank</a> joined American Express in cutting ties to Waters. "Citi is not a sponsor of Roger Waters' upcoming tour," a Citibank official said, noting that the company had "offered a limited time pre-sale of tickets for cardmembers for select shows. ... The pre-sale has ended and we have no plans to work with [Waters] in the future."

In 2013 The <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a>'s National Director <a href="Abraham%20H.%20Foxman">Abraham H. Foxman</a> accused Waters of anti-Semitism for his support of BDS and for saying that the current Palestinian situation paralleled “what went on in the ’30s in Germany".Earlier in 2013 Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the <a href="Simon%20Wiesenthal%20Center">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> accused Waters of anti-Semitism for including a giant pig balloon emblazoned with a Jewish Star of David at one of his concerts. In response Waters said "I deplore the policies of the Israeli government in the occupied territories and Gaza. They are immoral, inhuman and illegal. I will continue my non-violent protests as long as the government of Israel continues with these policies. ... It is difficult to make arguments to defend the Israeli government's policies, so would-be defenders often use a diversionary tactic, they routinely drag the critic into a public arena and accuse them of being an antisemite". On 2 October 2015, Waters published an open letter in "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" criticising the band <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a> for performing in Tel Aviv, which led <a href="Howard%20Stern">Howard Stern</a> to criticise Waters on his radio show. In June 2017 an organization known as "We Don't Need No Roger Waters" started to boycott Waters for his support of the BDS.

Waters narrated the 2016 documentary "The Occupation of the American Mind: Israel’s Public Relations War in the United States" about the methods used by Israel to shape American public opinion."

In October 2018, Waters drew praise and criticism after speaking against <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian then-presidential candidate <a href="Jair%20Bolsonaro">Jair Bolsonaro</a> at a concert in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>.

In February 2019, Waters was criticised for supporting the <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>n government amid the <a href="2019%20Venezuelan%20presidential%20crisis">presidential crisis</a>, and claiming that Venezuela enjoyed "true democracy." Waters publicised on his <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account an 'emergency demonstration' at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> against US interference in Venezuela. He also alleged that the US was trying to destroy Venezuelan democracy so that "the 1% can plunder their <a href="Oil%20reserves%20in%20Venezuela">oil</a>".

Waters' primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the electric bass guitar. He briefly played a <a href="H%C3%B6fner">Höfner</a> bass but replaced it with a <a href="Rickenbacker%204001">Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S</a>, until 1970 when it was stolen along with the rest of the band's equipment in New Orleans. He began using <a href="Fender%20Precision%20Bass">Fender Precision Bass</a>es in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker 4001, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972 when it became his main stage guitar and as of 2 October 2010, the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model. Waters endorses <a href="RotoSound">RotoSound</a> Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings. Throughout his career he has used <a href="The%20Selmer%20Company">Selmer</a>, <a href="Watkins%20Electric%20Music">WEM</a>, <a href="Hiwatt">Hiwatt</a> and <a href="Ashdown%20Engineering">Ashdown</a> amplifiers but has used <a href="Ampeg">Ampeg</a> for the last few tours, also employing <a href="delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a>, <a href="tremolo">tremolo</a>, <a href="chorus%20effect">chorus</a>, <a href="stereo%20panning">stereo panning</a> and <a href="Phaser%20%28effect%29">phaser</a> effects in his bass playing.

Waters experimented with the <a href="EMS%20Synthi%20A">EMS Synthi A</a> and <a href="EMS%20VCS%203">VCS 3</a> synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as "<a href="On%20the%20Run%20%28instrumental%29">On the Run</a>", "<a href="Welcome%20to%20the%20Machine">Welcome to the Machine</a>", and "<a href="In%20the%20Flesh%3F">In the Flesh?</a>" He played electric and acoustic guitar on Pink Floyd tracks using Fender, Martin, <a href="Ovation%20Guitar%20Company">Ovation</a> and Washburn guitars. He played electric guitar on the Pink Floyd song "<a href="Sheep%20%28song%29">Sheep</a>", from "Animals", and acoustic guitar on several Pink Floyd recordings, such as <a href="Pigs%20on%20the%20Wing">"Pigs on the Wing 1 & 2"</a>, also from "Animals", "<a href="Southampton%20Dock">Southampton Dock</a>" from "The Final Cut", and on "<a href="Mother%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Mother</a>" from "The Wall".

Anna Laetitia Barbauld

Anna Laetitia Barbauld (, by herself possibly , as in French, "née" Aikin; 20 June 1743 – 9 March 1825) was a prominent English poet, essayist, <a href="literary%20criticism">literary critic</a>, editor, and author of <a href="children%27s%20literature">children's literature</a>.

A "<a href="Man%20of%20letters">woman of letters</a>" who published in multiple genres, Barbauld had a successful writing career at a time when women rarely were professional writers. She was a noted teacher at the <a href="Palgrave%20Academy">Palgrave Academy</a> and an innovative writer of works for children; her primers provided a model for <a href="pedagogy">pedagogy</a> for more than a century. Her essays demonstrated that it was possible for a woman to be publicly engaged in politics, and other women authors such as <a href="Elizabeth%20Benger">Elizabeth Benger</a> emulated her. Barbauld's literary career spanned numerous periods in British literary history: her work promoted the values of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> and of <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>, while her poetry made a founding contribution to the development of British <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>. Barbauld was also a literary critic. Her anthology of 18th-century novels helped to establish the canon as it is known today.

Barbauld's career as a poet ended abruptly in 1812, with the publication of "<a href="Eighteen%20Hundred%20and%20Eleven">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</a>", which criticised Britain's participation in the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the 19th century, and largely forgotten in the 20th, until the rise of <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary criticism</a> in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.

Much of what is known about Barbauld's life comes from two memoirs, the first published in 1825 and written by her niece, <a href="Lucy%20Aikin">Lucy Aikin</a>, and the second published in 1874, written by her great-niece <a href="Anna%20Letitia%20Le%20Breton">Anna Letitia Le Breton</a>. Some letters from Barbauld to others also exist. However, a great many Barbauld family documents were lost in a fire that resulted from the <a href="London%20blitz">London blitz</a> in 1940.

Barbauld was born on 20 June 1743 at <a href="Kibworth">Kibworth Harcourt</a> in Leicestershire to Jane and <a href="John%20Aikin%20%28Unitarian%29">John Aikin</a>. She was named after her maternal grandmother and referred to as "Nancy" (a nickname for Anna). She was baptised by her mother's brother, John Jennings, in <a href="Huntingdonshire">Huntingdonshire</a> two weeks after her birth. Barbauld's father was headmaster of the <a href="Dissenting%20academies">dissenting academy</a> in Kibworth Harcourt and minister at a nearby <a href="English%20Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> church. She spent her childhood in what Barbauld scholar William McCarthy describes as "one of the best houses in Kibworth and in the very middle of the village square." She was much in the public eye, as the house was also a boys' school. The family had a comfortable standard of living. McCarthy suggests they may have ranked with large freeholders, well-to-do tradesmen, and manufacturers. At Barbauld's father's death in 1780, his estate was valued at more than £2,500.

Barbauld commented to her husband in 1773: "For the early part of my life I conversed little with my own Sex. In the Village where I was, there was none to converse with." Barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits. Her mother attempted to subdue these, which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman; according to Lucy Aikin's memoir, what resulted was "a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve" in Barbauld's character. Barbauld was uncomfortable with her identity as a woman and believed she had failed to live up to the ideal of womanhood; much of her writing would focus on issues central to women, and her outsider perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity being made in the 18th century.

Barbauld demanded that her father teach her the <a href="classics">classics</a> and after much pestering, he did. She had the opportunity to learn not only <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>, but French, Italian, and many other subjects generally deemed unnecessary for women at the time. Barbauld's penchant for study worried her mother, who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism. The two were never so close as Barbauld and her father. Yet Barbauld's mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter, "I once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; but I never knew such another, and I believe never shall."

Barbauld's brother, <a href="John%20Aikin">John Aikin</a>, described their father as "the best parent, the wisest counsellor, the most affectionate friend, every thing that could command love and veneration". Barbauld's father prompted many such tributes, although Lucy Aikin described him as excessively modest and reserved. Barbauld developed a strong bond with her brother during childhood, standing in as a mother figure to him; they eventually became literary partners. In 1817, <a href="Joanna%20Baillie">Joanna Baillie</a> commented of their relationship: "How few brothers and sisters have been to one another what they have been through so long a course of years!"
In 1758, the family moved to <a href="Warrington%20Academy">Warrington Academy</a>, in <a href="Warrington%2C%20England">Warrington</a>, where Barbauld's father had been offered a teaching position. The Academy drew many luminaries of the day, such as the <a href="natural%20philosopher">natural philosopher</a> and <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> theologian <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a>, and came to be known as "the Athens of the North" for its stimulating intellectual atmosphere. Another luminary may have been the French revolutionary <a href="Jean-Paul%20Marat">Jean-Paul Marat</a>. School records suggest he was a "French master" there in the 1770s. He may also have been a suitor to Barbauld – he allegedly wrote to John Aikin declaring his intention to become an English citizen and marry her. <a href="Archibald%20Hamilton%20Rowan">Archibald Hamilton Rowan</a> also fell in love with Barbauld, describing her later as "possessed of great beauty, distinct traces of which she retained to the latest of her life. Her person was slender, her complexion exquisitely fair with the bloom of perfect health; her features regular and elegant, and her dark blue eyes beamed with the light of wit and fancy." Despite her mother's anxiety, Barbauld received many offers of marriage around this time — all of which she declined.
In 1773, Barbauld brought out her first book of poems, after her friends had praised them and convinced her to publish them. The collection, entitled simply "Poems", went through four editions in a single year and surprised Barbauld by its success. Barbauld became a respected literary figure in England on the reputation of "Poems" alone. In the same year, she and her brother, <a href="John%20Aikin">John Aikin</a>, jointly published "Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose", which was also well received. The essays in it (most of which were by Barbauld) were favourably compared to those of <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>.

In May 1774, despite some "misgivings", Barbauld married Rochemont Barbauld (1749–1808), the grandson of a French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> and a former pupil at Warrington. According to Barbauld's niece, <a href="Lucy%20Aikin">Lucy Aikin</a>:
After the wedding, the couple moved to <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, near where Rochemont had been offered a congregation and a school for boys. Barbauld took this time and rewrote some of the <a href="Book%20of%20Psalms">psalms</a>, a common pastime in the 18th century, publishing them as "Devotional Pieces Compiled from the Psalms and the Book of Job". Attached to this work is her essay "Thoughts on the Devotional Taste, on Sects and on Establishments", which explains her theory of religious feeling and the problems inherent in institutionalising religion.

It seems that Barbauld and her husband were concerned that they would never have a child of their own, and in 1775, after only a year of marriage, Barbauld suggested to her brother that they adopt one of his children:

After a time, her brother conceded and the couple adopted <a href="Charles%20Rochemont%20Aikin">Charles</a>. it was for him that Barbauld wrote her most famous books: "<a href="Lessons%20for%20Children">Lessons for Children</a>" (1778–79) and "<a href="Hymns%20in%20Prose%20for%20Children">Hymns in Prose for Children</a>" (1781).

Barbauld and her husband spent eleven years teaching at <a href="Palgrave%20Academy">Palgrave Academy</a> in Suffolk. Early on, Barbauld was responsible not only for running her own household, but also the school's, to which she served as accountant, maid, and housekeeper. The school opened with only eight boys, but the number had risen to about forty by the time the Barbaulds left in 1785, which reflects the excellent reputation the school had acquired. The Barbaulds' educational philosophy attracted <a href="English%20dissenters">Dissenters</a> as well as <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>s. Palgrave replaced the strict discipline of traditional schools such as <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>, which often used corporal punishment, with a system of "fines and jobations" and even, it seems likely, "juvenile trials," that is, trials run by and for the students themselves. Moreover, instead of the traditional classical studies, the school offered a practical curriculum that stressed science and the modern languages. Barbauld herself taught the foundation subjects of reading and religion to the youngest boys, and geography, history, composition, rhetoric and science to higher grade levels. She was a dedicated teacher, producing a "weekly chronicle" for the school and writing theatrical pieces for the students to perform. Barbauld had a profound effect on many of her students. One who went on to great success was <a href="William%20Taylor%20%28scholar%29">William Taylor</a>, a pre-eminent scholar of German literature, who referred to Barbauld as "the mother of his mind."

In September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave for a tour of France. By this time Rochemont's mental health was deteriorating and he was no longer able to carry out his teaching duties. In 1787, they moved to <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became <a href="Rosslyn%20Hill%20Unitarian%20Chapel">Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel</a>. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with <a href="Joanna%20Baillie">Joanna Baillie</a>, the playwright. Although no longer in charge of a school, the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education; they often boarded one or two pupils recommended by personal friends.

During this time, the heyday of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, Barbauld published her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a> attempted to convince the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, "An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts" (see <a href="Test%20Act">Test Act</a>). Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument should come from a woman. In 1791, after <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a>'s attempt to outlaw the slave trade had failed, Barbauld published her "Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade", which not only lamented the fate of the slaves, but warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abandon slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled "Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation" which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: "We are called upon to repent of national sins, because we can help them, and because we ought to help them."
In 1802, the Barbaulds moved to <a href="Stoke%20Newington">Stoke Newington</a>, where Rochemont took over the pastoral duties of <a href="Newington%20Green%20Unitarian%20Church">the Unitarian Chapel at Newington Green</a>. Barbauld herself was happy to be nearer her brother, <a href="John%20Aikin">John</a>, as her husband's mind was rapidly failing. Rochemont developed a "violent antipathy to his wife and he was liable to fits of insane fury directed against her. One day at dinner he seized a knife and chased her round the table so that she only saved herself by jumping out of the window." Such scenes repeated themselves to Barbauld's great sadness and real danger, but she refused to leave him. Rochemont drowned himself in the nearby <a href="New%20River%20%28England%29">New River</a> in 1808 and Barbauld was overcome with grief. When she returned to writing, she produced the radical poem "<a href="Eighteen%20Hundred%20and%20Eleven">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</a>" (1812), which depicted England as a ruin. It was reviewed so viciously that Barbauld never published another work in her lifetime, although it is now often viewed by scholars as her greatest poetic achievement. She died in 1825, a renowned writer, and was buried in the family vault in <a href="Stoke%20Newington%20%28parish%29">St Mary's, Stoke Newington</a>. After her death, a marble tablet was erected in the Newington Green Chapel with the following inscription:

She was born at Kibworth in Leicestershire, 20 June 1743,
and died at Stoke Newington, 9 March 1825.
Endowed by the Giver of all Good
With Wit, Genius, Poetic Talent, and a Vigorous Understanding
She Employed these High Gifts
in Promoting the Cause of Humanity, Peace, and Justice,

the Acuteness, the Brilliant Fancy, and Sound Reasoning
of her Literary Compositions;
Let the Surviving few who shared her Delightful
and Instructive Conversation,

That this Monument Records
No Exaggerated Praise.
</poem>

At her death, Barbauld was lauded in the "Newcastle Magazine" as "unquestionably the first ["i.e.", best] of our female poets, and one of the most eloquent and powerful of our prose writers" and the "Imperial Magazine" declared "so long as letters shall be cultivated in Britain, or wherever the English language shall be known, so long will the name of this lady be respected." She was favourably compared to both <a href="Joseph%20Addison">Joseph Addison</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> – no mean feat for a woman writer in the 18th century. By 1925, however, she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children, if that. It was not until the advent of <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary criticism</a> in the academic world of the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history.

Barbauld's remarkable disappearance from the literary landscape took place for a number of reasons. One of the most important was the disdain heaped upon her by <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> and <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, poets who in their youthful, radical days had looked to her poetry for inspiration, but in their later, conservative years dismissed her work. Once these poets had become canonised, their opinions held sway. Moreover, the intellectual ferment of which Barbauld was an important part of — particularly at the <a href="Dissenting%20academies">Dissenting academies</a> — had by the end of the 19th century come to be associated with the "philistine" middle class, as <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> put it. The reformist 18th-century middle class was later held responsible for the excesses and abuses of the industrial age. Finally, the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a>s viewed Barbauld as "an icon of sentimental saintliness" and "erased her political courage, her tough mindedness, [and] her talent for humor and irony", to arrive at a literary figure that modernists despised.

As literary studies developed into a discipline at the end of the 19th century, the story of the origins of <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> in England emerged along with it. According to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman — one who was angry, who resisted the gender roles of her time, and who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories. Indeed, it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice that Barbauld had contributed.

Barbauld's works fell out of print and no full-length scholarly biography of her was written until William McCarthy's "Anna Letitia Barbauld: Voice of the Enlightenment" in 2009.

Barbauld's adopted son Charles grew up to be a doctor and chemist. He married a daughter of <a href="Gilbert%20Wakefield">Gilbert Wakefield</a>. Their child, <a href="Anna%20Letitia%20Le%20Breton">Anna Letitia Le Breton</a>, wrote literary memoirs, which included a "Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld, including Letters and Notices of her Family and Friends" in 1874.

Barbauld's wide-ranging poetry has been read primarily by <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary critics</a> interested in recovering women writers important in their own time, but forgotten in literary history. Isobel Armstrong's work represents one way to do such a study; she argues that Barbauld, like other <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> women poets:

In her subsequent analysis of "Inscription for an Ice-House" Armstrong points to Barbauld's challenge of <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>'s characterisation of the sublime and the beautiful and <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a>'s economic theories in the "<a href="Wealth%20of%20Nations">Wealth of Nations</a>" as evidence for this interpretation.

The work of Marlon Ross and <a href="Anne%20K.%20Mellor">Anne K. Mellor</a> represents a second way to apply the insights of <a href="feminist%20theory">feminist theory</a> to the recovery of women writers. They argue that Barbauld and other Romantic women poets carved out a distinctive feminine voice in the literary sphere. As a woman and a dissenter, Barbauld had a unique perspective on society, according to Ross, and it was this specific position that obliged her to publish social commentary. Ross points out, however, that women were in a double bind: "They could choose to speak politics in nonpolitical modes, and thus risk greatly diminishing the clarity and pointedness of their political passion, or they could choose literary modes that were overtly political while trying to infuse them with a recognizable 'feminine' decorum, again risking a softening of their political agenda." So Barbauld and other Romantic women poets often wrote "<a href="occasional%20poems">occasional poems</a>". These had traditionally commented, often satirically, on national events, but by the end of the 18th century were increasingly serious and personal. Women wrote <a href="sensibility">sentimental</a> poems, a style then much in vogue, on personal occasions such as the birth of a child and argued that in commenting on the small occurrences of daily life, they would establish a moral foundation for the nation. Scholars such as Ross and Mellor maintain that this adaptation of existing styles and genres is one way in which women poets created a feminine Romanticism.

Barbauld's most significant political texts are: "An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts" (1790), "Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade" (1791), "Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation" (1793), and "<a href="Eighteen%20Hundred%20and%20Eleven">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</a>" (1812). As Harriet Guest explains, "The theme Barbauld's essays of the 1790s repeatedly return to is that of the constitution of the public as a religious, civic, and national body, and she is always concerned to emphasize the continuity between the rights of private individuals and those of the public defined in capaciously inclusive terms."

For three years, from 1787 to 1790, <a href="English%20dissenters">Dissenters</a> had been attempting to convince <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">Parliament</a> to repeal the <a href="Test%20Act">Test</a> and <a href="Corporation%20Act%201661">Corporation Acts</a>, which limited the civil rights of Dissenters. After the repeal was voted down for the third time, Barbauld burst onto the public stage after "nine years of silence". Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone. It opens, "We thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters, when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit, all such places will at once be filled with them." She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: "We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects." Moreover, she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent in their form of worship. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in extending liberty.

In the following year, after one of <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a>'s many efforts to suppress the <a href="slavery">slave trade</a> failed to pass Parliament, Barbauld wrote her "Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade" (1791). In it, she calls Britain to account for the sin of slavery. She condemns in harsh tones the "avarice" of a country content to allow its wealth and prosperity to be supported by the labour of enslaved human beings. Moreover, she draws a picture of the plantation mistress and master that reveals all of the failings of the "colonial enterprise: [an] indolent, voluptuous, monstrous woman" and a "degenerate, enfeebled man".

In 1793, when the British government called on the nation to fast in honour of the war, anti-war Dissenters such as Barbauld were left with a moral quandary: "Obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved? observe the Fast, but preach against the war? defy the Proclamation and refuse to take any part in the Fast?" Barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon, "Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation", on the moral responsibility of the individual. For her, each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation because he or she constitutes part of the nation. The essay attempts to determine what the proper role of the individual is in the state, and while she argues that "insubordination" can undermine a government, she admits there are lines of "conscience" that cannot be crossed in obeying a government. The text has been seen as a classic consideration of the idea of an "unjust war".

In "Eighteen Hundred and Eleven" (1812), written after <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a> had been at war with France for a decade and was on the brink of losing the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Barbauld presented a shocking <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a>ian satire: she argued that the British Empire was waning and the American Empire waxing. It is to America that Britain's wealth and fame will now go, she contended, and Britain will become a mere empty ruin. She tied this decline directly to Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars:
Not surprisingly, this pessimistic view of the future was poorly received: "Reviews, whether in liberal or conservative magazines, ranged from cautious to patronizingly negative to outrageously abusive." Barbauld, stunned by the reaction, retreated from the public eye. Even when Britain was on the verge of winning the war, Barbauld could not be joyous. She wrote to a friend, "I do not know how to rejoice at this victory, splendid as it is, over Buonaparte, when I consider the horrible waste of life, the mass of misery, which such gigantic combats must occasion."

Barbauld's "<a href="Lessons%20for%20Children">Lessons for Children</a>" and "<a href="Hymns%20in%20Prose%20for%20Children">Hymns in Prose for Children</a>" made a revolution in children's literature. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered. Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them, and even more importantly, she developed a style of "informal dialogue between parent and child" that would dominate children's literature for a generation. In "Lessons for Children", a four-volume, age-adapted reading primer, Barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son. It is more than likely that many of the events in these stories were inspired by Barbauld's experience of teaching her own son, Charles. The series is far more than a way to acquire literacy — it also introduces the reader to "elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility." Moreover, it exposes the child to the principles of "botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [and] astronomy." The series was relatively popular. <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a> commented in the educational treatise that she co-authored with her father, "<a href="Practical%20Education">Practical Education</a>" (1798): it is "one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old, that has yet appeared."

Some at the time saw Barbauld's work as marking a shift in children's literature from fantasy to didacticism. <a href="Sarah%20Burney">Sarah Burney</a>, in her popular novel "Traits of Nature" (1812), has the 14-year-old Christina Cleveland remark, "Well, then; you know fairy-tales are forbidden pleasures in all modern school-rooms. Mrs. Barbauld, and <a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Mrs. Trimmer</a>, and <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Miss Edgeworth</a>, and a hundred others, have written good books for children, which have thrown poor <a href="Mother%20Goose">Mother Goose</a>, and the <a href="One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">Arabian Nights</a>, quite out of favour; — at least, with papas and mamas." A more strident criticism was made by the Lambs, telling of Mary's abortive search for a copy of "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Little%20Goody%20Two-Shoes">Goody Two Shoes</a>", which her brother claimed was because "Mrs. Barbauld's stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery."

"Lessons for Children" and "Hymns in Prose" had, for children's books, an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>, <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, and <a href="Jane%20Taylor%20%28poet%29">Jane Taylor</a>, they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren. Children's literature scholar William McCarthy states, "<a href="Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a> could still quote the opening lines of "Lessons for Children" at age thirty-nine." Although both <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> and <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a> ridiculed Barbauld's children's books and believed that she was wasting her talents, Barbauld herself saw such writing as noble and encouraged others to follow her. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer explains, "She gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard." In fact, because of Barbauld, <a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Sarah Trimmer</a> and <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a> were inspired to write for poor children as well as organise a large-scale <a href="Sunday%20School">Sunday School</a> movement, <a href="Ellenor%20Fenn">Ellenor Fenn</a> to write and design a series of readers and games for middle-class children, and <a href="Richard%20Lovell%20Edgeworth">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</a> to begin one of the first systematic studies of <a href="childhood%20development">childhood development</a>, which would culminate in an educational treatise authored by <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a> and him, and in a large body of children's stories by Maria.
Barbauld also collaborated with her brother John Aikin on the six-volume series "<a href="Evenings%20at%20Home">Evenings at Home</a>" (1793). It is a miscellany of stories, fables, dramas, poems, and dialogues. In many ways this series encapsulates the ideals of an <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> education: "curiosity, observation, and reasoning." For example, the stories encourage the learning of science through hands-on activities: in "A Tea Lecture" the child learns that tea-making is "properly an operation of "chemistry"" and lessons on <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a>, and <a href="condensation">condensation</a> follow. The text also emphasises rationality: in "Things by Their Right Names," a child demands that his father tell him a story about "a bloody murder." The father does so, using some of the fictional tropes of <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>s such as "once upon a time", but confounding his son with details, such as the murderers all "had steel caps on." In the end the child realises his father has told him the story of a battle, and his father comments "I do not know of any "murders" half so bloody." Both the tactic of defamiliarising the world to force the reader to think about it rationally, along with the anti-war message of this tale, prevail throughout "Evenings at Home". In fact, Michelle Levy, a scholar of the period, argued that the series encouraged readers to "become critical observers of and, where necessary, vocal resisters to authority." This resistance is learned and practised in the home; according to Levy, ""Evenings at Home"... makes the claim that social and political reform must begin in the family." It is families that are responsible for the nation's progress or regression.

According to <a href="Lucy%20Aikin">Lucy Aikin</a>, Barbauld's niece, Barbauld's contributions to "Evenings at Home" consisted of the following pieces: "The Young Mouse," "The Wasp and Bee," "Alfred, a drama," "Animals and Countries," "Canute's Reproof," "The Masque of Nature," "Things by their right Names," "The Goose and Horse," "On Manufactures," "The Flying-fish," "A Lesson in the Art of Distinguishing," "The Phoenix and Dove," "The Manufacture of Paper," "The Four Sisters," and "Live Dolls."

Barbauld edited several major works towards the end of her life, all of which helped to shape the canon as known today. First, in 1804, she edited <a href="Samuel%20Richardson">Samuel Richardson</a>'s correspondence and wrote an extensive biographical introduction of the man who was perhaps the most influential novelist of the 18th century. Her "212-page essay on his life and works [was] the first substantial Richardson biography." The following year she edited "Selections from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, and Freeholder, with a Preliminary Essay", a volume of essays emphasising "wit", "manners" and "taste". In 1811, she assembled "The Female Speaker", an anthology of literature chosen specifically for young girls. Because, according to Barbauld's philosophy, what one reads when one is young is formative, she carefully considered the "delicacy" of her female readers and "direct[ed] her choice to subjects more particularly appropriate to the duties, the employments, and the dispositions of the softer sex." The anthology is subdivided into sections such as "moral and didactic pieces" and "descriptive and pathetic pieces"; it includes poetry and prose by, among others, <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>, <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a>, <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>, <a href="James%20Thomson%20%28poet%29">James Thomson</a> and <a href="Hester%20Chapone">Hester Chapone</a>.

Barbauld's 50-volume series of "The British Novelists", published in 1810 with a broad introductory essay on the history of the novel, allowed her to place her mark on literary history. It was "the first English edition to make comprehensive critical and historical claims" and was in every respect "a canon-making enterprise". In an insightful essay, Barbauld legitimises the novel, then still a controversial genre, by connecting it to ancient Persian and Greek literature. For her, a good novel is "an epic in prose, with more of character and less (indeed in modern novels nothing) of the supernatural machinery." Barbauld maintains that novel-reading has a multiplicity of benefits. Not only is it a "domestic pleasure", but it is also a way to "infus[e] principles and moral feelings" into the population. Barbauld also provided introductions to each of the fifty authors included in the series.

Unless otherwise noted, this list is taken from Wolicky's entry on Barbauld in the "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20Literary%20Biography">Dictionary of Literary Biography</a>" (each year with a link connects to its corresponding "[year] in literature" article, for verse works, or "[year] in literature" article, for prose or mixed prose and verse):

James Chadwick

Sir James Chadwick, (20 October 1891 – 24 July 1974) was a British <a href="physicist">physicist</a> who was awarded the 1935 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for his <a href="discovery%20of%20the%20neutron">discovery of the neutron</a> in 1932. In 1941, he wrote the final draft of the <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Report</a>, which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> research efforts. He was the head of the British team that worked on the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> during the Second World War. He was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> in Britain in 1945 for his achievements in physics.

Chadwick graduated from the <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">Victoria University of Manchester</a> in 1911, where he studied under <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> (known as the "father of nuclear physics"). At Manchester, he continued to study under Rutherford until he was awarded his MSc in 1913. The same year, Chadwick was awarded an <a href="1851%20Research%20Fellowship">1851 Research Fellowship</a> from the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20for%20the%20Exhibition%20of%201851">Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851</a>. He elected to study <a href="beta%20radiation">beta radiation</a> under <a href="Hans%20Geiger">Hans Geiger</a> in Berlin. Using Geiger's recently developed <a href="Geiger%20counter">Geiger counter</a>, Chadwick was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a <a href="Beta%20decay%23Beta%20emission%20spectrum">continuous spectrum</a>, and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when the First World War broke out in Europe, he spent the next four years in the <a href="Ruhleben%20internment%20camp">Ruhleben internment camp</a>.

After the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, where Chadwick earned his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> degree under Rutherford's supervision from <a href="Gonville%20and%20Caius%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge</a>, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a>, <a href="Norman%20Feather">Norman Feather</a>, and <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>. Chadwick followed his discovery of the <a href="neutron">neutron</a> by measuring its <a href="mass">mass</a>. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the <a href="University%20of%20Liverpool">University of Liverpool</a>, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a>, made it an important centre for the study of <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>.

During the Second World War, Chadwick carried out research as part of the <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> project to build an atomic bomb, while his Manchester lab and environs were harassed by <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> bombing. When the <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a> merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a> For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the <a href="1945%20New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours on 1 January 1945</a>. In July 1945, he viewed the <a href="Trinity%20nuclear%20test">Trinity nuclear test</a>. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward <a href="Big%20Science">Big Science</a>, Chadwick became the <a href="Master%20%28college%29">Master</a> of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.

James Chadwick was born in <a href="Bollington">Bollington</a>, <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, on 20 October 1891, the first child of John Joseph Chadwick, a cotton spinner, and Anne Mary Knowles, a domestic servant. He was named James after his paternal grandfather. In 1895, his parents moved to <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, leaving him in the care of his maternal grandparents. He went to Bollington Cross Primary School, and was offered a scholarship to <a href="Manchester%20Grammar%20School">Manchester Grammar School</a>, which his family had to turn down as they could not afford the small fees that still had to be paid. Instead he attended the <a href="Central%20Grammar%20School%20for%20Boys">Central Grammar School for Boys</a> in Manchester, rejoining his parents there. He now had two younger brothers, Harry and Hubert; a sister had died in infancy. At the age of 16, he sat two examinations for university scholarships, and won both of them.

Chadwick chose to attend <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">Victoria University of Manchester</a>, which he entered in 1908. He meant to study mathematics, but enrolled in <a href="physics">physics</a> by mistake. Like most students, he lived at home, walking the to the university and back each day. At the end of his first year, he was awarded a Heginbottom Scholarship to study physics. The physics department was headed by <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, who assigned research projects to final-year students, and he instructed Chadwick to devise a means of comparing the amount of radioactive energy of two different sources. The idea was that they could be measured in terms of the activity of of <a href="radium">radium</a>, a unit of measurement which would become known as the <a href="curie">curie</a>. Rutherford's suggested approach was unworkable—something Chadwick knew but was afraid to tell Rutherford—so Chadwick pressed on, and eventually devised the required method. The results became Chadwick's first paper, which, co-authored with Rutherford, was published in 1912. He graduated with <a href="first%20class%20honours">first class honours</a> in 1911.

Having devised a means of measuring gamma radiation, Chadwick proceeded to measure the absorption of gamma rays by various gases and liquids. This time the resulting paper was published under his name alone. He was awarded his <a href="Master%20of%20Science">Master of Science</a> (MSc) degree in 1912, and was appointed a Beyer Fellow. The following year he was awarded an <a href="1851%20Exhibition%20Scholarship">1851 Exhibition Scholarship</a>, which allowed him to study and research at a university in continental Europe. He elected to go to the <a href="Physikalisch-Technische%20Reichsanstalt">Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt</a> in Berlin in 1913, to study <a href="beta%20radiation">beta radiation</a> under <a href="Hans%20Geiger">Hans Geiger</a>. Using Geiger's recently developed <a href="Geiger%20counter">Geiger counter</a>, which provided more accuracy than the earlier photographic techniques, he was able to demonstrate that beta radiation did not produce <a href="spectral%20lines">discrete lines</a>, as has been previously thought, but rather a <a href="Beta%20decay%23Beta%20emission%20spectrum">continuous spectrum</a> with peaks in certain regions. On a visit to Geiger's laboratory, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> told Chadwick that: "I can explain either of these things, but I can't explain them both at the same time." The continuous spectrum would remain an <a href="Beta%20decay%23History">unexplained phenomenon for many years</a>.

Chadwick was still in Germany at the start of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, and was interned in the <a href="Ruhleben%20internment%20camp">Ruhleben internment camp</a> near Berlin, where he was allowed to set up a laboratory in the stables and conduct scientific experiments using improvised materials such as <a href="radioactive%20quackery">radioactive toothpaste</a>. With the help of <a href="Charles%20Drummond%20Ellis">Charles Drummond Ellis</a>, he worked on the <a href="ionisation">ionisation</a> of <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, and the <a href="mechanistic%20organic%20photochemistry">photochemical reaction</a> of <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>. He was released after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice with Germany</a> came into effect in November 1918, and returned to his parents' home in Manchester, where he wrote up his findings over the previous four years for the 1851 Exhibition commissioners.

Rutherford gave Chadwick a part-time teaching position at Manchester, allowing him to continue research. He looked at the <a href="nuclear%20charge">nuclear charge</a> of <a href="platinum">platinum</a>, <a href="silver">silver</a>, and <a href="copper">copper</a>, and experimentally found that this was the same as the <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> (PhD) student at <a href="Gonville%20and%20Caius%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge</a>. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the <a href="nuclear%20force">forces</a> inside the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a>. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.

Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship expired in 1923, and he was succeeded by the Russian physicist <a href="Pyotr%20Kapitza">Pyotr Kapitza</a>. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the <a href="Department%20of%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Scientific and Industrial Research</a>, Sir <a href="William%20Symington%20McCormick">William McCormick</a> arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over the next few years these would include <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a>, <a href="Norman%20Feather">Norman Feather</a> and <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.
In 1925, Chadwick met Aileen Stewart-Brown, the daughter of a Liverpool stockbroker. The two were married in August 1925, with Kapitza as Best Man. The couple had twin daughters, Joanna and Judith, who were born in February 1927.

In his research, Chadwick continued to probe the nucleus. In 1925, the concept of <a href="Spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a> had allowed physicists to explain the <a href="Zeeman%20effect">Zeeman effect</a>, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At the time it was believed that the nucleus consisted of <a href="proton">proton</a>s and electrons, so <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>'s nucleus, for example, with a <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This gave it the right <a href="mass">mass</a> and charge, but the wrong spin.

At a conference at Cambridge on beta particles and gamma rays in 1928, Chadwick met Geiger again. Geiger had brought with him a new model of his Geiger counter, which had been improved by his post-doctoral student <a href="Walther%20M%C3%BCller">Walther Müller</a>. Chadwick had not used one since the war, and the new <a href="Geiger%20counter">Geiger–Müller counter</a> was potentially a major improvement over the <a href="Scintillation%20%28physics%29">scintillation</a> techniques then in use at Cambridge, which relied on the human eye for observation. The major drawback with it was that it detected <a href="Alpha%20decay">alpha</a>, <a href="Beta%20particle">beta</a> and <a href="Gamma%20ray">gamma</a> radiation, and radium, which the Cavendish laboratory normally used in its experiments, emitted all three, and was therefore unsuitable for what Chadwick had in mind. However, <a href="polonium">polonium</a> is an alpha emitter, and <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> sent Chadwick about 2 millicuries (about ) from Germany.

In Germany, <a href="Walther%20Bothe">Walther Bothe</a> and his student <a href="Herbert%20Becker%20%28physicist%29">Herbert Becker</a> had used polonium to bombard <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a> with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this was evidence of something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the <a href="neutron">neutron</a>, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Joliot-Curie">Frédéric</a> and <a href="Ir%C3%A8ne%20Joliot-Curie">Irène Joliot-Curie</a> had succeeded in knocking protons from <a href="paraffin%20wax">paraffin wax</a> using polonium and beryllium as a source for what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, <a href="Ettore%20Majorana">Ettore Majorana</a> came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.

Chadwick dropped all his other responsibilities to concentrate on proving the existence of the neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an <a href="oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a>.
In February 1932, after only about two weeks of experimentation with neutrons, Chadwick sent a letter to "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" titled "Possible Existence of a Neutron". He communicated his findings in detail in an article sent to "<a href="Proceedings%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20A">Proceedings of the Royal Society A</a>" titled "The Existence of a Neutron" in May. His <a href="discovery%20of%20the%20neutron">discovery of the neutron</a> was a milestone in understanding the nucleus. Reading Chadwick's paper, <a href="Robert%20Bacher">Robert Bacher</a> and <a href="Edward%20Condon">Edward Condon</a> realised that anomalies in the then-current theory, like the spin of nitrogen, would be resolved if the neutron has a <a href="spin-%C2%BD">spin of 1/2</a> and that a nitrogen nucleus consisted of seven protons and seven neutrons.

The theoretical physicists <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> considered whether the neutron could be a fundamental <a href="nucleon">nuclear particle</a> like the proton and electron, rather than a proton–electron pair. Heisenberg showed that the neutron was best described as a new nuclear particle, but its exact nature remained unclear. In his 1933 <a href="Bakerian%20Lecture">Bakerian Lecture</a>, Chadwick estimated that a neutron had a mass of about . Since a proton and an electron had a combined mass of , this implied the neutron as a proton–electron composite had a binding energy of about , which sounded reasonable, although it was hard to understand how a particle with so little binding energy could be stable. Estimating such a small mass difference required challenging precise measurements, however, and several conflicting results were obtained in 1933–4. By bombarding <a href="boron">boron</a> with alpha particles, Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie obtained a large value for the mass of a neutron, but <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a>'s team at the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> produced a small one. Then <a href="Maurice%20Goldhaber">Maurice Goldhaber</a>, a refugee from <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and a graduate student at the Cavendish Laboratory, suggested to Chadwick that <a href="deuteron">deuteron</a>s could be <a href="Photodisintegration">photodisintegrated</a> by the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of Tl (then known as <a href="Decay%20chain%23Thorium%20series">thorium C"</a>):
An accurate value for the mass of the neutron could be determined from this process. Chadwick and Goldhaber tried this and found that it worked. They measured the kinetic energy of the proton produced as 1.05 MeV, leaving the mass of the neutron as the unknown in the equation. Chadwick and Goldhaber calculated that it was either 1.0084 or 1.0090 atomic units, depending on the values used for the masses of the proton and deuteron. (The modern accepted value for the mass of the neutron is .) The mass of the neutron was too large to be a proton–electron pair.

For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick was awarded the <a href="Hughes%20Medal">Hughes Medal</a> by the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in 1932, the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1935, the <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a> in 1950 and the <a href="Franklin%20Medal">Franklin Medal</a> in 1951. His discovery of the neutron made it possible to produce elements heavier than <a href="uranium">uranium</a> in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>. Unlike the positively charged <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any <a href="Coulomb%20barrier">Coulomb barrier</a>, and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938.

<a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a> proposed another kind of particle on 4 December 1930 in order to explain the continuous spectrum of beta radiation that Chadwick had reported in 1914. Since not all of the energy of beta radiation could be accounted for, the law of <a href="conservation%20of%20energy">conservation of energy</a> appeared to be violated, but Pauli argued that this could be redressed if another, undiscovered, particle was involved. Pauli also called this particle a neutron, but it was clearly not the same particle as Chadwick's neutron. Fermi renamed it the <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>, Italian for "little neutron". In 1934, Fermi proposed his <a href="Fermi%27s%20interaction">theory of beta decay</a> which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino. The neutrino could account for the missing energy, but a particle with little mass and no electric charge was difficult to observe. <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a> and <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a> calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, so the chances of detecting them were slim. <a href="Frederick%20Reines">Frederick Reines</a> and <a href="Clyde%20Cowan">Clyde Cowan</a> would <a href="neutrino%20experiment">confirm the neutrino</a> on 14 June 1956 by placing a detector within a large antineutrino flux from a nearby nuclear reactor.

With the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Great Depression in the United Kingdom</a>, the government became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a>, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.
Chadwick was himself a critic of <a href="Big%20Science">Big Science</a> in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the <a href="Solvay%20Conference">Solvay Conference</a> in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium <a href="Nuclear%20fusion">fuses</a> to form <a href="helium-3">helium-3</a>, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a> was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.

In March 1935, Chadwick received an offer of the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the <a href="University%20of%20Liverpool">University of Liverpool</a>, in his wife's home town, to succeed <a href="Lionel%20Wilberforce">Lionel Wilberforce</a>. The laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> electricity, but Chadwick seized the opportunity, assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university's prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick's Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.

Chadwick set about acquiring a cyclotron for Liverpool. He started by spending £700 to refurbish the antiquated laboratories at Liverpool, so some components could be made in-house. He was able to persuade the university to provide £2,000 and obtained a grant for another £2,000 from the Royal Society. To build his cyclotron, Chadwick brought in two young experts, Bernard Kinsey and Harold Walke, who had worked with Lawrence at the University of California. A local cable manufacturer donated the copper conductor for the coils. The cyclotron's 50-ton magnet was manufactured in <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a> by <a href="Metropolitan-Vickers">Metropolitan-Vickers</a>, which also made the vacuum chamber. The cyclotron was completely installed and running in July 1939. The total cost of £5,184 was more than Chadwick had received from the University and the Royal Society, so Chadwick paid the rest from his (£8,243) Nobel Prize money.

At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked together closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a> to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes, and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer.

In Germany, <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> bombarded uranium with neutrons, and noted that <a href="barium">barium</a>, a lighter element, was among the products produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a> astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called <a href="nuclear%20fission">fission</a>. They calculated that this would result in the release of about 200 <a href="Electronvolt">MeV</a>, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, <a href="Pierre%20Joliot">Pierre Joliot</a>, <a href="Hans%20von%20Halban">Hans von Halban</a> and <a href="Lew%20Kowarski">Lew Kowarski</a>, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Wheeler</a>, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.
Chadwick did not believe that there was any likelihood of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a <a href="tramp%20steamer">tramp steamer</a>. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found <a href="Joseph%20Rotblat">Joseph Rotblat</a>, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.

In October 1939, Chadwick received a letter from Sir <a href="Edward%20Victor%20Appleton">Edward Appleton</a>, the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. Chadwick responded cautiously. He did not dismiss the possibility, but carefully went over the many theoretical and practical difficulties involved. Chadwick decided to investigate the properties of <a href="uranium%20oxide">uranium oxide</a> further with Rotblat. In March 1940, Otto Frisch and <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a> re-examined the theoretical issues involved in a paper that became known as the <a href="Frisch%E2%80%93Peierls%20memorandum">Frisch–Peierls memorandum</a>. Instead of looking at uranium metal, they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, but that it might require as little as of uranium-235, and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite.
A special subcommittee of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), known as the <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Committee</a>, was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir <a href="George%20Paget%20Thomson">George Thomson</a> and its original membership included Chadwick, along with Mark Oliphant, John Cockcroft and <a href="Philip%20Moon">Philip Moon</a>. While other teams investigated <a href="uranium%20enrichment">uranium enrichment</a> techniques, Chadwick's team at Liverpool concentrated on determining the <a href="nuclear%20cross%20section">nuclear cross section</a> of uranium-235. By April 1941, it had been experimentally confirmed that the <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a> of uranium-235 might be or less. His research into such matters was complicated by all-but-incessant <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> bombings of the environs of his Liverpool lab; the windows were blown out so often that they were replaced by cardboard.

In July 1941, Chadwick was chosen to write the final draft of the MAUD Report, which, when presented by <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a> to <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour millions of dollars into the pursuit of an atomic bomb. When <a href="George%20B.%20Pegram">George B. Pegram</a> and <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a> visited Britain to see how the project, now known as <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a>, was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: "I wish I could tell you that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will."

In a recent book about the Bomb project, <a href="Graham%20Farmelo">Graham Farmelo</a> wrote that "Chadwick did more than any other scientist to give Churchill the Bomb. ... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point." So worried that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that "a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody would think about them before long, and some country would put them into action". Sir <a href="Hermann%20Bondi">Hermann Bondi</a> suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter's prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick's interest in "looking forward" to the Bomb's prospects.

Owing to the danger from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada as part of a <a href="Evacuations%20of%20civilians%20in%20Britain%20during%20World%20War%20II">government evacuation scheme</a>. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over £1 million and strain Britain's resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At the same time that the British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.

The matter of cooperation had to be taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, and President Roosevelt negotiated the <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a>, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and <a href="Francis%20Simon">Simon</a> were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir <a href="Wallace%20Akers">Wallace Akers</a>, to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new <a href="Combined%20Policy%20Committee">Combined Policy Committee</a> to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, and the head of the British Mission.

Leaving Rotblat in charge in Liverpool, Chadwick began a tour of the Manhattan Project facilities in November 1943, except for the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a> where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man apart from Groves and his second in command to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the <a href="K-25">K-25</a> <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> facility at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, Chadwick realised how wrong he had been about building the plant in wartime Britain. The enormous structure could never have been concealed from the Luftwaffe. In early 1944, he moved to <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>, with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents. For security reasons, he was given the cover name of James Chaffee.
Chadwick accepted that the Americans did not need British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with the director of the Manhattan Project, <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>, he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.

Although he had more knowledge of the project than anyone else from Britain, Chadwick had no access to the Hanford site. <a href="Charles%20Portal%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Portal%20of%20Hungerford">Lord Portal</a> was offered a tour of Hanford in 1946. "This was the only plant to which Chadwick had been denied access in wartime, and now he asked Groves if he could accompany Portal. Groves replied that he could, but if he did then 'Portal will not see very much'." For his efforts, Chadwick received a <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a> in the <a href="1945%20New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours on 1 January 1945</a>. He considered this to be a recognition of the work of the whole Tube Alloys project.

By early 1945, Chadwick was spending most of his time in Washington, D.C., and his family relocated from Los Alamos to a house on Washington's <a href="Dupont%20Circle">Dupont Circle</a> in April 1945. He was present at the meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 4 July when <a href="Field%20Marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Field Marshal</a> Sir <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Henry Maitland Wilson</a> gave Britain's agreement to use the atomic bomb against Japan, and at the <a href="Trinity%20nuclear%20test">Trinity nuclear test</a> on 16 July, when the first atomic bomb was detonated. Inside its <a href="Pit%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">pit</a> was a polonium-beryllium <a href="modulated%20neutron%20initiator">modulated neutron initiator</a>, a development of the technique that Chadwick had used to discover the neutron over a decade before. <a href="William%20L.%20Laurence">William L. Laurence</a>, the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" reporter attached to the Manhattan Project, wrote that "never before in history had any man lived to see his own discovery materialize itself with such telling effect on the destiny of man."

Shortly after the war ended, Chadwick was appointed to the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy (ACAE). He was also appointed as the British scientific advisor to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United Nations Atomic Energy Commission</a>. He clashed with fellow ACAE member <a href="Patrick%20Blackett">Patrick Blackett</a>, who disagreed with Chadwick's conviction that Britain needed to acquire its own nuclear weapons; but it was Chadwick's position that was ultimately adopted. He returned to Britain in 1946, to find a country still beset by wartime rationing and shortages.

At this time, Sir James Mountford, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, wrote in his diary "he had never seen a man 'so physically, mentally and spiritually tired" as Chadwick, for he "had plumbed such depths of moral decision as more fortunate men are never called upon even to peer into ... [and suffered] ... almost insupportable agonies of responsibility arising from his scientific work'."

In 1948, Chadwick accepted an offer to become the <a href="Master%20%28college%29">Master</a> of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the College, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He increased the number of research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist <a href="Tien-chin%20Tsao">Tien-chin Tsao</a> and the Hungarian-born economist <a href="Peter%20Thomas%20Bauer">Peter Bauer</a>. In what became known as the Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by <a href="Patrick%20Hadley">Patrick Hadley</a> voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick's were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that <a href="Francis%20Crick">Francis Crick</a>, a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and <a href="James%20Watson">James Watson</a> discovered the structure of <a href="DNA">DNA</a>.

Over the years, Chadwick received many honours, including the <a href="Medal%20for%20Merit">Medal for Merit</a> from the United States, and the "<a href="Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite">Pour le Mérite</a>" from Germany. He was elected a <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Fellow of the Royal Society</a> in 1927, and in 1946 he became foreign member of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>. He was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1970 for "services to science", and went to <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> for the investiture ceremony. He became more frail, and seldom left his flat, although he travelled to Liverpool for celebrations of his eightieth birthday. A lifelong atheist, he saw no reason to adopt religious faith in later life. He died in his sleep on 24 July 1974. 

His papers are held at the <a href="Churchill%20Archives%20Centre">Churchill Archives Centre</a> in Cambridge, and are accessible to the public. The Chadwick Laboratory at the University of Liverpool is named after him, as is its Sir James Chadwick Chair of Experimental Physics, which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth. A <a href="Chadwick%20%28crater%29">crater on the moon</a> is also named after him. The James Chadwick Building, which houses part of the <a href="School%20of%20Chemical%20Engineering%20and%20Analytical%20Sciences%2C%20University%20of%20Manchester">School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Sciences, University of Manchester</a> is named in his honour. He was described by the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Atomic%20Energy%20Authority">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a> official historian <a href="Lorna%20Arnold">Lorna Arnold</a> as "a physicist, a scientist-diplomat, and a good, wise, and humane man."

Quiriguá

Quiriguá () is an ancient <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya</a> <a href="archaeological%20site">archaeological site</a> in the <a href="Departments%20of%20Guatemala">department</a> of <a href="Izabal%20Department">Izabal</a> in south-eastern <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. It is a medium-sized site covering approximately along the lower <a href="Motagua%20River">Motagua River</a>, with the ceremonial center about from the north bank. During the <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology">Maya Classic Period</a> (AD 200–900), Quiriguá was situated at the juncture of several important <a href="Trade%20in%20Maya%20civilization">trade routes</a>. The site was occupied by 200, construction on the <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a> had begun by about 550, and an explosion of grander construction started in the 8th century. All construction had halted by about 850, except for a brief period of reoccupation in the Early <a href="Mesoamerica%23Postclassic">Postclassic</a> ("c". 900 – "c". 1200). Quiriguá shares its architectural and sculptural styles with the nearby Classic Period city of <a href="Cop%C3%A1n">Copán</a>, with whose history it is closely entwined.

Quiriguá's rapid expansion in the 8th century was tied to king <a href="K%27ak%27%20Tiliw%20Chan%20Yopaat">K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat</a>'s military victory over Copán in 738. When the greatest king of Copán, <a href="Uaxaclajuun%20Ub%27aah%20K%27awiil">Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil</a> or "18-Rabbit", was defeated, he was captured and then sacrificed in the Great Plaza at Quiriguá. Before this, Quiriguá had been a <a href="vassal%20state">vassal state</a> of Copán, but it maintained its independence afterwards. The ceremonial <a href="Maya%20architecture">architecture</a> at Quiriguá is quite modest, but the site's importance lies in its wealth of sculpture, including the tallest stone <a href="monumental%20sculpture">monumental sculpture</a> ever erected in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>.

The archaeological site of Quiriguá is named after the nearby village of the same name, and is located a little over northeast of <a href="Guatemala%20City">Guatemala City</a>; it lies in the municipality of <a href="Los%20Amates">Los Amates</a> in the department of Izabal and has an elevation of <a href="above%20mean%20sea%20level">above mean sea level</a>.

Positioned on the north bank of the lower reaches of the <a href="Motagua%20River">Motagua River</a>, Quiriguá is situated at the point where the valley broadens into a <a href="flood%20plain">flood plain</a>, which has exposed the site to periodic flooding over the centuries. Although the river passed close to the site during the period of the city's occupation, it has since changed course and now flows south of the ceremonial centre. Quiriguá is north of Copán, and is located north-west of the international border with <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>.

The local <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> is a hard red <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, which the inhabitants used in the construction of monuments and <a href="Mesoamerican%20architecture">architecture</a>. This local sandstone is very strong and not prone to <a href="Shear%20%28geology%29">shearing</a> or <a href="Fracture%20%28geology%29">fracturing</a>, allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. Quiriguá was built directly over the <a href="Motagua%20Fault">Motagua Fault</a> and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s.

Although the Quiriguá elite were clearly Maya in ethnicity, the site lies on the southern periphery of the <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n area and the population was at least bi-ethnic, with <a href="Maya%20people">ethnic Maya</a> in a minority. The majority of the population belonged ethnically to the less complex <a href="Intermediate%20Area">Intermediate Area</a> lying beyond the eastern border of Mesoamerica. The <a href="population%20density">population density</a> of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer (1040 to 1300 per square mile) in the centre of the city during the <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology">Late Classic</a> with an estimated peak population of 1200–1600; surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer (338 per square mile) at the site, compared with 1449 structures/km (3767 per square mile) in central Copán. The low population density indicates that Quiriguá served as the focus for a dispersed rural population.

The population levels of the Quiriguá valley increased rapidly after the successful rebellion against Copán in 738, although it was never a heavily populated site. In the 9th century there was a severe decline in population, culminating in the abandonment of the city.

The Motagua River flows down from the western <a href="Guatemalan%20Highlands">Guatemalan highlands</a>, and Quiriguá was ideally positioned to control the trade of uncut <a href="jade">jade</a>, the majority of which was found in the middle reaches of the Motagua Valley, as well as controlling the flow of other important commodities up and down the river such as <a href="Cocoa%20bean">cacao</a>, which was produced as a local <a href="cash%20crop">cash crop</a>. Although cacao was produced for trade, maize remained the primary local crop due to its central role in the <a href="Maya%20cuisine">Maya diet</a>. In addition, maize probably formed an important component in the site's tribute payments to its overlords at Copán, a city that was exhausting its own local resources. Although little jade has been recovered from the site, there is evidence for <a href="Obsidian%20use%20in%20Mesoamerica">trade in obsidian</a> originating from the <a href="Ixtepeque">Ixtepeque</a> source situated near the upper reaches of the Motagua.

In the Classic Period, the location of the site would have placed Quiriguá on a crossroads between the trading route from the highlands to the Caribbean coast and the route from Copán to the major cities of the <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Basin">Petén Basin</a>.

As recorded on hieroglyphic inscriptions at Quiriguá, all dates are AD. Maya inscriptions for rulers sometimes include reference to a number (""hel"-number" or count, named after its main glyph) that are believed to specify the position of that ruler in the sequence of dynastic succession to the rulership of the site. Thus a "hel"-number of five indicates the ruler was fifth in the line of dynastic succession.

There is evidence that Quiriguá was occupied as early as the <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology">Late Preclassic</a> (400 BC – AD 200). Although no structures have been securely dated to this period, a number of Late Preclassic <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artifacts</a> have been recovered, including 63 <a href="figurine">figurine</a>s and a <a href="chert">chert</a> blade. Early Classic <a href="Ceramic%20art">ceramics</a> from Quiriguá are similar to finds at both Copán and <a href="Chalchuapa">Chalchuapa</a> in <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>, while jade hunchback figurines from the same period resemble those found in central Honduras and in the Guatemalan highlands. These early finds demonstrate the participation of Quiriguá in the wider southeastern Maya region from the Late Preclassic onwards.

A combination of hieroglyphic texts from <a href="Tikal">Tikal</a>, Copán and Quiriguá, together with architectural styles and chemical tests of the bones of the founder of the Copán dynasty all suggest that Quiriguá and Copán were founded by elite colonists from the great city of <a href="Tikal">Tikal</a> as a part of its expansion into the southeastern border area of the Maya region. The recorded history of Quiriguá starts in 426, in the Early Classic ("c". 200 – "c". 600); according to <a href="hieroglyph">hieroglyph</a>ic <a href="Maya%20script">inscriptions</a> at other sites, on 5 September of that year <a href="K%27inich%20Yax%20K%27uk%27%20Mo%27">K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'</a> was enthroned as king of Copán. Just three days later he installed "Tok Casper", the first known king of Quiriguá, upon the throne. From this it is evident that right from the beginning of its recorded history Quiriguá was subservient to its southern neighbour, and was founded to bring the lucrative trade route of the Motagua River under the control of Copán and, indirectly, of Tikal. During the next few centuries, about which little is known, the ceremonial architecture at Quiriguá was limited to the hilltop Group A and a broad earthen platform on the valley floor. It is recorded that a stela, as yet undiscovered, was erected in 455 by Tutuum Yohl K'inich, the second king of Quiriguá. An early monument records the supervision of a ritual in 480 by the then overlord from Copán, demonstrating Quiriguá's continued status as a vassal of that city. A hieroglyphic text dating to 493 mentions two further kings of Quiriguá, but interruptions in the text make the reading and decipherment of their names particularly difficult.

There are close parallels between the 5th-century architecture and monuments of Quiriguá and <a href="Uaxactun">Uaxactun</a> in the northern Petén, a site that fell under the domination of Tikal in the late 4th century. The similarities show that Quiriguá remained strongly aligned with the great Tikal alliance network.

Quiriguá suffered a hiatus from the turn of the 6th century that lasted through to the middle of the 7th century. This may be linked to the <a href="Tikal%23Tikal%20hiatus">Tikal hiatus</a> of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by <a href="Calakmul">Calakmul</a>. There is evidence that Quiriguá suffered an attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument 26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.

In the 6th or early 7th century a natural disaster caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried the surface of the site under a deep layer of <a href="silt">silt</a>, completely changing the landscape. Only those buildings that stood above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on the valley floor also continued in use, at least those parts of it that stood above the silt, and it was one of the site's smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quiriguá, as represented by the monuments visible to this day.

A revival can be identified by the dedication of the first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with <a href="Caracol">Caracol</a> in <a href="Belize">Belize</a>. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a>, including the building of the site's first <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballcourt">ballcourt</a>.

Quiriguá traditionally had been subordinate to its southern neighbour, Copán, and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, king of Copán, installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quiriguá's throne as his vassal. As early as 734, however, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat had shown that he was no longer an obedient subordinate of Copán when he started to refer to himself as "k'ul <a href="ajaw">ahaw</a>", holy lord, instead of using the lesser term "ahaw", subordinate lord; at the same time he began to use his own Quiriguá <a href="Maya%20script%23Emblem%20glyphs">emblem glyph</a>. These early assertions of independence can only have been made if Quiriguá had managed to form an external alliance.

Indeed, this local act of rebellion appears to have been part of the larger political struggle between the two Maya "superpowers", the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul. In 736, only two years later, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat received a visit from Wamaw K'awiil, the high king of distant Calakmul, while Copán was one of Tikal's oldest allies. The timing of this visit by the king of Calakmul is highly significant, falling between the accession of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat to the throne of Quiriguá as a vassal of Copán and the outright rebellion that was to follow. This strongly suggests that Calakmul sponsored Quiriguá's rebellion in order to weaken Tikal and to gain access to the rich trade route of the Motagua Valley. It is likely that contact with Calakmul had been initiated soon after K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat acceded to the throne, since Quiriguá experienced rapid growth soon after, suggesting that Quiriguá already was receiving external support.

In 738 the interlinked fortunes of Quiriguá and Copán took a stunning change of direction when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, reigning lord of Quiriguá, captured the powerful, but elderly 13th king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who had installed him on his throne in 725. This coup does not seem to have affected either Copán or Quiriguá physically, there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. Quiriguá seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes. An inscription at Quiriguá, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when Quiriguá seized and burned the wooden images of Copán's patron <a href="deity">deities</a>. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. In the Classic Period the statues of <a href="List%20of%20Maya%20gods%20and%20supernatural%20beings">Maya deities</a> often were carried into battle on <a href="Litter%20%28vehicle%29">palanquins</a>, facilitating their capture in the event of defeat. It has been suggested that the king of Copán was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for <a href="Sacrifice%20in%20Maya%20culture">sacrifice</a>, and was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.

The captured lord was taken back to Quiriguá and on 3 May 738 he was decapitated in a public ritual. The sacrificial offering of the blood of such a powerful overlord greatly enhanced the standing of Quiriguá and its royal family throughout the region and it proclaimed Quiriguá as the new capital of the south-eastern Maya region. After this, Quiriguá engaged in a major monument-building programme, closely mimicking the sculptural style of Copán, possibly using captured Copán sculptors to carry out the work. The population of Quiriguá and of other sites in the valley rapidly increased after the events of 738, although Quiriguá was always a small centre and its total population probably never exceeded 2,000.

In the Late Classic ("c". 600 – "c". 900), alliance with Calakmul frequently was associated with the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was far enough away from Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.

In 718, the city of Xkuy – an as yet undiscovered site – was attacked and burned by Copán under the leadership of king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. After the king of Copán was sacrificed in 738, Xkuy seems to have become a loyal vassal of Quiriguá and in 762 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat supervised the accession of "Sunraiser Jaguar" to the subservient city's throne.

K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, who had so dramatically changed the destiny of his city, died on 27 July 785. <a href="Zoomorph">Zoomorph</a> G is his memorial stone and it describes how he was buried 10 days later in the "13 Kawak House", a building that has not been identified. The great king was succeeded by "Sky Xul", a king whose name has not been properly identified. "Sky Xul" became the reigning lord of Quiriguá 78 days after the death of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, who is thought to have been his father. His reign lasted from 10 to 15 years and was a period of continued activity. In most of the Maya region cities already were suffering terminal decline, engulfed by the <a href="Classic%20Maya%20collapse">Classic Maya collapse</a>, but in Quiriguá "Sky Xul" dedicated three great zoomorph sculptures and two <a href="altar">altar</a>s, considered marvels of Maya stoneworking. "Sky Xul" died some time between 795 and 800.

Little is known of "Jade Sky", who succeeded "Sky Xul" and was the last recorded ruler of Quiriguá. The city's power already was waning, as evidenced by the two stunted stelae erected during his reign, which indicate that the kingdom no longer had access to the kind of resources needed to produce monuments of a similar quality to those of his predecessors. "Jade Sky" did build two of the largest structures in the acropolis, however.

Quiriguá apparently retained its independence from Copán and continued to flourish until the beginning of the 9th century. Relations between the two cities had improved somewhat by 810, when king <a href="Yax%20Pasaj%20Chan%20Yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a> of Copán visited Quiriguá in order to carry out a "<a href="katun%20%28Maya%20calendar%29">k'atun</a>"-ending ritual. However, 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quiriguá, although a reduced level of construction continued in the city centre. After this, Quiriguá falls into silence, engulfed by the greater phenomenon of the <a href="Classic%20Maya%20collapse">Classic Maya collapse</a> – it had lost its reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua; within a few years Quiriguá was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment.

In the early <a href="Postclassic">Postclassic</a> Period ("c". 900 – "c". 1200), Quiriguá was occupied by peoples closely linked to the Caribbean coastal areas of the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> and <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, perhaps due to <a href="Chontal%20Maya%20people">Chontal</a> Maya control of a trade network that included the Yucatán coast and the Motagua Valley. During their brief reoccupation of the site they made substantial additions to the acropolis complex. Finds associated with their occupation include a reclining <a href="chacmool">chacmool</a> sculpture and ceramics from the east coast of Yucatán, artifacts that demonstrate a close link with the distant city of <a href="Chichen%20Itza">Chichen Itza</a>. Some <a href="copper">copper</a> bells and ornaments were recovered from Quiriguá, they are among the earliest finds of <a href="Metallurgy%20in%20pre-Columbian%20Mesoamerica">metal artifacts</a> in the Maya area. They have been dated to either the Terminal Classic ("c". 800 – "c". 950) or the Early Postclassic.

The first European visitor to publish an account of Quiriguá was English architect and artist <a href="Frederick%20Catherwood">Frederick Catherwood</a>, who reached the ruins in 1840. The previous landowner, by the surname of Payés, had related the existence of the ruins to his sons and to Carlos Meiney, a <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>n Englishman resident in Guatemala. The elder Payés had recently died and passed the land to his sons and, since neither Meiney nor Payés' sons had visited the land containing the ruins, they invited <a href="John%20Lloyd%20Stephens">John Lloyd Stephens</a> and Catherwood to join them on their first trip to the site. Stephens had other duties to attend to, but Catherwood was able to accompany the Payés brothers to Quiriguá. Due to adverse conditions he was only able to stay a short time at the ruins, but made drawings of two of the stelae, which were published with a short account of Catherwood's visit in John Lloyd Stephens's book "Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan" in 1841. Quiriguá was the first site that Stephens and Catherwood could claim to have discovered themselves. A longer account of the ruins was made in 1854 by Dr. Karl Scherzer.

Explorer and archaeologist <a href="Alfred%20Maudslay">Alfred Maudslay</a> visited Quiriguá for three days in 1881; they were the first <a href="pre-Columbian">pre-Columbian</a> ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology. He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavations</a>, made paper and plaster <a href="Molding%20%28process%29">molds</a> of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures; these molds were then shipped to the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, with casts being transferred to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>.

In 1910, the <a href="United%20Fruit%20Company">United Fruit Company</a> bought Quiriguá and all the land for a great distance around the site for <a href="banana">banana</a> production; they set aside around the ceremonial centre as an archaeological park, leaving an island of jungle among the plantations. More archaeological work was carried out from 1910 to 1914 by <a href="Edgar%20Lee%20Hewett">Edgar Lee Hewett</a> and <a href="Sylvanus%20Morley">Sylvanus Morley</a> for the <a href="School%20of%20American%20Archaeology">School of American Archaeology</a> in Santa Fe. Duplicates of the stelae of Quiriguá made from Hewitt's plaster casts of the originals were exhibited at the <a href="Panama-California%20Exposition%20%281915%29">Panama-California Exposition</a> in <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a>, in 1915. The casts are still on display at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Museum%20of%20Man">San Diego Museum of Man</a> in their "Maya: Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth" exhibition. The <a href="Carnegie%20Institution">Carnegie Institution</a> conducted several intermittent projects at Quiriguá from 1915 through 1934. <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>, writing after visiting the site in the early 1930s, noted that Quiriguá's stelae commemorated "man's triumph over time and matter and the triumph of time and matter over man." Quiriguá was among the first Maya archaeological sites to be studied intensively, although little restoration was carried out and the ruins once again became overgrown with jungle.

Quiriguá was declared a National Monument in 1970 under Ministerial Accord 1210, this was followed on 19 June 1974 by its declaration as an Archaeological Park under Governmental Accord 35-74.

From 1974 through 1979, an extensive archaeological project was conducted at Quiriguá sponsored by the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a>, and the Guatemalan <a href="Instituto%20de%20Antropolog%C3%ADa%20e%20Historia">Instituto de Antropología e Historia</a>. Directed by <a href="Robert%20Sharer">Robert Sharer</a> and <a href="William%20R.%20Coe%20%28archaeologist%29">William R. Coe</a>, the project excavated the acropolis, cleaned the monuments, and studied outlying groups. It was declared a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> in 1981, and in 1999 UNESCO approved one-off funding of US$27,248 for "emergency assistance for the rehabilitation of the archaeological site of Quiriguá". One of the site's stelae is depicted on the Guatemalan <a href="Guatemalan%20quetzal%23Coins">10 centavo coin</a>.

The area included within the Archaeological Park of Quiriguá has been developed for tourism with the construction of a car park, site museum, and sanitation facilities and is open to the public on a daily basis.

After Quiriguá's pivotal victory over Copán in 738, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat rebuilt the main group in the image of Copán itself. Thus, the <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a>, palace, and ballcourt all lie at the southern end of the Great Plaza. The ceremonial centre is laid out around three plazas, the northernmost is the Great Plaza. This plaza measures from north to south and is the largest plaza in the whole Maya region. At the southern end of the Great Plaza is the Ballcourt Plaza, surrounded on three sides by structures associated with the acropolis. The Acropolis Plaza is a fully enclosed plaza within the acropolis itself. The area to the west of the Ballcourt Plaza was probably the riverside docking area and there is evidence that the southern part of the Great Plaza was a marketplace. A number of ceramic-lined <a href="Water%20well">wells</a> have been excavated close to the site core, these were all built in the 8th century and although some continued in use into the 9th century, none are known to have been built that late.




Groups A, B and C lie at a distance of one to three miles from the site core.

The monuments at Quiriguá include unusually large <a href="Maya%20stelae">stelae</a> elaborately carved from single blocks of red sandstone, brought from quarries away. The characteristics of this hard rock allowed the local sculptors to produce low-<a href="relief">relief</a> sculptures enhanced by three-dimensional faces, in contrast with the contemporary two-dimensional sculpture of the <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Basin">Petén</a> region. After the defeat and execution of the king of Copán in 738, the sculptural style of Quiriguá closely resembled that of its former overlord. The enormous stelae at Quirigá originally would have been visible from the Motagua River, which once flowed past the west side of the Great Plaza, announcing the new-found power of the city to passing traders. The monuments include long panels of glyphic text that are considered among the most complex and beautiful of all Maya stone inscriptions. A characteristic of these texts is the use of full-figure glyphs in which the normal bar and dot number glyphs of <a href="Maya%20script">Maya script</a> are replaced with exquisitely carved representations of the deities. However, by the latter part of the 8th century Quiriguá had developed an original style with the production of boulders elaborately sculpted into the forms of composite <a href="Legendary%20creature">mythological animals</a> bearing elements of <a href="toad">toad</a>s, <a href="jaguar">jaguar</a>s, <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s, and <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>; these sculptures are referred to as "zoomorphs" and were completed by two later kings after the death of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 785.

There also are various altars and sculptures used as decoration in the facades of buildings; most Quiriguá monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff compared to the naturalistic grace of the art of some other Maya sites. Traces of red <a href="pigment">pigment</a> have been found on some of the monuments and most of the monuments were likely to have been painted red, the colour of birth, sacrifice, and renewal.

George Herriman

George Joseph Herriman (August 22, 1880 – April 25, 1944) was an American cartoonist best known for the comic strip "<a href="Krazy%20Kat">Krazy Kat</a>" (1913–1944). More influential than popular, "Krazy Kat" had an appreciative audience among those in the arts. <a href="Gilbert%20Seldes">Gilbert Seldes</a>' article "The Krazy Kat Who Walks by Himself" was the earliest example of a critic from the high arts giving serious attention to a comic strip. "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>" placed the strip first on its list of the greatest comics of the 20th century. Herriman's work has been a primary influence on cartoonists such as <a href="Will%20Eisner">Will Eisner</a>, <a href="Charles%20M.%20Schulz">Charles M. Schulz</a>, <a href="Robert%20Crumb">Robert Crumb</a>, <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a>, <a href="Bill%20Watterson">Bill Watterson</a>, and <a href="Chris%20Ware">Chris Ware</a>.

Herriman was born in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, Louisiana, to <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a> <a href="Louisiana%20Creole%20people">Creole</a> parents, and grew up in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. After he graduated from high school in 1897, he worked in the newspaper industry as an illustrator and engraver. He moved on to cartooning and comic strips—a medium then in its infancy—and drew a variety of strips until he introduced his most famous character, Krazy Kat, in his strip "<a href="The%20Dingbat%20Family">The Dingbat Family</a>" in 1910. A "Krazy Kat" daily strip began in 1913, and from 1916 the strip also appeared on Sundays. It was noted for its poetic, dialect-heavy dialogue; its fantastic, shifting backgrounds; and its bold, experimental page layouts.

In the strip's main motif and dynamic, Ignatz Mouse pelted Krazy with bricks, which the naïve, <a href="Androgyny">androgynous</a> Kat interpreted as symbols of love. As the strip progressed, a love triangle developed between Krazy, Ignatz, and Offisa Pupp. Pupp made it his mission to prevent Ignatz from throwing bricks at Krazy, or to jail him for having done so, but his efforts were perpetually impeded because Krazy wished to be struck by Ignatz's bricks.

Herriman lived most of his life in Los Angeles, but made frequent trips to the Navajo deserts in the southwestern U.S. He was drawn to the landscapes of <a href="Monument%20Valley">Monument Valley</a> and the <a href="Enchanted%20Mesa">Enchanted Mesa</a>, and made <a href="Coconino%20County%2C%20Arizona">Coconino County</a> the location of his "Krazy Kat" strips. His artwork made much use of <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo</a> and Mexican themes and motifs against shifting desert backgrounds. He was a prolific cartoonist who produced a large number of strips and illustrated <a href="Don%20Marquis">Don Marquis</a>'s books of poetry about "<a href="Archy%20and%20Mehitabel">Archy and Mehitabel</a>", an alley cat and a cockroach. Newspaper magnate <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> was a proponent of Herriman and gave him a lifetime contract with <a href="King%20Features%20Syndicate">King Features Syndicate</a>, which guaranteed Herriman a comfortable living and an outlet for his work despite its lack of popularity.

George Joseph Herriman was born at 348 Villere Street in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> on August 22, 1880. He came from a line of French-speaking Louisiana <a href="Creoles%20of%20color">Creole mulattoes</a> who were considered <a href="free%20people%20of%20color">free people of color</a>, and were reportedly active in the early <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist movement</a>. His , owned a tailor shop on <a href="Royal%20Street%2C%20New%20Orleans">Royal Street</a> in New Orleans. His maternal grandmother was born in <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, Cuba. His parents were (1850–1923), born in New Orleans, and Clara Morel Herriman (1857–1911), born in <a href="Iberville%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Iberville</a>. The family attended the St. Augustine Catholic Church in New Orleans' <a href="Trem%C3%A9">Tremé</a> neighborhood.

When he was ten, Herriman and his family moved to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, where he grew up south of downtown near <a href="Main%20Street%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Main Street</a> and <a href="Washington%20Boulevard%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Washington Boulevard</a>. His father worked there as a tailor. Herriman attended the Catholic boys' school St. Vincent's College (now <a href="Loyola%20High%20School%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Loyola High School</a>). Soon after graduating in 1897, he sold a sketch of the Hotel Petrolia in <a href="Santa%20Paula%2C%20California">Santa Paula</a> to the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Herald-Examiner">Los Angeles Herald</a>". This landed him a $2-per-week job there as an assistant in the engraving department, where he occasionally did drawings for advertisements and <a href="Editorial%20cartoonist">political cartoons</a>.

When he was 20, Herriman sneaked aboard a freight train bound for <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, hoping his chances as an artist would be better there. He was unsuccessful at first, and survived by working as a <a href="barker%20%28occupation%29">barker</a> and billboard painter at <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a>, until one of the leading <a href="humor%20magazine">humor magazine</a>s of the day, "<a href="Judge%20%28magazine%29">Judge</a>", accepted some of his cartoons. Between June 15 and October 26, 1901, eleven of his cartoons appeared in that magazine's pages, in the heavily <a href="Hatching">crosshatched</a> style of the day. He often used sequential images in his cartoons, as in the emerging comic strip medium. On September 29 that year, his first real comic strips were published, one in the <a href="Pulitzer%2C%20Inc.">Pulitzer</a> chain of newspapers on a non-contractual, one-shot basis and another on a continuing basis in the Philadelphia North American Syndicate's first comic strip supplement. His first color comic strips appeared in the <a href="McClure%20Newspaper%20Syndicate">T. C. McClure Syndicate</a> beginning October 20.

His success with these syndicated strips convinced Herriman to give up on magazine submissions. For the Pulitzer papers on February 16, 1902, he began his first strip that had a continuing character, "Musical Mose". The strip featured an <a href="African%20American">African-American</a> musician who impersonated other ethnicities, only to suffer the consequences when discovered by his audience. "Professor Otto and his Auto", about a terrifyingly dangerous driver, followed in March, and "Acrobatic Archie", a "kid strip" with a child protagonist, first appeared in April. With his future as a cartoonist seemingly assured, Herriman traveled back to Los Angeles to marry his childhood sweetheart and returned with her to New York.

In the November 1902 issue of the literary magazine "<a href="The%20Bookman%20%28New%20York%29">The Bookman</a>" Herriman wrote of his profession self-deprecatingly, while poet La Touche Hancock, in an article in that issue titled "The American Comic and Caricature Art", wrote, "Art and poetry is the characteristic of George Herriman. Were his drawings not so well known one would think he had mistaken his vocation." Herriman's work was increasing in popularity, and he occasionally had front-page, full-color strips for the Pulitzer supplements, such as "Two Jolly Jackies" about two unemployed sailors, which began in January 1903. He began drawing the cowboy strip "Lariat Pete" in September for the McClure syndicate after "Two Jolly Jackies" was ended.

In June, Herriman was employed by the "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>". There, he illustrated <a href="Roy%20McCardell">Roy McCardell</a>'s commentaries on local events, beginning June 28 and running to the year's end. Herriman still produced syndicate work, such as "Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade" for the <a href="World%20Color%20Press">World Color Printing Company</a> beginning January 2, 1904. Another of Herriman's obsessive characters, the Major traveled the world in an unsuccessful search for the purest air and spouted poetic dialogue. "Major Ozone" was so popular that it soon was given the supplement's front page. The same month, Herriman moved from the "World" to the "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">New York Daily News</a>", where he was given a larger quantity and variety of work, including cartoon reporting on sports and politics. In February and March, he had a short-lived continuing character comic strip about domestic life called "Home Sweet Home". That spring, he began illustrating a series of articles written by Walter Murphy called "Bubblespikers".

Rudolph Block hired Herriman for the <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">Hearst</a> papers with "a salary commensurate with his talents", starting April 22 at the "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York American</a>", which ran no daily comic strips at the time. Herriman drew sports cartoons in an office alongside <a href="Frederick%20Burr%20Opper">Frederick Burr Opper</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Swinnerton">James Swinnerton</a>, and <a href="Tad%20Dorgan">Tad Dorgan</a>, who was popularly known as "Tad" and was considered a star at another Hearst paper, the "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York Evening Journal</a>". Tad and Herriman were often assigned to cover the same sporting events and became close friends. In 1924, Tad called Herriman "one of the best sporting artists in the world" and regretted that Herriman no longer did that kind of work. Herriman continued with Hearst until June 1905, when he left the paper, possibly because of the new sports editor's unsympathetic attitude to cartoonists. He returned to Los Angeles in the latter half of 1905.

In California, Herriman continued to mail in work to the <a href="World%20Color%20Press">World Color Printing Company</a>. He revived "Major Ozone" and produced "Grandma's Girl—Likewise Bud Smith", which he combined from two earlier strips, and a two-tiered children's strip, "Rosy Posy—Mama's Girl". He began to work with the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" on January 8, 1906, before returning to Hearst that summer. Accompanying a front-page illustration in Hearst's "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Herald-Examiner">Los Angeles Examiner</a>", Herriman was announced as "the "Examiner"s cartoonist" on August 21. His artwork began to appear on nearly every page, resulting in greatly increased sales for the newspaper. In October, he stopped working for World Color.

Following the success of <a href="Bud%20Fisher">Bud Fisher</a>'s daily strip "<a href="Mutt%20and%20Jeff">A. Mutt</a>", which debuted in late 1907, Herriman began a similarly sports-themed daily strip that December called "Mr. Proones the Plumber". The strip was not as successful as Fisher's, and it ceased to appear after December 26. His next comic strip, "Baron Mooch", starring the titular freeloader, debuted in the "Examiner" on October 12, 1909. Herriman began two more strips in November 1909 with the World Color Printing Company—"Alexander the Cat" and "Daniel and Pansy", which both appeared in color. "Daniel and Pansy" was Herriman's first strip to feature an all-animal cast. This was followed in the "Examiner" on December 20 by the short-lived "Mary's Home from College", a precursor to the "girl strips" such as <a href="Cliff%20Sterrett">Cliff Sterrett</a>'s "<a href="Polly%20and%20Her%20Pals">Polly and Her Pals</a>" and John Held Jr.'s "Merely Margie", and on December 23 by "Gooseberry Sprig", about an aristocratic, cigar-smoking duck who had previously and popularly appeared in Herriman's sports cartoons. The bird-populated fantasy was a precursor to "Krazy Kat", and many of its characters reappeared in the later strip.

In 1910, the sports editor of the "New York Evening Journal" called Herriman back to New York to cover for Tad Dorgan who was in San Francisco covering the <a href="Jack%20Johnson%20%28boxer%29%23The%20%26quot%3BFight%20of%20the%20Century%26quot%3B">"Fight of the Century"</a> between <a href="Jack%20Johnson%20%28boxer%29">Jack Johnson</a> and <a href="James%20J.%20Jeffries">Jim Jeffries</a>. Six days after arriving in New York, Herriman began "<a href="The%20Dingbat%20Family">The Dingbat Family</a>", starring E. Pluribus Dingbat and his family. Herriman used typed lettering on the strip on July 26, 1910, but quickly went back to hand-lettering. On August 10, 1910, Herriman retitled the strip "The Family Upstairs". The original title return after the strip of November 15, 1911, when the Dingbats' building was demolished to make room for a department store and they and their upstairs nemeses parted paths.

Critics do not regard the strip highly, but it provided the vehicle for a fruitful situation: in the July 26 episode, a mouse threw a brick at the family cat—called "Kat"—which hit the cat on the head. The antics of this mouse and "Kat" continued to appear in the bottom portion of "<a href="The%20Dingbat%20Family">The Dingbat Family</a>". Herriman said he did this "to fill up the waste space". About a month after its first appearance, the "Kat" crept up on the sleeping mouse and kissed it loudly. The mouse awoke saying, "I dreamed an angel kissed me", while the "Kat" crept away and said, "Sweet thing".

The gender of "Kat" was unclear from the start. Herriman experimented with a decision about the character's gender, but it remained ambiguous and he would refer to "Kat" as "he" or "she" as he saw fit. Herriman incorporated unusual details into the mini-strip's backgrounds—cacti, pagodas, fanciful vegetation, or anything else that struck his fancy; this became a signature of the later "Krazy Kat" strip. The cast grew and soon included the mainstay character Bull Pupp and characters from the "Gooseberry Sprigg" strip. The strip's characters, relations and situations grew organically during its lifetime, encouraged by Herriman's colleagues.

The cat-and-mouse substrip was gaining in popularity; instead of filling up space in the bottom of "<a href="The%20Dingbat%20Family">The Dingbat Family</a>"s panels, it began to occupy a tier of panels of its own. In July 1912, while Herriman had the Dingbats on vacation, Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse took over the strip, which was retitled "Krazy Kat and I. Mouse" for the duration. On October 28, 1913, "Krazy Kat" debuted as an independent strip on the daily comics page.

During the first few years of publication, "Krazy Kat"s humor changed from slapstick to a more <a href="Vaudeville">vaudevillian</a> kind. The shifting backgrounds became increasingly bizarre, presaging things to come. The strip expanded to a full-page black-and-white <a href="Sunday%20strip">Sunday strip</a> on April 23, 1916. Herriman made full use of his imagination and used the whole page in the strip's layout. The strips were unlike anything else on the comics page; spontaneous, formally daring, yet impeccably composed.

Herriman visited <a href="Monument%20Valley">Monument Valley</a> in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> and similar places in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> and southern <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, and incorporated the distinct forms of the desert landscape into his strips. The <a href="Enchanted%20Mesa">Enchanted Mesa</a> of New Mexico first appeared in "Krazy Kat" in the summer of 1916. Herriman may have visited after reading an article by <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> in 1913, but he may have gone earlier—the desert <a href="Coconino%20County%2C%20Arizona">Coconino County</a>, Arizona, that became the backdrop to "Krazy Kat" was first mentioned in a 1911 "<a href="The%20Dingbat%20Family">The Dingbat Family</a>" strip, though the real Coconino County was located further southwest than Herriman's fanciful version.

"The Dingbat Family" finished in 1916 and was replaced by "Baron Bean"s debut the next day. The strip's title character, The Baron, was an impoverished English nobleman, a tramp inspired by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>. He and his valet Grimes would plot ways to get by. Herriman later introduced the main characters' wives, and after a run as a domestic strip, with occasional appearances of characters from Krazy Kat's world, it ended in January 1919. It was replaced the next day by "Now Listen Mabel", which was about a young man courting a young woman; he would be caught in a compromising situation, which he would try to explain away with "Now listen Mabel ..." The strip lasted until that December.

"Krazy Kat" gained an appreciative audience in the world of the arts. The character debuted in film in 1916. The first animated films starring a cat were produced by Hearst's <a href="International%20Film%20Service">International Film Service</a>, though without Herriman's direct involvement. In 1922, <a href="Adolph%20Bolm">Adolph Bolm</a> choreographed a jazz-pantomime "Krazy Kat" ballet written by <a href="John%20Alden%20Carpenter">John Alden Carpenter</a>. It was first performed in New York in 1922 by <a href="Theatre%20Intime">Ballet Intime</a>, and Herriman illustrated the libretto and designed the costumes and scenario. While it was not a great success, the critics <a href="Deems%20Taylor">Deems Taylor</a>, <a href="Stark%20Young">Stark Young</a> and Henrietta Straus wrote favorably about it. The strip itself was the subject of an article by literary critic <a href="Gilbert%20Seldes">Gilbert Seldes</a> called "Golla, Golla the Comic Strip's Art", which appeared in the May 1922 issue of "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>". Seldes expanded this article as part of his book on the popular arts, "The Seven Lively Arts" (1924), in which Seldes argued against conservative tendencies that excluded artists in the popular arts, such as Herriman and Chaplin, from being considered alongside traditional artists. "Krazy Kat" was the subject of a chapter entitled "The Krazy Kat That Walks by Himself", which is the most famous piece of writing about the strip and the earliest example of a critic from the world of high art giving legitimacy to the comic strip medium. "Vanity Fair" inducted Herriman into its Hall of Fame in the April 1923 issue.

Hearst, an admirer of "Krazy Kat", had given Herriman a lifetime contract with his company <a href="King%20Features%20Syndicate">King Features Syndicate</a>, which gave Herriman the security to live anywhere he wanted. In 1922, he moved back to Hollywood, into a two-story Spanish-style home at 1617 North Sierra Bonita, from where he made frequent visits to the Arizona desert. Herriman developed ties with members of the film industry; he knew <a href="Hal%20Roach">Hal Roach</a> Studio members <a href="Tom%20McNamara%20%28director%29">Tom McNamara</a> and <a href="H.%20M.%20Walker">"Beanie" Walker</a> from their newspaper days. Walker, Herriman's best friend, was the head writer on the "<a href="Our%20Gang">Our Gang</a>" shorts. In the early 1920s, Herriman occasionally drew his strips at the Roach Studio. He met celebrities, including <a href="Will%20Rogers">Will Rogers</a> and <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>, and presented them with hand-colored drawings. He loved Charlie Chaplin's films, and reviewed "<a href="The%20Gold%20Rush">The Gold Rush</a>" in the magazine "Motion Picture Classics" in October 1925.

Autumn 1922 saw the first daily installment of "Stumble Inn", the first non-"Krazy Kat" strip Herriman had drawn since 1919. A verbose strip whose Sundays were often overrun with prose, its lead characters were Uriah and Ida Stumble, who rented rooms to an assortment of strange characters. The daily strip was short-lived, but the Sundays edition lasted three years.

From August 1925 until September 1929, King Features required that Herriman design the "Krazy Kat" Sundays so that they could be run either as a full Sunday page or as two four-panel dailies. Herriman lamented intrusion on his page designs, and the artwork of the period took on a rushed look. He was made to focus on the strip's characterization, and during this period, the Krazy—Ignatz—Offisa Pupp love triangle for which the strip is remembered became fully developed. Pupp pined for Krazy, Krazy loved Ignatz, and Ignatz hated Krazy and pelted the annoying "Kat" with a brick, and Pupp imprisoned Ignatz.

Throughout the late 1920s, Herriman made frequent trips to <a href="Kayenta%2C%20Arizona">Kayenta, Arizona</a>, in <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo</a> country about from Monument Valley. He also made winter trips to Mexico. The desert, Navajo artwork, and Mexican pottery and architecture became more prominent in Herriman's strips, and he sometimes used Spanish vocabulary in the dialogue. Herriman did little work on these excursions, and it is likely that he drew his strips in hurried bursts when in Hollywood.

"Stumble Inn" finished in late 1925, and it was replaced with the domestic strip "Us Husbands" (with "Mistakes Will Happen" as a "<a href="Topper%20%28comic%20strip%29">topper</a>" strip), which ran until the end of that year. In 1928, Herriman took over the strip "Embarrassing Moments", which had begun in 1922 and had been drawn by several cartoonists. The strip eventually became "Bernie Burns", in which embarrassing moments would happen to the title character. The strip appeared in few papers, and after it ended in 1932, Herriman worked only on "Krazy Kat", although he provided illustrations for Don Marquis' popular "Archy and Mehitabel", a series of books of poetry about a cat and a cockroach.

In 1930, Herriman sold his first Hollywood home to a friend and moved his family to 2217 Maravilla Drive, a Spanish-style mansion atop a hill. It was adorned with paintings of Southwest and Native themes, and had a Mexican-style garden paved with <a href="flagstone">flagstone</a>s and decorated with painted pots and tropical plants. Herriman later bought the lot across the street and turned it into a public park.

The 1930s were a period of tragedy for Herriman. On September 29, 1931, his wife Mabel died after an automobile accident, and in 1939, his youngest daughter Bobbie died unexpectedly at 30. After his wife's death, Herriman never remarried and lived in Los Angeles with his cats and dogs. He developed a close relationship with cartoonist James Swinnerton's first wife Louise, with whom he frequently exchanged letters. Herriman underwent a kidney operation in spring 1938, and during his ten-week convalescence King Features reran old "Krazy Kat" strips.

"Krazy Kat"s popularity fell considerably over the years, and by the 1930s it was running in only thirty-five newspapers, while its contemporaries such as "<a href="Bringing%20Up%20Father">Bringing Up Father</a>" were reportedly running in up to a thousand. Herriman realized his $750-per-week salary from Hearst's King Features Syndicate was far more than the revenue the strip could be generating, but Hearst refused Herriman's offer to take a pay cut. Hearst let it be known that Herriman was to continue the strip as long as he liked. From 1935, "Krazy Kat" appeared in color, of which Herriman made bold use. He reduced the amount of hatchwork and used larger, more open panels.

Herriman died in his sleep in his home near Hollywood on April 25, 1944, after a long illness. An incompletely inked penciling of a week's worth of daily strips was found on his drawing board. On his death certificate, the cause of death was listed as "<a href="Non-alcoholic%20fatty%20liver%20disease">non-alcoholic</a> <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> of the liver", and despite his mixed-race heritage, he was listed as "caucasian". The "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York Journal-American</a>" ran a front-page obituary. His funeral at Little Church of Flowers at <a href="Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%20%28Glendale%29">Forest Lawn Memorial Park</a> was attended by few. Cartoonist <a href="Harry%20Hershfield">Harry Hershfield</a> spoke at the funeral, saying, "If ever there was a saint on earth, it was George Herriman". According to his request, his body was cremated and his remains were scattered over Monument Valley.

On June 25, 1944, two months after Herriman's death, the last of his completed "Krazy Kat" strips, a full-page Sunday, was printed. At the time, Hearst usually engaged new cartoonists when the artists of popular strips quit or died, but he made an exception for Herriman, as he felt that no one could take his place.

Herriman was described as self-deprecatingly modest, and he disliked being photographed. The "New York Journal-American"s obituary described him as a devoted husband and father, of slight build, mild-mannered and an anonymous contributor to charities. He was generous to his friends, and sold his first Hollywood house, which he had bought for $50,000, to a friend for $40,000. Though a private person, he was said to be an entertaining host to his friends. He would sometimes stay silent during social occasions and would often leave the room to wash dishes, which he said he enjoyed as it gave him the opportunity to think. His favorite game was poker, which he particularly enjoyed playing with his fellow cartoonists.

Herriman had a great love of animals, and had a large number of dogs and cats; he had five dogs and thirteen cats in 1934. He usually kept to a vegetarian diet, except when it made him feel too weak, and he refused to ride horses. He so admired <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>'s pacifist stance that he would only buy <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> automobiles. He purchased a new model annually.

Herriman married his childhood sweetheart Mabel Lillian Bridge in Los Angeles on July 7, 1902. They had two daughters: Mabel (b. 1903), nicknamed "Toodles", later "Toots") and Barbara (b. 1909), nicknamed "Bobbie", who had <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>.

Herriman was born to mixed-race parents, and his birth certificate lists Herriman as "colored". In the post- "<a href="Plessy%20v.%20Ferguson">Plessy v. Ferguson</a>" U.S., in which "<a href="separate%20but%20equal">separate but equal</a>" racial segregation was enshrined, people of mixed race had to choose to identify themselves as either black or white. Herriman seems to have identified himself as white. According to comics academic Jeet Heer, his early work is "replete with black caricatures", such as "Musical Mose", in which the lead character, an African-American musician, wishes his "color would fade". Racial ambivalence crept into "Krazy Kat", such as on two occasions where Krazy's black fur was dyed white. Ignatz falls in love with the whitened Krazy, only to return to hatred and brick-throwing when the truth is revealed. Similarly, in an oft-repeated joke, Ignatz would accidentally become covered with coal dust and would be spurned by the normally love-struck Krazy. In one such episode, a brick thrown by the blackened Ignatz hits Krazy, who declares, "A lil Eetiopium Mice, black like a month from midnights. Fuwi!" Once Ignatz reverts to his white self, Krazy loves him again.

Herriman's ethnic heritage was unknown to his colleagues. Fellow cartoonist Tad Dorgan nicknamed him "the Greek", a label which stuck and was taken up by his biographers and the press, who called him the son of a Greek baker. At other times, he was identified as French, Irish, and Turkish. He told a friend that he was Creole, and speculated that he may have "Negro blood" in him, as he had "<a href="Afro-textured%20hair">kinky hair</a>". The friend said that Herriman wore a hat to hide his hair, which may have been an attempt to <a href="Passing%20%28racial%20identity%29">pass as white</a>. Herriman said that he dreamed of being reborn a Navajo. On his death certificate, he was listed as "Caucasian", and his daughter Mabel had his father's birthplace listed as <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and his mother's as <a href="Alsace-Lorraine">Alsace-Lorraine</a>.

Sociologist <a href="Arthur%20Asa%20Berger">Arthur Asa Berger</a> made Herriman's mixed-race heritage known in 1971. While researching for Herriman's entry for the "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20American%20Biography">Dictionary of American Biography</a>", Berger discovered the cartoonist's race was listed as "colored" on his birth certificate obtained from the New Orleans Board of Health. The 1880 census for New Orleans listed his parents as "mulatto". On reading this, African-American poet <a href="Ishmael%20Reed">Ishmael Reed</a> dedicated his 1972 novel "<a href="Mumbo%20Jumbo%20%28novel%29">Mumbo Jumbo</a>" to "George Herriman, Afro-American, who created Krazy Kat". Herriman came to be identified as Black or Creole in comics literature, including his first book-length biography, "Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman" (1986), while the "Greek" label stuck with some biographers, and was used by <a href="Bill%20Blackbeard">Bill Blackbeard</a> in his introductions to the "Krazy and Ignatz" volumes in the early 2000s. Later research at the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Public%20Library">New Orleans Public Library</a> by cartoonist Brian Nelson showed that Herriman's maternal grandmother was born in Havana, Cuba, that all his relatives were listed as "mulatto" on the 1890 census, and that Herriman may also have had Spanish or Native American ancestry.

"Krazy Kat" was popular with intellectuals, artists and critics, and in the 1920s Herriman's modernist touches received praise. In 1921, composer John Alden Carpenter, who had long been an admirer of Herriman's work, approached him to collaborate on a "Krazy Kat" ballet. President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> refused to miss any installment of "Krazy Kat", and would take it into cabinet meetings.

Writer <a href="E.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BB.%20White">E. B. White</a> praised Herriman's illustrations for "Archy and Mehitabel". Cartoonist <a href="Edward%20Sorel">Edward Sorel</a> wrote that "Krazy Kat"s lack of popularity later in its run was largely due to Hearst's editorial policies, in that the "<a href="Low%20culture">lowbrow</a>" readership at whom he aimed his papers was unlikely to appreciate Herriman's style of work, though Hearst personally championed the strip. Following Herriman's death, the strip was discontinued, unlike most popular strips which were continued by other cartoonists after their creators' deaths. His stature was such that decades after his death, his work was displayed in art galleries.

Critics found Herriman's work difficult to classify and contextualize; Seldes, , and writers <a href="Adam%20Gopnik">Adam Gopnik</a> and <a href="Robert%20Warshow">Robert Warshow</a> were among critics who tempered their enthusiasm for the strip with qualifications about its perceived naïveté and its "lowbrow" origins on the comic strip page.

The strip has had a lasting influence on a large number of cartoonists. "<a href="Mutts">Mutts</a>" creator Patrick McDonnell calls "Krazy Kat" one of his foremost influences, and is co-author of "Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman" (1986). <a href="Will%20Eisner">Will Eisner</a> discovered Herriman's comics when he was selling newspapers in the 1930s and called "Krazy Kat" "the big strong influence" on his own work. <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a> called Herriman one of his "conscious influences". Herriman's widespread influence on American , particularly his shape-shifting, <a href="Psychedelia">psychedelic</a> backgrounds, lack of respect for convention and his irreverence, is evident in the work of <a href="Robert%20Crumb">Robert Crumb</a>, <a href="Denis%20Kitchen">Denis Kitchen</a>, and <a href="Bobby%20London">Bobby London</a>. Journalist Paul Krassner called Crumb "the illegitimate offspring of "Krazy Kat"". Cartoonist <a href="Chris%20Ware">Chris Ware</a> was so taken with Herriman's work he made a pilgrimage to Monument Valley to see the desert landscapes that inspired much of Herriman's art.

"Krazy Kat" was a primary influence on other cartoonists such as <a href="Charles%20M.%20Schulz">Charles M. Schulz</a> of "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>", <a href="Bill%20Watterson">Bill Watterson</a> of "<a href="Calvin%20and%20Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a>", and the Italian <a href="Massimo%20Mattioli">Massimo Mattioli</a>. <a href="Walt%20Kelly">Walt Kelly</a> paid homage to Herriman in some of his "<a href="Pogo%20%28comic%20strip%29">Pogo</a>" strips. <a href="Dr.%20Seuss">Dr. Seuss</a> expressed fondness for "Krazy Kat", and children's literature scholar <a href="Philip%20Nel">Philip Nel</a> has detected Herriman's influence in Seuss's works, especially in his zig-zagging, Coconino County-like backgrounds. Multimedia artist <a href="%C3%96yvind%20Fahlstr%C3%B6m">Öyvind Fahlström</a> appropriated "Krazy Kat" in a series of works from 1963 to 1965. <a href="Jay%20Cantor">Jay Cantor</a> published a <a href="Postmodern%20literature">postmodern novel</a> in 1987 called "Krazy Kat: A Novel in Five Panels", in which the retired Krazy and Ignatz contemplate a comeback in a post-atomic world.

Since 1997, the <a href="Small%20Press%20Expo">Small Press Expo</a> has held the annual <a href="Ignatz%20Award">Ignatz Award</a>s in honor of Herriman's mouse from "Krazy Kat". It recognizes talent in independent comics publishing. "Krazy Kat" was ranked first on "The Comics Journal"s list of the greatest comics of the twentieth century. The <a href="Society%20of%20Illustrators">Society of Illustrators</a> inducted Herriman into its Hall of Fame in 2013.

Within the seeming strictures of the strip—the recurring characters, the Krazy–Ignatz–Offisa Pupp love triangle—Herriman improvised freely with the story, the shifting backgrounds, and the sex of the "Krazy Kat"s title character. Among the multicultural influences Herriman mixed in his work were those of the Navajo and Mexican. He made creative use of language with a poetical sense, employing multilingual puns in a fanciful mix of dialects from different ethnic backgrounds. Herriman used <a href="metafiction">metafiction</a>al techniques associated with <a href="postmodernism">postmodernism</a>; his characters were self-aware, he frequently drew attention to himself and his drawings as drawings in his strips, and he emphasized the subjectivity of language and experience.

Herriman drew with what cartoonist Edward Sorel called a "liberated, spontaneous-looking style  ...  a cartoon counterpart of <a href="expressionism">expressionism</a>". It was organic, and his pen strokes had a dynamic, thick-and-thin range which Sorel describes as instantly recognizable and difficult to imitate. The "Krazy Kat" Sunday pages showed Herriman experimenting most freely—each had a unique panel layout and logo, and the jumbled panels could be circles, irregular shapes, or borderless. In his last few years, Herriman's arthritis led to an ever-scratchier style of art; he used a knife to scratch out whites from inked surfaces, giving the artwork the look of a <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>.

"Krazy Kat" has been <a href="Krazy%20Kat%23Reprints%20and%20compilations">collected</a> in a variety of formats over the years, though Herriman's other strips have been less frequently reprinted. "George Herriman's Krazy Kat" (1946) was the first "Krazy Kat" collection; it featured an introduction by poet . Comics historian Bill Blackbeard began compiling a complete collection of "Krazy Kat" Sundays beginning in 1988, but the publisher <a href="Eclipse%20Comics">Eclipse Comics</a> went bankrupt in 1992, before the series was complete. Blackbeard's thirteen-volume "Krazy and Ignatz" series was published by <a href="Fantagraphics%20Books">Fantagraphics Books</a> beginning in 2002, and was designed by Chris Ware. In 2010, Sunday Press Books released "Krazy Kat: A Celebration of Sundays", which reprinted a selection of "Krazy Kat" Sundays and some of Herriman's pre-"Krazy Kat" work in a format, which approximated the original printed size of the strips. In 2012, IDW began issuing a three-volume "Baron Bean" reprinting, and Fantagraphics will release "George Herriman's Stumble Inn". Fantagraphics has also announced plans to collect the complete "Krazy Kat" dailies at an unspecified time.

Biscayne National Park

Biscayne National Park is an American <a href="national%20park">national park</a> in southern <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, south of <a href="Miami">Miami</a>. The park preserves <a href="Biscayne%20Bay">Biscayne Bay</a> and its offshore barrier reefs. Ninety-five percent of the park is water, and the shore of the bay is the location of an extensive <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> forest. The park covers and includes <a href="Elliott%20Key">Elliott Key</a>, the park's largest island and first of the true <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>, formed from fossilized <a href="coral">coral</a> reef. The islands farther north in the park are transitional islands of coral and sand. The offshore portion of the park includes the northernmost region of the <a href="Florida%20Reef">Florida Reef</a>, one of the largest coral reefs in the world.

Biscayne National Park protects four distinct ecosystems: the shoreline mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps of the mainland and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and <a href="West%20Indian%20manatee">manatees</a>. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for <a href="endangered%20sea%20turtles">endangered sea turtles</a>. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">endangered species</a> including <a href="Papilio%20aristodemus">Schaus' swallowtail butterflies</a>, <a href="smalltooth%20sawfish">smalltooth sawfish</a>, manatees, and <a href="Green%20sea%20turtle">green</a> and <a href="Hawksbill%20sea%20turtle">hawksbill</a> sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened <a href="American%20crocodile">American crocodile</a>s and a few <a href="American%20alligator">American alligator</a>s.

The people of the <a href="Glades%20culture">Glades culture</a> inhabited the Biscayne Bay region as early as 10,000 years ago before rising sea levels filled the bay. The <a href="Tequesta">Tequesta</a> people occupied the islands and shoreline from about 4,000 years before the present to the 16th century, when the Spanish took possession of Florida. Reefs claimed ships from Spanish times through the 20th century, with more than 40 documented wrecks within the park's boundaries. While the park's islands were farmed during the 19th and early 20th centuries, their rocky soil and periodic <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>s made agriculture difficult to sustain.

In the early 20th century the islands became secluded destinations for wealthy Miamians who built getaway homes and social clubs. <a href="Mark%20C.%20Honeywell">Mark C. Honeywell</a>'s guesthouse on <a href="Boca%20Chita%20Key">Boca Chita Key</a> that featured a mock lighthouse was the area's most elaborate private retreat. The <a href="Cocolobo%20Cay%20Club">Cocolobo Cay Club</a> was at various times owned by Miami developer <a href="Carl%20G.%20Fisher">Carl G. Fisher</a>, yachtsman <a href="Garfield%20Wood">Garfield Wood</a>, and President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s friend <a href="Bebe%20Rebozo">Bebe Rebozo</a>, and was visited by four United States presidents. The amphibious community of <a href="Stiltsville">Stiltsville</a>, established in the 1930s in the shoals of northern Biscayne Bay, took advantage of its remoteness from land to offer offshore gambling and alcohol during <a href="Prohibition">Prohibition</a>. After the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a> of 1959, the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> and Cuban exile groups used Elliott Key as a training ground for infiltrators into <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a>'s <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>.

Originally proposed for inclusion in <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a>, Biscayne Bay was removed from the proposed park to ensure Everglades' establishment. The area remained undeveloped until the 1960s, when a series of proposals were made to develop the keys in the manner of <a href="Miami%20Beach">Miami Beach</a>, and to construct a deepwater seaport for bulk cargo, along with refinery and petrochemical facilities on the mainland shore of Biscayne Bay. Through the 1960s and 1970s, two fossil-fueled power plants and two nuclear power plants were built on the bay shores. A backlash against development led to the 1968 designation of Biscayne National Monument. The preserved area was expanded by its 1980 re-designation as Biscayne National Park. The park is heavily used by boaters, and apart from the park's visitor center on the mainland, its land and sea areas are accessible only by boat.

Biscayne National Park comprises in <a href="Miami-Dade%20County">Miami-Dade County</a> in southeast Florida. Extending from just south of <a href="Key%20Biscayne">Key Biscayne</a> southward to just north of <a href="Key%20Largo">Key Largo</a>, the park includes <a href="Soldier%20Key">Soldier Key</a>, the <a href="Ragged%20Keys">Ragged Keys</a>, <a href="Sands%20Key">Sands Key</a>, <a href="Elliott%20Key">Elliott Key</a>, <a href="Totten%20Key">Totten Key</a> and <a href="Old%20Rhodes%20Key">Old Rhodes Key</a>, as well as smaller islands that form the northernmost extension of the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>. The <a href="Biscayne%20Bay%23Safety%20Valve">Safety Valve</a>, a wide shallow opening in the island chain, between the Ragged Keys and Key Biscayne just north of the park's boundary, allows <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> water to flow out of the bay after the passage of tropical storms. The park's eastern boundary is the ten-fathom line () of water depth in the Atlantic Ocean on the <a href="Florida%20Reef">Florida Reef</a>. The park's western boundary is a fringe of property on the mainland, extending a few hundred meters inland between <a href="Cutler%20Ridge">Cutler Ridge</a> and Mangrove Point. The only direct mainland access to the park is at the Convoy Point Visitor Center, adjacent to the park headquarters. The southwestern boundary adjoins the <a href="Turkey%20Point%20Nuclear%20Generating%20Station">Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station</a> and its system of cooling canals.

The southern portion of <a href="Biscayne%20Bay">Biscayne Bay</a> extends between Elliott Key and the mainland, transited by the <a href="Intracoastal%20Waterway">Intracoastal Waterway</a>. The park abuts the <a href="Florida%20Keys%20National%20Marine%20Sanctuary">Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary</a> on the east and south sides of the park and <a href="John%20Pennekamp%20Coral%20Reef%20State%20Park">John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park</a> to the south. Only of the park's area are on land, with the offshore keys comprising and mainland mangrove swamps account for the remaining . As an extension of the Everglades ecosystem, much of the park was originally proposed to be included in <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a>, but was excluded to obtain a consensus for the establishment of the Everglades park in 1947.

Biscayne Bay marks the southernmost extent of the Atlantic barrier islands, represented by Key Biscayne, and the northernmost extent of the Florida Keys at Elliott Key. The keys are distinguished from the barrier islands by the coral limestone that extends to the islands' surface under a thin veneer of topsoil, while the barrier islands are dominated by wave-deposited sands that cover most of the limestones. Biscayne Bay lies between low ridges of <a href="Oolite">oolitic</a> Miami Limestone on the west, forming Cutler Ridge, and the coral-based Key Largo Limestone that underlies Elliott Key and the keys to the south. The Miami Limestone was deposited in turbulent lagoon waters. The Key Largo Limestone is a fossilized coral reef formed during the <a href="Sangamonian%20%28stage%29">Sangamonian interglacial period</a> of about 75,000 to 125,000 years ago. The Miami Formation achieved its present form somewhat later, during a glacial period in which fresh water consolidated and cemented the lagoon deposits. The Key Largo Limestone is a coarse stone formed from stony corals, between in thickness. As a consequence of their origins as reefs, the beaches of Elliott Key and Old Rhodes Key are rocky. Significant sandy beaches are found only at Sands Key.

Biscayne Bay is a shallow semi-enclosed lagoon which averages in depth. Both its mainland margins and the keys are covered by mangrove forest. The park includes the southern portion of Biscayne Bay, with areas of thin sediment called "hardbottom", and vegetated seagrass meadows supporting turtlegrass and shoal grass.

As a result of efforts to control water resources in Florida and projects to drain the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The <a href="Comprehensive%20Everglades%20Restoration%20Plan">Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan</a> (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the <a href="Restoration%20of%20the%20Everglades">restoration of historical patterns of water flow</a> into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of water out of the southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.

<a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20Florida">Native Americans</a> were present in lower Florida 10,000 years ago, when ocean levels were low and Biscayne Bay was comparatively empty of water. Water levels rose from about 4000 years ago and inundated the bay. Archeologists believe any traces left by the peoples of that era are now submerged; none now exist on dry lands in the park. The <a href="Cutler%20Fossil%20Site">Cutler Fossil Site</a>, just to the west of the park, has yielded evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000 years before the present. The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500 years before the present, with piles of <a href="conch">conch</a> and <a href="whelk">whelk</a> shells left by the <a href="Glades%20culture">Glades culture</a>. The Glades culture was followed by the <a href="Tequesta">Tequesta</a> people, who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta were a sedentary community that lived on fish and other sea life, with no significant agricultural activity. A site on Sands Key has yielded potsherds, worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000 AD to about 1650, after contact was made with Europeans. Fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park.

<a href="Juan%20Ponce%20de%20Le%C3%B3n">Juan Ponce de León</a> explored the area in 1513, discovering the Florida Keys and encountering the Tequesta on the mainland. Other Spanish explorers arrived later in the 16th century and Florida came under Spanish rule. The Tequesta were resettled by the then-Spanish government in the Florida Keys, and the South Florida mainland was depopulated. Ponce de León referred to the bay as "Chequescha" after its inhabitants, becoming "Tequesta" by the time of Spanish governor <a href="Pedro%20Men%C3%A9ndez%20de%20Avil%C3%A9s">Pedro Menéndez de Avilés</a> later in the century. The present name has been attributed to a shipwrecked <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> sailor known as the "Biscaino" or "Viscayno" who lived in the area for a time, or to a more general allusion to the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>.

Spanish treasure fleets regularly sailed past the Florida Keys and were often caught in hurricanes. There are 44 documented shipwrecks in the park from the 16th through the 20th centuries. At least two 18th-century Spanish ships were wrecked in the park area. The Spanish galleon "Nuestra Senora del Popolo" is believed to have been wrecked in park waters in 1733, though the site has not been found. <a href="HMS%20Fowey%20%281744%29">HMS "Fowey"</a> was wrecked in 1748 in what is now Legare Anchorage, at some distance from the Fowey Rocks. The discovery of the ship in 1975 resulted in a landmark court case that established the wreck as an archaeological site rather than a salvage site. 43 wrecks are included on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in the <a href="Offshore%20Reefs%20Archeological%20District">Offshore Reefs Archeological District</a>, which extends for along the seaward side of the Biscayne National Park keys. During the 18th century, Elliott Key was the reputed base of two different pirates, both called <a href="Black%20Caesar%20%28pirate%29">Black Caesar</a>, commemorated by Caesar's Creek between Elliott and Old Rhodes Key.

The first permanent European settlers in the Miami area did not come until the early 19th century. The first settlements around Biscayne Bay were small farms on Elliott Key growing crops like <a href="key%20lime">key lime</a>s and <a href="pineapple">pineapple</a>s. <a href="John%20James%20Audubon">John James Audubon</a> visited Elliott Key in 1832. Colonel <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> surveyed the area around Biscayne Bay for potential fortification sites in 1849. At the end of the American Civil War in 1865, a number of Confederates passed through the area as they were attempting to escape to <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. Elliott Key was a brief stopping point for <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> during his flight to Cuba. The former United States vice president, Confederate general and Confederate secretary of war spent two nights in Biscayne Bay on his journey. Few people lived in the park area until 1897, when Israel Lafayette Jones, an African-American property manager, bought Porgy Key for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$300 US</a>. The next year Jones bought the adjoining Old Rhodes Key and moved his family there, clearing land to grow limes and pineapples. In 1911 Jones bought Totten Key, which had been used as a pineapple plantation, for a dollar an acre, selling in 1925 for $250,000. Before Israel Jones' death in 1932 the Jones plantations were for a while among the largest lime producers on the Florida east coast.
<a href="Carl%20G.%20Fisher">Carl G. Fisher</a>, who was responsible for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought <a href="Adams%20Key">Adams Key</a>, once known as Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the <a href="Cocolobo%20Cay%20Club">Cocolobo Cay Club</a> in 1922. The two-story club building had ten guest rooms, a dining room, and a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, <a href="Albert%20Fall">Albert Fall</a>, <a href="T.%20Coleman%20du%20Pont">T. Coleman du Pont</a>, <a href="Harvey%20Firestone">Harvey Firestone</a>, <a href="Jack%20Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a>, <a href="Charles%20F.%20Kettering">Charles F. Kettering</a>, <a href="Will%20Rogers">Will Rogers</a> and <a href="Frank%20Seiberling">Frank Seiberling</a>. Israel Jones' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">crash of 1929</a> which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by <a href="Garfield%20Wood">Garfield Wood</a> in 1934. Among the Joneses' clients was avid fisherman <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> and his family. The Joneses also provided the club with fish, lobster and crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker <a href="Bebe%20Rebozo">Bebe Rebozo</a> in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club. Clients guided by the Joneses included then-senators <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>, <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, <a href="Herman%20Talmadge">Herman Talmadge</a> and <a href="George%20Smathers">George Smathers</a> through the 1940s and 1950s.

During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> the future park area was a training ground for Cuban exiles training for missions in <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a>'s Cuba. Elliott Key in particular was used by the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for <a href="Bay%20of%20Pigs%20Invasion">Bay of Pigs invasion</a>. The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built on the key. As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they tried to use the key for a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president <a href="Marcos%20P%C3%A9rez%20Jim%C3%A9nez">Marcos Pérez Jiménez</a> kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.

As modern communities grew in and around Miami, developers looked to southern Dade County for new projects. The undeveloped keys south of Key Biscayne were viewed as prime development territory. Beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted the construction of a causeway to the mainland. One proposal included building a highway linking the Biscayne Bay keys to the <a href="Overseas%20Highway">Overseas Highway</a> at Key Largo and to the developed barrier islands to the north. At the same time, pressure built to accommodate industrial development in South Florida. This led to competing priorities between those who wanted to develop for residential and leisure use and those in favor of industrial and infrastructure development. On December 6, 1960, 12 of the 18 area landowners who favored development voted to create the City of <a href="Islandia%2C%20Florida">Islandia</a> on Elliott Key. The town was incorporated to encourage Dade County to improve access to Elliott Key in particular, which landowners viewed as a potential rival to Miami Beach. The new city lobbied for causeway access and formed a negotiating bloc to attract potential developers.

In 1962 an industrial seaport was proposed for the mainland shores of Biscayne Bay, to be known as SeaDade. SeaDade, supported by billionaire shipping magnate <a href="Daniel%20K.%20Ludwig">Daniel K. Ludwig</a>, would have included an oil refinery. In addition to the physical structures, it would have been necessary to dredge a channel through the bay for large ships to access the refinery. The channel would have also required cutting through the coral reef to get to the deep water. In 1963 <a href="Florida%20Power%20and%20Light">Florida Power and Light</a> (FP&L) announced plans for two new 400-<a href="megawatt">megawatt</a> oil-fired power plants on undeveloped land at Turkey Point.

Many local residents and politicians supported SeaDade because it would have created additional jobs, but a group of early environmentalists thought the costs were too high. They fought against development of the bay and formed the Safe Progress Association. Led by Lloyd Miller, the president of the local chapter of the <a href="Izaak%20Walton%20League">Izaak Walton League</a>, "Miami Herald" reporter Juanita Greene, and Art Marshall, the opponents of industrialization proposed the creation of a national park unit that would protect the reefs, islands and bay. After initial skepticism, the park proposal obtained the support of <a href="Miami%20Herald">Miami Herald</a> editors, as well as Florida Congressman <a href="Dante%20Fascell">Dante Fascell</a> and Florida Governor <a href="Claude%20R.%20Kirk%2C%20Jr.">Claude R. Kirk, Jr.</a>, and were supported by lobbying efforts by sympathetic businessmen including <a href="Herbert%20Hoover%2C%20Jr.">Herbert Hoover, Jr.</a>

One vision of Islandia, supported by land owners, would have connected the northern Florida Keys – from Key Biscayne to Key Largo – with bridges and created new islands using the fill from the SeaDade channel. Although Miami-area politicians and the state of Florida did not support Ludwig's SeaDade plans, Islandia's supporters continued to lobby for development support. In 1968, when it appeared the area was about to become a national monument, Islandia supporters bulldozed a highway six lanes wide down the center of the island, destroying the forest for . Islandia landowners called it Elliott Key Boulevard, but called it "Spite Highway" privately. It was hoped that since there was so much environmental damage, no one would want it for a national monument. Over time in the near-tropical climate, the forest grew back and now the only significant hiking trail on Elliott Key now follows the path of Elliott Key Boulevard.
The oil-fired Turkey Point power stations were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from the discharge of hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. In 1964 FP&L announced plans for two 693 MW nuclear reactors at the site, which were expected to compound the cooling water problem. Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay, the power stations were projected to consume a significant proportion of the bay's waters each day for cooling. After extensive negotiations and litigation with both the state and with Ludwig, who owned lands needed for cooling water canals, a closed-loop canal system was built south of the power plants and the nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s.

Portions of the present park were used for recreation prior to the park's establishment. Homestead Bayfront Park, still operated by Miami-Dade County just south of Convoy Point, established a "blacks-only" segregated beach for African-Americans at the present site of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center. The segregated beach operated through the 1950s into the early 1960s before segregated public facilities were abolished.

The earliest proposals for the protection of Biscayne Bay were part of proposals by Everglades National Park advocate <a href="Ernest%20F.%20Coe">Ernest F. Coe</a>, whose proposed Everglades park boundaries included Biscayne Bay, its keys, interior country including what are now Homestead and <a href="Florida%20City%2C%20Florida">Florida City</a>, and Key Largo. Biscayne Bay, Key Largo and the adjoining inland extensions were cut from Everglades National Park before its establishment in 1947. When proposals to develop Elliott Key surfaced in 1960, Lloyd Miller asked Secretary of the Interior <a href="Stewart%20Udall">Stewart Udall</a> to send a Park Service reconnaissance team to review the Biscayne Bay area for inclusion in the national park system. A favorable report ensued, and with financial help from Herbert Hoover, Jr., political support was solicited, most notably from Congressman Fascell. A area of Elliott Key was by this time a part of the Dade County park system. The 1966 report noted the proposed park contained the best remaining areas of tropical forest in Florida and a rare combination of "terrestrial, marine and amphibious life," as well as significant recreational value. The report found the most significant virtues of the potential park were "the clear, sparkling waters, marine life, and the submerged lands of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Here in shallow water is a veritable wonderland."

President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Public Law 90-606 to create Biscayne National Monument on October 18, 1968. The monument was expanded in 1974 under Public Law 93-477 and expanded again when the monument was redesignated a national park by an act of Congress through Public Law 96-287, effective June 28, 1980. The 1980 expansion extended the park almost to Key Biscayne and included Boca Chita Key, the Ragged Keys and the Safety Valve shoal region, together with the corresponding offshore reefs and a substantial portion of central Biscayne Bay.

The first Islandia property owner to sell land to the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> was Lancelot Jones, together with Katherine Jones, Arthur's widow. They sold their lands for $1,272,500, about a third of the potential development value. Jones was given a life estate on at the age of 70. He visited with park rangers stationed at the former Cocolobo Club, which eventually burned down in 1975. The other life estate in the park was held by Virginia Tannehill, the widow of <a href="Eastern%20Airlines">Eastern Airlines</a> executive Paul Tannehill. Jones' house built by Lancelot, his father and his brother, burned down in 1982. He lived in a two-room shack for the next ten years, riding out hurricanes on Porgy Key, but left his home permanently just before Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The house was destroyed and Jones remained in Miami until his death in 1997 at 99 years.

Deprived of a rationale for existence by the national monument's establishment, Islandia languished. The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County <a href="state%27s%20attorney">state attorney's office</a>, headed by <a href="Janet%20Reno">Janet Reno</a>. In 1990 Reno's office determined after investigation that all of the town's elections were invalid, since the elections were restricted only to landowners, not residents. The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012.

The impact of Hurricane Andrew on neighboring <a href="Homestead%20Air%20Force%20Base">Homestead Air Force Base</a> caused the Air Force to consider closing the base and conveying it to Miami-Dade County, which was interested in using the base for commercial air traffic as an alternative to <a href="Miami%20International%20Airport">Miami International Airport</a>. An environmental impact study concluded the resulting flight paths over the bay, only to the east, would result in degradation of the park. In 1999 The Air Force prohibited major commercial development at Homestead as a result.

The park's popularity as a destination for boaters has led to a high rate of accidents, some of them fatal. The <a href="Columbus%20Day">Columbus Day</a> weekend has been cited as the "most dangerous weekend of the year." An annual boating regatta in its 57th year in 2012 resulted in six deaths between 2002 and 2011, with damage to seabeds from vessel groundings and littering. Although official regatta activities take place outside the park, the area of Elliott Key has become a popular destination for some participants.

A fifth generating unit fueled by natural gas and oil was added to the Turkey Point generating station in 2007. In 2009, Turkey Point was proposed as the site of two new 1117 MW <a href="AP1000">AP1000</a> nuclear reactors, to be designated Turkey Point 6 and 7. If built, the new reactors would make Turkey Point one of the largest generating sites in the United States. Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami-Dade County, a sewage treatment facility on the park boundary at Black Point, and its neighbor, the South Miami-Dade Landfill.

Biscayne National Park operates year-round. Camping is most practical in winter months, when mosquitoes are less troublesome on the keys. Private concessioners provide full day tours in the park that include snorkeling, hiking, paddling and sailing from the park headquarters. Boat excursions to Boca Chita and Adams Key are also available.

Access to the park from the mainland is limited to the immediate vicinity of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point. All other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. Activities include boating, fishing, <a href="kayaking">kayaking</a>, <a href="windsurfing">windsurfing</a>, <a href="snorkeling">snorkeling</a> and <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a>. Miami-Dade County operates four marina parks near the park. Homestead Bayfront Park is directly adjacent to the park headquarters at Convoy Point. Farther south Black Point Park provides access to Adams and Elliott Keys. Matheson Hammock Park is near the north end of the park, and Crandon Park is on Key Biscayne.

Although it is a federally designated park, fishing within Biscayne is governed by the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, <a href="spiny%20lobster">spiny lobster</a>, <a href="Florida%20stone%20crab">stone crab</a>, <a href="Callinectes%20sapidus">blue crab</a> and shrimp. Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, sea urchins and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. Additionally, lobstering is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary, administered by the state of Florida to protect spiny lobster breeding areas, which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay.

A private concessioner provides tours from the Park headquarters into the bay and to the keys. Most tours are operated during the peak winter season from January to April. <a href="Personal%20watercraft">Personal watercraft</a> are prohibited in Biscayne and most other national parks, but other private powerboats and sailboats are permitted.

Most of Biscayne's permanent facilities are on the offshore keys. A seasonally staffed ranger station is on Elliott Key, as well as a campground and 36 boat slips. A single loop trail runs from the harbor to the oceanfront, and a path following the Spite Highway runs the length of the island. Adams Key is a day-use-only area for visitors, although two Park Service residences are on the island. Boca Chita Key is the most-visited island, with a campground and picnic areas. The Boca Chita Lighthouse is occasionally open to visitors when staffing permits.

Snorkeling and scuba diving on the offshore reefs are popular activities. The reefs have been the cause of many shipwrecks. A selection of wrecks have been the subjects of ranger-led snorkeling tours and have been organized as the Maritime Heritage Trail, the only underwater archaeological trail in the National Park Service system. The wrecks of the "<a href="SS%20Arratoon%20Apcar">Arratoon Apcar</a>" (sank 1878), "Erl King" (1891), "Alicia" (1905), "Lugano" (1913) and "Mandalay" (1966) are on the trail together with an unknown wreck from the 1800s and the Fowey Rocks Lighthouse. The "Alicia", "Erl King" and "Lugano" are relatively deep wrecks, best suited for scuba dives. The "Mandalay" is at a shallower depth and is especially popular for snorkeling.

Although most of Biscayne National Park's area is water, the islands have a number of protected historical structures and districts. Shipwrecks are also protected within the park, and the park's offshore waters are a protected historic district.

<a href="Stiltsville">Stiltsville</a> was established by Eddie "Crawfish" Walker in the 1930s as a small community of shacks built on pilings in a shallow section of Biscayne Bay, not far from Key Biscayne. Comprising 27 structures at its height in the 1960s, Stiltsville lost shacks to fires and hurricanes, with only seven surviving in 2012, none of them dating to the 1960s or earlier. The site was incorporated into Biscayne National Park in 1985, when the Park Service agreed to honor existing leases until July 1, 1999. Hurricane Andrew destroyed most of Stiltsville in 1992. The Park Service has undertaken to preserve the community, which is now unoccupied. The community is to be administered by a trust and used as accommodation for overnight camping, educational facilities and researchers.

Biscayne National Park includes a number of navigational aids, as well as an ornamental structure built to resemble a lighthouse. The <a href="Fowey%20Rocks%20Light">Fowey Rocks Light</a> is a skeleton-frame cast iron structure built in 1878. Already included within the boundaries of the park, the light was acquired by the Park Service on October 2, 2012. The unmanned <a href="Unmanned%20reef%20lights%20of%20the%20Florida%20Keys%23Pacific%20Reef%20Light">Pacific Reef Light</a> is about three miles (5 km) offshore from Elliott Key. The original 1921 structure was replaced in 2000 and its lantern was placed on display in a park in <a href="Islamorada%2C%20Florida">Islamorada</a>.

Industrialist <a href="Mark%20C.%20Honeywell">Mark C. Honeywell</a> was a Cocolobo Club member who bought <a href="Boca%20Chita%20Key">Boca Chita Key</a> in 1937, expanding the facilities to include a small lighthouse. Boca Chita Key was developed with several structures including an imitation lighthouse, built using coral rock and topped with a wire cage resembling a lighthouse lantern, and the end of a jetty on the north side of the key. The key was owned by Honeywell until 1945. Mark and Olive Honeywell also built a chapel, a guesthouse, seawalls and utility buildings on the island.

The Boca Chita Key structures are administered as a cultural landscape, interpreting the area's use as a retreat for the rich. More modest homesteads include the now-abandoned plantations developed by Israel Jones and his sons, and the <a href="Sweeting%20Homestead">Sweeting Homestead</a> on Elliott Key. The frame structures associated with these plantations, together with those of the Cocolobo Cay Club and frame buildings on Boca Chita Key, have been destroyed by fire and hurricanes.

South Florida is a transitional zone between the <a href="Nearctic%20ecozone">Nearctic</a> and <a href="Neotropical%20ecozone">Neotropical</a> <a href="Terrestrial%20ecozone">ecozones</a>, resulting in a wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in.

Hundreds of species of fish are present in park waters, including more than fifty crustacean species ranging from <a href="isopod">isopod</a>s to <a href="Cardisoma%20guanhumi">giant blue land crabs</a>, about two hundred species of birds and about 27 mammal species, both terrestrial and marine. <a href="Mollusc">Mollusc</a>s include a variety of <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s, terrestrial and marine snails, <a href="sea%20hare">sea hare</a>s, <a href="sea%20slug">sea slug</a>s and two <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, the <a href="Caribbean%20reef%20octopus">Caribbean reef octopus</a> and the <a href="Caribbean%20reef%20squid">Caribbean reef squid</a>.

The sheltered open waters of the bay and the outlying chain of keys provide resting areas for migrating birds on their way between North American, the Caribbean islands, and South America. Many southbound land birds stop in the fall at <a href="Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park">Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park</a>, just north of the park on Key Biscayne, before venturing across the open waters of Biscayne Bay. Northbound spring migrants do likewise on Elliott Key. Most of the small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> migrants are warblers, with <a href="ovenbird">ovenbird</a>s, <a href="palm%20warbler">palm warbler</a>s, <a href="American%20redstart">American redstart</a>s, <a href="common%20yellowthroat">common yellowthroat</a>s, <a href="prairie%20warbler">prairie warbler</a>s, <a href="worm-eating%20warbler">worm-eating warbler</a>s and <a href="black-throated%20blue%20warbler">black-throated blue warbler</a>s accounting for the majority. Migrant raptors include <a href="short-tailed%20hawk">short-tailed hawk</a>s, <a href="sharp-shinned%20hawk">sharp-shinned hawk</a>s, <a href="Merlin%20%28bird%29">merlins</a>, <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s and <a href="swallow-tailed%20kite">swallow-tailed kite</a>s, while <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s and <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s nest in the park. Both <a href="White-tailed%20tropicbird">white-tailed</a> and <a href="red-tailed%20tropicbird">red-tailed</a> tropicbirds are seen in the park, as are <a href="American%20flamingos">American flamingos</a>, with some of the latter probably escaped captive birds.

The mainland shorelines are dominated by a marshy transitional zone chiefly populated by <a href="Rhizophora%20mangle">red mangrove</a> and <a href="Avicennia%20germinans">black mangrove</a> growing from the shallow water, with <a href="Laguncularia%20racemosa">white mangrove</a> growing farther back from the water's edge. The trees' aerial root structure provides a sheltered habitat for crabs, fish and wading birds. The brown waters within the mangrove thickets are nurseries for fish, mollusc and crustacean larvae that require a quiet sheltered environment before the immature animals can disperse into open waters. Mangroves shed leaves at about per year, providing food for fish, worms and crustaceans. Because the carbon in the leaves is sequestered by incorporation into animals, the mangrove swamp is estimated to have two to three times the ability to sequester carbon of terrestrial forests. The mangrove forest on Biscayne Bay is the longest on Florida's east coast. Shoreline and island mangrove swamps, together with the bay, represent a significant nursery for the marine life of southeast Florida.
The salt-tolerant mangrove margin has expanded inland as freshwater flow into the bay has been <a href="river%20engineering%23Channelization">channelized</a>, replacing freshwater <a href="Cladium">sawgrass</a> marshes. The L-31E coastal storm surge <a href="levee">levee</a> inland of the park's western boundary has played a significant role in isolating former freshwater marshlands from their water sources. At the same time, tidal water does not reach the interior of the coastal margin, limiting interchange between salt and freshwater ecosystems.

Bird life on the shoreline includes <a href="yellow-crowned%20night%20heron">yellow-crowned night heron</a>s, <a href="loggerhead%20shrike">loggerhead shrike</a>s, prairie warblers and shorebirds. <a href="Mangrove%20cuckoo">Mangrove cuckoo</a>s, a notoriously difficult-to-observe species, may be seen at Convoy Point and Black Point. Biscayne has one of the largest populations of mangrove cuckoos in Florida.

The park's margins are habitat for the threatened <a href="American%20crocodile">American crocodile</a>. The construction of miles of cooling water canals in the <a href="marl">marl</a> lands close to the shore behind the Turkey Point power plant, and the canals' warm waters, have provided a nearly ideal environment for crocodile nesting, making the power plant a nursery for many of those living in the park. Although crocodiles and <a href="American%20alligator">American alligator</a>s both occur in extreme southern Florida, alligators are uncommon in Biscayne, since alligators mainly inhabit fresh waters found farther inland, while crocodiles can live in Biscayne's somewhat saltier estuarine waters.

The open waters are inhabited by fishes, molluscs and crustaceans living on sea grasses or who prey on each other. The shallowness of the lagoon makes it suitable habitat for diving birds such as <a href="anhinga">anhinga</a>, cormorants and diving ducks. The bay also provides habitat for juvenile sea animals that have left the shelter of the mangrove belts. <a href="West%20Indian%20manatee">Manatees</a> frequent the quiet waters of the bay. The bay has a year-round population of <a href="double-crested%20cormorant">double-crested cormorant</a>s. Winter residents include <a href="northern%20gannet">northern gannet</a>s, <a href="American%20white%20pelican">American white pelican</a>s and <a href="common%20loon">common loon</a>s. The bay also has a resident population of <a href="common%20bottlenose%20dolphin">common bottlenose dolphin</a>s.

Biscayne Bay is a shallow lagoon with little vertical density or salinity gradient due to its lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals on the west side and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as <a href="red%20drum">red drum</a>. Biscayne Bay and <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a> are major nurseries for <a href="red%20grouper">red grouper</a> and <a href="gray%20snapper">gray snapper</a>. The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: <a href="Thalassia%20testudinum">turtlegrass</a>, <a href="shoal%20grass">shoal grass</a> and <a href="Syringodium%20filiforme">manatee grass</a>. The endangered <a href="Halophila%20johnsonii">Johnson's seagrass</a> is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is at the southern end of the grass's range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses. Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years. The bay is also affected by commercial shrimp trawling, which is permitted in park waters. The passage of roller-frame trawl nets does not harm grasses, but damages soft corals and sponges.

Elliott Key is the largest island in the park, measuring and about long by wide. Next largest is Old Rhodes Key at , then Sands Key , Totten Key and Little Totten Key at , with 37 smaller islands arranged in a north-south line east of the mainland shoreline. The keys shift from barrier islands with rocky cores in the north to coral rock platforms in the south. All are fringed with mangroves, with subtropical vegetation and hardwood forests in the interiors, including <a href="gumbo%20limbo">gumbo limbo</a>, <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a>, <a href="ironwood">ironwood</a>, <a href="Amyris%20elemifera">torchwood</a> and <a href="Chrysophyllum%20oliviforme">satinleaf</a>. Insects include <a href="Schaus%27%20swallowtail">Schaus' swallowtail</a>, an endangered species, as well as dense clouds of mosquitoes in the wet season, preyed upon by dragonflies. <a href="Marsh%20rabbit">Marsh rabbit</a>s and <a href="raccoons">raccoons</a>, together with mice and rats comprise the primary mammalian species. Reptiles include <a href="rattlesnake">rattlesnake</a>s and a variety of lizards, as well as an occasional crocodile.

The keys are a transitional area capable of hosting unexpected birds, often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland. The interior of the keys are frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them. Coastal zones are habitat for <a href="ruddy%20turnstone">ruddy turnstone</a>s and <a href="least%20sandpiper">least sandpiper</a>s. Gulls and terns include <a href="royal%20tern">royal tern</a>s, <a href="laughing%20gull">laughing gull</a>s and <a href="ring-billed%20gull">ring-billed gull</a>s, with <a href="brown%20pelican">brown pelican</a>s just offshore. <a href="Wilson%27s%20plover">Wilson's plover</a>s nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting zones are closed during breeding season.
Sea turtles nest on island beaches in the park. Park staff actively assist turtle nesting by removing debris from beaches that might pose an obstacle to adults and hatchlings. <a href="Loggerhead%20turtle">Loggerhead turtle</a>s are the most common sea turtle species and account for nearly all of the turtle nests in the park. Nest sites are identified by daily morning beach patrols and are protected with mesh screen against the predation by abundant raccoon population. Nest protection efforts have reduced predation from 100% of nests disturbed per year to no disturbed nests in 2007, with a more usual average of more than 50% nest disturbance in most years. In 2012 one undisturbed nest was found and protected, five partially disturbed nests were protected, and one nest was destroyed by predators. The threatened <a href="eastern%20indigo%20snake">eastern indigo snake</a> is also present on the island.

Rare and endangered plant species on the islands include <a href="Pseudophoenix%20sargentii">Sargent's cherry palm</a> and the semaphore prickly-pear cactus ("<a href="Consolea%20corallicola">Consolea corallicola</a>"). The cactus, which has been described as "near extinction", has been reduced to about 20 individuals. A <a href="Clonal%20colony">colonial</a> population of 570 cacti were found on one island in Biscayne Bay in 2001, making it the largest known population of semaphore prickly-pear cactus in the world. The only natural population of Sargent's palm grows on Elliott Key. Fewer than 50 grew on the key in 1991. Despite efforts to propagate the plant, there are now 16 Sargent's palms on Elliott Key, with about 123 propagated on Long Key.

Two critically endangered butterflies, <a href="Papilio%20aristodemus">Schaus' swallowtail</a> ("Papilio aristodemus") and the <a href="Miami%20blue">Miami blue</a>, are found in the park, mostly on Elliott Key. In 2012 the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (USFWS) authorized a capture and captive breeding program for Schaus' swallowtail after only five of the butterflies were found by surveyors in the park, down from 35 in 2011, of a total surveyed Florida population of 41. The Miami blue was feared to be extinct after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, but a population was found in 1999 at <a href="Bahia%20Honda%20Key">Bahia Honda Key</a>. Captive breeding produced 25,000 Miami blues, some of which have been released on Elliott Key with mixed results.

Beyond the keys in the Atlantic Ocean the seafloor slopes gradually down before rising in an almost continuous coral reef. The reef, composed of living <a href="coral">coral</a>s, is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish, as well as molluscs, crustaceans and worms. Every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations. Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half the area of the park, with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank-barrier reef. Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals, <a href="sea%20anemone">sea anemone</a>s and <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s are found in bay and offshore waters. The coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into the outer reef on the edge of the Florida carbonate platform, the patch reefs between the outer reef and the keys, and the reefs in the shoals on either side of the keys. The offshore reefs are dominated by <a href="elkhorn%20coral">elkhorn coral</a> to water depth, and <a href="staghorn%20coral">staghorn coral</a> below 10 meters. The landward patch reefs are principally composed of <a href="Montastraea%20annularis">boulder star coral</a> and <a href="Diploria%20strigosa">symmetrical brain coral</a>. The island shoal reefs mainly consist of <a href="Siderastrea%20radians">lesser starlet coral</a> and "<a href="Porites">Porites</a>" finger corals.

Reef environments in Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species richness and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007. A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract and the decline in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. <a href="algae">Algal</a> cover has increased as coral has declined, so coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while <a href="polychlorinated%20biphenyl">polychlorinated biphenyl</a> and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.

The park's eastern boundary lies just beyond the rise of the offshore reef at ten-fathom () sea depth. Areas farther offshore are protected within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which extends eastward to a boundary corresponding to a depth of . The offshore waters harbor brown pelicans, <a href="magnificent%20frigatebird">magnificent frigatebird</a>s, <a href="brown%20booby">brown boobies</a>, particularly around the offshore lights, and pelagic birds such as <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s and <a href="petrel">petrel</a>s. <a href="Whale">Whale</a>s in offshore waters are rare, but can include <a href="North%20Atlantic%20right%20whale">right whales</a>, <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a>s, <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm whale</a>s, <a href="fin%20whale">fin whale</a>s and <a href="sei%20whale">sei whale</a>s, all of them endangered. The <a href="smalltooth%20sawfish">smalltooth sawfish</a> is similarly rare in park waters and endangered. Threatened coral species include elkhorn and staghorn corals, as well as <a href="pillar%20coral">pillar coral</a>, listed as endangered in Florida.

More than 50 species of exotic plant have been documented in the park, with almost 20 of those considered to be pest species which may displace native plants and possibly alter the ecological balance. <a href="Green%20iguana">Green iguana</a>s, <a href="cane%20toad">cane toad</a>s, <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a>s, <a href="lionfish">lionfish</a>, <a href="fire%20ant">fire ant</a>s, <a href="Oscar%20%28fish%29">oscars</a> and <a href="brown%20basilisk">brown basilisk</a> lizards are common in the park. The lionfish ("Pterois volitans" and "Pterois miles") is a tropical fish from the Indian-Pacific Ocean area. It is known for its voracious appetite and its ability to establish itself in new waters, rapidly replacing other species. Researchers theorized the introduction of this species in the park occurred during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Sightings in Biscayne Bay at that time were believed to have been from home aquariums destroyed during the hurricane, though the researcher who first proposed the theory has since retracted the assertion. More recent lionfish sightings are probably from more established populations in the Florida Keys to the south of the park. Also likely originating from human captivity, <a href="Burmese%20python">Burmese python</a>s have been observed near the park's boundary along the mainland. Exotic plant species which pose the highest risk to native plant communities include <a href="Schinus%20terebinthifolius">Brazilian-pepper</a>, <a href="Panicum%20repens">torpedo grass</a>, <a href="Nephrolepis%20cordifolia">tuberous sword fern</a>, <a href="Psidium%20guajava">guava</a> and <a href="Thespesia%20populnea">portiatree</a>.

Biscayne's tropical climate reflects its location in extreme South Florida. Southern Miami-Dade County is classified as <a href="tropical%20savanna">tropical savanna</a> in the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen-Geiger</a> system. Seasons may be divided into the November–April dry season and the May–October wet season. Dry season temperatures average between with an average monthly rainfall of . Wet season temperatures average between with an average monthly rainfall of . The wet season roughly coincides with <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">hurricane season</a>, with frequent thunderstorms.

Like many locations in southern Florida, Biscayne National Park is affected by hurricanes every few years. Most storms require temporary closings and occasional repairs to park facilities. A direct hit by a powerful hurricane can produce severe consequences, primarily by its impact on human interventions in the environment rather than on the natural environment of the park, which is well-adapted to these events. Significant hurricanes to strike Biscayne include storms in 1835 and 1904, the <a href="1906%20Florida%20Keys%20hurricane">1906 Florida Keys hurricane</a>, the <a href="1926%20Miami%20hurricane">1926 Miami hurricane</a>, the <a href="1929%20Bahamas%20hurricane">1929 Bahamas hurricane</a>, the <a href="1935%20Labor%20Day%20hurricane">1935 Labor Day hurricane</a>, the <a href="1935%20Yankee%20hurricane">1935 Yankee hurricane</a>, the <a href="1941%20Florida%20hurricane">1941 Florida hurricane</a>, the <a href="1945%20Southeast%20Florida%20hurricane">1945 Southeast Florida hurricane</a>, the <a href="1948%20Miami%20hurricane">1948 Miami hurricane</a>, <a href="Hurricane%20King">Hurricane King</a> in 1950, <a href="Hurricane%20Donna">Hurricane Donna</a> in 1960. <a href="Hurricane%20Cleo">Hurricane Cleo</a> in 1964, and <a href="Hurricane%20Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a> in 1992. The park can be affected by wave action from more distant tropical storms such as 2012's <a href="Hurricane%20Sandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, which damaged facilities on Elliott Key.
On August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew came ashore just south of Miami, passing directly across Biscayne National Park with maximum sustained winds of , with gusts to . The storm surge was up to above mean sea level. It was a compact <a href="Category%205%20hurricane%23Category%205">Category 5</a> hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Biscayne Bay was affected by bottom scouring and turbidity and with damage to its fringes of mangrove forest. Leakage from damaged boats and marinas polluted the bay with fuel, with discharges continuing for nearly a month after the hurricane's passage. A commemorative plaque was placed at the Dante Fascell Visitor Center in 2002 to commemorate the human and environmental cost of Andrew, and to celebrate the area's recovery from the storm's effects. The inscription reads in part:

On Monday, August 24, 1992, at 4:30 a.m., the eye wall of Hurricane Andrew
passed over this point before striking Homestead and southern Miami-Dade County.

The Fowey Rocks light station transmitted weather data with winds peaking at a two-minute wind speed of and a gust to before the station ceased transmitting, presumably due to damage from stronger gusts. The strongest part of the eyewall had not reached Fowey Rocks when it stopped transmitting.

Since all park lands are no more than a few feet above sea level, they are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Park Service studies project that much of the park's land area will be lost in the next two hundred years. Sea level in Biscayne Bay is projected to rise between by 2030, and by 2060. A sea level rise of is projected to increase saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne Aquifer. Higher rises will make the southern Everglades a saltwater marsh, altering the ecology of the region.

Glorious First of June

The Glorious First of June (also known in France as the ' or ') of 1794 was the first and largest <a href="fleet%20action">fleet action</a> of the naval conflict between the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a> and the <a href="First%20French%20Republic">First French Republic</a> during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>.

The action was the culmination of a <a href="May%201794%20Atlantic%20campaign">campaign</a> that had criss-crossed the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> over the previous month in which both sides had captured numerous merchant ships and minor warships and had engaged in two partial, but inconclusive, fleet actions. The <a href="British%20Channel%20Fleet">British Channel Fleet</a> under Admiral <a href="Richard%20Howe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Howe">Lord Howe</a> attempted to prevent the passage of a vital French <a href="Cereal">grain</a> <a href="convoy">convoy</a> from the United States, which was protected by the <a href="French%20Navy">French Atlantic Fleet</a>, commanded by Rear-Admiral <a href="Louis%20Thomas%20Villaret%20de%20Joyeuse">Villaret-Joyeuse</a>. The two forces clashed in the Atlantic Ocean, some west of the French island of <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a> on 1 June 1794.

During the battle, Howe defied naval convention by ordering his fleet to turn towards the French and for each of his vessels to <a href="raking%20fire">rake</a> and engage their immediate opponent. This unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains, and as a result his attack was more piecemeal than he intended. Nevertheless, his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered; in no condition for further combat, Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his <a href="ships%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a>, Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe's fleet, securing a strategic success. However, he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port, leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of <a href="blockade">blockade</a> for the remainder of the war. In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies.

The Glorious First of June demonstrated a number of the major problems inherent in the French and British navies at the start of the Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.

Since early 1792 France had been at war with four of its neighbours on two fronts, battling <a href="Habsburg%20Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a> in the <a href="Austrian%20Netherlands">Austrian Netherlands</a>, and the Austrians and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sardinia">Piedmontese</a> in Italy. On 2 January 1793, almost one year into the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20War">French Revolutionary War</a>, republican-held forts at <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> in Brittany fired on the British <a href="brig">brig</a> HMS "Childers". A few weeks later, following the execution of the imprisoned <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">King Louis XVI</a>, diplomatic ties between Britain and France were broken. On 1 February France declared war on both Britain and the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>.

Protected from immediate invasion by the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, Britain prepared for an extensive naval campaign and dispatched troops to the Netherlands for service against the French. Throughout the remainder of 1793, the British and French navies undertook minor operations in Northern waters, the Mediterranean and the <a href="Caribbean">West</a> and <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>, where both nations maintained <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">colonies</a>. The closest the Channel Fleet had come to an engagement was when it had narrowly missed intercepting the French convoy from the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, escorted by 15 ships of the line on 2 August. The only major clash was the <a href="Siege%20of%20Toulon">Siege of Toulon</a>, a confused and bloody affair in which the British force holding the town—alongside <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sardinia">Sardinian</a>, Austrian and French Royalist troops—had to be evacuated by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> to prevent its imminent defeat at the hands of the French Republican army. The aftermath of this siege was punctuated by recriminations and accusations of cowardice and betrayal among the allies, eventually resulting in Spain switching allegiance with the signing of the <a href="Second%20Treaty%20of%20San%20Ildefonso">Treaty of San Ildefonso</a> two years later. Nevertheless, the siege produced one major success: <a href="William%20Sidney%20Smith">Sir Sidney Smith</a>, with parties of sailors from the retreating British fleet, accomplished the destruction of substantial French naval stores and shipping in <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a>. More might have been achieved had the Spanish raiding parties that accompanied Smith not been issued with secret orders to stall the destruction of the French fleet.

The situation in Europe remained volatile into 1794. Off Northern France, the French Atlantic Fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay. In consequence, the French Navy officer corps suffered greatly from the effects of the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a>, with many experienced sailors being executed, imprisoned or dismissed from the service for perceived disloyalty. The shortage of provisions was more than a navy problem though; France itself was starving because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a harsh winter to ruin the harvest. By this time at war with all her neighbours, France had nowhere to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions. Eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the <a href="National%20Convention">National Convention</a>: food produced in France's overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, and augmented with food and goods purchased from the United States. During April and May 1794, the merchantmen would convoy the supplies across the Atlantic to Brest, protected by elements of the French Atlantic Fleet.

The navies of Britain and France in 1794 were at very different stages of development. Although the British fleet was numerically superior, the French ships were larger and stronger, and carried a heavier weight of shot. The largest French ships were three-decker <a href="first%20rates">first rates</a>, carrying 110 or 120 guns, against 100 guns on the largest British vessels.

Since the <a href="Nootka%20Crisis">Spanish Armament</a> of 1790, the Royal Navy had been at sea in a state of readiness for over three years. The Navy's dockyards under <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="Charles%20Middleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Barham">Charles Middleton</a> were all fully fitted and prepared for conflict. This was quite unlike the disasters of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> ten years earlier, when an ill-prepared Royal Navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the North American campaign—which ended in defeat at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">Battle of Yorktown</a> due to lack of supplies. With British dockyards now readily turning out cannon, shot, sails, provisions and other essential equipment, the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the Navy list.

Unfortunately for the British, gathering sufficient manpower was difficult and never satisfactorily accomplished throughout the entire war. The shortage of seamen was such that <a href="press%20gangs">press gangs</a> were forced to take thousands of men with no experience on the sea, meaning that training and preparing them for naval life would take quite some time. The lack of <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> was even more urgent, and soldiers from the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> were drafted into the fleet for service at sea. Men of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Royal%20Regiment">2nd. Regiment of Foot - The Queen's (Royal West Surrey Regiment)</a> and the <a href="29th%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">29th Regiment of Foot</a> served aboard Royal Navy ships during the campaign; their descendant regiments still maintain the <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a> "1 June 1794".

Despite these difficulties, the Channel Fleet was possessed of one of the best naval commanders of the age; its commander-in-chief, <a href="Richard%20Howe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Howe">Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe</a>, had learned his trade under <a href="Edward%20Hawke">Sir Edward Hawke</a> and fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Quiberon%20Bay">Battle of Quiberon Bay</a> in 1759. In the spring of 1794, with the French convoy's arrival in European waters imminent, Howe had dispersed his fleet in three groups. <a href="George%20Montagu%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">George Montagu</a>, in <a href="HMS%20Hector">HMS "Hector"</a>, was sent with six ships of the line and two frigates to guard British convoys to the East Indies, West Indies and <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> as far as <a href="Cape%20Finisterre">Cape Finisterre</a>. <a href="Peter%20Rainier%2C%20junior">Peter Rainier</a>, in <a href="HMS%20Suffolk%20%281765%29">HMS "Suffolk</a> and commanding six other ships, was to escort the convoys for the rest of their passage. The third force consisted of 26 ships of the line, with several supporting vessels, under Howe's direct command. They were to patrol the Bay of Biscay for the arriving French.

In contrast to their British counterparts, the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> was in a state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the <a href="French%20Revolution">Revolution</a> five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.

The manpower problem was compounded by the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation, with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times. In August 1793, these problems came to a head in the fleet off Brest, when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors. The crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food, leaving the French coast undefended. The <a href="National%20Convention">National Convention</a> responded instantly by executing a swathe of senior officers and ship's non-commissioned officers. Hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned, banished or dismissed from naval service. The effect of this purge was devastating, seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel. In their places were promoted junior officers, merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal, although few of them knew how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea.

The newly appointed commander of this troubled fleet was <a href="Villaret%20de%20Joyeuse">Villaret de Joyeuse</a>; although formerly in a junior position, he was known to possess a high degree of tactical ability; he had trained under Admiral <a href="Pierre%20Andr%C3%A9%20de%20Suffren">Pierre André de Suffren</a> in the Indian Ocean during the American war. However, Villaret's attempts to mould his new officer corps into an effective fighting unit were hampered by another new appointee, a deputy of the National Convention named <a href="Jean-Bon%20Saint-Andr%C3%A9">Jean-Bon Saint-André</a>. Saint-André's job was to report directly to the National Convention on the revolutionary ardour of both the fleet and its admiral. He frequently intervened in strategic planning and tactical operations. Shortly after his arrival, Saint-André proposed issuing a decree ordering that any officer deemed to have shown insufficient zeal in defending his ship in action should be put to death on his return to France, although this highly controversial legislation does not appear to have ever been acted upon. Although his interference was a source of frustration for Villaret, Saint-André's dispatches to Paris were published regularly in "<a href="Le%20Moniteur%20Universel">Le Moniteur</a>", and did much to popularise the Navy in France.

The French Atlantic fleet was even more dispersed than the British in the spring of 1794: Rear-Admiral <a href="Pierre%20Vanstabel">Pierre Vanstabel</a> had been dispatched, with five ships including two of the line, to meet the much-needed French grain convoy off the American eastern seaboard. Rear-Admiral <a href="Joseph-Marie%20Nielly">Joseph-Marie Nielly</a> had sailed from <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a> with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to rendezvous with the convoy in the mid-Atlantic. This left Villaret with 25 ships of the line at Brest to meet the threat posed by the British fleet under Lord Howe.

By early spring of 1794, the situation in France was dire. With famine looming after the failure of the harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for sustenance. Turning to France's colonies in the Americas, and the agricultural bounty of the United States, the National Convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a> in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, where Admiral Vanstabel would wait for them. According to contemporary historian <a href="William%20James%20%28naval%20historian%29">William James</a> this conglomeration of ships was said to be over 350 strong, although he disputes this figure, citing the number as 117 (in addition to the French warships).

The convoy had also been augmented by the United States government, in both cargo and shipping, as repayment for French financial, moral and military support during the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>. In supporting the French Revolution in this way, the American government, urged especially by Ambassador <a href="Gouverneur%20Morris">Gouverneur Morris</a>, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France. Friendly relations between the United States and France did not long survive the <a href="Jay%20Treaty">Jay Treaty</a> which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the <a href="Quasi%20War">Quasi War</a>.

The French convoy, escorted by Vanstabel, departed America from <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> on 2 April, and Howe sailed from <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> on 2 May, taking his entire fleet to both escort British convoys to the <a href="Western%20Approaches">Western Approaches</a> and intercept the French. Checking that Villaret was still in <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, Howe spent two weeks searching the Bay of Biscay for the grain convoy, returning to Brest on 18 May to discover that Villaret had sailed the previous day. Returning to sea in search of his opponent, Howe pursued Villaret deep into the Atlantic. Also at sea during this period were the squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British), both of whom had met with some success; Nielly had captured a number of British merchant ships and Montagu had taken several back. Nielly was the first to encounter the grain convoy, deep in the Atlantic in the second week of May. He took it under escort as it moved closer to Europe, while Montagu was searching fruitlessly to the south.

Despite Howe's pursuit, the main French sortie found initial success, running into a Dutch convoy and taking 20 ships from it on Villaret's first day at sea. For the next week Howe continued to follow the French, seizing and burning a trail of French-held Dutch ships and enemy corvettes. On 25 May Howe spotted a straggler from Villaret's fleet and gave chase; <a href="French%20ship%20Audacieux%20%281784%29">"Audacieux"</a> led Howe straight to his opponent's location. Having finally found Villaret, on 28 May Howe attacked, using a flying squadron of his fastest ships to cut off its rearmost vessel <a href="French%20ship%20Bretagne%20%281766%29">"Révolutionnaire"</a>. This <a href="first%20rate">first rate</a> was at various times engaged with six British ships and took heavy damage, possibly striking her colours late in the action. As darkness fell the British and French fleets separated, leaving "Révolutionnaire" and her final enemy, <a href="HMS%20Audacious%20%281785%29">HMS "Audacious"</a>, still locked in combat behind them. These two ships parted company during the night and eventually returned to their respective home ports. By this stage Villaret knew through his patrolling frigates that the grain convoy was close, and deliberately took his fleet to the west, hoping to decoy Howe away from the vital convoy.

Taking the bait, the following day Howe attacked again, but his attempt to split the French fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship, <a href="HMS%20Caesar%20%281793%29">HMS "Caesar"</a>, failed to follow orders. Much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive, and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue. Howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the <a href="weather%20gage">weather gage</a>, enabling him to further attack Villaret at a time of his choosing. Three French ships were sent back to port with damage, but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained the following day with the arrival of Nielly's detached squadron. Battle was postponed during the next two days because of thick fog, but when the haze lifted on 1 June 1794, the battle lines were only 6 miles (10 km) apart and Howe was prepared to force a decisive action.

Although Howe was in a favourable position, Villaret had not been idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was within a few hours of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage of his position on the weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6 km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the French, with <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s acting as repeaters for the admiral's commands. The French were likewise in <a href="line%20ahead">line ahead</a> and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.

It was normal in fleet actions of the 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then <a href="jibe">wearing</a> away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy. In contrast, Howe was counting on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with the advantage of the weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters; each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent's force (as <a href="George%20Rodney">Rodney</a> had done at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Saintes">Battle of the Saintes</a> 12 years earlier). Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers, cutting them off from their retreat downwind, and engage them directly, hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet.

Within minutes of issuing the signal and turning his flagship <a href="HMS%20Queen%20Charlotte%20%281790%29">HMS "Queen Charlotte"</a>, Howe's plan began to falter. Many of the British captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were hanging back in the original line. Other ships were still struggling with damage from Howe's earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough. The result was a ragged formation tipped by "Queen Charlotte" that headed unevenly for Villaret's fleet. The French responded by firing on the British ships as they approached, but the lack of training and coordination in the French fleet was obvious; many ships which did obey Howe's order and attacked the French directly arrived in action without significant damage.

Although "Queen Charlotte" pressed on all sail, she was not the first through the enemy line. That distinction belonged to a ship of the <a href="Vanguard%20%28military%20tactics%29">van squadron</a> under <a href="Thomas%20Graves%2C%201st%20Baron%20Graves">Admiral Graves</a>: <a href="HMS%20Defence%20%281763%29">HMS "Defence"</a> under Captain <a href="James%20Gambier">James Gambier</a>, a notoriously dour officer nicknamed "Dismal Jimmy" by his contemporaries. "Defence", the seventh ship of the British line, successfully cut the French line between its sixth and seventh ships; <a href="French%20ship%20Orion%20%281787%29">"Mucius"</a> and <a href="French%20ship%20Tourville%20%281788%29">"Tourville"</a>. Raking both opponents, "Defence" soon found herself in difficulty due to the failure of those ships behind her to properly follow up. This left her vulnerable to "Mucius", "Tourville" and the ships following them, with which she began a furious fusillade. However, "Defence" was not the only ship of the van to break the French line; minutes later <a href="George%20Cranfield-Berkeley">George Cranfield-Berkeley</a> in <a href="HMS%20Marlborough%20%281767%29">HMS "Marlborough"</a> executed Howe's manoeuvre perfectly, raking and then entangling his ship with <a href="French%20ship%20Imp%C3%A9tueux%20%281787%29">"Impétueux"</a>.

In front of "Marlborough" the rest of the van had mixed success. <a href="HMS%20Bellerophon%20%281786%29">HMS "Bellerophon"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Leviathan%20%281790%29">HMS "Leviathan"</a> were both still suffering the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line. Instead they pulled along the near side of <a href="French%20ship%20%C3%89ole%20%281789%29">"Éole"</a> and <a href="French%20ship%20America%20%281788%29">"America"</a> respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels. Rear-Admiral <a href="Thomas%20Pasley">Thomas Pasley</a> of "Bellerophon" was an early casualty, losing a leg in the opening exchanges. <a href="HMS%20Royal%20Sovereign%20%281786%29">HMS "Royal Sovereign"</a>, Graves's flagship, was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent <a href="French%20ship%20Terrible%20%281779%29">"Terrible"</a>. In the time it took to engage "Terrible" more closely, "Royal Sovereign" suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded.

More disturbing to Lord Howe were the actions of <a href="HMS%20Russell%20%281764%29">HMS "Russell"</a> and HMS "Caesar". "Russell's" captain <a href="John%20Willett%20Payne">John Willett Payne</a> was criticised at the time for failing to get to grips with the enemy more closely and allowing her opponent <a href="French%20ship%20T%C3%A9m%C3%A9raire%20%281782%29">"Téméraire"</a> to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start to the action. There were no such excuses, however, for Captain <a href="Anthony%20James%20Pye%20Molloy">Anthony Molloy</a> of "Caesar", who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe's signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly. "Caesar" did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading French ship "Trajan" but her fire had little effect, while "Trajan" inflicted much damage to "Caesar's" rigging and was subsequently able to attack "Bellerophon" as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing at the head of the line.

The centre of the two fleets was divided by two separate squadrons of the British line: the forward division under admirals <a href="Benjamin%20Caldwell">Benjamin Caldwell</a> and <a href="Sir%20George%20Bowyer%2C%201st%20Baronet">George Bowyer</a> and the rear under Lord Howe. While Howe in "Queen Charlotte" was engaging the French closely, his subordinates in the forward division were less active. Instead of moving in on their opposite numbers directly, the forward division sedately closed with the French in line ahead formation, engaging in a long distance duel which did not prevent their opponents from harassing the embattled "Defence" just ahead of them. Of all the ships in this squadron only <a href="HMS%20Invincible%20%281765%29">HMS "Invincible"</a>, under <a href="Thomas%20Pakenham%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Pakenham</a>, ranged close to the French lines. "Invincible" was badly damaged by her lone charge but managed to engage the larger <a href="French%20ship%20Deux%20Fr%C3%A8res">"Juste"</a>. <a href="HMS%20Barfleur%20%281768%29">HMS "Barfleur"</a> under Bowyer did later enter the action, but Bowyer was not present, having lost a leg in the opening exchanges.

Howe and "Queen Charlotte" led the fleet by example, sailing directly at the French flagship <a href="French%20ship%20Oc%C3%A9an%20%281790%29">"Montagne"</a>. Passing between "Montagne" and the next in line <a href="French%20ship%20Vengeur%20du%20Peuple">"Vengeur du Peuple"</a>, "Queen Charlotte" raked both and hauled up close to "Montagne" to engage in a close-range artillery battle. As she did so, "Queen Charlotte" also became briefly entangled with <a href="French%20ship%20Auguste%20%281778%29">"Jacobin"</a>, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships.

To the right of "Queen Charlotte", <a href="HMS%20Brunswick%20%281790%29">HMS "Brunswick"</a> had initially struggled to join the action. Labouring behind the flagship, her captain <a href="John%20Harvey%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Harvey</a> received a rebuke from Howe for the delay. Spurred by this signal, Harvey pushed his ship forward and almost outstripped "Queen Charlotte", blocking her view of the eastern half of the French fleet for a time and taking severe damage from French fire as she did so. Harvey hoped to run aboard "Jacobin" and support his admiral directly, but was not fast enough to reach her and so attempted to cut between <a href="French%20ship%20Annibal%20%281779%29">"Achille"</a> and "Vengeur du Peuple". This manoeuvre failed when "Brunswick's" anchors became entangled in "Vengeur's" rigging. Harvey's <a href="Master%20mariner">master</a> asked if "Vengeur" should be cut loose, to which Harvey replied "No; we have got her and we will keep her". The two ships swung so close to each other that "Brunswick's" crew could not open their gunports and had to fire through the closed lids, the ships battering each other from a distance of just a few feet.

Behind this combat, other ships of the centre division struck the French line, <a href="HMS%20Valiant%20%281759%29">HMS "Valiant"</a> under <a href="Thomas%20Pringle%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Pringle</a> passing close to <a href="French%20ship%20Patriote%20%281785%29">"Patriote"</a> which pulled away, her crew suffering from <a href="Infectious%20disease">contagion</a> and unable to take their ship into battle. "Valiant" instead turned her attention on "Achille", which had already been raked by "Queen Charlotte" and "Brunswick", and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. <a href="HMS%20Orion%20%281787%29">HMS "Orion"</a> under <a href="John%20Thomas%20Duckworth">John Thomas Duckworth</a> and <a href="HMS%20Queen%20%281769%29">HMS "Queen"</a> under Admiral <a href="Alan%20Gardner%2C%201st%20Baron%20Gardner">Alan Gardner</a> both attacked the same ship, "Queen" suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain <a href="John%20Hutt%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Hutt</a> mortally wounded. Both ships bore down on the French <a href="French%20ship%20Northumberland%20%281780%29">"Northumberland"</a>, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. "Queen" was too slow to engage "Northumberland" as closely as "Orion", and soon fell in with <a href="French%20ship%20Alexandre%20%281794%29">"Jemmappes"</a>, both ships battering each other severely.

Of the British rear ships, only two made a determined effort to break the French line. Admiral Hood's flagship <a href="HMS%20Royal%20George%20%281788%29">HMS "Royal George"</a> pierced it between <a href="French%20ship%20Royal%20Louis%20%281780%29">"Républicain"</a> and <a href="French%20ship%20Sans%20Pareil">"Sans Pareil"</a>, engaging both closely, while <a href="HMS%20Glory%20%281788%29">HMS "Glory"</a> came through the line behind "Sans Pareil" and threw herself into the melee as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard did not participate in this close combat; <a href="HMS%20Montagu%20%281779%29">HMS "Montagu"</a> fought a long range gunnery duel with <a href="French%20ship%20Neptune%20%281778%29">"Neptune"</a> which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain <a href="James%20Montagu%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">James Montagu</a> was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant <a href="Ross%20Donnelly">Ross Donnelly</a>. Next in line, <a href="HMS%20Ramillies%20%281785%29">HMS "Ramillies"</a> ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain <a href="Henry%20Harvey">Henry Harvey</a> seeking "Brunswick", his brother's ship, in the confused action around "Queen Charlotte".

Three other British ships failed to respond to the signal from Howe, including <a href="HMS%20Alfred%20%281778%29">HMS "Alfred"</a> which engaged the French line at extreme range without noticeable effect, and Captain <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Cotton%2C%205th%20Baronet">Charles Cotton</a> in <a href="HMS%20Majestic%20%281785%29">HMS "Majestic"</a> who likewise did little until the action was decided, at which point he took the surrender of several already shattered French ships. Finally <a href="HMS%20Thunderer%20%281783%29">HMS "Thunderer"</a> under <a href="Sir%20Albemarle%20Bertie%2C%201st%20Baronet">Albemarle Bertie</a> took no part in the initial action at all, standing well away from the British line and failing to engage the enemy despite the signal for close engagement hanging limply from her mainmast. The French rear ships were no less idle, with <a href="French%20ship%20Entreprenant%20%281787%29">"Entreprenant"</a> and <a href="French%20ship%20Seduisant%20%281783%29">"Pelletier"</a> firing at any British ships in range but refusing to close or participate in the melees on either side. The French rear ship <a href="French%20ship%20Saint-Esprit%20%281766%29">"Scipion"</a> did not attempt to join the action either, but could not avoid becoming embroiled in the group around "Royal George" and "Républicain" and suffered severe damage.

Within an hour of their opening volleys the British and French lines were hopelessly confused, with three separate engagements being fought within sight of one another. In the van, "Caesar" had finally attempted to join the fight, only to have a vital spar shot away by "Trajan" which caused her to slip down the two embattled fleets without contributing significantly to the battle. "Bellerophon" and "Leviathan" were in the thick of the action, the outnumbered "Bellerophon" taking serious damage to her rigging. This left her unable to manoeuvre and in danger from her opponents, of which "Eole" also suffered severely. Captain <a href="William%20Johnstone%20Hope">William Johnstone Hope</a> sought to extract his ship from her perilous position and called up support; the frigate <a href="HMS%20Latona%20%281781%29">HMS "Latona"</a> under Captain <a href="Edward%20Thornbrough">Edward Thornbrough</a> arrived to provide assistance. Thornbrough brought his small ship between the ships of the French battleline and opened fire on "Eole", helping to drive off three ships of the line and then towing "Bellerophon" to safety. "Leviathan", under <a href="Lord%20Hugh%20Seymour">Lord Hugh Seymour</a>, had been more successful than "Bellerophon", her gunnery dismasting "America" despite receiving fire from "Eole" and "Trajan" in passing. "Leviathan" only left "America" after a two-hour duel, sailing at 11:50 to join "Queen Charlotte" in the centre.

"Russell" had not broken the French line and her opponent "Témeraire" got the better of her, knocking away a topmast and escaping to windward with "Trajan" and "Eole". "Russell" then fired on several passing French ships before joining "Leviathan" in attacking the centre of the French line. "Russell's" boats also took the surrender of "America", her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize (although later replaced by men from "Royal Sovereign"). "Royal Sovereign" lost Admiral Graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well, as "Terrible" fell out of the line to windward and joined a growing collection of French ships forming a new line on the far side of the action. Villaret was leading this line in his flagship "Montagne", which had escaped from "Queen Charlotte", and it was "Montagne" which "Royal Sovereign" engaged next, pursuing her close to the new French line accompanied by "Valiant", and beginning a long-range action.

Behind "Royal Sovereign" was "Marlborough", inextricably tangled with "Impétueux". Badly damaged and on the verge of surrender, "Impétueux" was briefly reprieved when "Mucius" appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with "Marlborough" and "Impétueux" losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of "Marlborough" had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant <a href="John%20Monkton">John Monkton</a>, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. <a href="Robert%20Stopford%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Robert Stopford</a> responded in <a href="HMS%20Aquilon%20%281786%29">HMS "Aquilon"</a>, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed "Marlborough" out of the line as "Mucius" freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. "Impétueux" was in too damaged a state to move at all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS "Russell".

Dismasted, "Defence" was unable to hold any of her various opponents to a protracted duel, and by 13:00 was threatened by the damaged "Républicain" moving from the east. Although "Républicain" later hauled off to join Villaret to the north, Gambier requested support for his ship from the fleet's frigates and was aided by <a href="HMS%20Phaeton%20%281782%29">HMS "Phaeton"</a> under Captain <a href="William%20Bentinck%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">William Bentinck</a>. As "Impétueux" passed she fired on "Phaeton", to which Bentinck responded with several broadsides of his own. "Invincible", the only ship of the forward division of the British centre to engage the enemy closely, became embroiled in the confusion surrounding "Queen Charlotte". "Invincible's" guns drove <a href="French%20ship%20Deux%20Fr%C3%A8res">"Juste"</a> onto the broadside of "Queen Charlotte", where she was forced to surrender to Lieutenant <a href="Henry%20Blackwood">Henry Blackwood</a> in a boat from "Invincible". Among the other ships of the division there were only minor casualties, although <a href="HMS%20Impregnable%20%281786%29">HMS "Impregnable"</a> lost several <a href="yard%20%28sailing%29">yards</a> and was only brought back into line by the quick reactions of two junior officers, Lieutenant <a href="Robert%20Otway">Robert Otway</a> and Midshipman <a href="Charles%20Dashwood%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Charles Dashwood</a>.

The conflict between "Queen Charlotte" and "Montagne" was oddly one-sided, the French flagship failing to make use of her lower-deck guns and consequently suffering extensive damage and casualties. "Queen Charlotte" in her turn was damaged by fire from nearby ships and was therefore unable to follow when "Montagne" set her remaining sails and slipped to the north to create a new focal point for the survivors of the French fleet. "Queen Charlotte" also took fire during the engagement from <a href="HMS%20Gibraltar%20%281780%29">HMS "Gibraltar"</a>, under <a href="Thomas%20Mackenzie%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Mackenzie</a>, which had failed to close with the enemy and instead fired at random into the smoke bank surrounding the flagship. Captain <a href="Andrew%20Snape%20Douglas">Sir Andrew Snape Douglas</a> was seriously wounded by this fire. Following "Montagne"'s escape, "Queen Charlotte" engaged "Jacobin" and "Républicain" as they passed, and was successful in forcing the surrender of "Juste". To the east of "Queen Charlotte", "Brunswick" and "Vengeur du Peuple" continued their bitter combat, locked together and firing main broadsides from point blank range. Captain Harvey of "Brunswick" was mortally wounded early in this action by <a href="Naval%20artillery%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Sail%23Shot">langrage fire</a> from "Vengeur", but refused to quit the deck, ordering more fire into his opponent. "Brunswick" also managed to drive "Achille" off from her far side when the French ship attempted to intervene. "Achille", already damaged, was totally dismasted in the exchange and briefly surrendered, although her crew rescinded this when it became clear "Brunswick" was in no position to take possession. With her colours rehoisted, "Achille" then made what sail she could in an attempt to join Villaret to the north. It was not until 12:45 that the shattered "Vengeur" and "Brunswick" pulled apart, both largely dismasted and very battered. "Brunswick" was only able to return to the British side of the line after being supported by "Ramillies", while "Vengeur" was unable to move at all. "Ramillies" took "Vengeur's" surrender after a brief cannonade but was unable to board her and instead pursued the fleeing "Achille", which soon surrendered as well.

To the east, "Orion" and "Queen" forced the surrender of both "Northumberland" and "Jemmappes", although "Queen" was unable to secure "Jemmappes" and she had to be abandoned later. "Queen" especially was badly damaged and unable to make the British lines again, wallowing between the newly reformed French fleet and the British battleline along with several other shattered ships. "Royal George" and "Glory" had between them disabled "Scipion" and "Sans Pareil" in a bitter exchange, but were also too badly damaged themselves to take possession. All four ships were among those left drifting in the gap between the fleets.

Villaret in "Montagne", having successfully broken contact with the British flagship and slipped away to the north, managed to gather 11 ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron. At 11:30, with the main action drawing to a close, he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered. Aiming his new squadron at the battered "Queen", Villaret's attack created consternation in the British fleet, which was unprepared for a second engagement. However, discerning Villaret's intention, Howe also pulled his ships together to create a new force. His reformed squadron consisted of "Queen Charlotte", "Royal Sovereign", "Valiant", "Leviathan", "Barfleur", and "Thunderer". Howe deployed this squadron in defence of "Queen", and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before Villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape British pursuit. Villaret was subsequently joined by the battered "Terrible", which sailed straight through the dispersed British fleet to reach the French lines, and he also recovered the dismasted "Scipion", "Mucius", "Jemmappes", and "Républicain"—all of which lay within reach of the unengaged British ships—before turning eastwards towards France. At this stage of the battle, Howe retired below and the British consolidation was left to his <a href="Captain%20of%20the%20Fleet">Captain of the Fleet</a>, <a href="Roger%20Curtis">Sir Roger Curtis</a>. Curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the Navy for not capturing more of the dismasted French ships, and was also accused of dissuading Howe from attempting further pursuit.

In fact, the British fleet was unable to pursue Villaret, having only 11 ships still capable of battle to the French 12, and having numerous dismasted ships and prizes to protect. Retiring and regrouping, the British crews set about making hasty repairs and securing their prizes; seven in total, including the badly damaged "Vengeur du Peuple". "Vengeur" had been holed by cannon firing from "Brunswick" directly through the ship's bottom, and after her surrender no British ship had managed to get men aboard. This left "Vengeur"'s few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they could—a task made harder when some of her sailors broke into the spirit room and became drunk. Ultimately the ship's pumps became unmanageable, and "Vengeur" began to sink. Only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged "Alfred" and <a href="HMS%20Culloden%20%281783%29">HMS "Culloden"</a>, as well as the services of the cutter HMS "Rattler", saved any of the "Vengeur's" crew from drowning, these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them. Lieutenant John Winne of "Rattler" was especially commended for this hazardous work. By 18:15, "Vengeur" was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded, the dead, and the drunk remained aboard. Several sailors are said to have waved <a href="Flag%20of%20France">the tricolor</a> from the bow of the ship and cried "Vive la Nation, vive la République!"

Having escaped to the east, Villaret made what sail his battered fleet could muster to return to France, and dispatched his frigates in search of the convoy. Villaret was also hoping for reinforcements; eight ships of the line, commanded by Admiral <a href="Pierre-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Cornic">Pierre-François Cornic</a>, were patrolling near the <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a> headland. Behind him to the west, the British took the whole night to secure their ships and prizes, not setting out to return to Britain until 05:00 on 2 June.

Casualties in the battle are notoriously hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception ("Scipion"), records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither of which can be treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000 captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.

With a large portion of his fleet no longer battleworthy, Howe was unable to resume his search for the French convoy in the Bay of Biscay. The <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>, though unaware of Howe's specific circumstances, knew a battle had taken place through the arrival of <a href="HMS%20Audacious%20%281785%29">HMS "Audacious"</a> in Portsmouth, and was preparing a second expedition under <a href="George%20Montagu%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">George Montagu</a>. Montagu had returned to England after his unsuccessful May cruise, and was refitting in Portsmouth when ordered to sea again. His force of ten ships was intended to both cover Howe's withdrawal from Biscay, and find and attack the French grain convoy. Montagu returned to sea on 3 June, and by 8 June was off Ushant searching for signs of either the French or Howe; unknown to him, neither had yet entered European waters. At 15:30 on 8 June Montagu spotted sails, and soon identified them as the enemy. He had located Cornic's squadron, which was also patrolling for the convoy and the returning fleets. Montagu gave chase and drove Cornic into Bertheaume Bay, where he blockaded the French squadron overnight, hoping to bring them to action the following day. However, on 9 June, Montagu sighted 19 French ships appearing from the west—the remnants of Villaret's fleet. Hastily turning his ships, Montagu sailed south to avoid becoming trapped between two forces which might easily overwhelm him. Villaret and Cornic gave chase for a day before turning east towards the safety of the French ports.

Howe benefited from Montagu's withdrawal, as his own battered fleet passed close to the scene of this stand-off on 10 June, pushing north into the English Channel. With Villaret and Cornic fortuitously pursuing Montagu to the south, Howe was free to pass Ushant without difficulty and arrived off <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 12 June, joined soon afterwards by Montagu. Villaret had anchored with Cornic in Bertheaume Bay the day before, but Saint-André refused to allow him to enter Brest until the republican attitudes of the town's population had been assessed. On 12 June, the convoy from America finally arrived off France, having lost just one ship in passage during a storm.

Both Britain and France claimed victory in the battle: Britain by virtue of capturing or sinking seven French ships without losing any of her own and remaining in control of the battle site; France because the vital convoy had passed through the Atlantic unharmed and arrived in France without significant loss. The two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism – the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting. The British fleet in <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> was treated with a Royal visit by <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> and the entire royal household.

In France the revolutionary principles of precluded extensive awards, but Villaret was promoted to vice-admiral on 27 September 1794 and other minor awards were distributed to the admirals of the fleet. In addition the fleet's officers took part in a celebratory parade from Brest to Paris, accompanying the recently arrived food supplies. The role of <a href="French%20ship%20Vengeur%20du%20Peuple">"Vengeur du Peuple"</a> was mythified by <a href="Bertrand%20Barr%C3%A8re">Bertrand Barrère</a>, giving birth to an exalted legend. Opinion in France concerning the battle's outcome was divided; while many celebrated Saint-André's exaggerated accounts of victory in "Le Moniteur", senior naval officers disagreed. Among the dissenters was the highly experienced but recently dismissed Admiral <a href="Yves-Joseph%20de%20Kerguelen-Tr%C3%A9marec">Kerguelen</a>. Kerguelen was disgusted by Villaret's failure to renew the battle after he had reformed his squadron, and felt that the French fleet could have been successful tactically as well as strategically if only Villaret had made greater efforts to engage the remains of Howe's fleet. The French Navy had suffered its worst losses in a single day since the <a href="Battle%20of%20La%20Hogue">Battle of La Hogue</a> in 1692.

Ultimately the revolutionary excesses of the period would prove disastrous for the French Navy. Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the French officer corps. The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure at the hands of more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20 years earlier.

In Britain, numerous honours were bestowed on the fleet and its commanders. Admiral Howe, already an earl, refused any further elevation, and King George III was dissuaded from making him a <a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Garter">Knight of the Garter</a> by one of Howe's political opponents. Vice-Admiral Graves was elevated to the <a href="Peerage%20of%20Ireland">Peerage of Ireland</a> as <a href="Baron%20Graves">Baron Graves</a>, while Vice-Admiral Hood was made <a href="Viscount%20Bridport">Viscount Bridport</a>. Rear-Admirals <a href="Sir%20George%20Bowyer%2C%205th%20Baronet">Bowyer</a>, Gardner, Pasley and Curtis (the last-named was promoted from captain on 4 July 1794) were all made <a href="baronets">baronets</a>, and Bowyer and Pasley also received pensions of £1,000 a year to compensate them for their severe wounds. All first lieutenants were promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a> and numerous other officers were promoted in consequence of their actions. The thanks of parliament were unanimously passed to all who fought at the action and various other gifts and awards were distributed among the fleet. A memorial to Captains John Hutt and John Harvey, both of whom had died of their wounds on 30 June, was raised in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

There was, however, a bitter consequence of the awards, rooted in Howe's official dispatch to the Admiralty concerning the battle, which according to some accounts was actually written by Curtis. Howe had appended a list to his report containing the names of officers whom he believed merited special reward for their part in the battle. The list included Vice-Admirals Graves and Hood, Rear-Admirals Bowyer, Gardner, and Pasley, and Captains Seymour, Pakenham, Cranfield-Berkeley, Gambier, John Harvey, Payne, Henry Harvey, Pringle, Duckworth, Elphinstone, Nichols, and Hope. Also mentioned were Lieutenants Monkton and Donnelly. The list had omitted a number of officers who had served in the battle, and the justice of their omission was a highly controversial issue in the Navy. Rear-Admiral Caldwell was the sole British flag officer present not to receive a hereditary honour, although he was promoted to Vice-Admiral on 4 July (as were Bowyer and Gardner). After studying the ship's logs and reports of the battle, the Admiralty minted a medal to be awarded to the living captains on the list only (although Captain <a href="Sir%20William%20Parker%2C%201st%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Harburn">William Parker</a> of HMS "Audacious" was awarded one as well). The captains excluded from the list were furious, and the furor from this selective commendation lasted years: in 1795 Vice-Admiral Caldwell quit the service in anger as a result, while <a href="Cuthbert%20Collingwood">Cuthbert Collingwood</a>, flag captain of "Barfleur", refused all awards for future service until the Glorious First of June medal was presented to him as well. He eventually received it after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20St%20Vincent%20%281797%29">Battle of Cape St Vincent</a> in 1797. Over five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the <a href="Naval%20General%20Service%20Medal%20%281847%29">Naval General Service Medal</a>, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.

Bitterest of all was the <a href="whispering%20campaign">whispering campaign</a> directed at Anthony Molloy, captain of HMS "Caesar". Molloy was accused of cowardice by fellow officers for his failure to follow Howe's orders on both 29 May and 1 June. Molloy's request for an official court-martial to clear his name failed, and although his personal courage was not called into question, his professional ability was. Molloy was dismissed from his ship.

Of the captured ships, several were purchased and enjoyed long careers in the Royal Navy, in particular the two 80-gun ships <a href="HMS%20Sans%20Pareil%20%281794%29">HMS "Sans Pareil"</a> which was decommissioned in 1802 but not broken up until 1842, and <a href="French%20ship%20Deux%20Fr%C3%A8res">HMS "Juste"</a>, which was a popular command until her decommissioning in 1802 at the <a href="Peace%20of%20Amiens">Peace of Amiens</a>. Of the four 74-gun prizes, "Achille" and "Northumberland" (both 74s built in the late 1770s) were broken up as unserviceable soon after arrival in Britain, while "Impétueux" was destroyed in a dockyard fire on 24 August 1794 while undergoing repairs. "America", the final prize, was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS "America" but renamed <a href="French%20ship%20America%20%281788%29">HMS "Impetueux"</a> in July 1795 and remained in service until 1813. The combined <a href="prize%20money">prize money</a> for these ships was £201,096 (the equivalent of £ as of 2019), divided among the ships under Lord Howe's command.

He began his career in the <a href="sketch%20comedy">sketch comedy</a> series "<a href="Full%20Frontal%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29">Full Frontal</a>" before his first movie, comedy-drama "<a href="The%20Castle%20%281997%20Australian%20film%29">The Castle</a>" (1997), got him noticed by global audiences. Soon after he gained critical recognition in the biographical crime film "<a href="Chopper%20%28film%29">Chopper</a>" (2000). After a decade of roles in Australian TV shows and films, Bana gained <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>'s attention for his performance in the war film "<a href="Black%20Hawk%20Down%20%28film%29">Black Hawk Down</a>" (2001) and <a href="Hulk">the title character</a> in "<a href="Hulk%20%28film%29">Hulk</a>" (2003). He has since played <a href="Hector">Hector</a> in the movie "<a href="Troy%20%28film%29">Troy</a>" (2004), the lead in <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s historical drama and political thriller "<a href="Munich%20%28film%29">Munich</a>" (2005), <a href="King%20Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> in "<a href="The%20Other%20Boleyn%20Girl%20%282008%20film%29">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>" (2008), and the villain <a href="Captain%20Nero">Nero</a> in the science-fiction film "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" (2009). Bana also played Henry De Tamble in "<a href="The%20Time%20Traveler%27s%20Wife%20%28film%29">The Time Traveler's Wife</a>" (2009). In 2013, he played Lt. Cmdr. <a href="Erik%20S.%20Kristensen">Erik S. Kristensen</a> in the <a href="war%20film">war film</a> "<a href="Lone%20Survivor%20%28film%29">Lone Survivor</a>" and in the following year he played police sergeant <a href="Ralph%20Sarchie">Ralph Sarchie</a> in the <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> "<a href="Deliver%20Us%20from%20Evil%20%282014%20film%29">Deliver Us from Evil</a>".

An accomplished dramatic actor and comedian, he received Australia's highest film and television awards for his performances in "Chopper", "Full Frontal" and "<a href="Romulus%2C%20My%20Father%20%28film%29">Romulus, My Father</a>". Bana has performed across a wide spectrum of leading roles in a variety of low-budget and major studio films, ranging from <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedies</a> and drama to science fiction and <a href="action%20film">action thrillers</a>.

Bana was born in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia. His father, Ivan, was <a href="Croats">Croatian</a> and worked as a logistics manager for <a href="Caterpillar%20Inc.">Caterpillar Inc.</a>, and his <a href="Germans">German</a> mother, Eleanor, was a hairdresser, originally from near <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a> in Germany. He has one older brother, Anthony. Bana grew up in Melbourne's <a href="Tullamarine%2C%20Victoria">Tullamarine</a>, a suburban area on the northern edge of the city, near Melbourne's international airport, and attended <a href="Penleigh%20and%20Essendon%20Grammar%20School">Penleigh and Essendon Grammar School</a>. In a cover story for "<a href="The%20Mail%20on%20Sunday">The Mail on Sunday</a>", he told author <a href="Antonella%20Gambotto-Burke">Antonella Gambotto-Burke</a> that his family had suffered from racist taunts, and that it had distressed him. "<a href="Wog">Wog</a> is such a terrible word," he said. He has stated: "I have always been proud of my origin, which had a big influence on my upbringing. I have always been in the company of people of European origin".

Showing acting skill early in life, Bana began doing impressions of family members at the age of six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather's walk, voice and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> film "<a href="Mad%20Max">Mad Max</a>" (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the <a href="performing%20arts">performing arts</a> until 1991 when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, however, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables.

In 1993, Bana made his television debut on <a href="Steve%20Vizard">Steve Vizard</a>'s late night talk show, "<a href="Tonight%20Live%20with%20Steve%20Vizard">Tonight Live</a>". His performance gained the attention of producers from the <a href="sketch%20comedy">sketch comedy</a> series, "<a href="Full%20Frontal%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29">Full Frontal</a>", who invited him to join the show as a writer and performer. During his four years on the show, Bana wrote much of his own material, and based some of his characters on members of his family. His impressions of <a href="Columbo%20%28TV%20series%29">Columbo</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, <a href="Sylvester%20Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>, and <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> made Bana popular with the show's audience. This success led him to record the comedy album "<a href="Out%20of%20Bounds%20%28Eric%20Bana%20album%29">Out of Bounds</a>" in 1994 and to host his own television special, titled "Eric", in 1996. The show, a collection of sketches featuring everyday characters, prompted him to launch a sketch comedy series "The Eric Bana Show". The series, written and performed by Bana, featured skits, stand-up and celebrity guests, but failed to attract a substantial audience and was cancelled after only eight episodes due to low ratings. Even so, in 1997, he received a <a href="Logie%20Award">Logie Award</a> for "Most Popular Comedy Personality" for his work on the show.

That same year, Bana made his film debut in the Australian film "<a href="The%20Castle%20%281997%20Australian%20film%29">The Castle</a>", which tells the story of a Melbourne-based family's struggles to keep their home by Melbourne's airport as the airport authority force them to move. He was featured in a supporting role as Con Petropoulous, a kickboxing accountant who is the householder's son-in-law. "The Castle" was a surprise critical and financial success, earning <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>10,326,428 at the box office in Australia.

In 1997, in spite of his lack of experience in dramatic roles, Bana was approached by director <a href="Andrew%20Dominik">Andrew Dominik</a> to appear in the film "<a href="Chopper%20%28film%29">Chopper</a>" (2000), a biographical film based on the life of infamous Australian criminal <a href="Mark%20%26quot%3BChopper%26quot%3B%20Read">Chopper Read</a>. Dominik had been working on the project for five years, but was unable to find an actor to portray Read. Only after Read himself suggested Bana, having seen him perform a skit on television, did Dominik consider him for the part.

For the role, Bana shaved his head, gained thirty pounds, and spent two days with Read to perfect his mimicry. During filming he arrived on set at four in the morning and spent five hours being covered in Read's trademark tattoos. In spite of the film's limited release outside of Australia, Bana's performance received positive reviews. American film critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> complimented Bana, stating that "in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found, I think, a future star ... He has a quality no acting school can teach you and few actors can match. You cannot look away from him". "Chopper" was a critical and financial success in Australia, and was nominated for Best Film at the <a href="Australian%20Film%20Institute%20Awards">Australian Film Institute Awards</a> in 2001. Bana's performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.

In 2001, director <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a> cast Bana as an American soldier in the film "<a href="Black%20Hawk%20Down%20%28film%29">Black Hawk Down</a>" (2001). Scott, with a recommendation from <a href="Russell%20Crowe">Russell Crowe</a> and impressed by Bana's performance in "Chopper", did not require him to audition. In the film, he played <a href="Sergeant%20First%20Class">Sergeant First Class</a> Norm 'Hoot' Hooten, an elite <a href="Delta%20Force">Delta Force</a> soldier, who fights his way out of a battle in <a href="Mogadishu">Mogadishu</a>, Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry. Bana shed the weight he had gained for "Chopper" and began an exercise regimen months before filming began. He also trained with Delta Force operators at <a href="Fort%20Bragg%2C%20North%20Carolina">Fort Bragg</a>, learning to fire weapons and clear rooms.

Bana's next project was the low-budget Australian film "<a href="The%20Nugget">The Nugget</a>" (2002). A comedy, the film portrays the effect of instant wealth on three working class men and was released with moderate success in Australia. Bana read the script after filming "Chopper" in 2000 and was drawn to it because it reminded him of his childhood and because he found its characters amusing and likeable. While filming "The Nugget", Bana was offered the lead role of Bruce Banner in the film adaptation of the popular <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comic</a> book series "<a href="Hulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>". Only after learning of director <a href="Ang%20Lee">Ang Lee</a>'s involvement in the project did he consider the role. Bana admired Lee for his work on the film "<a href="The%20Ice%20Storm%20%28film%29">The Ice Storm</a>" and agreed to work on the film before the final script was complete. He said he was drawn to the film because "the character of Bruce Banner had dramatic potential" and was "a fairly non-traditional superhero". "<a href="Hulk%20%28film%29">Hulk</a>" (2003) received mixed reviews and a moderate success at the box office, but Bana's performance was praised: Jack Matthews of the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" felt that Bana played the role of Bruce Banner "with great conviction". Bana earned an Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films nomination for "Cinescape Genre Face of the Future" for the film.

In 2004, Bana co-starred with <a href="Brad%20Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> in the big-budget film "<a href="Troy%20%28film%29">Troy</a>". In the film, he played <a href="Hector">Prince Hector</a>, leader of the <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> forces battling against the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> warrior <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>. The film was an international success, grossing US$364 million, with US$133 million in the US.

After the critical disappointment of "Hulk" and "Troy", critics questioned Bana's bankability in big-budget films. He responded in "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire Magazine</a>": "It's not like it [Hulk] was a flop. When you're on a long shoot it is a long personal investment. If I wasn't happy with the end result I'd be bloody upset, but in every case so far I've been happy. "Troy" could take $50 and I wouldn't regret it."

The following year, Bana co-starred with <a href="Daniel%20Craig">Daniel Craig</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20Rush">Geoffrey Rush</a> in <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s controversial film "<a href="Munich%20%28film%29">Munich</a>". Bana played Avner, a <a href="Mossad">Mossad</a> agent, who is ordered to track down and kill the <a href="Black%20September%20%28group%29">Black September</a> terrorists thought to be responsible for the <a href="Munich%20massacre">massacre</a> of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i athletes at the <a href="1972%20Summer%20Olympics">1972 Summer Olympics</a>. The film was a critical success, and was nominated for five <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> in 2006. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" wrote that Bana as Avner "projects a combination of sensitivity and ruthlessness and ... knows how to present a face for which worry is a new experience."

In 2006, Bana was invited to join the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>. "<a href="Lucky%20You%20%28film%29">Lucky You</a>", a <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a> on which Bana worked before filming "Munich", was released in early 2007. In the film, he played Huck Cheever, a professional <a href="poker">poker</a> player who must overcome his personal problems to win a high-stakes tournament in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a>. His next film was the Australian drama "<a href="Romulus%2C%20My%20Father%20%28film%29">Romulus, My Father</a>" (2007). The film, based on <a href="Raimond%20Gaita">Raimond Gaita</a>'s <a href="Romulus%2C%20My%20Father">memoir of the same name</a>, portrays a couple and their struggle in the face of adversity to raise their son. The film was a critical success, and Bana's performance earned him a second Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor. In 2007, he also returned to his Australian TV roots by appearing in hit comedy "<a href="Kath%20%26amp%3B%20Kim%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29">Kath & Kim</a>" as himself.

Bana's next project was the historical drama "<a href="The%20Other%20Boleyn%20Girl%20%282008%20film%29">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>" (2008). In the film he played <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII of England</a> opposite <a href="Scarlett%20Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a> and <a href="Natalie%20Portman">Natalie Portman</a>. Bana was surprised to be offered the role and admitted that he "probably would have just passed it on without even opening it" if it had been presented to him under a different title. The following year, he co-starred with <a href="Chris%20Pine">Chris Pine</a> and <a href="Zachary%20Quinto">Zachary Quinto</a> in the <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>".

The film was a critical success and grossed over US$380 million worldwide.

In 2009, Bana released a self-produced and directed documentary-style film called "<a href="Love%20the%20Beast">Love the Beast</a>".

Along the way he seeks guidance and wisdom from the inner sanctum of his three lifelong friends, as well as celebrities <a href="Jay%20Leno">Jay Leno</a>, <a href="Jeremy%20Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a>, and <a href="Phil%20McGraw">Dr. Phil</a>. In 2011, Bana appeared as ex-<a href="CIA">CIA</a> operative Erik Heller in the action thriller film "<a href="Hanna%20%28film%29">Hanna</a>", starring alongside <a href="Saoirse%20Ronan">Saoirse Ronan</a> and <a href="Cate%20Blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a>. The film became another success for Bana as it opened at No. 2 at the United States box office. Having read <a href="Marcus%20Luttrell">Marcus Luttrell</a>'s autobiographical account as a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20SEALs">SEAL</a>, "<a href="Lone%20Survivor%20%28book%29">Lone Survivor</a>", he was willing to appear in the 2013 <a href="Lone%20Survivor%20%28film%29">film adaptation</a> regardless of which role he was offered.

Harold Innis

Harold Adams Innis (November 5, 1894 – November 8, 1952) was a Canadian professor of <a href="political%20economy">political economy</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> and the author of seminal works on media, <a href="communication%20theory">communication theory</a>, and Canadian <a href="Economy%20of%20Canada">economic</a> history. Despite his dense and difficult prose, Innis was one of Canada's most original thinkers. He helped develop the <a href="staples%20thesis">staples thesis</a>, which holds that Canada's <a href="Culture%20of%20Canada">culture</a>, <a href="Politics%20of%20Canada">political</a> history, and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of "staples" such as <a href="fur%20trade">fur</a>, <a href="fishing">fishing</a>, <a href="lumber">lumber</a>, <a href="wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="mining">mined metals</a>, and <a href="coal">coal</a>. The staple thesis dominated economic history in Canada 1930s-1960s, and continues to be a fundamental part of the Canadian <a href="political%20economy">political economy</a> tradition.

Innis's writings on communication explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations. He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek civilization</a> in the 5th century BC. He warned, however, that <a href="Western%20culture">Western civilization</a> is now imperiled by powerful, <a href="advertising">advertising</a>-driven media obsessed by "present-mindedness" and the "continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity". His intellectual bond with <a href="Eric%20A.%20Havelock">Eric A. Havelock</a> formed the foundations of the <a href="Toronto%20School%20of%20communication%20theory">Toronto School</a> of communication theory, which provided a source of inspiration for future members of the school: <a href="Marshall%20McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Snow%20Carpenter">Edmund Snow Carpenter</a>.

Innis laid the basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As the head of the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto's</a> political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.

As the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> grew hotter after 1947, Innis grew increasingly hostile to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. He warned repeatedly that <a href="Canada">Canada</a> was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. "We are indeed fighting for our lives," he warned, pointing especially to the "pernicious influence of American advertising... We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises." His views influenced some younger scholars, including <a href="Donald%20Creighton">Donald Creighton</a>.

Innis also tried to defend universities from political and economic pressures. He believed that independent universities, as centres of critical thought, were essential to the survival of Western civilization. His intellectual disciple and university colleague, <a href="Marshall%20McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a>, lamented Innis's premature death as a disastrous loss for human understanding. McLuhan wrote: "I am pleased to think of my own book "<a href="The%20Gutenberg%20Galaxy">The Gutenberg Galaxy</a>" as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of writing then of printing."

Innis was born in 1894 on a small livestock and dairy farm near the community of <a href="Otterville%2C%20Ontario">Otterville</a> in southwestern Ontario's <a href="Oxford%20County%2C%20Ontario">Oxford County</a>. As a boy he loved the rhythms and routines of farm life and he never forgot his rural origins. His mother, Mary Adams Innis, had named him 'Herald', hoping he would become a minister in the strict evangelical <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> faith that she and her husband William shared. At the time, the Baptist Church was an important part of life in rural areas. It gave isolated families a sense of community and embodied the values of individualism and independence. Its far-flung congregations were not ruled by a centralized, bureaucratic authority. Innis became an <a href="Agnosticism">agnostic</a> in later life, but never lost his interest in religion. According to his friend and biographer <a href="Donald%20Creighton">Donald Creighton</a>, Innis's character was moulded by the Church:

The strict sense of values and the feeling of devotion to a cause, which became so characteristic of him in later life, were derived, in part at least, from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside the severely unadorned walls of the Baptist Church at Otterville.
Innis attended the one-room schoolhouse in Otterville and the community's high school. He travelled by train to <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Ontario">Woodstock, Ontario</a>, to complete his secondary education at a Baptist-run college. He intended to become a public-school teacher and passed the entrance examinations for teacher training, but decided to take a year off to earn the money he would need to support himself at an Ontario teachers' college. At age 18, therefore, he returned to the one-room schoolhouse at Otterville to teach for one term until the local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher. The experience made him realize that the life of a teacher in a small, rural school was not for him.

In October 1913, Innis started classes at <a href="McMaster%20University">McMaster University</a> (then in Toronto). McMaster was a natural choice for him because it was a Baptist university and many students who attended Woodstock College went there. McMaster's liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate. Innis was especially influenced by James Ten Broeke, the university's one-man philosophy department. Ten Broeke posed an essay question that Innis pondered for the rest of his life: "Why do we attend to the things to which we attend?"

Before his final undergraduate year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer teaching at the Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near <a href="Vermilion%2C%20Alberta">Vermilion, Alberta</a>. The experience gave him a sense of the vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.

After graduating from McMaster, Innis felt that his Christian principles compelled him to enlist in the <a href="Canadian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Canadian Expeditionary Force</a>. He was sent to <a href="France">France</a> in the fall of 1916 to fight in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. <a href="Trench%20warfare">Trench warfare</a> with its "mud and lice and rats" had a devastating effect on him.

Innis's role as an artillery signaller gave him firsthand experience of life (and death) on the front lines as he participated in the successful Canadian attack on <a href="Battle%20of%20Vimy%20Ridge">Vimy Ridge</a>. Signallers, or spotters, watched where each <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29">artillery shell</a> landed, then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit their targets more accurately. On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England.

Innis's war was over. His biographer, John Watson, notes the physical wound took seven years to heal, but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime. Innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service.

Watson also notes that the Great War influenced Innis's intellectual outlook. It strengthened his Canadian <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>; sharpened his opinion of what he thought were the destructive effects of technology, including the communications media that were used so effectively to "sell" the war; and led him, for the first time, to doubt his Baptist faith.

Harold Innis completed a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a> at McMaster, graduating in April 1918. His thesis, called "The Returned Soldier", "was a detailed description of the public policy measures that were necessary, not only to provide a supportive milieu to help veterans get over the effects of the war, but also to move on with national reconstruction".

Innis did his postgraduate work at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> and was awarded his PhD, with a dissertation on the history of <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist <a href="neoclassical%20economics">neoclassical theories</a>, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.

Innis was influenced by the university's two eminent communications scholars, <a href="George%20Herbert%20Mead">George Herbert Mead</a> and <a href="Robert%20E.%20Park">Robert E. Park</a>. Although he did not attend any of these famous professors' classes, Innis did absorb their idea that communication involved much more than the transmission of information. <a href="James%20W.%20Carey">James W. Carey</a> writes that Mead and Park "characterized communication as the entire process whereby a culture is brought into existence, maintained in time, and sedimented into institutions".

While at Chicago, Innis was exposed to the ideas of <a href="Thorstein%20Veblen">Thorstein Veblen</a>, the iconoclastic thinker who drew on his deep knowledge of philosophy and economics to write scathing critiques of contemporary thought and culture. Veblen had left Chicago years before, but his ideas were still strongly felt there. Years later, in an essay on Veblen, Innis praised him for waging war against "standardized static economics".

Innis got his first taste of university teaching at Chicago, where he delivered several introductory economics courses. One of his students was Mary Quayle, the woman he would marry in May 1921 when he was 26 and she 22. Together they had four children, Donald (1924), Mary (1927), Hugh (1930), and <a href="Anne%20Innis%20Dagg">Anne</a> (1933). <a href="Mary%20Quayle%20Innis">Mary Quayle Innis</a> was herself a notable economist and writer. Her book, "An Economic History of Canada", was published in 1935. Her novel, "Stand on a Rainbow" appeared in 1943. Her other books include "Mrs. Simcoe's Diary" (1965), "The Clear Spirit: Canadian Women and Their Times" (1966) and "Unfold the Years" (1949), a history of the Young Women's Christian Association. She also edited Harold Innis's posthumous "Essays in Canadian Economic History" (1956) and a 1972 reissue of his "Empire and Communications."

<a href="Donald%20Quayle%20Innis">Donald Quayle Innis</a> became a geography professor at the <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York">State University of New York</a>, Mary married a surgeon and did graduate work in French literature, Hugh Innis became a professor at <a href="Ryerson%20University">Ryerson University</a> where he taught communications and economics, <a href="Anne%20Innis%20Dagg">Anne Innis Dagg</a> did doctoral work in biology and became an advisor for the Independent Studies program at the <a href="University%20of%20Waterloo">University of Waterloo</a> and published books on zoology, feminism, and Canadian women's history.

Harold Innis wrote his PhD thesis on the history of the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> (CPR). The completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.

Innis argues that "the history of the Canadian Pacific Railroad is primarily the history of the spread of Western civilization over the northern half of the North American continent". As Robert Babe notes, the railway brought industrialization, transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites. It was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to the spread of European civilization. Babe writes that, for Innis, the CPR's equipment "comprised a massive, energy-consuming, fast-moving, powerful, capital-intensive 'sign' dropped into the very midst of indigenous peoples, whose entire way of life was disrupted, and eventually shattered as a result.

Communications scholar <a href="Arthur%20Kroker">Arthur Kroker</a> argues that Innis's study of the Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he attempted to demonstrate that "technology is not something external to Canadian being; but on the contrary, is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence". It also reflected Innis's lifelong interest in the exercise of economic and political power. His CPR history ends, for example, with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies, such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers. Westerners complained that this <a href="National%20Policy">National Policy</a> funnelled money from Prairie farmers into the pockets of the Eastern business establishment. "Western Canada", Innis wrote, "has paid for the development of Canadian nationality, and it would appear that it must continue to pay. The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement."

Harold Innis is considered the leading founder of a Canadian school of economic thought known as the staples theory. It holds that Canada's culture, political history and economy have been decisively shaped by the exploitation and export of a series of "staples" such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels. Innis theorized that this reliance on exporting natural resources made Canada dependent on more industrially advanced countries and resulted in periodic disruptions to economic life as the international demand for staples rose and fell; as the staple itself became increasingly scarce; and, as technological change resulted in shifts from one staple to others. Innis pointed out, for example, that as furs became scarce and trade in that staple declined, it became necessary to develop and export other staples such as wheat, <a href="potash">potash</a> and especially lumber. The export of these new staples was made possible through improved transportation networks that included first canals, and later, railways.

In 1920, Innis joined the department of political economy at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a>. He was assigned to teach courses in commerce, economic history and economic theory. He decided to focus his scholarly research on Canadian economic history, a hugely neglected subject, and he settled on the fur trade as his first area of study. Furs had brought French and English traders to Canada, motivating them to travel west along the continent's interlocking lake and river systems to the Pacific coast. Innis realized that he would not only need to search out archival documents to understand the history of the fur trade, but would also have to travel the country himself gathering masses of firsthand information and accumulating what he called "dirt" experience.

Thus, Innis travelled extensively beginning in the summer of 1924 when he and a friend paddled an canvas-covered canoe hundreds of miles down the <a href="Peace%20River%20%28Canada%29">Peace River</a> to <a href="Lake%20Athabasca">Lake Athabasca</a>; then down the <a href="Slave%20River">Slave River</a> to <a href="Great%20Slave%20Lake">Great Slave Lake</a>. They completed their journey down the <a href="Mackenzie%20River">Mackenzie</a>, Canada's longest river, to the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> on a small <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> tug. During his travels, Innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber, pulp and paper, minerals, grain and fish. He travelled so extensively that by the early 1940s, he had visited every part of Canada except for the <a href="Western%20Arctic">Western Arctic</a> and the east side of <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a>.

Everywhere Innis went his methods were the same: he interviewed people connected with the production of staple products and listened to their stories.

Harold Innis's interest in the relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study, "The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History" (1930). The book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early 16th century to the 1920s. Instead of focusing on the "heroic" European adventurers who explored the Canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done, Innis documents how the interplay of geography, technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and Canada's political and economic destiny. He argues that the fur trade largely determined Canada's boundaries, coming to the conclusion that the country "emerged not in spite of geography but because of it".

In line with this observation, Innis notably proposes that European settlement of the Saint Lawrence river valley followed the economic and social patterns of indigenous peoples, making for a Canadian historical and cultural continuity that pre-dates and post-dates European settlement. Unlike many historians who see Canadian history as beginning with the arrival of Europeans, Innis emphasizes the cultural and economic contributions of First Nations peoples. "We have not yet realized," he writes, "that the Indian and his culture was fundamental to the growth of Canadian institutions." This Innisian perspective on the development of Canadian political, economic and social institutions was an early form of neo-institutionalism which became an accepted part of the Canadian political science tradition well before American and European counterparts. "The Fur Trade in Canada" concludes by arguing that Canadian economic history can best be understood by examining how one staple product gave way to another—furs to timber, for example, and the later importance of wheat and minerals. Reliance on staples made Canada economically dependent on more industrially advanced countries and the "cyclonic" shifts from one staple to another caused frequent disruptions in the country's economic life.

"The Fur Trade in Canada" also describes the cultural interactions among three groups of people: the Europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items; the European colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country, and First Nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots, knives, guns and liquor. Innis describes the central role First Nations peoples played in the development of the fur trade. Without their skilled hunting techniques, knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as snowshoes, toboggans and birch-bark canoes, the fur trade would not have existed. However, dependence on European technologies disrupted First Nations societies. "The new technology with its radical innovations", Innis writes, "brought about such a rapid shift in the prevailing Indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease." Historian Carl Berger argues that by placing First Nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade, Innis "was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of European capitalism."

After the publication of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the <a href="cod">cod</a> fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the <a href="Grand%20Banks">Grand Banks</a> of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>. The result was "The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy" published in 1940, 10 years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500 years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, "The Cod Fisheries" looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> and <a href="New%20England">New England</a>.

Harold Innis's study of the effects of interconnected lakes and rivers on Canadian development and European empire sparked his interest in the complex economic and cultural relationships between transportation systems and communications. During the 1940s, Innis also began studying pulp and paper, an industry of central importance to the Canadian economy. This research provided an additional crossover point from his work on staple products to his communications studies. Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis "followed pulp and paper through its subsequent stages: newspapers and journalism, books and advertising. In other words, from looking at a natural resource-based industry he turned his attention to a cultural industry in which information, and ultimately knowledge, was a commodity that circulated, had value, and empowered those who controlled it."

One of Innis's primary contributions to communications studies was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into <a href="Time-%20and%20space-bias">time-binding and space-binding types</a>. Time-binding media are durable. They include <a href="clay%20tablet">clay</a> or <a href="stele">stone tablet</a>s. Space-binding media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers.

Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.

Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a> in the time of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>. This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greece</a> to <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>.

Harold Innis's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of powerful communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. The balance required for cultural survival had been upset by what Innis saw as "mechanized" communications media used to transmit information quickly over long distances. These media had contributed to an obsession with "present-mindedness" wiping out concerns about past or future. Innis wrote,
The overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the magazine, has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity.

Western civilization could only be saved, Innis argued, by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, "A Plea for Time", he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.

Although Innis remains appreciated and respected for the grand and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in "<a href="Empire%20and%20Communications">Empire and Communications</a>" has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have suggested that this style may have been a result of Innis' illness late in his career.

Aside from his work on "The Cod Fisheries", Innis wrote extensively in the 1930s about other staple products such as minerals and wheat as well as Canada's immense economic problems in the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. During the summers of 1932 and 1933, he travelled to the West to see the effects of the Depression for himself. The next year, in an essay entitled, "The Canadian Economy and the Depression", Innis outlined the plight of "a country susceptible to the slightest ground-swell of international disturbance", yet beset by regional differences that made it difficult to devise effective solutions. He described a Prairie economy dependent on the export of wheat, yet afflicted by severe drought, on the one hand, and the increased political power of Canada's growing cities, sheltered from direct reliance on the staples trade, on the other. The result was political conflict and a breakdown in federal–provincial relations. "We lack vital information on which to base prospective policies to meet this situation", Innis warned, because of "the weak position of the social sciences in Canada".

Innis's reputation as a "public intellectual" was growing steadily and, in 1934, Premier <a href="Angus%20Lewis%20Macdonald">Angus L. Macdonald</a> invited him to serve on a Royal Commission to examine <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>'s economic problems. The next year, he helped establish "The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science". In 1936, he was appointed a full <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> professor and a year later, became the head of the university's Department of Political Economy.

Innis was appointed president of the Canadian Political Science Association in 1938. His inaugural address, entitled "The Penetrative Powers of the Price System", must have baffled his listeners as he ranged over centuries of economic history jumping abruptly from one topic to the next linking monetary developments to patterns of trade and settlement. The address was an ambitious attempt to show the disruptive effects of new technologies culminating in the modern shift from an industrial system based on coal and iron to the newest sources of industrial power, electricity, oil and steel. Innis also tried to show the commercial effects of mass circulation newspapers, made possible by expanded newsprint production, and of the new medium of radio, which "threatens to circumvent the walls imposed by tariffs and to reach across boundaries frequently denied to other media of communication". Both media, Innis argued, stimulated the demand for consumer goods and both promoted nationalism.

Innis was also a central participant in an international project that produced 25 scholarly volumes between 1936 and 1945. It was a series called "The Relations of Canada and the United States" overseen by <a href="James%20T.%20Shotwell">James T. Shotwell</a>, director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Innis edited and wrote prefaces for the volumes contributed by Canadian scholars. His own study of the cod fisheries also appeared as part of the series. His work with Shotwell enabled Innis to gain access to Carnegie money to further Canadian academic research. As John Watson points out, "the project offered one of the few sources of research funds in rather lean times".

The era of the <a href="Dust%20Bowl">"Dirty Thirties"</a> with its mass unemployment, poverty and despair gave rise to new Canadian political movements. In Alberta, for example, the radio evangelist <a href="William%20Aberhart">William "Bible Bill" Aberhart</a> led his populist <a href="Social%20Credit">Social Credit</a> party to victory in 1935. Three years earlier in <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, social reformers had founded a new political party, the <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a> or CCF. It advocated democratic socialism and a <a href="mixed%20economy">mixed economy</a> with <a href="public%20ownership">public ownership</a> of key industries. <a href="Frank%20Underhill">Frank Underhill</a>, one of Innis's colleagues at the University of Toronto was a founding member of the CCF. Innis and Underhill had both been members of an earlier group at the university that declared itself "dissatisfied with the policies of the two major [political] parties in Canada" and that aimed at "forming a definite body of progressive opinion". In 1931, Innis presented a paper to the group on "Economic Conditions in Canada", but he later recoiled from participating in party politics, denouncing partisans like Underhill as "hot gospellers".

Innis maintained that scholars had no place in active politics and that instead, they should devote themselves, first to research on public problems, and then to the production of knowledge based on critical thought. He saw the university, with its emphasis on dialogue, open-mindedness and skepticism, as an institution that could foster such thinking and research. "The university could provide an environment", he wrote, "as free as possible from the biases of the various institutions that form the state, so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives."

Although sympathetic to the plight of western farmers and urban, unemployed workers, Innis did not embrace socialism. <a href="Eric%20A.%20Havelock">Eric Havelock</a>, a left-leaning colleague explained many years later that Innis distrusted political "solutions" imported from elsewhere, especially those based on <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a> analysis with its emphasis on <a href="class%20conflict">class conflict</a>. He worried, too, that as Canada's ties with Britain weakened, the country would fall under the spell of American ideas instead of developing its own based on Canada's unique circumstances. Havelock added:

He has been called the radical conservative of his day — not a bad designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, cautious, perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' felt less difficulty in taking a stand; never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.
In the 1940s, Harold Innis reached the height of his influence in both academic circles and Canadian society. In 1941, he helped establish the American-based <a href="Economic%20History%20Association">Economic History Association</a> and its "<a href="Journal%20of%20Economic%20History">Journal of Economic History</a>". He later became the association's second president. Innis played a central role in founding two important sources for the funding of academic research: the Canadian Social Science Research Council (1940) and the Humanities Research Council of Canada (1944).

In 1944, the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Brunswick">University of New Brunswick</a> awarded Innis an honorary degree, as did his alma mater, <a href="McMaster%20University">McMaster University</a>. <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20Laval">Université Laval</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Manitoba">University of Manitoba</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> would also confer honorary degrees in 1947–48.

In 1945, Innis spent nearly a month in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> where he had been invited to attend the 220th anniversary celebrations marking the founding of the country's <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Academy of Sciences</a>. Later, in his essay "Reflections on Russia", he mused about the differences between the Soviet "producer" economy and the West's "consumer" ethos:

[A]n economy which emphasizes consumer's goods is characterized by communication industries largely dependent on advertising and by constant efforts to reach the largest number of readers or listeners; an economy emphasizing producer's goods is characterized by communications industries largely dependent on government support. As a result of this contrast, a common public opinion in Russia and the West is hard to achieve.
Innis's trip to Moscow and Leningrad came shortly before U.S.–Soviet rivalry led to the hostility of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. Innis lamented this rise in international tensions. He saw the Soviet Empire as a stabilizing counterbalance to the American Empire's emphasis on commercialism, the individual and constant change. For Innis, Russia was a society within the Western tradition, not an alien civilization. He abhorred the <a href="nuclear%20arms%20race">nuclear arms race</a>, seeing it as the triumph of force over knowledge, a modern form of the medieval <a href="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>. "The Middle Ages burned its heretics", he wrote, "and the modern age threatens them with atom bombs."

In 1946, Innis was elected president of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Canada">Royal Society of Canada</a>, the country's senior body of scientists and scholars. That same year, he served on the Manitoba Royal Commission on Adult Education and published "Political Economy in the Modern State", a collection of his speeches and essays that reflected both his staples research and his new work in communications. In 1947, Innis was appointed the University of Toronto's dean of graduate studies. In 1948, he delivered lectures at the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Nottingham">Nottingham University</a>. He also gave the prestigious Beit lectures at <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>, later published in his book "<a href="Empire%20and%20Communications">Empire and Communications</a>". In 1949, Innis was appointed as a commissioner on the federal government's <a href="List%20of%20Canadian%20Royal%20Commissions">Royal Commission</a> on Transportation, a position that involved extensive travel at a time when his health was starting to fail. The last decade of his career during which he worked on his communications studies was an unhappy time for Innis. He was academically isolated because his colleagues in economics could not fathom how this new work related to his pioneering research in staples theory. Biographer John Watson writes that "the almost complete lack of positive response to the communications works, contributed to his sense of overwork and depression".

Innis died of <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> in 1952 a few days after his 58th birthday. In commemoration, <a href="Innis%20College">Innis College</a> at the University of Toronto and Innis Library at <a href="McMaster%20University">McMaster University</a> were named in his honour.

Following his premature death, Innis' significance increasingly deepened as scholars in several academic disciplines continued to build upon his writings. <a href="Marshall%20Poe">Marshall Poe</a>'s general media theory that proposes two sub-theories were inspired by Innis. <a href="Douglas%20C.%20North">Douglas C. North</a> expanded on of Innis' "vent for surplus" theory of economic development by applying it to regional development in the United States and underdeveloped countries. In addition, <a href="James%20W.%20Carey">James W. Carey</a> adopted Innis as a "reference point in his conception of two models of communication".

<a href="Marshall%20McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> was a colleague of Innis's at the University of Toronto. As a young English professor, McLuhan was flattered when he learned that Innis had put his book "<a href="Marshall%20McLuhan%23The%20Mechanical%20Bride%20.281951.29">The Mechanical Bride</a>" on the reading list of the fourth-year economics course. McLuhan built on Innis's idea that in studying the effects of communications media, technological form mattered more than content. Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis's concept of the "bias" of a particular medium of communication can be seen as a "less flamboyant precursor to McLuhan's legendary phrase '<a href="the%20medium%20is%20the%20message">the medium is the message</a>.'" Innis, for example, tried to show how printed media such as books or newspapers were "biased" toward control over space and secular power, while engraved media such as stone or clay tablets were "biased" in favour of continuity in time and metaphysical or religious knowledge. McLuhan focused on what may be called a medium's "sensory bias" arguing, for example, that books and newspapers appealed to the rationality of the eye, while radio played to the irrationality of the ear. The differences in the Innisian and McLuhanesque approaches were summarized by the late James W. Carey:

Both McLuhan and Innis assume the centrality of communication technology; where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has much to say about perception and thought but little to say about institutions; Innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought.
Biographer John Watson notes that Innis's work was profoundly political while McLuhan's was not. He writes that "the mechanization of knowledge, not the relative sensual bias of media, is the key to Innis's work. This also underlies the politicization of Innis's position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan." Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. "For Innis, the <a href="Yellow%20journalism">yellow press</a> of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command." Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the "<a href="dialectic">dialectic</a> of power and knowledge" in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan's.

As scholars and teachers, Innis and McLuhan shared a similar dilemma since both argued that book culture tended to produce fixed points of view and homogeneity of thought; yet both produced many books. In his introduction to the 1964 reprint of "The Bias of Communication", McLuhan marvelled at Innis's technique of juxtaposing "his insights in a mosaic structure of seemingly unrelated and disproportioned sentences and aphorisms". McLuhan argued that although this made reading Innis's dense prose difficult—"a pattern of insights that are not packaged for the consumer palate"—Innis's method approximated "the natural form of conversation or dialogue rather than of written discourse". Best of all, it yielded "insight" and "pattern recognition" rather than the "classified knowledge" so overvalued by print-trained scholars. "How exciting it was to encounter a writer whose every phrase invited prolonged meditation and exploration", McLuhan added. McLuhan's own books with their reliance on aphorisms, puns, quips, "probes" and oddly juxtaposed observations also employ this mosaic technique.

Innis's theories of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: he had a profound influence on <a href="Media%20studies">critical media theory</a> and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation.

Anfield

Anfield is a <a href="association%20football">football</a> stadium in <a href="Anfield%2C%20Liverpool">Anfield, Liverpool</a>, England, which has a <a href="seating%20capacity">seating capacity</a> of 54,074, making it the <a href="List%20of%20football%20stadiums%20in%20England">sixth largest</a> football stadium in England. It has been the home of <a href="Liverpool%20FC">Liverpool FC</a> since their formation in 1892. It was originally the home of <a href="Everton%20FC">Everton FC</a> from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a> after a dispute with the club president.

The stadium has four stands: the <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadiums%29">Spion Kop</a>, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> in 1952. The ground converted to an <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a> in 1994 as a result of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>, which reduced its capacity.

Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a> and <a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a>. A statue of Shankly is also outside the stadium. The ground is from <a href="Liverpool%20Lime%20Street%20railway%20station">Liverpool Lime Street railway station</a>. It was proposed in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent <a href="Stanley%20Park%20Stadium">Stanley Park</a>, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by <a href="Fenway%20Sports%20Group">Fenway Sports Group</a> in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen.

Construction for an extension to the Main Stand began on 8 December 2014. This extension increased the stadium capacity to 54,074, making it one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football. There are future plans to expand the Anfield Road Stand which would bring the stadium size to around 61,000. Liverpool F.C. officially opened the new stand to the public on 9 September 2016.

The name Anfield comes from the old town land of "Annefield" outside <a href="New%20Ross">New Ross</a>, <a href="County%20Wexford">County Wexford</a> in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>.

Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally owned by <a href="John%20Orrell%20%28English%20landowner%29">John Orrell</a>, a minor land owner who was a friend of <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton F.C.</a> member <a href="John%20Houlding">John Houlding</a>. Everton, who previously played at <a href="Priory%20Road">Priory Road</a>, were in need of a new venue owing to the noise produced by the crowd on match days. Orrell lent the pitch to the club in exchange for a small rent. The first match at the ground was between Everton and Earlestown on 28 September 1884, which Everton won 5–0. During Everton's tenure at the stadium, stands were erected for some of the 8,000-plus spectators regularly attending matches, although the ground was capable of holding around 20,000 spectators and occasionally did. The ground was considered of international standard at the time, playing host to the <a href="British%20Home%20Championship">British Home Championship</a> match between <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> and <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Ireland</a> in 1889. Anfield's first league match was played on 8 September 1888, between Everton and <a href="Accrington%20F.C.">Accrington F.C.</a> Everton quickly improved as a team, and became Anfield's first league champions in the <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1890–91</a> season.

In 1892, negotiations to purchase the land at Anfield from Orrell escalated into a dispute between Houlding and the Everton F.C. committee over how the club was run. Events culminated in Everton's move to <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a>. Houlding was left with an empty stadium, and decided to form a new club to occupy it. The new team was called <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd</a>, and the club's first match at Anfield was a <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly</a> played in front of 200 people on 1 September 1892, against <a href="Rotherham%20Town%20F.C.%20%281878%29">Rotherham Town</a>. Liverpool won 7–1.

Liverpool's first <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> match at Anfield was played on 9 September 1893, against <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a>. Liverpool won 4–0 in front of 5,000 spectators. A new stand capable of holding 3,000 spectators was constructed in 1895 on the site of the present Main Stand. Designed by architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a>, the stand had a distinctive red and white <a href="gable">gable</a>, and was similar to the main stand at <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United's</a> ground <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a>. Another stand was constructed at the Anfield Road end in 1903, built from timber and <a href="corrugated%20iron">corrugated iron</a>. After Liverpool had won their second League championship in <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">1906</a>, a new stand was built along the Walton Breck Road. Local journalist Ernest Edwards, who was the sports editor of newspapers the "<a href="Liverpool%20Daily%20Post">Liverpool Daily Post</a>" and "<a href="Liverpool%20Echo">Echo</a>", named it the <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadiums%29">Spion Kop</a>; it was named after a <a href="Battle%20of%20Spion%20Kop">famous hill</a> in South Africa where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the <a href="Boer%20War">Boer War</a> in 1900. More than 300 men had died, many of them from Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop. Around the same period a stand was also built along Kemlyn Road.

The ground remained much the same until 1928, when the Kop was redesigned and extended to hold 30,000 spectators, all standing. A roof was erected as well. Many stadia in England had stands named after the Spion Kop. Anfield's was the largest Kop in the country at the time—it was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds. In the same year the <a href="topmast">topmast</a> of the , one of the first iron ships, was rescued from the <a href="ship%20breaking">ship breaking</a> yard at nearby <a href="Rock%20Ferry">Rock Ferry</a>, and was hauled up Everton Valley by a team of horses, to be erected alongside the new Kop. It still stands there, serving as a flag pole.
<a href="Floodlight">Floodlight</a>s were installed at a cost of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the <a href="Liverpool%20County%20Football%20Association">Liverpool County Football Association</a>. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a>ed stand, built at a cost of £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent">the Duke of Kent</a> on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a>; his widow Nessie unlocked them for the first time on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words "You'll Never Walk Alone", the title of the <a href="You%27ll%20Never%20Walk%20Alone">hit song</a> by <a href="Gerry%20and%20the%20Pacemakers">Gerry and the Pacemakers</a> adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.

Coloured seats and a police room were added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included <a href="executive%20boxes">executive boxes</a> and <a href="conference%20hall">function suites</a> as well as 11,000 seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action. The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> president <a href="Lennart%20Johansson">Lennart Johansson</a>. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.

On 4 December 1997, a bronze statue of Bill Shankly was unveiled at the visitors' centre in front of the Kop. Standing at over tall, the statue depicts Shankly with a fan's scarf around his neck, in a familiar pose he adopted when receiving applause from fans. Inscribed on the statue are the words "Bill Shankly – He Made The People Happy". The Hillsborough memorial is situated alongside the Shankly Gates, and is always decorated with flowers and tributes to the 96 people who died in 1989 as a result of the disaster. At the centre of the memorial is an <a href="eternal%20flame">eternal flame</a>, signifying that those who died will never be forgotten. Since 2014, the memorial was temporarily removed during the expansion of the Main Stand of the stadium.

In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand has encountered a number of problems since its redevelopment; at the beginning of the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a> season, a series of support poles and <a href="stanchion">stanchion</a>s had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand. During <a href="Ronnie%20Moran">Ronnie Moran</a>'s <a href="testimonial%20match">testimonial match</a> against <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the <a href="seating%20capacity">seating capacity</a> in the paddock.

Anfield comprises 54,074 seats split between four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the Main Stand. The Anfield Road end and Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand are two-tiered, while the Kop is a single-tiered and the Main Stand a three-tiered. Entry to the stadium is gained by <a href="radio-frequency%20identification">radio-frequency identification</a> (RFID) <a href="smart%20card">smart card</a>s rather than the traditional manned <a href="turnstile">turnstile</a>. This system, used in all 80 turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005.

Plans to replace Anfield with a new 60,000-capacity stadium in adjacent <a href="Stanley%20Park%20Stadium">Stanley Park</a> were initiated in 2002. The plans were revisited under the ownership of <a href="Tom%20Hicks">Tom Hicks</a> and <a href="George%20N.%20Gillett%2C%20Jr.">George Gillett</a>. Following the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by <a href="Fenway%20Sports%20Group">Fenway Sports Group</a> in 2010, the owners have abandoned the proposed new stadium in Stanley Park, preferring instead to redevelop and expand Anfield, thus echoing their decision to renovate <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>.
The <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadiums%29">Kop</a> is a large single-tiered stand. Originally a large terraced banking providing accommodation for more than 30,000 spectators, the current incarnation was constructed in 1994–95 and is single-tiered with no executive boxes. The Kop houses the club's museum, the Reducate centre and the official club shop. The Kop is the most-renowned stand at Anfield among home and away supporters, with the people who occupy the stand referred to as kopites. Such was the reputation that the stand had it was claimed that the crowd in the Kop could suck the ball into the goal. Traditionally, Liverpool's most vocal supporters congregate in this stand.
The oldest stand at Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was completed in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors' box. The directors' VIP box is located at the rear of the lower tier of the stand. The old large roof was supported by two thin central uprights, with a large suspended television camera gantry which has moved to the front of the third tier The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating "THIS IS ANFIELD". Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally reached up and placed one or both hands on it as they passed underneath.

The sign was temporarily removed during the most recent reconstruction of the Main Stand; it was placed at the exit from the new Main Stand tunnel to the pitch in advance of Liverpool's <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a> home opener. Current Liverpool manager <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a> has banned players from touching the restored sign until the club has won at least one major trophy.

The Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand is a two-tiered stand. Originally a single-tiered stand called the Kemlyn Road Stand, the second tier was added in 1992 to coincide with the club's centenary. It is located opposite the Main Stand and houses directors' boxes, which are between the two tiers. The stand also houses the ground's police station. On 3 May 2017, Liverpool announced the Centenary Stand would be renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand in honour of the club's greatest servant, former player and manager <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a>.

The Anfield Road stand, on the left side of the Main Stand, houses the <a href="home%20%28sports%29">away fans</a> during matches. The Anfield Road End was rebuilt in 1965, and multi-coloured seats were added in 1982. Originally a single-tier stand, a further revamp, which was completed in 1998, gave the stand a second-tier providing additional seating.

There are 59 spaces available in the stadium to accommodate <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a> users who have season tickets; a further 33 spaces are available for general sale and 8 are allocated to away supporters. These spaces are located in the Main Stand, Anfield Road Stand and The Kop. There are 38 spaces available for the <a href="visually%20impaired">visually impaired</a>, which are situated in the old paddock area of the Main Stand, with space for one <a href="personal%20assistant">personal assistant</a> each. A headset with full <a href="play-by-play">commentary</a> is provided.

The stadium features tributes to two of the club's most successful managers. The Paisley Gateway is a tribute to <a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a>, who guided Liverpool to three <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>s and six <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">League Championships</a> in the 1970s, and 1980s. The gates were erected at the Kop; their design includes representations of the three European Cups Paisley won during his tenure, the crest of his birthplace in <a href="Hetton-le-Hole">Hetton-le-Hole</a>, and the crest of Liverpool F.C. The Shankly Gates, in tribute of <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a>, Paisley's predecessor between 1959 and 1974, are at the Anfield Road end. Their design includes a Scottish flag, a Scottish thistle, the Liverpool badge, and the words "You'll Never Walk Alone".

Anfield stadium is a <a href="UEFA%20stadium%20categories">UEFA category 4 stadium</a>.

Plans to replace Anfield were originally initiated by Liverpool F.C. in May 2002. The proposed capacity was 55,000, but it was later revised to 61,000, with 1,000 seats given for segregation between home and away fans. Several attempts were made between 2003 and 2007 by the <a href="Liverpool%20City%20Council">Liverpool City Council</a> to instigate a <a href="groundshare">groundshare</a> of the proposed stadium with local rivals Everton, but this move was rejected, as neither club favoured it. On 30 July 2004 Liverpool was granted planning permission to build a new stadium away from Anfield at Stanley Park. On 8 September 2006 Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool F.C. a <a href="999-year%20lease">999-year lease</a> of the land on the proposed site.

Following the takeover of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by <a href="George%20N.%20Gillett%2C%20Jr.">George Gillett</a> and <a href="Tom%20Hicks">Tom Hicks</a>, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout was approved by the council, and construction was due to start in early 2008. The new stadium, provisionally called <a href="Stanley%20Park%20Stadium">Stanley Park Stadium</a>, was to be built by <a href="HKS%2C%20Inc.">HKS, Inc.</a>. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000. If the new stadium had been built, Anfield would have been demolished. The land would have become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would have included a hotel, restaurants, and offices. However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the <a href="economic%20crisis%20of%202008">economic crisis of 2008</a> and the subsequent <a href="recession">recession</a>, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with <a href="bank%20loan">borrowed money</a>, not the owners' <a href="Financial%20capital">capital</a>, and interest rates were higher than expected. Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60 days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated £500 million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield.

The acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by <a href="Fenway%20Sports%20Group">Fenway Sports Group</a> in October 2010 put into question whether Liverpool would leave Anfield. In February 2011 the new club owner, <a href="John%20W.%20Henry">John W. Henry</a>, stated he had a preference for remaining at Anfield and expanding the capacity. After attending a number of games at Anfield, Henry stated that "the Kop is unrivalled", adding "it would be hard to replicate that feeling anywhere else".
On 15 October 2012, Liverpool City Council announced plans to regenerate the Anfield area after securing a £25m grant, with a housing association also set to invest.
On 23 August 2013 Anfield was listed as an Asset of Community Value by Liverpool City Council. On 11 September, current owner, John W. Henry announced that they had the funds to afford the expansion but they are waiting for the City Council to finalise the purchase of houses in the area before they commit to plans to expand the Main Stand and the Anfield Road end of the ground.
In April 2014 Liverpool F.C. signed a legal agreement with Liverpool City Council and Your Housing Group to redevelop the surrounding Anfield area. This was seen as a significant step towards the renovation of the stadium. The redevelopment was worth around £260 million.

On 23 April 2014, Liverpool F.C. revealed plans for an expansion of the Main Stand, which involved adding new third tier, new matchday facilities and enhanced corporate facilities. The new stand would add 8,500 seats and take the capacity of the stadium to 54,742. Work began on 8 December 2014, with the club aiming for the new stand to be match-ready and operational for the start of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League">2016–17 season</a>. The work was undertaken by <a href="Carillion">Carillion</a>.The structure of new stand was uniquely constructed around the existing main stand to enable the existing stand to continue to be used at full operational capacity during the 2015-16 season. Demolition of the existing stand took place in summer 2016, allowing for the construction of the lower tiers of the new stand during the off-season. Consisting of 1.8 million bricks and blocks and over 5000 tonnes of steel, the stand was opened on schedule on 9 September 2016 for the first home game of the 2016-17 season, a 4-1 victory over <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>. Further internal construction work including new changing rooms and media facilities continued until April 2017.

In May 2016, outline planning permission was granted by Liverpool council for the construction of a new 1,800 sq m club superstore development, situated on Walton Breck Road on the corner of the Kop and the new Main Stand. Construction began in December 2016, with the store opening early in the 2017-18 season. The space between the new store and the stadium was developed into a "fan zone", with new catering outlets and pre-match entertainment.

The second phase of Anfield's redevelopment is to redevelop the Anfield Road stand. The club received initial outline planning permission in 2014 for the redevelopment, with seating to be increased by 4,825, giving Anfield a total capacity of 58,000. However, it has since been reported that the club are looking to increase capacity further to "above 60,000", with Liverpool FC chief operating officer Andy Hughes stating that "one of our main objectives is to maximise capacity in this design".

As of 2018, the club are conducting feasibility studies and detailed planning work into a new stand, with a view to making a decision on the proposed redevelopment in the near future. Initial outline planning permission expires in September 2019, although changes in design means plans may have to be resubmitted for approval.

Anfield has hosted numerous international matches, and was one of the venues used during <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201996">UEFA Euro 1996</a>; the ground hosted three group games and a quarter-final. The first international match hosted at Anfield was between <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> and <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Ireland</a>, in 1889. England won the match 6–1. Anfield was also the home venue for several of England's international football matches in the early 1900s, and for the <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Welsh national team</a> in the later part of that century. Anfield has also played host to five FA Cup semi-finals, the last of which was in 1929. The most recent international to be hosted at Anfield was England's 2–1 victory over <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a> on 1 March 2006. England has played two testimonial matches against Liverpool at Anfield. The first was in 1983, when England faced Liverpool for <a href="Phil%20Thompson">Phil Thompson</a>'s testimonial. Then, in 1988, England visited again for <a href="Alan%20Hansen">Alan Hansen</a>'s testimonial. Liverpool's <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">arch rival</a> <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> played their first home game of the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1971–72</a> season at Anfield as they were banned from playing their first two home league matches at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> after an incident of hooliganism. United beat <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 3–1.

The stadium has hosted five <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> matches: the 1989 <a href="Rugby%20League%20Charity%20Shield%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Charity Shield</a> between <a href="Widnes%20Vikings">Widnes</a> and <a href="Wigan%20Warriors">Wigan</a>; the <a href="1991%20World%20Club%20Challenge">1991 World Club Challenge</a> between Wigan, winners of the <a href="Rugby%20Football%20League%20Championship">RFL Championship</a>, and <a href="Penrith%20Panthers">Penrith Panthers</a>, winners of the Australian <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League%20premiership">NSWRL Premiership</a>, with an attendance of 20,152; a 1997 <a href="St%20Helens%20R.F.C.">St. Helens</a> <a href="Super%20League%20II">Super League</a> home game against <a href="Castleford%20Tigers">Castleford Tigers</a>, with an attendance of 12,329; and the <a href="2016%20Rugby%20League%20Four%20Nations%20Final">2016 Rugby League Four Nations Final</a>, in front of 40,042 people.

Anfield was chosen as the venue for the 2019 Magic Weekend after two test matches were played there in 2016 and 2018. After previously choosing games that were local derbies or competitive games, in 2019 the fixtures were determined by the previous seasons league position.

Robert Elstone, Super League Chief Executive, said “On behalf of the Super League clubs, we’re delighted to be taking the Dacia Magic Weekend to one of the most famous stadiums in the world.

Anfield has been the venue for many other events. During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the finishing line for the city <a href="marathon">marathon</a>. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George's plateau in the city centre and finished with a lap of Anfield. <a href="Boxing">Boxing</a> matches were regularly held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 <a href="Nel%20Tarleton">Nel Tarleton</a> beat <a href="Freddie%20Miller%20%28boxer%29">Freddie Miller</a> for the <a href="List%20of%20featherweight%20boxing%20champions">World Featherweight title</a>.

In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring the <a href="Harlem%20Globetrotters">Harlem Globetrotters</a> was held at the ground.

Aside from sporting uses, Anfield has been a venue for musicians of different genres as well as evangelical preachers. One week in July 1984, the American <a href="Evangelism">evangelist</a> <a href="Billy%20Graham">Billy Graham</a> preached at Anfield, attracting crowds of over 30,000 each night. Anfield was featured in Liverpool's 2008 <a href="European%20Capital%20of%20Culture">European Capital of Culture</a> celebrations: 36,000 people attended a concert on 1 June 2008, featuring <a href="The%20Zutons">The Zutons</a>, <a href="Kaiser%20Chiefs">Kaiser Chiefs</a>, and <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>.

The Phantom Tollbooth

The Phantom Tollbooth is a <a href="Children%27s%20literature">children's</a> <a href="Fantasy%20literature">fantasy</a> <a href="adventure%20novel">adventure novel</a> written by <a href="Norton%20Juster">Norton Juster</a> with illustrations by <a href="Jules%20Feiffer">Jules Feiffer</a>, published in <a href="1961%20in%20literature">1961</a> by <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> in the US.

In 1958, Juster had received a <a href="Ford%20Foundation">Ford Foundation</a> grant for a children's book about "cities". Unable to make progress on that project, he turned to writing what became "The Phantom Tollbooth", his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. <a href="Jason%20Epstein">Jason Epstein</a>, an editor at Random House, bought the book and published it. It received rave reviews and has sold in excess of three million copies, far more than expected. It has been adapted into <a href="The%20Phantom%20Tollbooth%20%28film%29">a film</a>, <a href="opera">opera</a>, and <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">play</a>, and translated into many different languages.

"The Phantom Tollbooth" is the story of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic <a href="toll%20road">tollbooth</a> one afternoon, and, having nothing better to do, drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the "Kingdom of Wisdom", once prosperous but now troubled. There he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to find two exiled princesses—Rhyme and Reason—from the "Castle in the Air" and bring them back to the kingdom. In the process, he learns valuable lessons and finds a love of learning. The writing is full of <a href="pun">pun</a>s and <a href="wordplay">wordplay</a>, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps to "Conclusions", an island in "Wisdom", thus exploring the <a href="Literal%20meaning">literal meanings</a> of <a href="idiom">idiom</a>s.

Although the book is an <a href="adventure%20story">adventure story</a> at first glance, one of its major themes is the need for a love of <a href="education">education</a>; this is how Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared the book's appeal to that of <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>" and to <a href="L.%20Frank%20Baum">L. Frank Baum</a>'s "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20Wizard%20of%20Oz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a>".

Milo is a boy bored by the world around him; every activity seems a waste of time. He arrives home from another boring day at school to find a mysterious package. Among its contents are a small tollbooth and a map of "the Lands Beyond", illustrating the Kingdom of Wisdom (which will also guide the reader from its place on the <a href="endpaper">endpaper</a>s of the book). Attached to the package is a note "For Milo, who has plenty of time". Warned by an included sign to have his destination in mind, he decides without much thought to go to Dictionopolis, assuming this is a pretend game to be played on the floor of his room. He maneuvers through the tollbooth in his electric toy car, and instantly finds himself driving on a road that is clearly not in his city apartment.

Milo begins with Expectations, a pleasant place where he starts on Wisdom's road. In Expectations, he seeks directions from the Whether Man, who is full of endless talk. As Milo drives on, he daydreams and soon is paying no attention at all, and gets lost in the <a href="Doldrums">Doldrums</a>, a colorless place where nothing ever happens. Milo is soon joining the inhabitants, the Lethargarians, in killing time there, a pastime angrily interrupted by the arrival of Tock, a talking, oversize dog with an alarm clock on each side (a "watchdog"), who tells Milo that only by thinking can he get out of the Doldrums. Head abuzz with unaccustomed thoughts, Milo is soon back on his road, and the watchdog joins him on his journey through Wisdom.

Milo and Tock travel to Dictionopolis, one of two capital cities of the divided Kingdom of Wisdom, and home to King Azaz the Unabridged. They meet King Azaz's cabinet officials and visit the Word Market, where the words and letters are sold that empower the world. A fight between the Spelling Bee and the blustering <a href="Humbug">Humbug</a> breaks up the market, and Milo and Tock are arrested by the very short Officer Shrift. In prison, Milo meets the Which (not to be confused with Witch), also known as Faintly Macabre, long in charge of which words should be used in Wisdom. She tells him how the two rulers, King Azaz and his brother, the Mathemagician, had two adopted younger sisters, Rhyme and Reason, to whom everyone came to settle disputes. All lived in harmony until the rulers disagreed with the princesses' decision that <a href="letter%20%28alphabet%29">letters</a> (championed by Azaz) and <a href="number">number</a>s (by the Mathemagician) were equally important. They banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air, and since then, the land has had neither Rhyme nor Reason.

Milo and Tock leave the dungeon. King Azaz hosts them at a banquet where the guests literally eat their words, served to them on plates. After the meal, King Azaz lets Milo and Tock talk themselves into a dangerous quest to rescue the princesses. Azaz flatters the Humbug into being their guide, and boy, dog and insect set off for the Mathemagician's capital of Digitopolis as they must gain his approval before they can begin their quest.

Along the way, they meet such characters as Alec Bings, a little boy suspended in the air who sees through things and who will grow down until he reaches the ground. Milo then loses time in substituting for Chroma the Great, a conductor whose <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a> creates the colors of the world.

In Digitopolis, they meet the Mathemagician, who is still angry at Azaz, and who will not give his blessing to anything that his brother has approved. Milo maneuvers him into saying he will permit the quest if the boy can show the two have concurred on anything since they banished the princesses. To the number wizard's shock, Milo proves that the two have agreed to disagree, and the Mathemagician gives his reluctant consent.

In the Mountains of Ignorance, the journeyers contend with demons like the Terrible Trivium and the Gelatinous Giant. After overcoming testing obstacles and their own fears, they reach the Castle in the Air. Princesses Rhyme and Reason welcome Milo and agree to return to Wisdom. Unable to enter the castle, the demons cut it loose, letting it drift away, but Milo realizes Tock can carry them down because time flies. The demons pursue, but the armies of Wisdom repel them. Rhyme and Reason heal the divisions in the old Kingdom of Wisdom, Azaz and the Mathemagician are reconciled, and all enjoy a three-day celebration.

Milo says goodbye and drives back through the tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens the next day with plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, "For Milo, who now knows the way." The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding direction in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for there is so much to do right where he is.

Architect <a href="Norton%20Juster">Norton Juster</a> was living in his hometown of <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, after three years in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">navy</a>. In June 1960, he gained a $5,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to write a children's book about cities. Juster argued that the young <a href="baby%20boomer">baby boomer</a>s would soon have responsibility for the cities, and many lived in the suburbs and did not know them. In his proposal, he said he wanted "to stimulate and heighten perception – to help children notice and appreciate the visual world around them – to help excite them and shape their interest in an environment they will eventually reshape." Beginning with great enthusiasm, he ground to a halt with too many notes and too little progress. He took a weekend break with friends at <a href="Fire%20Island">Fire Island</a>, and came back determined to put aside the cities book and seek inspiration in another writing project.
Juster's guilt over his lack of progress on the cities book had led him to write pieces of stories about a little boy named Milo, which he began to develop into a book.
Juster quit his job so that he could work on the book. His imagination fired by a boy who approached him on the street and with whom he discussed the nature of infinity, Juster wanted to finish the story about "a boy who asked too many questions" before returning to the book on cities. Juster shared his house in <a href="Brooklyn%20Heights">Brooklyn Heights</a> with cartoonist <a href="Jules%20Feiffer">Jules Feiffer</a> whose bedroom was immediately below, and who could hear him pacing in the night. Feiffer was surprised to learn that his friend's insomnia was not caused by the cities book, but by a book about a boy. Juster showed Feiffer the draft to date and, unbidden, the artist began sketching illustrations. Feiffer knew Judy Sheftel, who put deals together in the publishing trade and was his future bride. Sheftel got <a href="Jason%20Epstein">Jason Epstein</a>, an innovative editor at <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> with a deep appreciation for children's literature, to agree to review the manuscript. Some at Random House considered the book's vocabulary too difficult: at the time, educators advised against children's literature containing words the target audience did not already know, fearing the unfamiliar would discourage young learners. Based on seven chapters of manuscript, plus a three-page outline of the rest of the story, Epstein bought the book.
Since Juster did the cooking for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, he had to do the drawings. Feiffer quickly realized the book would require illustrations of the type and quality that <a href="John%20Tenniel">John Tenniel</a> had created for <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>" and although a nationally known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book to be a success and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a>'s drawings as an inspiration.

It became a game, with Feiffer trying to draw things the way he wanted, and Juster trying to describe things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.

Repeated edits altered the protagonist's name (originally Tony), removed his parents entirely from the book, and deleted text attempting to describe how the tollbooth package had been delivered. Milo's age was removed from the text—early drafts have him aged eight or nine—as Juster decided not to state it, lest potential readers decide they were too old to care.

Since no one has ever bothered to explain the importance of learning to Milo, he regards school as the biggest waste of time in his life. Juster intended that the book speak to the importance of learning to love learning. Teaching methods that might bore children, by memorization for example, are mocked in the book, as in the case of the Spelling Bee. Like the Bee, the Humbug's insult to his fellow insect goes over Milo's head, but possibly not the reader's: "A slavish concern for the composition of words is the sign of a bankrupt intellect." According to Mary Liston in her journal article on law in fantasy realms, ""The Phantom Tollbooth" concerns the difference between education and wisdom and what processes are conducive to synthesizing both, so as to encourage an attitude of engagement, alertness, and responsibility within an increasingly autonomous individual."

Another theme is the need for common sense to back up rules. Milo journeys through a land where, without Rhyme or Reason, the art of governance has been lost, leading to bizarre results. Milo repeatedly meets characters to whom words are more important than their meaning. The Whether Man, for all his talk, is unable to provide Milo with the information or guidance the boy wants, while Officer Shrift's investigation of the overturning of the Word Market contains the forms of law, without justice. The denizens around Digitopolis are little better; the twelve-faced <a href="regular%20dodecahedron">Dodecahedron</a>, named for what he is, turns the logic of his naming on its head when he asks if everyone with one face is called Milo. The attitudes now displayed by the adherents of both brothers are summed up by the Dodecahedron, "as long as the answer is right, who cares if the question is wrong?"

As Milo struggles with words and begins the process of making himself their master, he also has difficulty with numbers, especially when he speaks with .58 of a child, who with parents and two siblings (whom Milo does not meet) makes up an average family. Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, is that many of the things which can never be, often are". Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, "You must never feel badly about making mistakes ... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons". An index card in the Juster papers sets forth the germ of the princess' "memorable" counsel to Milo, "Quite often the road to Rhyme + Reason is through the right mistakes."

Although Milo is bored with learning, that does not mean he knew nothing before his journey. He exhibits characteristics of a well-schooled child of his time; his speech is polite and peppered with "please" and "thank you", and when he unexpectedly encounters the partial child, he requests pardon for staring. He can count to a thousand, though his tact in bringing up the subject in the presence of the numbers-hating King Azaz is not the best. Mindful of his mother's admonition to eat lightly when a guest, he initially orders a light meal at the banquet, only to find the waiters bringing in insubstantial light beams. Not realizing he will be asked to eat his words, he then makes a plausible start at a speech before being interrupted by the king.
"The Phantom Tollbooth" displays Milo's growth; Leonard S. Marcus in his notes to its annotated edition writes that the boy learns to think in the abstract, pledging after his unintentional jump to Conclusions that he will not make up his mind again without a good reason. Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not. Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it will be like to do the same. According to Liston, Milo "transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities".

Even though the day is won by Milo and his fellow questers, it is a great but not a permanent victory, as he hears the kingly brothers begin to argue again as he departs. Juster has written that it was his intent to get Milo out of there as quickly as possible, and that "the fight would have to be won again and again".

Milo's trip through the lands beyond the tollbooth teaches the previously bored child to appreciate both journey and destination. This is a lesson that had been unlearned by the citizens of Wisdom, as exemplified by the described fate of the twin cities of Reality and Illusions. Although the city of Illusions never actually existed, Reality was lost as its residents concentrated on getting to their destination as quickly as possible, and, unappreciated, the city withered away, unnoticed by the busy people who still hasten along its former streets. Milo meets his trials by defining himself as different from the kingdom's inhabitants, who either demand or accept conformity, as enforced by the kingdom's laws, which discourage (and even outlaw) thought. Milo cannot accept such laws, beginning when, in the Doldrums, he thinks, thus violating a local ordinance and separating himself from the thoughtless inhabitants. Liston opined that because the Kingdom of Wisdom's "laws require the impossible, they contradict what it means to be fully human".

"The Phantom Tollbooth" contains allusions to many works, including those loved by Juster in his own upbringing. Some of Juster's favorite books as a child, including "<a href="The%20Wind%20in%20the%20Willows">The Wind in the Willows</a>", had endpaper maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer's opposition, going so far as to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style. Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel's love of <a href="pun">pun</a>s, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio. According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to <a href="radio%20serial">radio serial</a>s helped inspire "The Phantom Tollbooth", as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on <a href="sidekick">sidekick</a> Jim Fairfield from "<a href="Jack%20Armstrong%2C%20the%20All-American%20Boy">Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy</a>". Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit. As a child, Juster had <a href="synesthesia">synesthesia</a>, and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. He remembered that the condition affected word associations. "One of the things I always did was think literally when I heard words. On the "<a href="Lone%20Ranger">Lone Ranger</a>" [radio serial] they would say, 'Here come the Injuns!' and I always had an image of engines, of train engines."
Some of the incidents in the book stem from Juster's own past. In Digitopolis, the Numbers Mine, where gemlike numerals are dug for, recalled one of Juster's architecture professors at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, who compared numbers and equations to jewels. The <a href="Marx%20Brothers">Marx Brothers</a> films were a staple for Juster as a child and his father would quote lengthy passages from the movies; this inspired the unending series of straight-faced puns that fills the book.

Growing up in a <a href="Jewish-American">Jewish-American</a> household where the parents demanded high achievement, Juster was intimately familiar with expectations, though in his case many of his parents' hopes were centered on his older brother, an academic star. The Terrible Trivium, the well-dressed, polite demon who sets the questers to mindless tasks, was Juster's way of representing his own tendency to avoid what he should be doing in favor of a more congenial occupation, such as his evasion of the grant project to write "The Phantom Tollbooth". Juster drew on Feiffer's life experiences as well; the Whether Man's adage "Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens" was a favorite of the cartoonist's mother.

Juster had not read "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" when he wrote "The Phantom Tollbooth", but the two books, each about a bored child plunged into a world of absurd logic, have repeatedly been compared. According to Daniel Hahn in his 2012 article on the Juster book, "Alice is clearly Milo's closest literary kin". Milo's conversation with the Whether Man, which leaves him no more comprehending than when he came, recalls that of Alice with the <a href="Cheshire%20Cat">Cheshire Cat</a>. The questions of authority (something omnipresent for a child) and of justice run through both books; the <a href="Queen%20of%20Hearts%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Queen of Hearts'</a> arbitrary justice is echoed, though with less violence, by Officer Shrift. Alice's sovereigns, representing the authority figures of <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> childhood life, rule absolutely (though not necessarily effectively); a child of the post-<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> world, Milo journeys through a more bureaucratic realm. His quest is far more purposeful than the frustrating journey Alice experiences, and the outcome differs as well—Milo restores his kingdom while Alice overturns hers. Carroll leaves us uncertain if Alice has learned anything from her adventures, but Juster makes it clear that Milo has acquired tools he will need to find his way through life.

"The Phantom Tollbooth" was published in September 1961. Its competition among new books for the minds and hearts of children included <a href="Roald%20Dahl">Roald Dahl</a>'s "<a href="James%20and%20the%20Giant%20Peach">James and the Giant Peach</a>". "<a href="The%20Bronze%20Bow">The Bronze Bow</a>", set in the Biblical times, was newly available, and would bring <a href="Elizabeth%20George%20Speare">Elizabeth George Speare</a> her second <a href="Newbery%20Award">Newbery Award</a> in three years. Neither publisher nor first-time author expected many sales for "The Phantom Tollbooth", but Juster was nevertheless disappointed not to find his work on store shelves. His mother, Minnie, did her part, as her son put it, "terrorizing" bookstore owners into displaying it.
Juster says the book was rescued from the remainders table when Emily Maxwell wrote a strong review of it in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>". Maxwell wrote, "As "<a href="Pilgrim%27s%20Progress">Pilgrim's Progress</a>" is concerned with the awakening of the sluggardly spirit, "The Phantom Tollbooth" is concerned with the awakening of the lazy mind." Hers was far from the only positive piece; children's author <a href="Ann%20McGovern">Ann McGovern</a> reviewed it for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", writing "Norton Juster's amazing fantasy has something wonderful for anyone old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of "Alice in Wonderland" and the pointed whimsy of "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20Wizard%20of%20Oz">The Wizard of Oz</a>" ". <a href="John%20Crosby%20%28media%20critic%29">John Crosby</a> wrote for the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>", "In a world which sometimes seems to have gone mad, it is refreshing to pause and consider for a moment a book for children which contains a character called 'Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which.' The name of the book is "The Phantom Tollbooth" and it was written by a bearded elf named Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer, who is the cleverest of the young neurotics". Dissenting was the "<a href="Bulletin%20of%20the%20Center%20for%20Children%27s%20Books">Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</a>", which in March 1962 deemed the book an "intensive and extensive fantasy, heavily burdened with contrivance and whimsy".

In 1962, the book was published in Britain. Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>", ""The Phantom Tollbooth" is something every adult seems sure will turn into a modern "Alice" ... The obvious guess is that the appeal of this sort of writing is directed towards just the sort of adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the "Alices". As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up's favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer." Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for "<a href="The%20Listener%20%28magazine%29">The Listener</a>", "This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of "Pilgrim's Progress" of a little boy in his car ... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron. the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) make it that rare delight, a book which parents and children can share." It reached Australia in 1963; "<a href="The%20Canberra%20Times">The Canberra Times</a>"' reviewer, J.E.B., deemed it memorable, causing readers to quote from it and leaf through its pages again.

After publication, Juster sent a copy of the book to the Ford Foundation, with an explanation of how the projected book on cities had transformed into "The Phantom Tollbooth". He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years "and they'll talk to me about a whole different book, normally. But now they've got a lot more of the words right. A lot more of the fun kind of crazy references". He learned too that readers were capable of more than he had intended, as in the case of the letter sent by the Mathemagician to King Azaz. Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set about breaking it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful. The numbers were not intended to have any meaning, and were meant to convey that the Mathemagician's letter could not have been understood by Azaz or his advisers.
As the book became acclaimed as a modern classic, it began to be used in the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist <a href="Cathleen%20Schine">Cathleen Schine</a> recalled, "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." British fantasy writer <a href="Diana%20Wynne%20Jones">Diana Wynne Jones</a> read her copy so often it fell apart: "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like "The Wizard of Oz", only better." One reader, signing himself "Milo", wrote to "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" in 1970, "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up "The Phantom Tollbooth", by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype."

The book continued to garner positive reviews and comments. In 1998, Amanda Foreman wrote for "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" of London, "I want to shout about "The Phantom" from the rooftops. I want to stand in <a href="London%20Waterloo%20station">Waterloo</a> and press copies into people's hands. This is a book that should be in every home. ... Whether you are 8 or 88 Juster's mixture of allegorical wisdom and logical whimsy will take you on a journey of the spirit. "The Phantom" is a "<a href="mappa%20mundi">mappa mundi</a>" of our hearts, proving once again that in laughter and simplicity lies the truth of life". In a 2011 article written for the book's fiftieth anniversary, <a href="Adam%20Gopnik">Adam Gopnik</a> wrote, "The book is made magical by Juster's and Feiffer's gift for transforming abstract philosophical ideas into unforgettable images."

The book has been translated into many foreign languages, including Chinese, Croatian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Thai, Turkish and three different Spanish editions: one for Spain, one for Latin America, and one for Spanish speakers in the United States. Juster states that he does not know if the wordplay of the original carries through to the translated works. In 1969, <a href="Chuck%20Jones">Chuck Jones</a> made "The Phantom Tollbooth" into a musical film <a href="The%20Phantom%20Tollbooth%20%28film%29">of the same name</a>, produced and released by <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> in 1970. Milo's town and room were depicted in live-action, and with the film changing to animation beyond the tollbooth. Juster disliked the film, describing it as "drivel". In February 2010, director <a href="Gary%20Ross">Gary Ross</a> began development of a remake of "The Phantom Tollbooth", with the first draft of the script written by <a href="Alex%20Tse">Alex Tse</a>. As of August 2016, the remake has moved to <a href="TriStar%20Pictures">TriStar Pictures</a>, with Michael Vukadinovich writing the adaption. The classical composer Robert Xavier Rodriguez in 1987 composed "A Colorful Symphony" based on the work.

In 2011, "The Annotated Phantom Tollbooth" was published, which includes sketches and copies of Juster's handwritten drafts and word lists, Feiffer's early drawings, and an introduction and annotations by Leonard S. Marcus. A fiftieth anniversary edition was also published, with appreciations by <a href="Maurice%20Sendak">Maurice Sendak</a>, <a href="Michael%20Chabon">Michael Chabon</a> and <a href="Philip%20Pullman">Philip Pullman</a>. More than three million copies have been sold of the original book in the U.S. alone. It has been adapted into a small-scale opera with music by <a href="Arnold%20Black">Arnold Black</a>, and a book by Juster and <a href="Sheldon%20Harnick">Sheldon Harnick</a>, produced by <a href="Opera%20Delaware">Opera Delaware</a> in 1995. It was then revamped into a musical that had its debut to strong reviews at the <a href="Kennedy%20Center">Kennedy Center</a> in Washington, D.C. and then made a national tour.

"The Phantom Tollbooth" remains acknowledged as a classic of children's literature. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. <a href="National%20Education%20Association">National Education Association</a> named it one of "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children". In 2012, it was ranked number 21 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by "<a href="School%20Library%20Journal">School Library Journal</a>".

In 2017, <a href="TriStar%20Pictures">TriStar Pictures</a> announced that <a href="Matt%20Shakman">Matt Shakman</a> would direct its upcoming "live-action/hybrid" film adaptation of "The Phantom Tollbooth". In 2018, <a href="Carlos%20Saldanha">Carlos Saldanha</a> replaced Shankman due to scheduling conflicts. <a href="Theodore%20Melfi">Theodore Melfi</a> is drafting the screenplay after Michael Vukadinovich and <a href="Phil%20Johnston%20%28filmmaker%29">Phil Johnston</a>.

Juster feels that his book still has relevance today, although children's lives have changed since 1961:

Rumours (album)

Rumours is the eleventh studio album by English-American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>, released on 4 February 1977 by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>. Largely recorded in California in 1976, it was produced by the band with <a href="Ken%20Caillat">Ken Caillat</a> and <a href="Richard%20Dashut">Richard Dashut</a>. The band wanted to expand on the commercial success of their <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac%20%281975%20album%29">eponymous 1975 album</a>, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The "Rumours" studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife among band members, which shaped the album's lyrics.

Recorded with the intention of making "a <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> album", the album's music featured a <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a> and <a href="soft%20rock">soft rock</a> sound characterized by <a href="accent%20%28music%29">accented</a> rhythms and electric keyboards such as the <a href="Fender%20Rhodes">Fender Rhodes</a> or <a href="Hammond%20B3%20organ">Hammond B3 organ</a>. The members partied and used <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> for much of the recording sessions, and its completion was delayed by its mixing process, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours. "Rumours" reached the top of both the <a href="Billboard%20200">US "Billboard" 200</a> and the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">United Kingdom Albums Chart</a>, and became the band's most successful release. The songs "<a href="Go%20Your%20Own%20Way">Go Your Own Way</a>", "<a href="Dreams%20%28Fleetwood%20Mac%20song%29">Dreams</a>", "<a href="Don%27t%20Stop%20%28Fleetwood%20Mac%20song%29">Don't Stop</a>", and "<a href="You%20Make%20Loving%20Fun">You Make Loving Fun</a>" were released as <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a>, all of which reached the US top 10.

Having won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Grammy Award for Album of the Year</a> in 1978, "Rumours" has since sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20albums">best-selling albums of all time</a>, and has received diamond certifications in several countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. The album garnered widespread acclaim from critics, with praise centred on its production quality and <a href="harmonies">harmonies</a>, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists and has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres.

Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and of all time. In 2004, "Rumours" was <a href="remastered">remastered</a> and reissued with the addition of "<a href="Silver%20Springs%20%28song%29">Silver Springs</a>", which had been excluded from the original due to tension within the band, and a bonus CD of <a href="outtake">outtake</a>s from the recording sessions. In 2018, the album was selected for preservation in the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a>, being deemed "culturally, historically, or artistically significant" by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>.

In July 1975, Fleetwood Mac's eponymous <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac%20%281975%20album%29">tenth album</a> was released to great commercial success, reaching No. 1 <a href="Billboard%20200">in the U.S.</a> in 1976. The record's biggest hit single, "<a href="Rhiannon%20%28song%29">Rhiannon</a>", gave the band extensive radio exposure. At the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up consisted of guitarist and vocalist <a href="Lindsey%20Buckingham">Lindsey Buckingham</a>, drummer <a href="Mick%20Fleetwood">Mick Fleetwood</a>, keyboard player and vocalist <a href="Christine%20McVie">Christine McVie</a>, bass guitarist <a href="John%20McVie">John McVie</a>, and vocalist <a href="Stevie%20Nicks">Stevie Nicks</a>. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending eight years of marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks—who had joined the band before 1975's "Fleetwood Mac", after guitarist <a href="Bob%20Welch%20%28musician%29">Bob Welch</a> had left—were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often. The duo's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife <a href="Jenny%20Boyd">Jenny</a>, mother of his two children, had an affair with his best friend.

Press intrusions into the band members' lives led to inaccurate stories. Christine McVie was reported to be in hospital with a serious illness, while Buckingham and Nicks were declared the parents of Fleetwood's daughter Lucy after being photographed with her. The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members <a href="Peter%20Green%20%28musician%29">Peter Green</a>, <a href="Danny%20Kirwan">Danny Kirwan</a>, and <a href="Jeremy%20Spencer">Jeremy Spencer</a> for a 10th anniversary tour. Despite false reports, the band did not change its line-up, although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new album began. Fleetwood has noted the "tremendous emotional sacrifices" made by everyone just to attend studio work. In early 1976, Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida. Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense with the services of their previous producer, <a href="Keith%20Olsen">Keith Olsen</a>, because he favoured a lower emphasis on the <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a>. The duo formed a company called Seedy Management to represent the band's interests.

In February 1976, Fleetwood Mac convened at the <a href="Record%20Plant">Record Plant</a> in <a href="Sausalito%2C%20California">Sausalito, California</a>, with hired <a href="audio%20engineer">engineers</a> Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. Production duties were shared by the three parties, while the more technically adept Caillat was responsible for most of the engineering; he took a leave of absence from <a href="Wally%20Heider%20Studios">Wally Heider Studios</a> in Los Angeles on the premise that Fleetwood Mac would eventually use their facilities. The set-up in Sausalito included a number of small recording rooms in a large, windowless wooden building. Most band members complained about the studio and wanted to record at their homes, but Fleetwood did not allow any moves. Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city's harbour, while the male contingent stayed at the studio's lodge in the adjacent hills. Recording occurred in a six-by-nine-metre room which included a <a href="3M">3M</a> <a href="multitrack%20recording">24-track tape machine</a>, a range of high-quality microphones, and an <a href="Automated%20Processes%2C%20Inc.">API</a> <a href="mixing%20console">mixing console</a> with 550A equalisers; the latter were used to control frequency differences or a track's <a href="timbre">timbre</a>. Although Caillat was impressed with the set-up, he felt that the room lacked ambience because of its "very dead speakers" and large amounts of <a href="soundproofing">soundproofing</a>.

The record's <a href="working%20title">working title</a> in Sausalito was "Yesterday's Gone". Buckingham took charge of the studio sessions to make "a pop album". According to Dashut, while Fleetwood and the McVies came from an improvisational <a href="blues-rock">blues-rock</a> background, the guitarist understood "the craft of record making". During the formative stages of compositions, Buckingham and Christine McVie played guitar and piano together to create the album's basic structures. The latter was the only classically trained musician in Fleetwood Mac, but both shared a similar sense of musicality. When the band <a href="jam%20%28music%29">jammed</a>, Fleetwood often played his drum kit outside the studio's partition screen to better gauge Caillat's and Dashut's reactions to the music's <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a>. <a href="Sound%20baffle">Baffles</a> were placed around the drums and around John McVie, who played his bass guitar facing Fleetwood. Buckingham performed close to the rhythm section, while Christine McVie's keyboards were kept away from the drum kit. Caillat and Dashut spent about nine days working with a range of microphones and <a href="instrument%20amplifier">amplifiers</a> to get a larger sound, before discovering they could adjust the sound effectively on the API mixing console.

As the studio sessions progressed, the band members' new intimate relationships that formed after various separations started to have a negative effect on Fleetwood Mac. The musicians did not meet or socialise after their daily work at the Record Plant. At the time, the <a href="hippie%20movement">hippie movement</a> still affected Sausalito's culture and drugs were readily available. Open-ended budgets enabled the band and the engineers to become self-indulgent; sleepless nights and the extensive use of <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> marked much of the album's production. <a href="Chris%20Stone%20%28entrepreneur%29">Chris Stone</a>, one of the Record Plant's owners, indicated in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac brought "excess at its most excessive" by taking over the studio for long and extremely expensive sessions; he stated, "The band would come in at 7 at night, have a big feast, party till 1 or 2 in the morning, and then when they were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording".
Nicks has suggested that Fleetwood Mac created the best music when in the worst shape, while, according to Buckingham, the tensions between band members informed the recording process and led to "the whole being more than the sum of the parts". The couple's work became "bittersweet" after their final split, although Buckingham still had a skill for taking Nicks' tracks and "making them beautiful". The <a href="vocal%20harmonies">vocal harmonies</a> between the duo and Christine McVie worked well and were captured using the best microphones available. Nicks' lyrical focus allowed the instrumentals in the songs that she wrote to be looser and more abstract. According to Dashut, all the recordings captured "emotion and feeling without a middle man ... or tempering". John McVie tended to clash with Buckingham about the make-up of songs, but both admit to achieving good outcomes. Christine McVie's "Songbird", which Caillat felt needed a concert hall's ambience, was recorded during an all-night session at <a href="Zellerbach%20Hall">Zellerbach Auditorium</a>, across <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley</a>.

Following over two months in Sausalito, Fleetwood arranged a ten-day tour to give the band a break and fan feedback. After the concerts, recording resumed at venues in Los Angeles, including Wally Heider Studios. Christine McVie and Nicks did not attend most of the sessions and took time off until they were needed to record any remaining vocals. The rest of Fleetwood Mac, with Caillat and Dashut, struggled to finalise the <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a> and mixing of "Rumours" after the Sausalito tapes were damaged by repeated use during recording; the <a href="bass%20drum">kick</a> and <a href="snare%20drum">snare drum</a> audio tracks sounded "lifeless". A sell-out autumn tour of the US was cancelled to allow the completion of the album, whose scheduled release date of September 1976 was pushed back. A specialist was hired to rectify the Sausalito tapes using a <a href="oscillator">vari-speed oscillator</a>. Through a pair of headphones which played the damaged tapes in his left ear and the <a href="master%20recording">safety master recordings</a> in his right, he converged their respective speeds aided by the timings provided by the snare and <a href="Hi-hat%20%28instrument%29">hi-hat</a> audio tracks. Fleetwood Mac and their co-producers wanted a "no-filler" final product, in which every track seemed a potential single. After the final <a href="audio%20mastering">mastering</a> stage and hearing the songs back-to-back, the band members sensed they had recorded something "pretty powerful".

In autumn 1976, while still recording, Fleetwood Mac showcased tracks from "Rumours" at the <a href="Universal%20Amphitheatre">Universal Amphitheatre</a> in Los Angeles. John McVie suggested the album title to the band because he felt the members were writing "journals and diaries" about each other through music. Warner Bros. confirmed the release details to the press in December and chose "Go Your Own Way" as a December 1976 promotional single. The label's aggressive marketing of 1975's "Fleetwood Mac", in which links with dozens of FM and AM radio stations were formed across America, aided the promotion of "Rumours". At the time, the album's advance order of 800,000 copies was the largest in Warner Bros.' history.

"Rumours" was released on 4 February 1977 in the US and a week later in the UK. The front cover features a stylised shot of Fleetwood and Nicks dressed in her "Rhiannon" stage persona, while the back has a montage of band portraits; all the photographs were taken by Herbert Worthington. On 28 February 1977, after rehearsing at SIR Studios in Los Angeles, Fleetwood Mac started a seven-month-long promotional tour of America. Nicks has noted that, after performing mostly "Rumours" songs during gigs, the band initially encountered poor receptions from fans who were not accustomed to the new material. A one-off March performance at a benefit concert for <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> <a href="Birch%20Bayh">Birch Bayh</a> in Indiana was followed by a short European tour of the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Germany in April. Nigel Williamson of "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" called Fleetwood Mac's performances "rock's greatest soap opera". "Dreams", released in March 1977, became the band's only number one on the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> in June.

Fleetwood Mac's main writers — Buckingham, Christine McVie and Nicks — worked individually on songs but sometimes shared lyrics with each other. "The Chain" is the only track on which all members, including Fleetwood and John McVie, collaborated. All songs on "Rumours" concern personal, often troubled relationships. According to Christine McVie, the fact that the lyricists were focusing on the various separations became apparent to the band only in hindsight. "You Make Loving Fun" is about her boyfriend, Fleetwood Mac's lighting director, whom she dated after splitting from John. Nicks' "Dreams" details a breakup and has a hopeful message, while Buckingham's similar effort in "Go Your Own Way" is more pessimistic. After a short fling with a New England woman, he was inspired to write "Never Going Back Again", a song about the illusion of thinking that sadness will never occur again once content with life. The lines "Been down one time/Been down two times" refer to the lyricist's efforts when persuading the woman to give him a chance.
"Don't Stop", written by Christine McVie, is a song about optimism. She noted that Buckingham helped her craft the verses because their personal sensibilities overlapped. McVie's next track, "Songbird", features more introspective lyrics about "nobody and everybody" in the form of "a little prayer". "Oh Daddy", the last McVie song on the album, was written about Fleetwood and his wife <a href="Jenny%20Boyd">Jenny Boyd</a>, who had just got back together. The band's nickname for Fleetwood was "the Big Daddy". McVie commented that the writing is slightly sarcastic and focuses on the drummer's direction for Fleetwood Mac, which always turned out to be right. Nicks provided the final lines "And I can't walk away from you, baby/If I tried". Her own song, "Gold Dust Woman", is inspired by Los Angeles and the hardship encountered in such a city. After struggling with the rock lifestyle, Nicks became addicted to cocaine and the lyrics address her belief in "keeping going".

Featuring a <a href="soft%20rock">soft rock</a> and <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a> sound, "Rumours" is built around a mix of acoustic and electric instrumentation. Buckingham's guitar work and Christine McVie's use of <a href="Fender%20Musical%20Instruments%20Corporation">Fender</a> <a href="Rhodes%20piano">Rhodes piano</a> or <a href="Hammond%20B-3%20organ">Hammond B-3 organ</a> are present on all but two tracks. The record often includes <a href="stress%20%28music%29">stressed</a> drum sounds and distinctive percussion such as <a href="conga">conga</a>s and <a href="maraca">maraca</a>s. It opens with "Second Hand News", originally an acoustic demo titled "Strummer". After hearing <a href="Bee%20Gees">Bee Gees</a>' "<a href="Jive%20Talkin%27">Jive Talkin'</a>", Buckingham and co-producer Dashut built up the song with four audio tracks of electric guitar and the use of chair percussion to evoke <a href="Celtic%20rock">Celtic rock</a>. "Dreams" includes "ethereal spaces" and a recurring two <a href="note%20%28music%29">note</a> pattern on the bass guitar. Nicks wrote the song in an afternoon and led the vocals, while the band played around her. The third track on "Rumours", "Never Going Back Again", began as "Brushes", a simple acoustic guitar tune played by Buckingham, with snare rolls by Fleetwood using <a href="percussion%20mallet%23Brushes">brushes</a>; the band added vocals and further instrumental audio tracks to make it more layered. Inspired by triple step <a href="step%20pattern">dancing patterns</a>, "Don't Stop" includes both <a href="acoustic%20piano">conventional acoustic</a> and <a href="tack%20piano">tack piano</a>. In the latter instrument, nails are placed on the points where the hammers hit the strings, producing a more percussive sound. "Go Your Own Way" is more guitar-oriented and has a <a href="four-to-the-floor">four-to-the-floor</a> dance beat influenced by <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>' "<a href="Street%20Fighting%20Man">Street Fighting Man</a>". The album's pace slows down with "Songbird", conceived solely by Christine McVie using a nine-foot <a href="Steinway%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Steinway</a> piano.

Side two of "Rumours" begins with "The Chain", one of the record's most complicated compositions. A Christine McVie demo, "Keep Me There", and a Nicks song were re-cut in the studio and were heavily edited to form parts of the track. The whole of the band crafted the rest using an approach akin to creating a <a href="film%20score">film score</a>; John McVie provided a prominent solo using a <a href="fretless">fretless</a> bass guitar, which marked a speeding up in tempo and the start of the song's final third. Inspired by <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>, "You Make Loving Fun" has a simpler composition and features a <a href="clavinet">clavinet</a>, a special type of keyboard instrument, while the rhythm section plays interlocking notes and beats. The ninth track on "Rumours", "I Don't Want to Know", makes use of a <a href="twelve%20string%20guitar">twelve string guitar</a> and harmonising vocals. Influenced by the music of <a href="Buddy%20Holly">Buddy Holly</a>, Buckingham and Nicks created it in 1974 before they were in Fleetwood Mac. "Oh Daddy" was crafted spontaneously and includes improvised bass guitar patterns from John McVie and keyboard blips from Christine McVie. The album ends with "Gold Dust Woman", a song inspired by <a href="free%20jazz">free jazz</a>, which has music from a <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, a <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a> guitar, and a <a href="dobro">dobro</a>, an acoustic guitar whose sound is produced by one or more metal cones.

"Rumours" has been acclaimed by <a href="music%20journalism">music critics</a> since its release. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, reviewing in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", gave the album an "A" and described it as "more consistent and more eccentric" than its predecessor. He added that it "jumps right out of the speakers at you". "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine's John Swenson believed the interplay among the three vocalists was one of the album's most pleasing elements; he stated, "Despite the interminable delay in finishing the record, "Rumours" proves that the success of "Fleetwood Mac" was no fluke." In a review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="John%20Rockwell">John Rockwell</a> said the album is "a delightful disk, and one hopes the public thinks so, too", while <a href="Dave%20Marsh">Dave Marsh</a> of the "<a href="St.%20Petersburg%20Times">St. Petersburg Times</a>" claimed the songs are "as grandly glossy as anything right now". <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a> was less receptive and called "Rumours" a "frustratingly uneven" record in his review for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", while Juan Rodriguez of "<a href="The%20Gazette%20%28Montreal%29">The Gazette</a>" suggested that, while the music is "crisper and clearer", Fleetwood Mac's ideas are "slightly more muddled". The album finished fourth in "The Village Voice"s 1977 <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics' poll, which aggregated the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.

In a retrospective review, <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> editor <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> gave "Rumours" five stars and noted that, regardless of the voyeuristic element, the record was "an unparalleled blockbuster" because of the music's quality; he concluded, "Each tune, each phrase regains its raw, immediate emotional power—which is why "Rumours" touched a nerve upon its 1977 release, and has since transcended its era to be one of the greatest, most compelling pop albums of all time." According to "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>"s Barry Walsh, Fleetwood Mac drew on romantic dysfunction and personal turmoil to create a timeless, five-star record, while Andy Gill of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" claimed it "represents, along with "<a href="Their%20Greatest%20Hits%20%281971%E2%80%931975%29">The Eagles Greatest Hits</a>", the high-water mark of America's Seventies rock-culture expansion, the quintessence of a counter-cultural mindset lured into coke-fuelled hedonism". In 2007, <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s Daryl Easlea labelled the sonic results as "near perfect", "like a thousand angels kissing you sweetly on the forehead", while Patrick McKay of "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>" wrote, "What distinguishes "Rumours"—what makes it art—is the contradiction between its cheerful surface and its anguished heart. Here is a radio-friendly record about anger, recrimination, and loss."

"Rumours" was a huge commercial success and became Fleetwood Mac's second US number one record, following the 1975 eponymous release. It stayed at the top of the "Billboard" 200 for 31 non-consecutive weeks, while also reaching number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In May 2011 it re-entered <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart at number 11, and the Australian <a href="ARIA%20chart">ARIA chart</a> at number 2, due to several songs from the album being used for the <a href="Rumours%20%28Glee%29">"Rumours"</a> episode of the American TV series "<a href="Glee%20%28TV%20series%29">Glee</a>". The album was certified <a href="platinum%20record">platinum</a> in America and the UK within months of release after one million units and 300,000 units were shipped respectively.

After a debut at number seven, "Rumours" peaked at the top of the UK Albums Chart in January 1978, becoming Fleetwood Mac's first number one album in the country. In February, the band and co-producers Caillat and Dashut won the 1978 <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Grammy Award for Album of the Year</a>. By March, the album had sold over 10 million copies worldwide, including over eight million in the US alone.

Mick Fleetwood has called "Rumours" "the most important album we ever made", because its success allowed the group to continue recording for years to come. <a href="popular%20culture">Pop culture</a> journalist <a href="Chuck%20Klosterman">Chuck Klosterman</a> links the record's sales figures to its "really likable songs", but suggests that "no justification for greatness" is intrinsically provided by them.

Natalie Clifford Barney

Natalie Clifford Barney (October 31, 1876 – February 2, 1972) was an American playwright, poet and novelist who lived as an <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a> in Paris.

Barney's <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a> was held at her home at 20 rue Jacob in Paris's <a href="Rive%20Gauche">Left Bank</a> for more than 60 years and brought together writers and artists from around the world, including many leading figures in French literature along with American and British <a href="Modernists">Modernists</a> of the <a href="Lost%20Generation">Lost Generation</a>. She worked to promote writing by women and formed a "Women's Academy" (L'Académie des Femmes) in response to the all-male <a href="French%20Academy">French Academy</a> while also giving support and inspiration to male writers from <a href="Remy%20de%20Gourmont">Remy de Gourmont</a> to <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a>.

She was openly lesbian and began publishing love poems to women under her own name as early as 1900, considering scandal as "the best way of getting rid of nuisances" (meaning heterosexual attention from young men). She wrote in both French and English. In her writings she supported <a href="feminism">feminism</a> and <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a>. She opposed <a href="monogamy">monogamy</a> and had many overlapping long and short-term relationships, including on-and-off romances with poet <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Vivien">Renée Vivien</a> and dancer <a href="Armen%20Ohanian">Armen Ohanian</a> and a 50-year relationship with painter <a href="Romaine%20Brooks">Romaine Brooks</a>. Her life and love affairs served as inspiration for many novels, ranging from the salacious French bestseller "Idylle Saphique" to "<a href="The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness">The Well of Loneliness</a>", the most famous lesbian novel of the twentieth century.

Barney was born in 1876 in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, to Albert Clifford Barney and <a href="Alice%20Pike%20Barney">Alice Pike Barney</a>. Her mother was of French, <a href="Dutch%20people">Dutch</a> and German ancestry and her father was the son of a wealthy manufacturer of railway cars and of English descent. Her maternal grandfather's father was Jewish.

When Barney was five years old her family spent the summer at New York's Long Beach Hotel where <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> happened to be speaking on his American lecture tour. Wilde scooped her up as she ran past him fleeing a group of small boys, held her out of their reach then sat her down on his knee and told her a story. The next day he joined Barney and her mother on the beach, where their conversation changed the course of Alice's life, inspiring her to pursue art seriously, despite, years later, her husband's disapproval. She later studied under <a href="Carolus-Duran">Carolus-Duran</a> and <a href="James%20McNeill%20Whistler">James McNeill Whistler</a>. Many of Alice Pike Barney's paintings are now in the <a href="Smithsonian%20American%20Art%20Museum">Smithsonian American Art Museum</a>.
Like many girls of her time, Barney had a haphazard education.

Her interest in the French language began with a <a href="governess">governess</a> who read <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a> stories aloud to her so she would have to learn quickly to understand them. Later she and her younger sister <a href="Laura%20Clifford%20Barney">Laura Clifford Barney</a> attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school in Fontainebleau, France, founded by feminist <a href="Marie%20Souvestre">Marie Souvestre</a>, who also founded <a href="Allenswood%20Academy">Allenswood Academy</a>, in Wimbledon, outside London, which was attended by such notables as <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>. As an adult, she spoke and wrote French fluently.

When she was ten her family moved from Ohio to Washington, D.C., spending summers in <a href="Bar%20Harbor%2C%20Maine">Bar Harbor, Maine</a>. As the rebellious and unconventional daughter of one of the wealthiest families in town, she was often mentioned in Washington newspapers. In her early twenties she made headlines by galloping through Bar Harbor while driving a second horse on a lead ahead of her and by riding astride instead of <a href="sidesaddle">sidesaddle</a>.

Barney later said she knew by age 12 she was lesbian and was determined to "live openly, without hiding anything." In 1899, after seeing the <a href="courtesan">courtesan</a> <a href="Liane%20de%20Pougy">Liane de Pougy</a> at a dance hall in Paris, Barney presented herself at de Pougy's residence in a <a href="Page%20%28occupation%29">page</a> costume and announced she was a "page of love" sent by <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a>.

Although de Pougy was one of the most famous women in France, constantly sought after by wealthy and titled men, Barney's audacity charmed her. Their brief affair became the subject of de Pougy's tell-all "<a href="roman%20%C3%A0%20clef">roman à clef</a>", "Idylle Saphique" ("Sapphic Idyll"). Published in 1901, this book became the talk of Paris, reprinted at least 69 times in its first year. Barney was soon well known as the model for one of the characters. By this time, however, the two had already broken up after quarreling repeatedly over Barney's desire to "rescue" de Pougy from her life as a courtesan.

Barney herself contributed a chapter to "Idylle Saphique" in which she described reclining at de Pougy's feet in a screened box at the theater, watching <a href="Sarah%20Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>'s play <a href="Prince%20Hamlet">Hamlet</a>. During intermission, Barney (as "Flossie") compares Hamlet's plight with that of women: "What is there for women who feel the passion for action when pitiless Destiny holds them in chains? Destiny made us women at a time when the law of men is the only law that is recognized." She also wrote "Lettres à une Connue" ("Letters to a Woman I Have Known"), her own <a href="epistolary%20novel">epistolary novel</a> about the affair. Although Barney failed to find a publisher for the book and later called it naïve and clumsy, it is notable for its discussion of homosexuality, which Barney regarded as natural and compared to <a href="albinism">albinism</a>. "My queerness," she said, "is not a vice, is not deliberate, and harms no one."

Barney's earliest intimate relationship was with <a href="Eva%20Palmer-Sikelianos">Eva Palmer-Sikelianos</a>. In 1893 they became acquainted during summer vacations in <a href="Bar%20Harbor">Bar Harbor</a>, Maine. Barney likened Palmer to a medieval virgin, an ode to her ankle length red hair, sea-green eyes and pale complexion. The two remained close for a number of years. As young adults in Paris they shared an apartment at 4, rue Chalgrin. Later they each had their own place in <a href="Neuilly">Neuilly</a>. Barney frequently solicited Palmer's help in her romantic pursuits of other women, such as Pauline Tarn. Palmer ultimately left Barney's side for Greece and eventually married <a href="Angelos%20Sikelianos">Angelos Sikelianos</a>. Their relationship did not survive this turn of events, Barney took a dim view of Angelos and heated letters were exchanged. Later in their lives the friendship was repaired and both took a mature view on the roles they had played in each other's lives.

In November 1899 Barney met the poet Pauline Tarn, better known by her pen name <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Vivien">Renée Vivien</a>. For Vivien it was love at first sight, while Barney became fascinated with Vivien after hearing her recite one of her poems, which she described as "haunted by the desire for death." Their romantic relationship was also a creative exchange that inspired both of them to write. Barney provided a feminist theoretical framework which Vivien explored in her poetry. They adapted the imagery of the <a href="Symbolist%20poet">Symbolist poet</a>s along with the conventions of <a href="courtly%20love">courtly love</a> to describe love between women, also finding examples of heroic women in history and myth. <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a> was an especially important influence and they studied <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> so as to read the surviving fragments of her poetry in the original. Both wrote plays about her life.

Vivien saw Barney as a <a href="muse">muse</a> and as Barney put it, "she had found new inspiration through me, almost without knowing me." Barney felt Vivien had cast her as a "<a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>" and that she wanted "to lose herself... entirely in suffering" for the sake of her art. Vivien also believed in <a href="fidelity">fidelity</a>, which Barney was unwilling to agree to. While Barney was visiting her family in Washington, D.C. in 1901, Vivien stopped answering her letters. Barney tried to get her back for years, at one point persuading a friend, operatic <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> <a href="Emma%20Calv%C3%A9">Emma Calvé</a>, to sing under Vivien's window so she could throw a poem (wrapped around a bouquet of flowers) up to Vivien on her balcony. Both flowers and poem were intercepted and returned by a governess.

In 1904 she wrote "Je Me Souviens" ("I Remember"), an intensely personal prose poem about their relationship which was presented as a single handwritten copy to Vivien in an attempt to win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to <a href="Lesbos%20Island">Lesbos</a>, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness <a href="H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne%20van%20Zuylen">Hélène van Zuylen</a> and went to <a href="Istanbul">Constantinople</a> thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.

Vivien's health declined rapidly after this. According to Vivien's friend and neighbor <a href="Colette">Colette</a>, she ate almost nothing and drank heavily, even rinsing her mouth with perfumed water to hide the smell. Colette's account has led some to call Vivien an <a href="anorexia%20nervosa">anorexic</a> but this diagnosis did not yet exist at the time. Vivien was also addicted to the sedative <a href="chloral%20hydrate">chloral hydrate</a>. In 1908 she attempted suicide by overdosing on <a href="laudanum">laudanum</a> and died the following year. In a memoir written fifty years later Barney said "She could not be saved. Her life was a long suicide. Everything turned to dust and ashes in her hands."

In 1949, two years after the death of Hélène van Zuylen, Barney restored the <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Vivien%20Prize">Renée Vivien Prize</a> with a financial grant under the authority of the "<a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20des%20gens%20de%20lettres">Société des gens de lettres</a>" and took on the chairmanship of the jury in 1950.

In 1900, Barney published her first book, a collection of poems called "<a href="Quelques%20Portraits-Sonnets%20de%20Femmes">Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes</a>" ("Some Portrait-Sonnets of Women"). The poems were written in traditional French verse and a formal, old-fashioned style since Barney did not care for <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a>. These poems have been described as "apprentice work" but by publishing them, Barney became the first woman poet to openly write about the love of women since Sappho. Her mother contributed pastel illustrations of the poems' subjects, wholly unaware three of the four women who modeled for her were her daughter's lovers.

Reviews were generally positive and glossed over the lesbian theme of the poems, some even misrepresenting it. The "Washington Mirror" said Barney "writes odes to men's lips and eyes; not like a novice, either." However, a headline in a society gossip paper cried out "Sappho Sings in Washington" and this alerted her father, who bought and destroyed the publisher's remaining stock and printing plates.

To escape her father's sway Barney published her next book, "Cinq Petits Dialogues Grecs" ("Five Short Greek Dialogues", 1901), under the pseudonym <a href="Tryph%C3%A9">Tryphé</a>. The name came from the works of <a href="Pierre%20Lou%C3%BFs">Pierre Louÿs</a>, who helped to edit and revise the <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>. Barney also dedicated the book to him. The first of the dialogues is set in ancient Greece and contains a long description of Sappho, who is "more faithful in her inconstancy than others in their fidelity." Another argues for <a href="paganism">paganism</a> over Christianity. Barney's father's death in 1902 left her with a substantial fortune, freeing her from any need to conceal the authorship of her books; she never used a pseudonym again.

"Je Me Souviens" was published in 1910, after Vivien's death. That same year, Barney published "Actes et Entr'actes" ("Acts and Interludes"), a collection of short plays and poems. One of the plays was "Équivoque" ("Ambiguity"), a <a href="historical%20revisionism">revisionist</a> version on the legend of <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a>'s death: Instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of <a href="Phaon">Phaon</a> the sailor, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she loves. The play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own footnotes in Greek and was performed with "ancient Greek" music and dance.

Barney did not take her poetry as seriously as Vivien did, saying, "if I had one ambition it was to make my life itself into a poem." Her plays were only performed through amateur productions in her garden. According to <a href="Karla%20Jay">Karla Jay</a>, most of them lacked coherent plots and "would probably baffle even the most sympathetic audience." After 1910 she mostly wrote the <a href="epigram">epigram</a>s and memoirs for which she is better known. Her last book of poetry was called "Poems & Poemes: Autres Alliances" and came out in 1920, bringing together romantic poetry in both French and English. Barney asked <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> to edit the poems but then ignored the detailed recommendations he made.

For over 60 years, Barney hosted a literary <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a>, a weekly gathering at which people met to socialize and discuss literature, art, music and any other topic of interest. Barney strove to feature women's writing while also hosting some of the most prominent male writers of her time. She brought together <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a> <a href="Modernists">Modernists</a> with members of the <a href="French%20Academy">French Academy</a>. Joan Schenkar described Barney's salon as "a place where lesbian assignations "and" appointments with academics could coexist in a kind of cheerful, cross-pollinating, cognitive dissonance."

In the 1900s Barney held early gatherings of the salon at her house in <a href="Neuilly-sur-Seine">Neuilly</a>. The entertainment included poetry readings and <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">theatricals</a> (in which <a href="Colette">Colette</a> sometimes performed). <a href="Mata%20Hari">Mata Hari</a> performed a dance once, riding into the garden as <a href="Lady%20Godiva">Lady Godiva</a> on a white horse harnessed with <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a> <a href="cloisonn%C3%A9">cloisonné</a>.

The play "Equivoque" may have led Barney to leave Neuilly in 1909. According to a contemporary newspaper article, her landlord objected to her holding an outdoor performance of a play about Sappho, which he felt "followed nature too closely". She canceled her lease and rented the <a href="pavilion">pavilion</a> at 20, Rue Jacob in Paris's <a href="Latin%20Quarter">Latin Quarter</a> and her salon was held there until the late 1960s. This was a small two-story house, separated on three sides from the main building on the street. Next to the pavillon was a large, overgrown garden with a <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> "Temple of Friendship" tucked into one corner. In this new location, the salon grew a more prim outward face, with poetry readings and conversation, perhaps because Barney had been told the pavillon's floors would not hold up to large dancing parties. Frequent guests during this period included <a href="Pierre%20Lou%C3%BFs">Pierre Louÿs</a>, <a href="Paul%20Claudel">Paul Claudel</a>, <a href="Philippe%20Berthelot">Philippe Berthelot</a> and translator <a href="J.%20C.%20Mardrus">J. C. Mardrus</a>.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> the salon became a haven for those opposed to the war. <a href="Henri%20Barbusse">Henri Barbusse</a> once gave a reading from his anti-war novel "Under Fire" and Barney hosted a Women's Congress for Peace at the Rue Jacob. Other visitors to the salon during the war included <a href="Oscar%20Milosz">Oscar Milosz</a>, <a href="Auguste%20Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a> and poet <a href="Alan%20Seeger">Alan Seeger</a>, who came while on leave from the <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">French Foreign Legion</a>.

In the early 1920s, Ezra Pound was a close friend of Barney's and often visited. The two schemed together to subsidize <a href="Paul%20Val%C3%A9ry">Paul Valéry</a> and <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> so they could quit their jobs and focus on writing, but Valéry found other <a href="patrons">patrons</a> and Eliot refused the <a href="Grant%20%28money%29">grant</a>. Pound introduced Barney to <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> composer <a href="George%20Antheil">George Antheil</a> and while her own taste in music leaned towards the traditional, she hosted premieres of Antheil's "Symphony for Five Instruments" and "First String Quartet" at the Rue Jacob. It was also at Barney's salon that Pound met his longtime <a href="mistress%20%28lover%29">mistress</a>, the violinist <a href="Olga%20Rudge">Olga Rudge</a>.

In 1927 Barney started an "Académie des Femmes" (Women's Academy) to honor women writers. This was a response to the influential French Academy which had been founded in the 17th century by <a href="Louis%20XIII">Louis XIII</a> and whose 40 "immortals" included no women at the time. Unlike the French Academy, her Women's Academy was not a formal organization, but rather a series of readings held as part of the regular Friday salons. Honorees included <a href="Colette">Colette</a>, <a href="Gertrude%20Stein">Gertrude Stein</a>, <a href="Anna%20Wickham">Anna Wickham</a>, <a href="Rachilde">Rachilde</a>, <a href="Lucie%20Delarue-Mardrus">Lucie Delarue-Mardrus</a>, <a href="Mina%20Loy">Mina Loy</a>, <a href="Djuna%20Barnes">Djuna Barnes</a> and <a href="Posthumous%20recognition">posthumously</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Vivien">Renée Vivien</a>.

Other visitors to the salon during the 1920s included French writers <a href="Jeanne%20Galzy">Jeanne Galzy</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gide">André Gide</a>, <a href="Anatole%20France">Anatole France</a>, <a href="Max%20Jacob">Max Jacob</a>, <a href="Louis%20Aragon">Louis Aragon</a> and <a href="Jean%20Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a> along with English-language writers <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>, <a href="W.%20Somerset%20Maugham">W. Somerset Maugham</a>, <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="Sinclair%20Lewis">Sinclair Lewis</a>, <a href="Sherwood%20Anderson">Sherwood Anderson</a>, <a href="Thornton%20Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a>, <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> and <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a> and moreover, German poet <a href="Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a>, Bengali poet <a href="Rabindranath%20Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a> (the first Nobel laureate from Asia), Romanian <a href="aesthetics">aesthetician</a> and diplomat <a href="Matila%20Ghyka">Matila Ghyka</a>, journalist <a href="Janet%20Flanner">Janet Flanner</a> (who set the "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">New Yorker</a>" style), journalist, activist and publisher <a href="Nancy%20Cunard">Nancy Cunard</a>, publishers <a href="Mary%20Phelps%20Jacob">Caresse</a> and <a href="Harry%20Crosby">Harry Crosby</a>, publisher <a href="Blanche%20Knopf">Blanche Knopf</a>, art collector and patron <a href="Peggy%20Guggenheim">Peggy Guggenheim</a>, <a href="Sylvia%20Beach">Sylvia Beach</a> (the bookstore owner who published <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>"), painters <a href="Tamara%20de%20Lempicka">Tamara de Lempicka</a> and <a href="Marie%20Laurencin">Marie Laurencin</a> and dancer <a href="Isadora%20Duncan">Isadora Duncan</a>.

For her 1929 book "Aventures de l'Esprit" ("Adventures of the Mind") Barney drew a social diagram which crowded the names of over a hundred people who had attended the salon into a rough map of the house, garden and Temple of Friendship. The first half of the book had reminiscences of 13 male writers she had known or met over the years and the second half had a chapter for each member of her "Académie des Femmes". This gender-balanced structure was not carried through on the book's packaging, which listed eight of the male writers then added "... and some women."

In the late 1920s <a href="Radclyffe%20Hall">Radclyffe Hall</a> drew a crowd after her novel "<a href="The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness">The Well of Loneliness</a>" had been banned in the UK. A reading by poet <a href="Edna%20St.%20Vincent%20Millay">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> packed the salon in 1932. At another Friday salon in the 1930s <a href="Virgil%20Thomson">Virgil Thomson</a> sang from "<a href="Four%20Saints%20in%20Three%20Acts">Four Saints in Three Acts</a>", an opera based on a libretto by <a href="Gertrude%20Stein">Gertrude Stein</a>.

Of the famous Modernist writers who spent time in Paris, <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> never made an appearance at the salon. <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a> came once or twice but didn't care for it. <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a> never attended a Friday, though he did come to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Lost%20Time">In Search of Lost Time</a>". His visit was delayed repeatedly owing to his poor health, and when the meeting finally did happen he was too nervous to bring up the subject he had come to talk about.

"Éparpillements" ("Scatterings", 1910) was Barney's first collection of "pensées"—literally, thoughts. This literary form had been associated with salon culture in France since the 17th century, when the genre was perfected at the salon of <a href="Madeleine%20de%20Souvr%C3%A9%2C%20marquise%20de%20Sabl%C3%A9">Madame de Sablé</a>. Barney's "pensées", like de Sablé's own "Maximes", were short, often one-line <a href="epigrams">epigrams</a> or "<a href="bon%20mot">bon mot</a>s" such as "There are more evil ears than bad mouths" and "To be married is to be neither alone nor together."

Her literary career got a boost after she sent a copy of "Éparpillements" to <a href="Remy%20de%20Gourmont">Remy de Gourmont</a>, a French poet, literary critic, and philosopher who had become a recluse after contracting the disfiguring disease <a href="lupus%20vulgaris">lupus vulgaris</a> in his thirties. He was impressed enough to invite her to one of the Sunday gatherings at his home, at which he usually received only a small group of old friends. She was a rejuvenating influence in his life, coaxing him out for evening car rides, dinners at the Rue Jacob, a masked <a href="Ball%20%28dance%29">ball</a>, even a short cruise on the <a href="Seine">Seine</a>. He turned some of their wide-ranging conversations into a series of letters that he published in the "<a href="Mercure%20de%20France">Mercure de France</a>", addressing her as "l'Amazone," a French word that can mean either "horsewoman" or "<a href="Amazons">Amazon</a>"; the letters were later collected in book form. He died in 1915, but the nickname he gave her would stay with her all her life—even her <a href="tombstone">tombstone</a> identifies her as "the Amazon of Remy de Gourmont"—and his "Letters to the Amazon" left readers wanting to know more about the woman who had inspired them.

Barney obliged in 1920 with "Pensées d'une Amazone" ("Thoughts of an Amazon"), her most overtly political work. In the first section, "Sexual Adversity, War, and Feminism", she developed <a href="feminism">feminist</a> and <a href="pacifism">pacifist</a> themes, describing war as an "involuntary and collective suicide ordained by man". In war, she said, men "father death as women mother life, with courage and without choice". The epigrammatic form makes it difficult to determine the details of Barney's views; ideas are presented only to be dropped, and some "pensées" seem to contradict others. Some critics interpret her as saying that the aggression that leads to war is visible in all male relationships. Karla Jay, however, argues that her philosophy was not that sweeping, and is better summed up by the epigram "Those who "love" war lack the love of an adequate sport—the art of living."

Another section of "Pensées d'une Amazone", "Misunderstanding, or Sappho's Lawsuit", gathered historical writings about homosexuality along with her own commentary. She also covered topics such as alcohol, friendship, old age, and literature, writing "Novels are longer than life" and "Romanticism is a childhood ailment; those who had it young are the most robust." A third volume, "Nouvelles Pensées de l'Amazone" ("New Thoughts of the Amazon"), appeared in 1939.

"The One Who is Legion, or A.D.'s After-Life" (1930) was Barney's only book written entirely in English, as well as her only novel. Illustrated by <a href="Romaine%20Brooks">Romaine Brooks</a>, it concerns a suicide, known only as A.D., who is brought back to life as a <a href="hermaphrodite">hermaphroditic</a> being and reads the book of her own life. This <a href="Fictional%20book">book-within-a-book</a>, entitled "The Love-Lives of A.D.", is a collection of hymns, poems and epigrams, much like Barney's own other writings.

Barney practiced, and advocated, non-monogamy. As early as 1901, in "Cinq Petits Dialogues Grecs," she argued in favor of multiple relationships and against jealousy; in "Éparpillements" she wrote "One is unfaithful to those one loves in order that their charm does not become mere habit." While she could be jealous herself, she actively encouraged at least some of her lovers to be <a href="non-monogamy">non-monogamous</a> as well.

Due in part to Jean Chalon's early biography of her, published in English as "Portrait of a Seductress", she had become more widely known for her many relationships than for her writing or her salon. She once wrote out a list, divided into three categories: liaisons, demi-liaisons, and adventures. <a href="Colette">Colette</a> was a demi-liaison, while the artist and furniture designer <a href="Eyre%20de%20Lanux">Eyre de Lanux</a>, with whom she had an off-and-on affair for several years, was listed as an adventure. Among the liaisons—the relationships that she considered most important—were <a href="Olive%20Custance">Olive Custance</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Vivien">Renée Vivien</a>, <a href="%C3%89lisabeth%20de%20Gramont">Élisabeth de Gramont</a>, <a href="Romaine%20Brooks">Romaine Brooks</a>, and <a href="Dolly%20Wilde">Dolly Wilde</a>. Of these, the three longest relationships were with de Gramont, Brooks, and Wilde; from 1927, she was involved with all three of them simultaneously, a situation that ended only with Wilde's death. Her shorter affairs, such as those with Colette and <a href="Lucie%20Delarue-Mardrus">Lucie Delarue-Mardrus</a>, often evolved into lifelong friendships.

<a href="%C3%89lisabeth%20de%20Gramont">Élisabeth de Gramont</a>, the <a href="Duchess">Duchess</a> of Clermont-Tonnerre, was a writer best known for her popular memoirs. A descendant of <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV of France</a>, she had grown up among the aristocracy; when she was a child, according to Janet Flanner, "peasants on her farm... begged her not to clean her shoes before entering their houses". She looked back on this lost world of wealth and privilege with little regret, and became known as the "red duchess" for her support of socialism. She was married and had two daughters in 1910, when she met Barney; her husband is said to have been violent and tyrannical. They eventually separated, and in 1918 she and Barney wrote up a marriage contract stating: "No one union shall be so strong as this union, nor another joining so tender—nor relationship so lasting."

De Gramont accepted Barney's nonmonogamy—perhaps reluctantly at first—and went out of her way to be gracious to her other lovers, always including Romaine Brooks when she invited Barney to vacation in the country. The relationship continued until de Gramont's death in 1954.

Barney's longest relationship was with the American painter <a href="Romaine%20Brooks">Romaine Brooks</a>, whom she met around 1914. Brooks specialized in <a href="portrait">portrait</a>ure and was noted for her somber palette of gray, black, and white. During the 1920s she painted portraits of several members of Barney's social circle, including de Gramont and Barney herself.

Brooks tolerated Barney's casual affairs well enough to tease her about them, and had a few of her own over the years, but could become jealous when a new love became serious. Usually she simply left town, but at one point she gave Barney an ultimatum to choose between her and Dolly Wilde—relenting once Barney had given in. At the same time, while Brooks was devoted to Barney, she did not want to live with her as a full-time couple; she disliked Paris, disdained Barney's friends, hated the constant socializing on which Barney thrived, and felt that she was fully herself only when alone. To accommodate Brooks's need for solitude they built a summer home consisting of two separate wings joined by a dining room, which they called "Villa Trait d'Union", the hyphenated villa. Brooks also spent much of the year in Italy or travelling elsewhere in Europe, away from Barney. They remained devoted to one another for over fifty years.

<a href="Dolly%20Wilde">Dolly Wilde</a> was the niece of <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> (whom Natalie Barney had met as a little girl) and the last of her family to bear the Wilde name. She was renowned for her epigrammatic wit but, unlike her famous uncle, never managed to apply her gifts to any publishable writing; her letters are her only legacy. She did some work as a translator and was often supported by others, including Barney, whom she met in 1927.

Like Vivien, Wilde seemed bent on self-destruction. She drank heavily, was addicted to heroin, and attempted suicide several times. Barney financed <a href="drug%20detoxification">drug detoxification</a>s, which were never effective; she emerged from one nursing-home stay with a new dependency on the sleeping draught <a href="paraldehyde">paraldehyde</a>, then available over-the-counter.

In 1939 she was diagnosed with <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a> and refused surgery, seeking alternative treatments. The following year, <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> separated her from Barney; she fled Paris for England while Barney went to Italy with Brooks. She died in 1941 from causes that have never been fully explained, possibly a paraldehyde overdose.

Barney's attitudes during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> have been controversial. In 1937, <a href="Una%20Vincenzo%2C%20Lady%20Troubridge">Una, Lady Troubridge</a> had complained that Barney "talked a lot of half-baked nonsense about the tyranny of fascism". Barney herself was one-quarter <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>, and since she spent the war in Italy with Romaine Brooks, risked deportation to a <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>—a fate she avoided only by <a href="Telegraphy">wiring</a> her sister Laura for a <a href="Notary%20public">notarized</a> document attesting to her <a href="confirmation">confirmation</a>. Nevertheless, having no other source of information about the war, she believed <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis</a> propaganda that portrayed the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> as the aggressors, so that pro-Fascism seemed to her to be a logical consequence of her <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a>. An unpublished memoir she wrote during the war years is pro-Fascist and <a href="anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a>, quoting speeches by <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a>, apparently with approval.

It is possible that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>'s anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States. By the end of the war her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.

"Villa Trait d'Union" was destroyed by bombing. After the war, Brooks declined to live with Barney in Paris; she remained in Italy, and they visited each other frequently. Their relationship remained <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a> until the mid-1950s, when Barney met her last new love, Janine Lahovary, the wife of a retired Romanian ambassador. Lahovary made a point of winning Romaine Brooks's friendship, Barney reassured Brooks that their relationship still came first, and the triangle appeared to be stable.

The salon resumed in 1949 and continued to attract young writers for whom it was as much a piece of history as a place where literary reputations were made. <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a> was an intermittent guest for almost ten years; he described the decor as "totally turn-of-the-century" and remembered that Barney introduced him to the models for several characters in <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a>'s "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Lost%20Time">In Search of Lost Time</a>". <a href="Alice%20B.%20Toklas">Alice B. Toklas</a> became a regular after Gertrude Stein's death in 1946. Fridays in the 1960s honored <a href="Mary%20McCarthy%20%28author%29">Mary McCarthy</a> and <a href="Marguerite%20Yourcenar">Marguerite Yourcenar</a>, who in 1980—eight years after Barney's death—became the first female member of the French Academy.

Barney did not return to writing epigrams, but did publish two volumes of memoirs about other writers she had known, "Souvenirs Indiscrets" ("Indiscreet Memories", 1960) and "Traits et Portraits" ("Traits and Portraits", 1963). She also worked to find a publisher for Brooks's memoirs and to place her paintings in galleries.

In the late 1960s Brooks became increasingly reclusive and paranoid; she sank into a depression and refused to see the doctors Barney sent. Bitter at Lahovary's presence during their last years, which she had hoped they would spend exclusively together, she finally broke off contact with Barney. Barney continued to write to her, but received no replies. Brooks died in December 1970, and Barney on February 2, 1972 of heart failure. She is buried at <a href="Passy%20Cemetery">Passy Cemetery</a>, Paris, Île-de-France, France.

By the end of Barney's life her work had been largely forgotten. In 1979, Natalie Barney was honored with a place setting in <a href="Judy%20Chicago">Judy Chicago</a>'s feminist work of art "<a href="The%20Dinner%20Party">The Dinner Party</a>". In the 1980s Barney began to be recognized for what Karla Jay calls an "almost uncanny anticipation" of the concerns of later feminist writers. English translations of some of her memoirs, essays, and epigrams appeared in 1992, but most of her plays and poetry are still untranslated.

Her indirect influence on literature, through her salon and her many literary friendships, can be seen in the number of writers who have addressed or portrayed her in their works. "Claudine S'en Va" ("<a href="Claudine%20%28book%20series%29">Claudine and Annie</a>", 1903) by <a href="Colette">Colette</a> contains a brief appearance by Barney as "Miss Flossie," echoing the nickname she had earlier been given in de Pougy's novel "Idylle Saphique". <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Vivien">Renée Vivien</a> wrote many poems about her, as well as a <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> novel, "Une Femme M'Apparut" ("A Woman Appeared to Me", 1904), in which she is described as having "eyes ... as sharp and blue as a blade... The charm of peril emanated from her and drew me inexorably." <a href="Remy%20de%20Gourmont">Remy de Gourmont</a> addressed her in his "Letters to the Amazon", and <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a> mentioned her in his last, unfinished novel "". She also appeared in two later novels by writers who never met her: Francesco Rapazzini's "Un Soir chez l'Amazone" ("An Evening with the Amazon", 2004) is a historical novel about Barney's salon, while Anna Livia's "Minimax" (1991) portrays both her and Renee Vivien as still-living vampires.

According to <a href="Lillian%20Faderman">Lillian Faderman</a>, "There was probably no lesbian in the four decades between 1928 and the late 1960s capable of reading English or any of the eleven languages into which the book was translated who was unfamiliar with "<a href="The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness">The Well of Loneliness</a>"." Although the novel's author, Radclyffe Hall, intended it as an argument for greater tolerance for what she called "<a href="Sexual%20inversion%20%28sexology%29">sexual inverts</a>", it has often been criticized by lesbian readers for its protagonist's self-hatred and its use of terms like "freak" and "mistake of nature". Barney, as the salon hostess Valérie Seymour, appears in the novel as the symbol of a different attitude. "Valérie, placid and self-assured, created an atmosphere of courage; everyone felt very normal and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour's."

<a href="Lucie%20Delarue-Mardrus">Lucie Delarue-Mardrus</a> wrote love poems to Barney in the early years of the century, and in 1930 depicted her in a novel, "L'Ange et les Pervers" ("The Angel and the Perverts"), in which she said she "analyzed and described Natalie at length as well as the life into which she initiated me". The <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> of the novel is a <a href="hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a> named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay <a href="party">soirées</a>. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Renée Vivien. The book's portrayal of her is, at times, harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys. Marion tells Wells that she is "perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... [but] a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion... [Y]ou are capable of loving someone just as they are, even a thief—in that lies your only fidelity. And so you have my respect."

After meeting Barney in the 1930s, the Russian poet <a href="Marina%20Ivanovna%20Tsvetaeva">Marina Ivanovna Tsvetaeva</a> addressed her in a "Letter to the Amazon" (1934) in which she expressed her conflicted feelings about love between women. The result, according to <a href="Terry%20Castle">Terry Castle</a>, is "an entirely cryptic, paranoid, overwhelming piece of reverie".

Barney and the women in her social circle are the subject of <a href="Djuna%20Barnes">Djuna Barnes</a>'s "<a href="Ladies%20Almanack">Ladies Almanack</a>" (1928), a "<a href="roman%20%C3%A0%20clef">roman à clef</a>" written in an archaic, <a href="Rabelaisian">Rabelaisian</a> style, with Barnes' own illustrations in the style of <a href="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s. She has the lead role as Dame Evangeline Musset, "who was in her Heart one Grand Red Cross for the Pursuance, the Relief and the Distraction, of such Girls as in their Hinder Parts, and their Fore Parts, and in whatsoever Parts did suffer them most, lament Cruelly". "[A] Pioneer and a Menace" in her youth, Dame Musset has reached "a witty and learned Fifty"; she rescues women in distress, dispenses wisdom, and upon her death is elevated to sainthood. Also appearing pseudonymously are Élisabeth de Gramont, <a href="Romaine%20Brooks">Romaine Brooks</a>, <a href="Dolly%20Wilde">Dolly Wilde</a>, <a href="Radclyffe%20Hall">Radclyffe Hall</a> and her partner Una, Lady Troubridge, <a href="Janet%20Flanner">Janet Flanner</a> and Solita Solano, and <a href="Mina%20Loy">Mina Loy</a>. The obscure language, inside jokes, and ambiguity of "Ladies Almanack" have kept critics arguing about whether it is an affectionate satire or a bitter attack, but Barney herself loved the book and reread it throughout her life.

On October 26, 2009, Barney was honored with a <a href="historical%20marker">historical marker</a> in her home town of <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>. The marker is the first in Ohio to note the sexual orientation of its honoree. This plaque was vandalized in July 2010.

Barney's French novel, "Amants féminins ou la troisième", believed to have been written in 1926, was published in 2013.

Isabella Beeton

Isabella Mary Beeton (' Mayson; 14 March 1836 – 6 February 1865) known as Mrs Beeton"', was an English journalist, editor and writer. Her name is particularly associated with her first book, the 1861 work "<a href="Mrs%20Beeton%27s%20Book%20of%20Household%20Management">Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management</a>". She was born in London and, after schooling in <a href="Islington">Islington</a>, north London, and <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>, Germany, she married <a href="Samuel%20Orchart%20Beeton">Samuel Orchart Beeton</a>, an ambitious publisher and magazine editor.

In 1857, less than a year after the wedding, Isabella began writing for one of her husband's publications, "<a href="The%20Englishwoman%27s%20Domestic%20Magazine">The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine</a>". She translated French fiction and wrote the cookery column, though all the recipes were <a href="plagiarism">plagiarised</a> from other works or sent in by the magazine's readers. In 1859 the Beetons launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements to "The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine"; the 24 instalments were published in one volume as "Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management" in October 1861, which sold 60,000 copies in the first year. Isabella was working on an abridged version of her book, which was to be titled "The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery", when she died of <a href="puerperal%20fever">puerperal fever</a> in February 1865 at the age of 28. She gave birth to four children, two of whom died in infancy, and had several miscarriages. Two of her biographers, <a href="Nancy%20Spain">Nancy Spain</a> and <a href="Kathryn%20Hughes">Kathryn Hughes</a>, posit the theory that Samuel had unknowingly contracted <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> in a premarital liaison with a prostitute, and had unwittingly passed the disease on to his wife.

The "Book of Household Management" has been edited, revised and enlarged several times since Isabella's death and is still in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including <a href="Elizabeth%20David">Elizabeth David</a> and <a href="Clarissa%20Dickson%20Wright">Clarissa Dickson Wright</a>, have criticised Isabella's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer <a href="Bee%20Wilson">Bee Wilson</a>, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" states that by 1891 the term "Mrs Beeton" had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.

Isabella Mayson was born on 14 March 1836 in <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>, London. She was the eldest of three daughters to Benjamin Mayson, a linen factor (merchant) and his wife Elizabeth ("" Jerrom). Shortly after Isabella's birth the family moved to Milk Street, <a href="Cheapside">Cheapside</a>, from where Benjamin traded. He died when Isabella was four years old, and Elizabeth, pregnant and unable to cope with raising the children on her own while maintaining Benjamin's business, sent her two elder daughters to live with relatives. Isabella went to live with her recently widowed paternal grandfather in <a href="Great%20Orton">Great Orton</a>, <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, though she was back with her mother within the next two years.
Three years after Benjamin's death Elizabeth married <a href="Henry%20Dorling">Henry Dorling</a>, a widower with four children. Henry was the Clerk of <a href="Epsom%20Downs%20Racecourse">Epsom Racecourse</a>, and had been granted residence within the racecourse grounds. The family, including Elizabeth's mother, moved to Surrey and over the next twenty years Henry and Elizabeth had a further thirteen children. Isabella was instrumental in her siblings' upbringing, and collectively referred to them as a "living cargo of children". The experience gave her much insight and experience in how to manage a family and its household.

After a brief education at a boarding school in <a href="Islington">Islington</a>, in 1851 Isabella was sent to school in <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>, Germany, accompanied by her stepsister Jane Dorling. Isabella became proficient in the piano and excelled in French and German; she also gained knowledge and experience in making pastry. She had returned to Epsom by the summer of 1854 and took further lessons in pastry-making from a local baker.

Around 1854 Isabella began a relationship with <a href="Samuel%20Orchart%20Beeton">Samuel Orchart Beeton</a>. His family had lived in Milk Street at the same time as the Maysons—Samuel's father still ran the Dolphin Tavern there—and Samuel's sisters had also attended the same Heidelberg school as Isabella. Samuel was the first British publisher of <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>'s "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>" in 1852 and had also released two innovative and pioneering journals: "<a href="The%20Englishwoman%27s%20Domestic%20Magazine">The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine</a>" in 1852 and the "<a href="Boys%27%20Own">Boys' Own</a>" magazine in 1855. The couple entered into extensive correspondence in 1855—in which Isabella signed her letters as "Fatty"—and they announced their engagement in June 1855. The marriage took place at St Martin's Church, Epsom, in July the following year, and was announced in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>". Samuel was "a discreet but firm believer in the equality of women" and their relationship, both personal and professional, was an equal partnership. The couple went to Paris for a three-week honeymoon, after which Samuel's mother joined them in a visit to Heidelberg. They returned to Britain in August, when the newlyweds moved into 2 Chandos Villas, a large <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> house in <a href="Pinner">Pinner</a>.
Within a month of returning from their honeymoon Isabella was pregnant. A few weeks before the birth, Samuel persuaded his wife to contribute to "The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine", a publication that the food writers Mary Aylett and Olive Ordish consider was "designed to make women content with their lot inside the home, not to interest them in the world outside". The magazine was affordable, aimed at young <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> women and was commercially successful, selling 50,000 issues a month by 1856. Isabella began by translating French fiction for publication as stories or serials. Shortly afterwards she started to work on the cookery column—which had been moribund for the previous six months following the departure of the previous correspondent—and the household article. The Beetons' son, Samuel Orchart, was born towards the end of May 1857, but died at the end of August that year. On the death certificate, the cause of death was given as diarrhoea and cholera, although Hughes hypothesises that Samuel senior had unknowingly contracted <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> in a premarital liaison with a prostitute, and had unwittingly passed the condition on to his wife, which would have infected his son.

While coping with the loss of her child, Isabella continued to work at "The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine". Although she was not a regular cook, she and Samuel obtained recipes from other sources. A request to receive the readers' own recipes led to over 2,000 being sent in, which were selected and edited by the Beetons. Published works were also copied, largely unattributed to any of the sources. These included <a href="Eliza%20Acton">Eliza Acton</a>'s "<a href="Modern%20Cookery%20for%20Private%20Families">Modern Cookery for Private Families</a>", <a href="Elizabeth%20Raffald">Elizabeth Raffald</a>'s "<a href="The%20Experienced%20English%20Housekeeper">The Experienced English Housekeeper</a>", <a href="Marie-Antoine%20Car%C3%AAme">Marie-Antoine Carême</a>'s "Le Pâtissier royal parisien", <a href="Louis%20Eustache%20Ude">Louis Eustache Ude</a>'s "The French Cook", <a href="Alexis%20Soyer">Alexis Soyer</a>'s "The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère" and "The Pantropheon", <a href="Hannah%20Glasse">Hannah Glasse</a>'s "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20Cookery%20Made%20Plain%20and%20Easy">The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</a>", <a href="Maria%20Eliza%20Rundell">Maria Eliza Rundell</a>'s "<a href="A%20New%20System%20of%20Domestic%20Cookery">A New System of Domestic Cookery</a>", and the works of <a href="Charles%20Elm%C3%A9%20Francatelli">Charles Elmé Francatelli</a>. Suzanne Daly and Ross G. Forman, in their examination of Victorian cooking culture, consider that the plagiarism makes it "an important index of mid-Victorian and middle-class society" because the production of the text from its own readers ensures that it is a reflection of what was actually being cooked and eaten at the time. In copying the recipes of others, Isabella was following the recommendation given to her by Henrietta English, a family friend, who wrote that "Cookery is a Science that is only learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had. Therefore my advice would be compile a book from receipts from a Variety of the Best Books published on Cookery and Heaven knows there is a great variety for you to choose from."
The Beetons partly followed the layout of Acton's recipes, although with a major alteration: whereas the earlier writer provided the method of cooking followed by a list of the required ingredients, the recipes in "The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine" listed the components before the cooking process. Isabella's standardised layout used for the recipes also showed the approximate costs of each serving, the seasonality of the ingredients and the number of portions per dish. According to the twentieth-century British cookery writer <a href="Elizabeth%20David">Elizabeth David</a>, one of the strengths of Isabella's writing was in the "clarity and details of her general instructions, her brisk comments, her no-nonsense asides". Margaret Beetham, the historian, sees that one of the strengths of the book was the "consistent principle of organisation which made its heterogeneous contents look uniform and orderly", and brought a consistent style in presentation and layout. Whereas Daly and Forman consider such an approach as "nothing if not formulaic", Hughes sees it as "the thing most beloved by the mid Victorians, "a system"".

During the particularly bitter winter of 1858–59 Isabella prepared her own soup that she served to the poor of Pinner, "Soup for benevolent purposes"; her sister later recalled that Isabella "was busy making [the] soup for the poor, and the children used to call with their cans regularly to be refilled". The recipe would become the only entry in her "<a href="Mrs%20Beeton%27s%20Book%20of%20Household%20Management">Book of Household Management</a>" that was her own. After two years of miscarriages, the couple's second son was born in June 1859; he was also named Samuel Orchart Beeton. Hughes sees the miscarriages as further evidence of Samuel's syphilis.

As early as 1857 the Beetons had considered using the magazine columns as the basis of a book of collected recipes and homecare advice, Hughes believes, and in November 1859 they launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements with "The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine". The print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break between each edition was fixed at 48 pages, regardless of the text, and in several issues the text of a sentence or recipe is split between the end of one instalment and the beginning of the next.

The Beetons decided to revamp "The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine", particularly the fashion column, which the historian Graham Nown describes as "a rather drab piece". They travelled to Paris in March 1860 to meet Adolphe Goubaud, the publisher of the French magazine "Le Moniteur de la Mode". The magazine carried a full-sized dress pattern outlined on a fold-out piece of paper for users to cut out and make their own dresses. The Beetons came to an agreement with Goubaud for the Frenchman to provide patterns and illustrations for their magazine. The first edition to carry the new feature appeared on 1 May, six weeks after the couple returned from Paris. For the redesigned magazine, Samuel was joined as editor by Isabella, who was described as "Editress". As well as being co-editors, the couple were also equal partners. Isabella brought an efficiency and strong business acumen to Samuel's normally disorganised and financially wasteful approach. She joined her husband at work, travelling daily by train to the office, where her presence caused a stir among commuters, most of whom were male. In June 1860 Isabella and Samuel travelled to <a href="Killarney">Killarney</a>, Ireland, for a fortnight's holiday, leaving their son at home with his nurse. The Beetons enjoyed the sightseeing, although on the days it rained, they stayed inside their hotel and worked on the next edition of "The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine". Isabella was impressed with the food they were served, and wrote in her diary that the dinners were "conducted in quite the French style".

In September 1861 the Beetons released a new, weekly publication called "<a href="Queen%20%28magazine%29">The Queen, the Ladies' Newspaper</a>". With the Beetons busy running their other titles, they employed <a href="Frederick%20Greenwood">Frederick Greenwood</a> as the editor.

The complete version of "Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management", consisting of the 24 collected monthly instalments, was published on 1 October 1861; it became one of the major publishing events of the nineteenth century. Isabella included an extensive 26-page "Analytical Index" in the book. Although not an innovation—it had been used in "<a href="The%20Family%20Friend%20%28magazine%29">The Family Friend</a>" magazine since 1855—Hughes considers the index in the "Book of Household Management" to be "fabulously detailed and exhaustively cross-referenced". Of the 1,112 pages, over 900 contained recipes. The remainder provided advice on fashion, child care, <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a>, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, first aid and the importance in the use of local and seasonal produce. In its first year of publication, the book sold 60,000 copies. It reflected <a href="Victorian%20morality">Victorian values</a>, particularly hard work, thrift and cleanliness. Christopher Clausen, in his study of the British middle classes, sees that Isabella "reflected better than anyone else, and for a larger audience, the optimistic message that mid-Victorian England was filled with opportunities for those who were willing to learn how to take advantage of them". The food writer Annette Hope thinks that "one can understand its success. If ... young ladies knew nothing of domestic arrangements, no better book than this could have been devised for them."
The reviews for "Book of Household Management" were positive. The critic for the "<a href="London%20Evening%20Standard">London Evening Standard</a>" considered that Isabella had earned herself a household reputation, remarking that she had "succeeded in producing a volume which will be, for years to come, a treasure to be made much of in every English household". The critic for the "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29">Saturday Review</a>" wrote that "for a really valuable repertory of hints on all sorts of household matters, we recommend Mrs Beeton with few misgivings". The anonymous reviewer for "The Bradford Observer" considered that "the information afforded ... appears intelligible and explicit"; the reviewer also praised the layout of the recipes, highlighting details relating to ingredients, seasonality and the times needed. Writing in "<a href="The%20Morning%20Chronicle">The Morning Chronicle</a>", an anonymous commentator opined that "Mrs Beeton has omitted nothing which tends to the comfort of housekeepers, or facilitates the many little troubles and cares that fall to the lot of every wife and mother. She may safely predict that this book will in future take precedence of every other on the same subject." For the 1906 edition of the book, "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>"s reviewer considered the work "a formidable body of domestic doctrine", and thought that "the book is almost of the first magnitude".

Samuel's business decisions from 1861 were unproductive and included an ill-advised investment in purchasing paper—in which he lost £1,000—and a court case over unpaid bills. His hubris in business affairs brought on financial difficulties and in early 1862 the couple had moved from their comfortable Pinner house to premises over their office. The air of central London was not conducive to the health of the Beetons' son, and he began to ail. Three days after Christmas his health worsened and he died on New Year's Eve 1862 at the age of three; his death certificate gave the cause as "suppressed scarlatina" and "laryngitis". In March 1863 Isabella found that she was pregnant again, and in April the couple moved to a house in <a href="Greenhithe">Greenhithe</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>; their son, who they named Orchart, was born on New Year's Eve 1863. Although the couple had been through financial problems, they enjoyed relative prosperity during 1863, boosted by the sale of "The Queen" to <a href="Edward%20William%20Cox">Edward Cox</a> in the middle of the year.

In the middle of 1864 the Beetons again visited the Goubauds in Paris—the couple's third visit to the city—and Isabella was pregnant during the visit, just as she had been the previous year. On her return to Britain she began working on an abridged version of the "Book of Household Management ", which was to be titled "The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery". On 29 January 1865, while working on the proofs of the dictionary, she went into labour; the baby—Mayson Moss—was born that day. Isabella began to feel feverish the following day and died of <a href="Puerperal%20infections">puerperal fever</a> on 6 February at the age of 28.
Isabella was buried at <a href="West%20Norwood%20Cemetery">West Norwood Cemetery</a> on 11 February. When "The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery" was published in the same year, Samuel added a tribute to his wife at the end:

In May 1866, following a severe downturn in his financial fortunes, Samuel sold the rights to the "Book of Household Management " to <a href="Ward%20Lock%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Ward, Lock and Tyler</a> (later Ward Lock & Co). The writer <a href="Nancy%20Spain">Nancy Spain</a>, in her biography of Isabella, reports that, given the money the company made from the Beetons' work, "surely no man ever made a worse or more impractical bargain" than Samuel did. In subsequent publications Ward Lock suppressed the details of the lives of the Beetons—especially the death of Isabella—in order to protect their investment by letting readers think she was still alive and creating recipes—what Hughes considers to be "intentional censorship". Those later editions continued to make the connection to Isabella in what Beetham considers to be a "fairly ruthless marketing policy which was begun by Beeton but carried on vigorously by Ward, Lock, and Tyler". Those subsequent volumes bearing Isabella's name became less reflective of the original. Since its initial publication the "Book of Household Management " has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.
Isabella and her main work have been subjected to criticism over the course of the twentieth century. Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are "sometimes slapdash and misleading", although she acknowledges that <a href="Prosper%20Montagn%C3%A9">Prosper Montagné</a>'s "<a href="Larousse%20Gastronomique">Larousse Gastronomique</a>" also contains errors. The television cook <a href="Delia%20Smith">Delia Smith</a> admits she was puzzled "how on earth Mrs Beeton's book managed to utterly eclipse ... [Acton's] superior work", while her fellow chef, <a href="Clarissa%20Dickson%20Wright">Clarissa Dickson Wright</a>, opines that "It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery, but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for." In comparison, the food writer <a href="Bee%20Wilson">Bee Wilson</a> opines that disparaging Isabella's work was only a "fashionable" stance to take and that the cook's writing "simply makes you want to cook". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the "relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930" may instead be explained by the "progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers". David comments that "when plain English cooks" were active in their kitchens, "they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a "fascinating source of information" from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be "the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era".

Despite the criticism, Clausen observes that "'Mrs. Beeton' has ... been for over a century the standard English cookbook, frequently outselling every other book but the Bible". According to the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>", the term "Mrs Beeton" became used as a generic name for "an authority on cooking and domestic subjects" as early as 1891, and Beetham opines that "'Mrs. Beeton' became a trade mark, a brand name". In a review by Gavin Koh published in a 2009 issue of "<a href="The%20BMJ">The BMJ</a>", "Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management" was labelled a medical classic. In Isabella's "attempt to educate the average reader about common medical complaints and their management", Koh argues, "she preceded the family health guides of today". Robin Wensley, a professor of strategic management, believes that Isabella's advice and guidance on household management can also be applied to business management, and her lessons on the subject have stood the test of time better than some of her advice on cooking or etiquette.

Following the radio broadcast of "Meet Mrs. Beeton", a 1934 comedy in which Samuel was portrayed in an unflattering light, and "Mrs Beeton", a 1937 documentary, Mayston Beeton worked with <a href="H.%20Montgomery%20Hyde">H. Montgomery Hyde</a> to produce the biography "Mr and Mrs Beeton", although completion and publication were delayed until 1951. In the meantime Nancy Spain published "Mrs Beeton and her Husband" in 1948, updated and retitled in 1956 to "The Beeton Story". In the new edition Spain hinted at, but did not elucidate upon, on the possibility that Samuel contracted syphilis. Several other biographies followed, including from the historian Sarah Freeman, who wrote "Isabella and Sam" in 1977; Nown's "Mrs Beeton: 150 Years of Cookery and Household Management", published on the 150th anniversary of Isabella's birthday, and Hughes's "The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton", published in 2006. Isabella was ignored by the "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Dictionary of National Biography</a>" for many years: while Acton was included in the first published volume of 1885, Isabella did not have an entry until 1993.

There have been several television broadcasts about Isabella. In 1970 <a href="Margaret%20Tyzack">Margaret Tyzack</a> portrayed her in a solo performance written by <a href="Rosemary%20Hill">Rosemary Hill</a>, in 2006 <a href="Anna%20Madeley">Anna Madeley</a> played Isabella in a <a href="docudrama">docudrama</a>, and <a href="Sophie%20Dahl">Sophie Dahl</a> presented a documentary, "The Marvellous Mrs Beeton", in the same year.

The literary historian Kate Thomas sees Isabella as "a powerful force in the making of middle-class Victorian domesticity", while the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>, advertising an abridged edition of the "Book of Household Management", considers Isabella's work a "founding text" and "a force in shaping" the middle-class identity of the Victorian era. Within that identity, the historian Sarah Richardson sees that one of Beeton's achievements was the integration of different threads of domestic science into one volume, which "elevat[ed] the middle-class female housekeeper's role ... placing it in a broader and more public context". Nown quotes an unnamed academic who thought that "Mrs Beetonism has preserved the family as a social unit, and made social reforms a possibility", while Nicola Humble, in her history of British food, sees "The Book of Household Management " as "an engine for social change" which led to a "new cult of domesticity that was to play such a major role in mid-Victorian life". Nown considers Isabella

The Fountainhead

The Fountainhead is a 1943 novel by Russian-American author <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, her first major literary success. The novel's protagonist, Howard Roark, is an <a href="individualistic">individualistic</a> young architect who designs <a href="modern%20architecture">modernist</a> buildings and refuses to compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept innovation. Roark embodies what Rand believed to be the ideal man, and his struggle reflects Rand's belief that individualism is superior to <a href="collectivism">collectivism</a>.

Roark is opposed by what he calls "second-handers", who value conformity over independence and integrity. These include Roark's former classmate, Peter Keating, who succeeds by following popular styles, but turns to Roark for help with design problems. Ellsworth Toohey, a <a href="socialist">socialist</a> <a href="architecture%20critic">architecture critic</a> who uses his influence to promote his political and social agenda, tries to destroy Roark's career. <a href="Tabloid%20journalism">Tabloid</a> newspaper publisher Gail Wynand seeks to shape popular opinion; he befriends Roark, then betrays him when public opinion turns in a direction he cannot control. The novel's most controversial character is Roark's lover, Dominique Francon. She believes that non-conformity has no chance of winning, so she alternates between helping Roark and working to undermine him. Feminist critics have condemned Roark and Dominique's first sexual encounter, accusing Rand of endorsing rape.

Twelve publishers rejected the manuscript before an editor at the <a href="Bobbs-Merrill%20Company">Bobbs-Merrill Company</a> risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers' opinions were polarized. Some praised the novel as a powerful paean to individualism, while others thought it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were slow, but the book gained a following by word of mouth and became a <a href="bestseller">bestseller</a>. More than 6.5 million copies of "The Fountainhead" have been sold worldwide and it has been translated into more than 20 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects, <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">American conservatives</a> and <a href="right-libertarians">right-libertarians</a>.

The novel has been adapted into other media several times. An illustrated version was syndicated in newspapers in 1945. <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> produced a <a href="The%20Fountainhead%20%28film%29">film version</a> in 1949; Rand wrote the screenplay, and <a href="Gary%20Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> played Roark. Critics panned the film, which did not recoup its budget; several directors and writers have considered developing a new film adaptation. In 2014, Belgian theater director <a href="Ivo%20van%20Hove">Ivo van Hove</a> created a <a href="The%20Fountainhead%20%28play%29">stage adaptation</a>, which has received mostly positive reviews.

In early 1922, Howard Roark is expelled from the architecture department of the Stanton Institute of Technology because he will not adhere to the school's preference for historical convention in building design. Roark goes to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and gets a job with Henry Cameron. Cameron was once a renowned architect, but now gets few commissions. In the meantime, Roark's popular, but vacuous, fellow student (and housemate, as Roark boards in the home of Keating and his mother) Peter Keating (whom Roark sometimes helped with projects) graduates with high honors. He too moves to New York, where he has been offered a position with the prestigious architecture firm, Francon & Heyer. Keating ingratiates himself with Guy Francon and works to remove rivals among his coworkers. After the Francon’s partner Heyer suffers a fatal <a href="stroke">stroke</a> brought on by Keating's antagonism, Francon chooses Keating to replace him. Meanwhile, Roark and Cameron create inspired work, but struggle financially.

After Cameron retires, Keating hires Roark, whom Francon soon fires for refusing to design a building in the classical style. Roark works briefly at another firm, then opens his own office but has trouble finding clients and closes it down. He gets a job in a granite quarry owned by Francon. There he meets Francon's daughter Dominique, a columnist for "The New York Banner", while she is staying at her family's estate nearby. They are immediately attracted to each other, leading to a rough sexual encounter that Dominique later calls a rape. Shortly after, Roark is notified that a client is ready to start a new building, and he returns to New York. Dominique also returns to New York and learns Roark is an architect. She attacks his work in public, but visits him for secret sexual encounters.

Ellsworth M. Toohey, who writes a popular architecture column in the "Banner", is an outspoken <a href="Socialism">socialist</a> who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who wants to build a Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey persuades Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying whatever he wants, such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.

To win Keating a prestigious commission offered by Gail Wynand, the owner and editor-in-chief of the "Banner", Dominique agrees to sleep with Wynand. Wynand is so strongly attracted to Dominique that he pays Keating to divorce her, after which Wynand and Dominique are married. Wanting to build a home for himself and his new wife, Wynand discovers that Roark designed every building he likes and so hires him. Roark and Wynand become close friends; Wynand is unaware of Roark's past relationship with Dominique.

Washed up and out of the public eye, Keating pleads with Toohey to use his influence to get the commission for the much-sought-after Cortlandt housing project. Keating knows his most successful projects were aided by Roark, so he asks for Roark's help in designing Cortlandt. Roark agrees in exchange for complete anonymity and Keating's promise that it will be built exactly as designed. After taking a long vacation with Wynand, Roark returns to find that Keating was not able to prevent major changes from being made in Cortlandt's construction. Roark dynamites the project to prevent the subversion of his vision.

Roark is arrested and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides to use his papers to defend his friend. This unpopular stance hurts the circulation of his newspapers, and Wynand's employees go on strike after Wynand dismisses Toohey for disobeying him and criticizing Roark. Faced with the prospect of closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a speech about the value of ego and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the "Banner" and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.

Rand's stated goal in writing fiction was to portray her vision of an ideal man. The character of Howard Roark, the <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> of "The Fountainhead", was the first instance where she believed she had achieved this. Roark embodies Rand's <a href="Ethical%20egoism">egoistic</a> moral ideals, especially the virtues of independence and integrity.

The character of Roark was at least partly inspired by American architect <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>. Rand described the inspiration as limited to specific ideas he had about architecture and "the pattern of his career". She denied that Wright had anything to do with the philosophy expressed by Roark or the events of the plot. Rand's denials have not stopped commentators from claiming stronger connections between Wright and Roark. Wright equivocated about whether he thought Roark was based on him, sometimes implying that he did, at other times denying it. Wright biographer <a href="Ada%20Louise%20Huxtable">Ada Louise Huxtable</a> described significant differences between Wright's philosophy and Rand's, and quoted him declaring, "I deny the paternity and refuse to marry the mother." Architecture critic <a href="Martin%20Filler">Martin Filler</a> said that Roark resembles the Swiss-French modernist architect <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a> more closely than Wright.

In contrast to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a <a href="Conformity">conformist</a> who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not really want to be an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a <a href="social%20climber">social climber</a>, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: he chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.

Rand did not use a specific architect as a model for Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the neighbor wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.

Dominique Francon is the heroine of "The Fountainhead", described by Rand as "the woman for a man like Howard Roark". Rand described Dominique as similar to herself "in a bad mood". For most of the novel, the character operates from what Rand viewed as wrong ideas. Believing that the values she admires cannot survive in the real world, she chooses to turn away from them so that the world cannot harm her. Only at the end of the novel does she accept that she can be happy and survive.

The character has provoked varied reactions from commentators. Philosopher <a href="Chris%20Matthew%20Sciabarra">Chris Matthew Sciabarra</a> called her "one of the more bizarre characters in the novel". Literature scholar <a href="Mimi%20Reisel%20Gladstein">Mimi Reisel Gladstein</a> called her "an interesting case study in perverseness". Writer Tore Boeckmann described her as a character with conflicting beliefs and saw her actions as a logical representation of how those conflicts might play out.

Gail Wynand is a wealthy newspaper mogul who rose from a destitute childhood in the <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a>es of New York to control much of the city's print media. While Wynand shares many of the character qualities of Roark, his success is dependent upon his ability to pander to public opinion. Rand presents this as a <a href="tragic%20flaw">tragic flaw</a> that eventually leads to his downfall. In her journals Rand described Wynand as "the man who could have been" a heroic individualist, contrasting him to Roark, "the man who can be and is". Some elements of Wynand's character were inspired by real-life newspaper tycoon <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, including Hearst's <a href="yellow%20journalism">yellow journalism</a> and mixed success in attempts to gain political influence. Wynand ultimately fails in his attempts to wield power, losing his newspaper, his wife, and his friendship with Roark. The character has been interpreted as a representation of the <a href="master%20morality">master morality</a> described by philosopher <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>; his tragic nature illustrates Rand's rejection of Nietzsche's philosophy. In Rand's view, a person like Wynand, who seeks power over others, is as much a "second-hander" as a conformist such as Keating.

Ellsworth Monkton Toohey is Roark's antagonist. He is Rand's personification of evilthe most active and self-aware villain in any of her novels. Toohey is a socialist, and represents the spirit of collectivism more generally. He styles himself as representative of the will of the masses, but his actual desire is for power over others. He controls individual victims by destroying their sense of self-worth, and seeks broader power (over "the world", as he declares to Keating in a moment of candor) by promoting the ideals of <a href="ethical%20altruism">ethical altruism</a> and a rigorous <a href="egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a> that treats all people and achievements as equally valuable. Rand used her memory of the British <a href="democratic%20socialist">democratic socialist</a> <a href="Harold%20Laski">Harold Laski</a> to help her imagine what Toohey would do in a given situation. She attended a New York lecture by Laski as part of gathering material for the novel, following which she changed the physical appearance of the character to be similar to that of Laski. New York intellectuals <a href="Lewis%20Mumford">Lewis Mumford</a> and <a href="Clifton%20Fadiman">Clifton Fadiman</a> also helped inspire the character.

When Rand first arrived in New York as an immigrant from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1926, she was greatly impressed by the <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> skyline's towering <a href="skyscrapers">skyscrapers</a>, which she saw as symbols of freedom, and resolved that she would write about them. In 1927, Rand was working as a junior screenwriter for movie producer <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> when he asked her to write a script for what would become the 1928 film "<a href="Skyscraper%20%281928%20film%29">Skyscraper</a>". The original story by <a href="Dudley%20Murphy">Dudley Murphy</a> was about two construction workers working on a skyscraper who are rivals for a woman's love. Rand rewrote it, transforming the rivals into architects. One of them, Howard Kane, was an idealist dedicated to erecting the skyscraper despite enormous obstacles. The film would have ended with Kane standing atop the completed skyscraper. DeMille rejected Rand's script, and the completed film followed Murphy's original idea. Rand's version contained elements she would use in "The Fountainhead".

In 1928, Rand made notes for a proposed, but never written, novel titled "The Little Street". Rand's notes for it contain elements that carried over into her work on "The Fountainhead". David Harriman, who edited the notes for the posthumously published "<a href="Journals%20of%20Ayn%20Rand">Journals of Ayn Rand</a>" (1997), described the story's villain as a preliminary version of the character Ellsworth Toohey, and this villain's assassination by the protagonist as prefiguring the attempted assassination of Toohey.
Rand began "The Fountainhead" (originally titled "Second-Hand Lives") following the completion of her first novel, "<a href="We%20the%20Living">We the Living</a>", in 1934. That earlier novel was based in part on people and events familiar to Rand; the new novel, on the other hand, focused on the less-familiar world of architecture. She therefore conducted extensive research that included reading many biographies and other books about architecture. She also worked as an unpaid typist in the office of architect <a href="Ely%20Jacques%20Kahn">Ely Jacques Kahn</a>. Rand began her notes for the new novel in December 1935.

Rand wanted to write a novel that was less overtly political than "We the Living", to avoid being viewed as "a 'one-theme' author". As she developed the story, she began to see more political meaning in the novel's ideas about <a href="individualism">individualism</a>. Rand also planned to introduce the novel's four sections with quotes from Friedrich Nietzsche, whose ideas had influenced her own intellectual development, but she eventually decided that Nietzsche's ideas were too different from hers. She edited the final manuscript to remove the quotes and other allusions to him.

Rand's work on "The Fountainhead" was repeatedly interrupted. In 1937, she took a break from it to write a novella called "<a href="Anthem%20%28novella%29">Anthem</a>". She also completed a stage adaptation of "We the Living" that ran briefly in 1940. That same year, she became active in politics. She first worked as a volunteer in <a href="Wendell%20Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a>'s presidential campaign, and then attempted to form a group for conservative intellectuals. As her royalties from earlier projects ran out, she began doing freelance work as a <a href="script%20reader">script reader</a> for movie studios. When Rand finally found a publisher, the novel was only one-third complete.

Although she was a previously published novelist and had a <a href="Night%20of%20January%2016th">successful Broadway play</a>, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for "The Fountainhead". <a href="Macmillan%20Publishing">Macmillan Publishing</a>, which had published "We the Living", rejected the book after Rand insisted they provide more publicity for her new novel than they had done for the first one. Rand's agent began submitting the book to other publishers; in 1938, <a href="Alfred%20A.%20Knopf">Knopf</a> signed a contract to publish the book. When Rand was only a quarter done with the manuscript by October 1940, Knopf canceled her contract. Several other publishers rejected the book. When Rand's agent began to criticize the novel, Rand fired the agent and decided to handle submissions herself. Twelve publishers (including Macmillan and Knopf) rejected the book.

While Rand was working as a script reader for <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, her boss put her in touch with the Bobbs-Merrill Company. A recently hired editor, Archibald Ogden, liked the book, but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions. One said it was a great book that would never sell; the other said it was trash but would sell well. Ogden's boss, Bobbs-Merrill president D.L. Chambers, decided to reject the book. Ogden responded by <a href="Telegraphy">wiring</a> to the head office, "If this is not the book for you, then I am not the editor for you." His strong stand won Rand the contract on December 10, 1941. She also got a $1,000 <a href="Advance%20against%20royalties">advance</a> so she could work full-time to complete the novel by January 1, 1943.

Rand worked long hours through 1942 to complete the final two-thirds of her manuscript, which she delivered on December 31, 1942. Rand's working title for the book was "Second-Hand Lives", but Ogden pointed out that this emphasized the story's villains. Rand offered "The Mainspring" as an alternative, but this title had been recently used for another book. She then used a <a href="thesaurus">thesaurus</a> and found 'fountainhead' as a synonym. "The Fountainhead" was published on May 7, 1943, with 7,500 copies in the first printing. Initial sales were slow, but they began to rise in late 1943, driven primarily by word of mouth. The novel began appearing on bestseller lists in 1944. It reached number six on <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"The New York Times" bestseller list</a> in August 1945, over two years after its initial publication. By 1956, the hardcover edition sold over 700,000 copies. The first paperback edition was published by the <a href="New%20American%20Library">New American Library</a> in 1952.

A 25th anniversary edition was issued by the New American Library in 1971, including a new introduction by Rand. In 1993, a 50th anniversary edition from Bobbs-Merrill added an afterword by Rand's heir, <a href="Leonard%20Peikoff">Leonard Peikoff</a>. The novel has been translated into more than 25 languages.

Rand indicated that the primary theme of "The Fountainhead" was "individualism versus collectivism, not in politics but within a man's soul". Philosopher <a href="Douglas%20Den%20Uyl">Douglas Den Uyl</a> identified the individualism presented in the novel as being specifically of an American kind, portrayed in the context of that country's society and institutions. Apart from scenes such as Roark's courtroom defense of the American concept of <a href="natural%20right">individual rights</a>, she avoided direct discussion of political issues. As historian James Baker described it, ""The Fountainhead" hardly mentions politics or economics, despite the fact that it was born in the 1930s. Nor does it deal with world affairs, although it was written during World War II. It is about one man against the system, and it does not permit other matters to intrude." Early drafts of the novel included more explicit political references, but Rand removed them from the finished text.

Rand chose the profession of architecture as the background for her novel, although she knew nothing about the field beforehand. As a field that combines art, technology, and business, it allowed her to illustrate her primary themes in multiple areas. Rand later wrote that architects provide "both art and a basic need of men's survival". In a speech to a chapter of the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Architects">American Institute of Architects</a>, Rand drew a connection between architecture and individualism, saying time periods that had improvements in architecture were also those that had more freedom for the individual.

Roark's modernist approach to architecture is contrasted with that of most of the other architects in the novel. In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve. Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms and commissions from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job offer. The same conflict between innovation and tradition is reflected in the career of Roark's mentor, Henry Cameron.

Den Uyl calls "The Fountainhead" a "philosophical novel", meaning that it addresses philosophical ideas and offers a specific philosophical viewpoint about those ideas. In the years following the publication of "The Fountainhead", Rand developed a philosophical system that she called <a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">Objectivism</a>. "The Fountainhead" does not contain this explicit philosophy, and Rand did not write the novel primarily to convey philosophical ideas. Nonetheless, Rand included three excerpts from the novel in "<a href="For%20the%20New%20Intellectual">For the New Intellectual</a>", a 1961 collection of her writings that she described as an outline of Objectivism. Peikoff used many quotes and examples from "The Fountainhead" in his 1991 book on Rand's philosophy, "".

"The Fountainhead" polarized critics and received mixed reviews upon its release. The reviewer for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" praised Rand as writing "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly", stating that she had "written a hymn in praise of the individual" that would force readers to rethink basic ideas. Benjamin DeCasseres, a columnist for the "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York Journal-American</a>", described Roark as "one of the most inspiring characters in modern American literature". Rand sent DeCasseres a letter thanking him for explaining the book's themes about individualism when many other reviewers did not. There were other positive reviews, although Rand dismissed many of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications. A number of negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it "a whale of a book" and another that said "anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style "offensively pedestrian".

In the years following its initial publication, "The Fountainhead" has received relatively little attention from literary critics. Assessing the novel's legacy, philosopher Douglas Den Uyl described "The Fountainhead" as relatively neglected compared to her later novel, "<a href="Atlas%20Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a>", and said, "our problem is to find those topics that arise clearly with "The Fountainhead" and yet do not force us to read it simply through the eyes of "Atlas Shrugged"." Among critics who have addressed it, some consider "The Fountainhead" to be Rand's best novel, although in some cases this assessment is tempered by an overall negative judgment of Rand's writings. Purely negative evaluations have also continued; a 2011 overview of American literature said "mainstream literary culture dismissed [] in the 1940s and continues to dismiss it".

One of the most controversial elements of the book is the first sexual encounter between Roark and Dominique. <a href="Feminist">Feminist</a> critics have attacked the scene as representative of an <a href="antifeminist">antifeminist</a> viewpoint in Rand's works that makes women subservient to men. <a href="Susan%20Brownmiller">Susan Brownmiller</a>, in her 1975 work "", denounced what she called "Rand's philosophy of rape", for portraying women as wanting "humiliation at the hands of a superior man". She called Rand "a traitor to her own sex". Susan Love Brown said the scene presents Rand's view of sex as <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a> involving "feminine subordination and passivity". <a href="Barbara%20Grizzuti%20Harrison">Barbara Grizzuti Harrison</a> suggested women who enjoy such "masochistic fantasies" are "damaged" and have low self-esteem. While Mimi Reisel Gladstein found elements to admire in Rand's female protagonists, she said that readers who have "a raised consciousness about the nature of rape" would disapprove of Rand's "romanticized rapes".

Rand's posthumously published working notes for the novel indicate that when she started on the book in 1936, she conceived of Roark's character that "were it necessary, he could rape her and feel justified". She denied that what happened in the finished novel was actually rape, referring to it as "rape by engraved invitation". She said Dominique wanted and "all but invited" the act, citing, among other things, a passage where Dominique scratches a marble slab in her bedroom to invite Roark to repair it. A true rape, Rand said, would be "a dreadful crime". Defenders of the novel have agreed with this interpretation. In an essay specifically explaining this scene, <a href="Andrew%20Bernstein">Andrew Bernstein</a> wrote that although much "confusion" exists about it, the descriptions in the novel provide "conclusive" evidence of Dominique's strong attraction to Roark and her desire to have sex with him. <a href="Individualist%20feminist">Individualist feminist</a> <a href="Wendy%20McElroy">Wendy McElroy</a> said that while Dominique is "thoroughly taken," there is nonetheless "clear indication" that Dominique both gave consent for and enjoyed the experience. Both Bernstein and McElroy saw the interpretations of feminists such as Brownmiller as based in a false understanding of sexuality.

Although Rand had some mainstream success previously with her play "<a href="Night%20of%20January%2016th">Night of January 16th</a>" and had two previously published novels, "The Fountainhead" was a major breakthrough in her career. It brought her lasting fame and financial success. She sold the movie rights to "The Fountainhead" and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay for the adaptation. In April 1944, she signed a multiyear contract with movie producer <a href="Hal%20Wallis">Hal Wallis</a> to write original screenplays and adaptations of other writers' works.

The success of the novel brought Rand new publishing opportunities. Bobbs-Merrill offered to publish a nonfiction book expanding on the ethical ideas presented in "The Fountainhead". Though this book was never completed, a portion of the material was used for an article in the January 1944 issue of "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>". Rand was also able to get an American publisher for "Anthem", which previously had been published in England, but not in the United States. When she was ready to submit "Atlas Shrugged" to publishers, over a dozen competed to acquire the new book.

"The Fountainhead" also attracted a new group of fans who were attracted to its philosophical ideas. When she moved back to New York in 1951, she gathered a group of these admirers to whom she referred publicly as "the Class of '43" in reference to the year "The Fountainhead" was published. The group evolved into the core of the <a href="Objectivist%20movement">Objectivist movement</a> that promoted the philosophical ideas from Rand's writing.

"The Fountainhead" has continued to have strong sales throughout the last century into the current one. By 2008, it had sold over 6.5 million copies in English. It has also been referred to in a variety of popular entertainments, including movies, television series, and other novels.

The year 1943 also saw the publication of "<a href="The%20God%20of%20the%20Machine">The God of the Machine</a>" by <a href="Isabel%20Paterson">Isabel Paterson</a> and "<a href="Rose%20Wilder%20Lane%23The%20Discovery%20of%20Freedom">The Discovery of Freedom</a>" by <a href="Rose%20Wilder%20Lane">Rose Wilder Lane</a>. Rand, Lane, and Paterson have been referred to as the founding mothers of the American <a href="libertarian%20movement">libertarian movement</a> with the publication of these works. Journalist <a href="John%20Chamberlain%20%28journalist%29">John Chamberlain</a>, for example, credited these works with converting him from socialism to what he called "an older American philosophy" of libertarian and conservative ideas. Literature professor Philip R. Yannella said the novel is "a central text of American conservative and libertarian political culture". In the United Kingdom, <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> politician <a href="Sajid%20Javid">Sajid Javid</a>, the British <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> since April 2018, has spoken of the novel's influence on him and how he regularly rereads the courtroom scene from Roark's criminal trial.

The book has a particular appeal to young people, an appeal that led historian James Baker to describe it as "more important than its detractors think, although not as important as Rand fans imagine". Philosopher <a href="Allan%20Bloom">Allan Bloom</a> said the novel is "hardly literature", but when he asked his students which books mattered to them, someone always was influenced by "The Fountainhead". Journalist <a href="Nora%20Ephron">Nora Ephron</a> wrote that she had loved the novel when she was 18, but admitted that she "missed the point", which she suggested is largely subliminal sexual metaphor. Ephron wrote that she decided upon rereading that "it is better read when one is young enough to miss the point. Otherwise, one cannot help thinking it is a very silly book."

"The Fountainhead" has been cited by numerous architects as an inspiration for their work. Architect Fred Stitt, founder of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Institute%20of%20Architecture">San Francisco Institute of Architecture</a>, dedicated a book to his "first architectural mentor, Howard Roark". According to architectural photographer <a href="Julius%20Shulman">Julius Shulman</a>, Rand's work "brought architecture into the public's focus for the first time". He said "The Fountainhead" was not only influential among 20th century architects, but also it "was one, first, front and center in the life of every architect who was a modern architect". The novel also had a significant impact on the public perception of architecture. During his <a href="Donald%20Trump%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">campaign for US President</a>, real estate developer <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> praised the novel, saying he identified with Roark.

In 1949, Warner Bros. released a film based on the book, starring <a href="Gary%20Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> as Howard Roark, <a href="Patricia%20Neal">Patricia Neal</a> as Dominique Francon, <a href="Raymond%20Massey">Raymond Massey</a> as Gail Wynand, and <a href="Kent%20Smith">Kent Smith</a> as Peter Keating. Rand, who had previous experience as a screenwriter, was hired to adapt her own novel. The film was directed by <a href="King%20Vidor">King Vidor</a>. It grossed $2.1 million, $400,000 less than its production budget. Critics panned the movie. Negative reviews appeared in publications ranging from newspapers such as "The New York Times" and the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", to movie industry outlets such as "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" and "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>", to magazines such as "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" and "<a href="Good%20Housekeeping">Good Housekeeping</a>".

In letters written at the time, Rand's reaction to the film was positive. She said it was the most faithful adaptation of a novel ever made in Hollywood and a "real triumph". Sales of the novel increased as a result of interest spurred by the film. She displayed a more negative attitude later, saying she disliked the entire movie and complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements. Rand said she would never sell rights to another novel to a film company that did not allow her to pick the director and screenwriter, as well as edit the film.

Various filmmakers have expressed interest in doing new adaptations of "The Fountainhead", although none of these potential films has begun production. In the 1970s, writer-director <a href="Michael%20Cimino">Michael Cimino</a> wanted to film his own script for <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a>. In 1992, producer James Hill optioned the rights and selected <a href="Phil%20Joanou">Phil Joanou</a> to direct. In the 2000s, <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a> was interested in directing a new adaptation; <a href="Brad%20Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> was reportedly under consideration to play Roark. In a March 2016 interview, director <a href="Zack%20Snyder">Zack Snyder</a> also expressed interest in doing a new film adaptation of "The Fountainhead". On May 28, 2018, Snyder was asked on the social media site <a href="Vero%20%28app%29">Vero</a> what his next project was, and he responded "Fountainhead".

The Dutch theater company <a href="Toneelgroep%20Amsterdam">Toneelgroep Amsterdam</a> presented an adaptation for the stage (in Dutch) at the <a href="Holland%20Festival">Holland Festival</a> in June 2014. The company's artistic director <a href="Ivo%20van%20Hove">Ivo van Hove</a> wrote and directed the adaptation. <a href="Ramsey%20Nasr">Ramsey Nasr</a> starred as Howard Roark, with <a href="Halina%20Reijn">Halina Reijn</a> as Dominique Francon. The four-hour production used video projections to show close-ups of the actors and Roark's drawings, as well as backgrounds of the New York skyline. After its debut the production went on tour, appearing in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, Spain, in early July 2014, and at the <a href="Festival%20d%27Avignon">Festival d'Avignon</a> in France later that month. The play appeared at the <a href="Od%C3%A9on-Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20de%20l%27Europe">Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe</a> in Paris in November 2016, and at the <a href="LG%20Arts%20Center">LG Arts Center</a> in <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a> from March 31 to April 2, 2017. The play had its first American production at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Academy%20of%20Music">Brooklyn Academy of Music</a>'s Next Wave Festival, where it ran from November 28 to December 2, 2017.

The European productions of the play received mostly positive reviews. The Festival d'Avignon production received positive from the French newspapers "<a href="La%20Croix">La Croix</a>", "<a href="Les%20%C3%89chos%20%28newspaper%29">Les Échos</a>", and "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>", as well as from the English newspaper "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", whose reviewer described it as "electrifying theatre". The French magazine "<a href="T%C3%A9l%C3%A9rama">Télérama</a>" gave the Avignon production a negative review, calling the source material inferior and complaining about the use of video screens on the set, while another French magazine, "<a href="w%3Afr%3ALa%20Terrasse%20%28journal%29">La Terrasse</a>", complimented the staging and acting of the Odéon production.

American critics gave mostly negative reviews of the Next Wave Festival production. Helen Shaw's review for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" said the adaptation was unwatchable because it portrayed Rand's characters and views seriously without undercutting them. The reviewer for the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" said the play was too long and that Hove had approached Rand's "noxious" book with too much reverence. In a mixed review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", critic <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> complimented Hove for capturing Rand's "sheer pulp appeal", but described the material as "hokum with a whole lot of ponderous speeches". A review for "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" complimented van Hove's ability to portray Rand's message, but said the play was an hour too long.

The novel was adapted in <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> for the <a href="Pakistan%20Television%20Network">Pakistan Television Network</a> in the 1970s, under the title "Teesra Kinara". The serial starred <a href="Rahat%20Kazmi">Rahat Kazmi</a>, who also wrote the adaptation. Kazmi's wife, Sahira Kazmi, played Dominique.

The novel was also parodied in an episode of the <a href="Animated%20series">animated adventure series</a> "" and in <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2020%29">season 20</a> of the <a href="animated%20sitcom">animated sitcom</a> "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", in the last part of the episode "<a href="Four%20Great%20Women%20and%20a%20Manicure%23Maggie%20Roark">Four Great Women and a Manicure</a>".

In 1944, "<a href="Omnibook%20Magazine">Omnibook Magazine</a>" produced an <a href="abridged">abridged</a> edition of the novel that was sold to members of the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States Armed Forces</a>. Rand was annoyed that Bobbs-Merrill allowed the edited version to be published without her approval of the text. <a href="King%20Features%20Syndicate">King Features Syndicate</a> approached Rand the following year about creating a condensed, illustrated version of the novel for <a href="Print%20syndication">syndication</a> in newspapers. Rand agreed, provided that she could oversee the editing and approve the proposed illustrations of her characters, which were provided by <a href="Frank%20Godwin">Frank Godwin</a>. The 30-part series began on December 24, 1945, and ran in over 35 newspapers. Rand biographer Anne Heller complimented the adaptation, calling it "handsomely illustrated".

Henry Wood

Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 186919 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of <a href="promenade%20concert">promenade concert</a>s, known as the <a href="The%20Proms">Proms</a>. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the "Henry Wood Promenade Concerts", although they continued to be generally referred to as "the Proms".

Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a>, he came under the influence of the voice teacher <a href="Manuel%20Patricio%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Garc%C3%ADa">Manuel Garcia</a> and became his accompanist. After similar work for <a href="Richard%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a>'s opera companies on the works of <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger <a href="Carl%20Rosa%20Opera%20Company">Carl Rosa Opera Company</a>. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>'s "<a href="Eugene%20Onegin%20%28opera%29">Eugene Onegin</a>" in 1892.

From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario <a href="Robert%20Newman%20%28impresario%29">Robert Newman</a> to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a>, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>.

Wood declined the chief conductorships of the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a> and <a href="Boston%20Symphony">Boston Symphony</a> Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and nurtured the taste of the public, presenting a vast repertoire of music spanning four centuries.

Wood was born in <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a>, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, "née" Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's <a href="pawnbroker">pawnbroking</a> business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal <a href="tenor">tenor</a> in the choir of <a href="St%20Sepulchre-without-Newgate">St Sepulchre-without-Newgate</a>, known as "the musicians' church". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a <a href="Broadwood%20and%20Sons">Broadwood</a> piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola.
Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, <a href="George%20Cooper%20%28organist%29">George Cooper</a>, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at <a href="St%20Mary%20Aldermanbury">St Mary Aldermanbury</a>, being paid <a href="Half%20crown%20%28British%20coin%29">half a crown</a>. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the <a href="Slade%20School%20of%20Fine%20Art">Slade School of Fine Art</a>. He remained a life-long amateur painter.

After taking private lessons from the musicologist <a href="Ebenezer%20Prout">Ebenezer Prout</a>, Wood entered the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren. It is not clear whether he was a member of <a href="Manuel%20Patricio%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Garc%C3%ADa">Manuel Garcia</a>'s singing class, but it is certain that he became its accompanist and was greatly influenced by Garcia. Wood also accompanied the opera class, taught by Garcia's son <a href="Gustave%20Garcia">Gustave</a>. Wood's ambition at the time was to become a teacher of singing, and he gave singing lessons throughout his life. He attended the classes of as many singing teachers as he could, although by his own account, "I possess a terrible voice. Garcia said it would go through a brick wall. In fact, a real conductor's voice."

On leaving the Royal Academy of Music in 1888, Wood taught singing privately and was soon very successful, attracting "more singing pupils than I could comfortably deal with" at half a guinea an hour. He also worked as a <a href="r%C3%A9p%C3%A9titeur">répétiteur</a>. According to his memoirs, he worked in that capacity for <a href="Richard%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a> during the rehearsals for the first production of "<a href="The%20Yeomen%20of%20the%20Guard">The Yeomen of the Guard</a>" at the <a href="Savoy%20Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a> in 1888. His biographer <a href="Arthur%20Jacobs">Arthur Jacobs</a> doubts this and discounts exchanges Wood purported to have had with <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sir Arthur Sullivan</a> about the score. Jacobs describes Wood's memoirs as "vivacious in style but factually unreliable".
It is certain, however, that Wood was répétiteur at Carte's <a href="Palace%20Theatre%2C%20London">Royal English Opera House</a> for Sullivan's <a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a> "<a href="Ivanhoe%20%28opera%29">Ivanhoe</a>" in late 1890 and early 1891, and for <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a>'s "<a href="La%20Basoche">La Basoche</a>" in 1891–92. He also worked for Carte at the Savoy as assistant to <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Cellier">François Cellier</a> on "<a href="The%20Nautch%20Girl">The Nautch Girl</a>" in 1891. Wood remained devoted to Sullivan's music and later insisted on programming his concert works when they were out of fashion in musical circles. During this period, he had several compositions of his own performed, including an <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>, "St. Dorothea" (1889), a light opera, "Daisy" (1890), and a one-act comic opera, "Returning the Compliment" (1890).

Wood recalled that his first professional appearance as a conductor was at a choral concert in December 1887. Ad hoc engagements of this kind were commonplace for organists, but they brought little prestige such as was given to British conductor-composers such as Sullivan, <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28composer%29">Alexander Mackenzie</a>, or the rising generation of German star conductors led by <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Nikisch">Arthur Nikisch</a>. His first sustained work as a conductor was his 1889 appointment as musical director of a small touring opera ensemble, the Arthur Rouseby English Touring Opera. The company was not of a high standard, with an orchestra of only six players augmented by local recruits at each tour venue. Wood eventually negotiated a release from his contract, and after a brief return to teaching he secured a better appointment as conductor for the <a href="Carl%20Rosa%20Opera%20Company">Carl Rosa Opera Company</a> in 1891. For that company he conducted "<a href="Carmen">Carmen</a>", "<a href="The%20Bohemian%20Girl">The Bohemian Girl</a>", "<a href="The%20Daughter%20of%20the%20Regiment">The Daughter of the Regiment</a>", "<a href="Maritana">Maritana</a>", and "<a href="Il%20trovatore">Il trovatore</a>". This appointment was followed by a similar engagement with a company set up by former Carl Rosa singers.

When Signor Lago, formerly impresario of the Imperial Opera Company of St. Petersburg, was looking for a second conductor to work with <a href="Luigi%20Arditi">Luigi Arditi</a> for a proposed London season, Garcia recommended Wood. The season opened at the newly rebuilt <a href="Olympic%20Theatre">Olympic Theatre</a> in London, in October 1892, with Wood conducting the British premiere of <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>'s "<a href="Eugene%20Onegin%20%28opera%29">Eugene Onegin</a>". At that time the operatic conductor was not seen as an important figure, but the critics who chose to mention the conducting gave Wood good reviews. The work was not popular with the public, and the season was cut short when Lago absconded, leaving the company unpaid. Before that debacle, Wood had also conducted performances of "Maritana" and rehearsed "<a href="Oberon%20%28Weber%29">Oberon</a>" and "<a href="Der%20Freisch%C3%BCtz">Der Freischütz</a>". After the collapse of the Olympic opera season, Wood returned once more to his singing tuition. With the exception of a season at the <a href="Opera%20Comique">Opera Comique</a> in 1896, Wood's subsequent conducting career was in the concert hall.

In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth</a> where he met the conductor <a href="Felix%20Mottl">Felix Mottl</a>, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> in London. The manager of the hall, <a href="Robert%20Newman%20%28impresario%29">Robert Newman</a>, was proposing to run a ten-week season of <a href="promenade%20concerts">promenade concerts</a> and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from <a href="Louis%20Antoine%20Jullien">Louis Antoine Jullien</a> to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a> symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Philharmonic Society</a> and others. Newman aimed to do the same: "I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music."

Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.

Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy <a href="Otolaryngology">ear, nose and throat</a> specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard <a href="Concert%20pitch%2319th%20and%2020th%20century%20standards">"diapason normal"</a>. Concert pitch in England was nearly a <a href="semitone">semitone</a> higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.

On 10 August 1895, the first of the Queen's Hall Promenade Concerts took place. Among those present who later recalled the opening was the singer <a href="Agnes%20Nicholls">Agnes Nicholls</a>:

Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his position behind the curtain at the end of the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem ... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the "<a href="Rienzi">Rienzi</a>" Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.

The rest of the programme comprised, in the words of an historian of the Proms, David Cox, "for the most part ... blatant trivialities." Within days, however, Wood was shifting the balance from light music to mainstream classical works, with <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Schubert%29">Unfinished Symphony</a> and further excerpts from <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a> operas. Among the other symphonies Wood conducted during the first season were Schubert's "<a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Schubert%29">Great C Major</a>", <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>'s "<a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Italian</a>" and <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Schumann%29">Fourth</a>. The concertos included Mendelssohn's <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Violin Concerto</a> and Schumann's <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Schumann%29">Piano Concerto</a>. During the season Wood presented 23 novelties, including the London premieres of pieces by <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>, Tchaikovsky, <a href="Alexander%20Glazunov">Glazunov</a>, <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</a>. Newman and Wood soon felt able to devote every Monday night of the season principally to Wagner and every Friday night to Beethoven, a pattern that endured for decades.

The income from the concerts did not permit generous rehearsal time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that "if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong." The violist Bernard Shore wrote, "You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with "that" stick in front of you". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a> recounted a story by one of his players who recalled that Wood "had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10 a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time."

Another feature of Wood's conducting was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check the instrument of each member of the woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve <a href="Musical%20ensemble">ensemble</a>, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.
Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera "Shamus O'Brien" at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, "I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday". Seventy-five years later, <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a> ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> in November 1898, <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, "Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?"

In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as "a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony". As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics.

The promenade concerts flourished through the 1890s, but in 1902 Newman, who had been investing unwisely in theatrical presentations, found himself unable to bear the financial responsibility for the Queen's Hall Orchestra and was declared bankrupt. The concerts were rescued by the musical benefactor <a href="Edgar%20Speyer">Sir Edgar Speyer</a>, a banker of German origin. Speyer put up the necessary funds, retained Newman as manager of the concerts, and encouraged him and Wood to continue with their project of improving the public's taste. At the beginning of 1902, Wood accepted the conductorship of that year's <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> triennial festival. He continued to be associated with that festival until 1936, changing its emphasis from choral to orchestral pieces. A German critic, reviewing the festival for a Berlin publication, wrote, "Two personalities now represent a new epoch in English musical life – <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a> as composer, and Henry J. Wood as conductor." Later in the year, overtaxed by his enormous workload, Wood's health broke down. Even though this was during the Proms season, Cathcart insisted that Wood should have a complete break and change of scene. Leaving the leader of the orchestra, Arthur Payne, to conduct during his absence, Wood and his wife took a cruise to Morocco, missing the Proms concerts from 13 October to 8 November.

In the early years of the Proms there were complaints in some musical journals that Wood was neglecting British music. In 1899 Newman unsuccessfully attempted to secure for Wood the premiere of Elgar's "<a href="Enigma%20Variations">Enigma Variations</a>", but in the same year Newman passed up the opportunity to introduce the music of <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Delius</a> to London concertgoers. By the end of the first decade of the new century, however, Wood's reputation in conducting British music was in no doubt; he gave the world, British or London premieres of more than a hundred British works between 1900 and 1910. Meanwhile, he introduced his audiences to many European composers. In the 1903 season, he programmed symphonies by <a href="Anton%20Bruckner">Bruckner</a> (<a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Bruckner%29">No. 7</a>), <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a> (<a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Sibelius%29">No. 1</a>), and <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a> (<a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Mahler%29">No. 1</a>). In the same year, he introduced several of Richard Strauss's tone poems to London, and in 1905 he gave Strauss's "<a href="Symphonia%20Domestica">Symphonia Domestica</a>". This prompted the composer to write, "I cannot leave London without an expression of admiration for the splendid Orchestra which Henry Wood's master hand has created in such a short time."

Creating the orchestra admired by Strauss had not been achieved without a struggle. In 1904, Wood and Newman tackled the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: "Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning." Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra: the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>. Wood bore no grudge and attended their first concert, although it was 12 years before he agreed to conduct the orchestra.

Wood had great sympathy for rank-and-file orchestral players and strove for improvements in their pay. He sought to raise their status and was the first British conductor to insist that the orchestra should stand to acknowledge applause along with the conductor. He introduced women into the Queen's Hall Orchestra in 1913. He said, "I do not like ladies playing the trombone or double bass, but they can play the violin, and they do." By 1918 Wood had 14 women in his orchestra.

Wood conducted his own compositions and arrangements from time to time. He gave his "Fantasia on Welsh Melodies" and "Fantasia on Scottish Melodies" on successive nights in 1909. He composed the work for which he is most celebrated, "<a href="Fantasia%20on%20British%20Sea%20Songs">Fantasia on British Sea Songs</a>", for a concert in 1905, celebrating the centenary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>. It caught the public fancy immediately, with its mixture of sea-shanties, together with <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>'s "See the Conquering Hero Comes" and <a href="Thomas%20Arne">Arne</a>'s "Rule, Britannia!". He played it at the Proms more than 40 times, and it became a fixture at the "<a href="Last%20Night%20of%20the%20Proms">Last Night of the Proms</a>", the lively concert marking the end of each season. It remained so under his successors, though often rearranged, notably by <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Sir Malcolm Sargent</a>. A highlight of the Fantasia is the <a href="hornpipe">hornpipe</a> ("Jack's the Lad"); Wood said of it:

They stamp their feet in time to the hornpipe – that is until I whip up the orchestra to a fierce "<a href="Tempo%23Terms%20for%20change%20in%20tempo">accelerando</a>" which leaves behind all those whose stamping technique is not of the very finest quality. I like to win by two bars, if possible; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half. It is good fun, and I enjoy it as much as they.

Among Wood's other works was his "Purcell Suite", incorporating themes from <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a>'s stage works and string sonatas, which Wood performed at an orchestral festival in Zurich in 1921, and orchestral transcriptions of works by a range of composers from <a href="Isaac%20Alb%C3%A9niz">Albéniz</a> to <a href="Antonio%20Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a>.

Wood worked with his wife for many concerts, and was her piano accompanist at her recitals. In 1906, at the <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a> music festival he presented Beethoven's <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Choral</a> Symphony and <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>'s "<a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion">St Matthew Passion</a>", with his wife among the singers. In December 1909, after a short illness, Olga Wood died. Cathcart took Wood away to take his mind off his loss. On his return, Wood resumed his professional routine, with the exception that, after Olga's death, he rarely performed as piano accompanist for anyone else; his skill in that art was greatly missed by the critics. In June 1911, he married his secretary, Muriel Ellen Greatrex (1882–1967), with whom he had two daughters. In the same year he accepted a <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighthood</a>, and declined the conductorship of the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">New York Philharmonic Orchestra</a> in succession to Mahler, as he felt it his duty to devote himself to the British public.

Throughout the early part of the century, Wood was influential in changing the habits of concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section. Wood discouraged this, sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed in programmes. For this he was much praised in the musical and national press. In addition to his work at the Queen's Hall, Wood conducted at the Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>, and <a href="Westmorland">Westmorland</a> festivals, and at orchestral concerts in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> and <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. His programming was summarised in "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", which listed the number of each composer's works played in the 1911 Proms season; the top ten were: Wagner (121); Beethoven (34); Tchaikovsky (30); <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> (28); <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Dvořák</a> (16); <a href="Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber">Weber</a> (16); J.S. Bach (14); <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> (14); Elgar (14); and <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> (13).
The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are singled out by Cox as among the finest of this part of Wood's career. Among those conducting their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>, <a href="Max%20Reger">Reger</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Scriabin">Scriabin</a>, and <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Rachmaninoff</a>. <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Schoenberg</a>'s "<a href="Five%20Pieces%20for%20Orchestra">Five Pieces for Orchestra</a>" also received its first performance (the composer not being present); during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, "Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time". The critic <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a> wrote after the performance: "It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London." However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: "I must say it was the first time since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands."

On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Newman, Wood and Speyer discussed whether the Proms should continue as planned. They had by this time become an established institution, and it was agreed to go ahead. However, anti-German feeling forced Speyer to leave the country and seek refuge in the US, and there was a campaign to ban all German music from concerts. Newman put out a statement declaring that German music would be played as planned: "The greatest examples of Music and Art are world possessions and unassailable even by the prejudices and passions of the hour." When Speyer left Britain, the music publishers Chappell's took on the responsibility for the Queen's Hall and its orchestra. The Proms continued throughout the war years, with fewer major new works than before, although there were nevertheless British premieres of pieces by <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a>, <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> and Debussy. An historian of the Proms, Ateş Orga, wrote, "Concerts often had to be re-timed to coincide with the 'All Clear' between air raids. Falling bombs, shrapnel, anti-aircraft fire and the droning of Zeppelins were ever threatening. But [Wood] kept things on the go and in the end had a very real part to play in boosting morale."

Towards the end of the war, Wood received an offer by which he was seriously tempted: the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> invited him to become its musical director. He had been guest conductor of the <a href="Berlin%20Philharmonic">Berlin</a> and New York Philharmonic Orchestras, but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest in the world. Nonetheless, as he told Boult, "it was hard to refuse, but I felt it was a patriotic duty to remain in my own country, at the present moment."
After the war, the Proms continued much as before. The second halves of concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over sponsorship of the Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell's were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, most of which were not profitable.

In 1921 Wood was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first English conductor to receive the honour. By now he was beginning to find his position as Britain's leading conductor under challenge from rising younger rivals. <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Thomas Beecham</a> had been an increasingly influential figure since about 1910. He and Wood did not like one another, and each avoided mention of the other in his memoirs. Adrian Boult, who, at Wood's recommendation, took over some of his responsibilities at Birmingham in 1923, always admired and respected Wood. Other younger conductors included men who had been members of Wood's orchestra, including <a href="Basil%20Cameron">Basil Cameron</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Aynsley%20Goossens">Eugene Goossens</a>. Another protégé of Wood was <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a>, who appeared at the Proms as a composer-conductor in 1921 and 1922. Wood encouraged him to abandon thoughts of a career as a pianist and to concentrate on conducting. Wood further showed his interest in the future of music by taking on the conductorship of the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music in 1923, rehearsing it twice a week, whenever possible, for the next twenty years. In the same year, he accepted the conductorship of the amateur Hull Philharmonic Orchestra, travelling three times a year until 1939 to rehearse and conduct its concerts.

In 1925 Wood was invited to conduct four concerts for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra</a> at the <a href="Hollywood%20Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a>. Such was their success, both artistic and financial, that Wood was invited back, and conducted again the following year. In addition to a large number of English pieces, Wood programmed works by composers as diverse as Bach and Stravinsky. He again conducted there in 1934.

On his return to England from his first Hollywood trip, Wood found himself in the middle of a feud between the chairman of Chappell's, William Boosey, and the BBC. Boosey had conceived a passionate hostility to the broadcasting of music, fearing that it would lead to the end of live concerts. He attempted to prevent anyone who wished to perform at the Queen's Hall from broadcasting for the BBC. This affected many of the artists whom Wood and Newman needed for the Proms. The matter was unresolved when Newman died in 1926. Shortly afterwards, Boosey announced that Chappell's would no longer support concerts at the Queen's Hall. The prospect that the Proms might not be able to continue caused widespread dismay, and there was a general welcome for the BBC's announcement that it would take over the running of the Proms, and would also run a winter series of symphony concerts at the Queen's Hall.
The BBC regime brought immediate benefits. The use of the second half of concerts to promote Chappell's songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC's control, the songs in the second half were by Schubert, <a href="Roger%20Quilter">Quilter</a> and <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Parry</a> rather than ballads from Chappell's. For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available.

In 1929, Wood played a celebrated practical joke on musicologists and critics. "I got "very fed up with them", always finding fault with any arrangement or orchestrations that I made ... 'spoiling the original' etc. etc.", and so Wood passed off his own orchestration of Bach's "<a href="Toccata%20and%20Fugue%20in%20D%20minor%2C%20BWV%20565">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</a>", as a transcription by a Russian composer called Paul Klenovsky. In Wood's later account, the press and the BBC "fell into the trap and said the scoring was wonderful, Klenovsky had the real flare for true colour etc. – and performance after performance was given and "asked for"." Wood kept the secret for five years before revealing the truth. The press treated the deception as a great joke; "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" entered into the spirit of it with a jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky.

As Wood's working life took a turn for the better, his domestic life started to deteriorate. During the early 1930s, he and his wife gradually became estranged, and their relationship ended in bitterness, with Muriel taking most of Wood's money and, for much of the time, living abroad. She refused to divorce him. The breach between Muriel and Wood also caused his estrangement from their daughters. In 1934 he began a happy relationship with a widowed former pupil, Jessie Linton, who had sung for him frequently in the past under her professional name of Jessie Goldsack. One of Wood's players recalled, "She changed him. He had been badly dressed, awful clothes. Jessie got him a new evening suit, instead of the mouldy green one, and he flourished yellow gloves and a cigar ... he became human." As Wood was not free to remarry, she changed her name by deed poll to "Lady Jessie Wood" and was generally assumed by the public to be Wood's wife. In his memoirs, Wood mentioned neither his second marriage nor his subsequent relationship.

In his later years, Wood came to be identified with the Proms rather than with the year-round concert season. Boult was appointed director of music at the BBC in 1930. In that capacity he strove to ensure that Wood was invited to conduct a fitting number of BBC symphony concerts outside the Prom season. The BBC chose Wood for important collaborations with Bartók and <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a>, and for the first British performance of Mahler's vast <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Mahler%29">Symphony No. 8</a>. But Jacobs notes that, in the general concert repertory, Wood now had to compete against well-known foreign conductors such as <a href="Bruno%20Walter">Bruno Walter</a>, <a href="Willem%20Mengelberg">Willem Mengelberg</a>, and <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>, "in comparison with whom he was increasingly seen as a workhorse".

In 1936, Wood was in charge of his final Sheffield festival. The choral works he conducted included the <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a> "<a href="Requiem%20%28Verdi%29">Requiem</a>", Beethoven's "<a href="Missa%20Solemnis%20%28Beethoven%29">Missa Solemnis</a>", <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>' "<a href="Te%20Deum%20%28Berlioz%29">Te Deum</a>", <a href="William%20Walton">Walton</a>'s "<a href="Belshazzar%27s%20Feast%20%28Walton%29">Belshazzar's Feast</a>", and, in the presence of the composer, Rachmaninoff's "<a href="The%20Bells%20%28symphony%29">The Bells</a>". The following year, Wood began planning for a grand concert to mark his fiftieth year as a conductor. The <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> was chosen as the venue, having a far larger capacity than the Queen's Hall. The concert was given on 5 October 1938. Rachmaninoff played the solo part in his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Rachmaninoff%29">Second Piano Concerto</a>, and <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Vaughan Williams</a>, at Wood's request, composed a short choral work for the occasion: the "<a href="Serenade%20to%20Music">Serenade to Music</a>" for orchestra and 16 soloists. The other composers represented in the programme were Sullivan, Beethoven, Bach, <a href="Arnold%20Bax">Bax</a>, Wagner, Handel and Elgar. The orchestra comprised players from the three London orchestras: the London Symphony, <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic</a> and BBC Symphony Orchestras. The concert raised £9,000 for Wood's chosen charity, providing health care for musicians. In the same year, Wood published his autobiography, "My Life of Music".
In September 1939, the Second World War broke out and the BBC immediately put into effect its contingency plans to move much of its broadcasting away from London to places thought less susceptible to bombing. Its musical activities, including the orchestra, moved to Bristol. The BBC withdrew not only the players, but financial support from the Proms. Wood determined that the 1940 season would nevertheless go ahead. The Royal Philharmonic Society and a private entrepreneur, Keith Douglas, agreed to back an eight-week season, and the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged. The season was curtailed after four weeks, when intense bombing forced the Queen's Hall to close. The last Prom given at the Queen's Hall was on 7 September 1940. In May 1941, the hall was destroyed by bombs.

It was immediately agreed that the 1941 season of Proms should be held at the Albert Hall. It was twice the size of the Queen's Hall, with poor acoustics, but a six-week series was judged a success, and the Albert Hall remained the home of the Proms. Wood, aged seventy-two, was persuaded to have an associate conductor to relieve him of some of the burden. Basil Cameron undertook the task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement, aged eighty, in 1964. The BBC brought its symphony orchestra back to London and resumed its backing of the Proms in 1942; Boult joined Cameron as Wood's associate conductor during that season. In early 1943, Wood's health deteriorated, and two days after the start of that year's season, he collapsed and was ordered to have a month in bed. Despite wartime vicissitudes, the 1943 season sold nearly 250,000 tickets, with an average audience of about 4,000 – many more than could have fitted into the Queen's Hall.

Despite his age and the difficulties of wartime travel, Wood insisted on going to provincial cities to conduct – as much, according to Jacobs, to help the local orchestras survive as to gratify audiences. His final season was in 1944. The season began well with Wood in good form, but after three weeks raids by the devastating new German flying bombs caused the government to order the closure of places of entertainment. The Proms were immediately relocated to <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a> some away, where Wood continued to conduct. He was taken ill in early August and was unable to conduct the fiftieth anniversary Prom on 10 August; he was forbidden by his doctor even to listen to its broadcast. Wood died just over a week later on 19 August at Hitchin Hospital in <a href="Hitchin">Hitchin</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>; his funeral service was held in the town at <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Hitchin">St Mary's church</a>, and his ashes were interred in the Musicians' Chapel of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.

Wood's recording career began in 1908, when he accompanied his wife Olga in "Farewell, forests" by Tchaikovsky, for the Gramophone and Typewriter Company, better known as <a href="HMV">His Master's Voice</a> or HMV. They made eight other records together for HMV over the next two years. After Olga's death, Wood signed a contract with HMV's rival, <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia</a>, for whom he made a series of discs between 1915 and 1917 with the singer <a href="Clara%20Butt">Clara Butt</a>, including excerpts from Elgar's "<a href="The%20Dream%20of%20Gerontius">The Dream of Gerontius</a>". Between 1915 and 1925 he conducted 65 recordings for Columbia using the early acoustic recording process, including many discs of Wagner excerpts and a truncated version of Elgar's <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">Violin Concerto</a> with <a href="Albert%20Sammons">Albert Sammons</a> as soloist. When the microphone and electrical recording were introduced in 1925, Wood re-recorded the Elgar concerto, with Sammons, and made 36 other discs for Columbia over the next nine years. The 1929 recording of the Elgar concerto has been reissued on compact disc and is well regarded by some critics.

Wood was wooed from Columbia by the young <a href="Decca%20records">Decca</a> company in 1935. For Decca he conducted 23 recordings over the next two years, including Beethoven's <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Beethoven%29">Fifth Symphony</a>, Elgar's "Enigma Variations" and Vaughan Williams's "<a href="A%20London%20Symphony">A London Symphony</a>". In 1938 he returned to Columbia, for whom his five new recordings included the "Serenade to Music" with the 16 original singers, a few days after the premiere, and his own "Fantasia on British Sea Songs".

Wood's recordings did not remain in the catalogues long after his death. "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>", 1956, lists none of his records. A few of his recordings have subsequently been reissued on compact disc, including the Decca and Columbia Vaughan Williams recordings from 1936 and 1938.

In Jacobs's 1994 biography, the list of premieres conducted by Wood extends to 18 pages. His world premieres included <a href="Frank%20Bridge">Frank Bridge</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sea%20%28Bridge%29">The Sea</a>"; <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Britten</a>'s <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Britten%29">Piano Concerto</a>; Delius's "A Song Before Sunrise", "<a href="A%20Song%20of%20Summer">A Song of Summer</a>", and "Idyll"; Elgar's "<a href="The%20Wand%20of%20Youth">The Wand of Youth</a>" Suite No. 1, "Sospiri" and the 4th and 5th <a href="Pomp%20and%20Circumstance%20Marches">Pomp and Circumstance Marches</a>; and Vaughan Williams's "Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1", "<a href="Flos%20Campi">Flos Campi</a>" and "Serenade to Music".

In addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911, Wood's state honours were his appointments as <a href="Companion%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> in 1944, to the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28Belgium%29">Order of the Crown</a> (Belgium; 1920), and <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Legion%20of%20Honour">Officer of the Legion of Honour</a> (France; 1926). He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> (1923).
Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams "Serenade to Music", works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, <a href="Marcel%20Dupr%C3%A9">Marcel Dupré</a> and Walton. The <a href="Poet%20Laureate">poet laureate</a>, <a href="John%20Masefield">John Masefield</a>, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled "Sir Henry Wood", often referred to by its first line, "Where does the uttered music go?". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.

Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975. His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a <a href="laurel%20wreath">chaplet</a> on the Last Night of the Proms. His collection of 2,800 orchestral scores and 1,920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music. For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund, giving financial aid to students. The <a href="University%20of%20Strathclyde">University of Strathclyde</a> named a building at its <a href="Jordanhill%20College">Jordanhill campus</a> after him. His best-known memorial is the Proms, officially "the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts", but universally referred to by the informal short version.

His biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood:

His orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him "Timber" – more than a play on his name, since it seemed to represent his reliability too. His tally of first performances, or first performances in Britain, was heroic: at least 717 works by 357 composers. Greatness as measured by finesse of execution may not be his, particularly in his limited legacy of recordings, but he remains one of the most remarkable musicians Britain has produced.

Paulinus of York

Paulinus (died 10 October 644) was a Roman missionary and the first <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Bishop of York</a>. A member of the <a href="Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian mission</a> sent in 601 by Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Gregory I</a> to <a href="Christianization">Christianize</a> the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> from their native <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxon paganism</a>, Paulinus arrived in England by 604 with the second missionary group. Little is known of Paulinus' activities in the following two decades.

After some years spent in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, perhaps in 625, Paulinus was <a href="Consecration">consecrated</a> a bishop. He accompanied <a href="%C3%86thelburg%20of%20Kent">Æthelburg of Kent</a>, sister of King <a href="Eadbald%20of%20Kent">Eadbald of Kent</a>, on her journey to <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> to marry King <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">Edwin of Northumbria</a>, and eventually succeeded in converting Edwin to Christianity. Paulinus also converted many of Edwin's subjects and built some churches. One of the women Paulinus <a href="baptism">baptised</a> was a future saint, <a href="Hilda%20of%20Whitby">Hilda of Whitby</a>. Following Edwin's death in 633, Paulinus and Æthelburg fled Northumbria, leaving behind a member of Paulinus' clergy, <a href="James%20the%20Deacon">James the Deacon</a>. Paulinus returned to Kent, where he became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>. He received a <a href="pallium">pallium</a> from the pope, symbolizing his appointment as Archbishop of York, but too late to be effective. After his death in 644, Paulinus was canonized as a saint and is now venerated in the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, and <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican</a> Churches.

Paulinus was a monk from Rome sent to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kingdom of Kent</a> by Pope Gregory I in 601, along with <a href="Mellitus">Mellitus</a> and others, as part of the second group of missionaries sent to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. He was probably an Italian by birth. The second group of missionaries arrived in Kent by 604, but little is known of Paulinus' further activities until he went to Northumbria.

Paulinus remained in Kent until 625, when he was consecrated as bishop by <a href="Justus">Justus</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, on 21 July. He then accompanied Æthelburg, the sister of King Eadbald of Kent, to Northumbria where she was to marry King Edwin of Northumbria. A condition of the marriage was that Edwin had promised that he would allow Æthelburg to remain a Christian and worship as she chose. <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, writing in the early 8th century, reports that Paulinus wished to convert the Northumbrians, as well as provide religious services to the new queen.

There is some difficulty with Bede's chronology on the date of Æthelburh's marriage, as surviving papal letters to Edwin urging him to convert imply that Eadbald only recently had become a Christian, which conflicts with Bede's chronology. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that Paulinus and Æthelburh must therefore have gone to Northumbria earlier than 624, and that Paulinus went north, not as a bishop, but as a priest, returning later to be consecrated. The historian <a href="Henry%20Mayr-Harting">Henry Mayr-Harting</a> agrees with Kirby's reasoning. Another historian, <a href="Peter%20Hunter%20Blair">Peter Hunter Blair</a>, argues that Æthelburh and Edwin were married before 625, but that she did not go to Northumbria until 625. If Kirby's arguments are accepted, then the date of Paulinus' consecration needs to be changed by a year, to 21 July 626.

Bede describes Paulinus as "a man tall of stature, a little stooping, with black hair and a thin face, a hooked and thin nose, his aspect both venerable and awe-inspiring".

Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin that the birth of his and Æthelburg's daughter at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of <a href="Wessex">West Saxons</a> from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter <a href="Eanfl%C3%A6d">Eanflæd</a> to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King <a href="R%C3%A6dwald%20of%20East%20Anglia">Rædwald of East Anglia</a>. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, he laid his hand on the king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a> of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.

It is unlikely that it was supernatural affairs and Paulinus' persuasion alone that caused Edwin to convert. The Northumbrian nobles seem to have been willing and the king also received letters from Pope <a href="Pope%20Boniface%20V">Boniface V</a> urging his conversion. Eventually convinced, Edwin and many of his followers were baptised at <a href="York">York</a> in 627. One story relates that during a stay with Edwin and Æthelburg at their palace in <a href="Yeavering">Yeavering</a>, Paulinus spent 36 days baptising new converts. Paulinus also was an active missionary in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Lindsey">Lindsey</a>, and his missionary activities help show the limits of Edwin's royal authority.

Pope Gregory's plan had been that York would be England's second <a href="Metropolitan%20bishop">metropolitan</a> <a href="diocese">see</a>, so Paulinus established his church there. Although built of stone, no trace of it has been found. Paulinus also built a number of churches on royal estates. His church in <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a> has been identified with the earliest building phase of the church of St Paul in the Bail.

Among those consecrated by Paulinus were Hilda, later the founding abbess of <a href="Whitby%20Abbey">Whitby Abbey</a>, and Hilda's successor, Eanflæd, Edwin's daughter. As the only Roman bishop in England, Paulinus also consecrated another Gregorian missionary, <a href="Honorius%20of%20Canterbury">Honorius</a>, as Archbishop of Canterbury after Justus' death, some time between 628 and 631.

Edwin was defeated by an alliance of Gwynedd Welsh and Mercian Angles, being killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hatfield%20Chase">Battle of Hatfield Chase</a>, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20I">Honorius I</a> wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius saying that he was sending a <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.

Edwin's defeat and death caused his kingdom to fragment into at least two parts. It also led to a sharp decline in Christianity in Northumbria when Edwin's immediate successors reverted to paganism. Widowed queen Æthelburg fled to her brother <a href="Eadbald%20of%20Kent">Eadbald</a>'s Kent kingdom. Paulinus went with her, along with Edwin and Æthelburg's son, daughter, and grandson. The two boys went to the continent for safety, to the court of King <a href="Dagobert%20I">Dagobert I</a>. Æthelburg, Eanflæd, and Paulinus remained in Kent, where Paulinus was offered the see, or bishopric, of <a href="Diocese%20of%20Rochester">Rochester</a>, which he held until his death. Because the pallium did not reach Paulinus until after he had left York, it was of no use to him. Paulinus' deputy, <a href="James%20the%20Deacon">James the Deacon</a>, remained in the north and struggled to rebuild the Roman mission,

Paulinus died on 10 October 644 at Rochester, where he was buried in the <a href="sacristy">sacristy</a> of the church. His successor at Rochester was <a href="Ithamar%20%28bishop%29">Ithamar</a>, the first Englishman consecrated to a Gregorian missionary see. After Paulinus' death, Paulinus was <a href="Canonization%23Historical%20development%20of%20the%20process">revered</a> as a saint, with a <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints">feast day</a> on 10 October. When a new church was constructed at Rochester in the 1080s his <a href="relic">relic</a>s, or remains, were <a href="Translation%20%28relics%29">translated</a> (ritually moved) to a new shrine. There also were shrines to Paulinus at Canterbury, and at least five churches were dedicated to him. Although Rochester held some of Paulinus' relics, the promotion of his cult there appears to have occurred after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a>. He is considered a saint by the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, and the <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Church</a>.

Paulinus' missionary efforts are difficult to evaluate. Bede implies that the mission in Northumbria was successful, but there is little supporting evidence, and it is more likely that Paulinus' missionary efforts there were relatively ineffectual. Although <a href="Osric%20of%20Deira">Osric</a>, one of Edwin's successors, was converted to Christianity by Paulinus, he returned to paganism after Edwin's death. Hilda, however, remained a Christian, and eventually went on to become abbess of the influential Whitby Abbey. Northumbria's conversion to Christianity was mainly achieved by <a href="Hiberno-Scottish%20mission">Irish missionaries</a> brought into the region by Edwin's eventual successor, <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a>.
