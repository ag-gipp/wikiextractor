John L. Helm

John LaRue Helm (July 4, 1802 – September 8, 1867) was the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">18th and 24th governor</a> of the U.S. <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Kentucky">Commonwealth of Kentucky</a>, although his service in that office totaled less than fourteen months. He also represented <a href="Hardin%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Hardin County</a> in both houses of the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> and was chosen to be the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives</a> four times. In 1838 his sole bid for federal office ended in defeat when his opponent, <a href="Willis%20Green">Willis Green</a>, was elected to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>.

Helm was first elected to the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> in 1826; between 1826 and 1843 he served eleven one-year terms in the state house. In 1844 he was elected to the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state senate</a>, where he served continuously until he was chosen as the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> nominee for <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a> on a ticket with <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a>, famous for the <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a>. The Whigs won the general election and Helm was elevated to governor on July 31, 1850, when Crittenden resigned to accept an appointment as <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">United States Attorney General</a> in President <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>'s cabinet. After his service as governor Helm became president of the struggling <a href="Louisville%20and%20Nashville%20Railroad">Louisville and Nashville Railroad</a>. He invested thousands of dollars of his own money in the project and convinced residents along the line's main route to buy stock in the company. In 1859 the line was completed, but the next year Helm resigned over of differences with the board of directors regarding a proposed branch that would extend the line to <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>.

Although he openly opposed <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, federal military forces labeled Helm a <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> sympathizer. In September 1862, he was arrested for this alleged sympathy, but Governor <a href="James%20Fisher%20Robinson">James F. Robinson</a> recognized him as he was being transported to a prison in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> and had him released. After the war Helm identified with the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>, and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous canvass of the state and won the general election. He was too weak to travel to <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a> for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.

In 1780 Helm's grandfather, Thomas Helm, emigrated to Kentucky from <a href="Prince%20William%20County%2C%20Virginia">Prince William County, Virginia</a> and founded the settlement of Helm Station near <a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20Kentucky">Elizabethtown, Kentucky</a> in Hardin County, where John L. Helm was born on July 4, 1802. He was the eldest of nine children born to George B. Helm, a farmer and politician, and <a href="LaRue%20family">Rebecca LaRue Helm</a>, a descendant of a prominent local pioneer family.

Helm attended the area's public schools and studied with noted educator <a href="Duff%20Green">Duff Green</a>. When Helm was 14 his father fell on hard financial times and Helm returned to work on the family farm. In 1818 he took a better-paying job in the office of Samuel Haycraft, the <a href="circuit%20court">circuit court</a> clerk of Hardin County. While there he <a href="reading%20law">read law</a> with Haycraft, then entered the law office of Ben Tobin in 1821.

At about this time Helm's father traveled to Texas to enter into business and rebuild his finances, but he died there in 1822, leaving Helm responsible for his mother and siblings. He was admitted to the <a href="bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> in 1823, the same year <a href="Meade%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Meade County, Kentucky</a> was formed. There were no lawyers in the county yet, so although Helm continued living in Hardin County he was made Meade's <a href="county%20attorney">county attorney</a>. His practice grew rapidly and he was soon able to pay off his father's debts and purchase the Helm homestead. Between 1832 and 1840 he built "<a href="Helm%20Place%20%28Elizabethtown%2C%20Kentucky%29">Helm Place</a>" on this land and it remained his home for the rest of his life.

In 1823 Helm called on <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Representative</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Hardin">Benjamin Hardin</a>. While Hardin and Helm discussed business, Hardin's 14-year-old daughter, Lucinda, entered the room to show her father a map she had drawn. Helm later claimed it was <a href="love%20at%20first%20sight">love at first sight</a>, and began to pursue Lucinda's affections. They <a href="courtship">courted</a> for seven years, married in 1830 and had six daughters and five sons together. One of his sons, <a href="Benjamin%20Hardin%20Helm">Benjamin Hardin Helm</a>, was a <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> general in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a>.

The major political issue in Kentucky during Helm's legal training was the <a href="Old%20Court-New%20Court%20controversy">Old Court-New Court controversy</a>. Reeling from the <a href="panic%20of%201819">panic of 1819</a>, Kentuckians had demanded debt relief. In response, the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> passed an act that granted debtors a grace period of two years in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept payment in the devalued notes of the Bank of the Commonwealth. The <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> struck down the law, claiming it was in violation of the <a href="Contract%20Clause">Contract Clause</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a>. The angered legislature attempted to <a href="impeachment">impeach</a> the justices on the Court of Appeals, but lacked the necessary <a href="two-thirds%20majority">two-thirds majority</a>. Instead, they abolished the Court of Appeals and replaced it with a new court, which was stocked with more sympathetic justices by pro-relief governor <a href="John%20Adair">John Adair</a>. Both courts claimed to be Kentucky's court of last resort.

Throughout 1825 Helm made speeches and distributed pamphlets in Hardin and surrounding counties, espousing the Old Court position. In 1826 he campaigned as a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> for a seat in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>. Helm won the election, and at the age of twenty-four became one of the youngest members to serve in the Kentucky General Assembly. An Old Court majority was elected to <a href="bicameral%20legislature">both houses</a> of the General Assembly in 1826, which then passed legislation abolishing the New Court.

Helm was re-elected to the state House in 1827 and 1830, and was re-elected every year from 1833 to 1837. He served as <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> in 1835 and 1836. In 1837 there was a three-way race for speaker between Helm, <a href="James%20Turner%20Morehead%20%28Kentucky%29">James Turner Morehead</a> and <a href="Robert%20P.%20Letcher">Robert P. Letcher</a>. After nine ballots Helm withdrew, and Letcher was elected speaker.

Helm made his only run for federal office in 1838 and was defeated by <a href="Willis%20Green">Willis Green</a> for a seat in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>. He returned to the Kentucky House in 1839 and was re-elected in 1842 and 1843, serving as Speaker of the House both years. In 1843, the Kentucky General Assembly proposed to create a new county from part of Hardin County and name it Helm County in honor of John L. Helm. Because of the few dissenting votes on this question, Helm declined the honor and proposed instead that the county be called <a href="LaRue%20County%2C%20Kentucky">LaRue County</a> after his mother's family, many of whom still lived in the proposed county. Helm's suggestion was unanimously adopted.

In 1844 Helm was elected to the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a>, where he served until 1848. That year he was the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> candidate for <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a> on a ticket with <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a>. Helm defeated <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="John%20Preston%20Martin">John Preston Martin</a> in the general election. The major political question in the state during Helm's time as lieutenant governor was whether to adopt a new state constitution. As a state senator in 1848, Helm had voted to allow the state's citizens to decide the matter in a referendum, but after seeing the document produced by the constitutional convention, he opposed its ratification. In an address to the state senate in 1850 he declared, "I was for reform, and not for revolution. I was for amending the Constitution, and not for obliterating every vital principle in contained." He especially opposed creating an elective judiciary. His antagonism to the constitution put him at odds with his father-in-law, Benjamin Hardin. The two did not reconcile until 1852, as Hardin lay on his deathbed. The new constitution was adopted in 1850, and in June of that year Helm encouraged the people to accept it.

Governor Crittenden resigned on July 31, 1850 to accept President <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>'s appointment as <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">attorney general</a>, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits in the public school fund by drawing money from the state's <a href="sinking%20fund">sinking fund</a>, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.

Helm was a <a href="United%20States%20Electoral%20College">presidential elector</a> for <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201852">1852 presidential election</a>. After this he took twelve years off from politics. As early as 1836, Helm had advocated the construction of the <a href="Louisville%20and%20Nashville%20Railroad">Louisville and Nashville Railroad</a>. On October 2, 1854, he became the railroad's second president. The previous president had been forced out of that position after a disagreement with Louisville's board of <a href="Alderman">aldermen</a>, and construction of the line had almost been abandoned.

Helm worked diligently to convince residents along the line's main route of the economic benefits it would bring. He persuaded many of them to help clear and grade land for the line and accept company stock as payment, and succeeded in selling stock subscriptions to people in the same area. Rising labor costs and troubles transporting materials raised expenses far above the projected budget, and at one point Helm personally redeemed $20,000 ($ as of ) of the company's bonds. Meanwhile, some observers accused Helm of mismanaging the company. The company's fortunes improved in 1857 when the city of Louisville provided $300,000 ($ as of ) in financial aid and the line was completed on October 18, 1859. Due to Helm's influence, the railroad's charter required all trains traveling through Elizabethtown to stop there.

By the time the line was finished there were public calls from inside and outside the company for Helm to resign, mostly because of his support for a proposed <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis</a> branch of the railroad. To complete the branch, the Louisville and Nashville would have to complete a line from <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green</a> to <a href="Guthrie%2C%20Kentucky">Guthrie, Kentucky</a>. There it would join a line owned by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that began across the state line at <a href="Clarksville%2C%20Tennessee">Clarksville, Tennessee</a> and extended to Memphis. Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade along the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> and <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio</a> Rivers. Opponents argued that the project was simply a ploy to whip up new support for the struggling railroad. Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.

On February 4, 1860, two members of the company's board of directors wrote a letter requesting Helm's resignation; they claimed they had voted for his re-election as president of the company with the understanding that he would resign when the main line between Louisville and Nashville was finished. Helm maintained that he felt an obligation to the citizens of <a href="Logan%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Logan County</a> – many of whom he had personally sold stock to – to remain president until the Memphis branch through their county was built. The rift between Helm and the directors continued to widen, however. Helm resigned on February 21, 1860, and was replaced by <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28American%20politician%29">James Guthrie</a>. The Memphis branch was completed on September 24, 1860.

On January 8, 1861 Helm chaired a meeting in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> that advocated for Kentucky's neutrality in the Civil War. Helm was an outspoken opponent of secession, but also denounced the election of <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and his use of military force to subdue the southern states. Because Helm did not condemn his son, Benjamin, for joining the Confederate Army, federal authorities classified him as a southern sympathizer.

After learning of the arrest of former governor <a href="Charles%20S.%20Morehead">Charles S. Morehead</a> by federal authorities, Helm fled to Bowling Green, fearing his own arrest. Through the intervention of <a href="Warner%20Underwood">Warner Underwood</a> he was able to return home on the condition that he swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Nevertheless, federal soldiers repeatedly entered his home, encouraging his slaves to abandon him, and consuming or destroying his crops. Because the state's courts were closed on account of the war, he was unable to earn a living by practicing law. In short order his once-substantial fortune was expended, and he resorted to borrowing money to support his family.

In September 1862 Helm and several other citizens from Hardin County were arrested by Colonel Knox. After several days of confinement in Elizabethtown the prisoners were conducted to Louisville. By chance, Kentucky governor <a href="James%20Fisher%20Robinson">James F. Robinson</a> recognized Helm in the group and negotiated with General <a href="Jeremiah%20Boyle">Jeremiah Boyle</a> to get him released. Shortly after returning home Helm learned of Benjamin's death at the Battle of Chickamauga.

After the war Helm identified with the Democratic Party, and he returned to the state senate in 1865. During his tenure he chaired the Committee on Federal Relations and fought against punitive and restrictive laws against ex-Confederates. On January 22, 1866 he presented to the state senate a protest against the actions of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> during the Civil War. It denounced the <a href="Reconstruction%20Amendments">Reconstruction Amendments</a> on the grounds that they granted powers to the federal government that were reserved for the states, and that they were passed while many southern states were not represented in Congress. He also decried the creation and operation of the <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a>. On January 29, 1867, Helm introduced legislation to organize a meeting in Louisville to rally support for President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> and his efforts to restore the Union.

The state Democratic Convention met on February 22, 1867 in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a> and chose Helm and <a href="John%20W.%20Stevenson">John W. Stevenson</a> as the party's candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Helm resigned his seat in the state senate to accept the nomination. Though his health was frail, he determined to canvass the entire state. He continued his call for an end to Civil War bitterness and <a href="proscription">proscription</a>s against those who had sided with the Confederacy. He won the general election over <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> Sidney Barnes and a third party candidate, Judge William B. Kinkead.

The strenuous campaign took a decisive toll on Helm's already weakened body. He was too weak to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so the oath of office was administered at his home on September 3, 1867. Helm's <a href="Kentucky%20Secretary%20of%20State">secretary of state</a> read the governor's inaugural address at the Hardin County Courthouse. In it Helm repeated his intent to remove political disabilities from ex-Confederates. He also charged that Congress was meddling in the affairs of the states. Though he promised protections for blacks, he opposed the idea of black <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a>.

Helm died on September 8, 1867, just five days after his inauguration. He was buried in a family graveyard at <a href="Helm%20Place%20%28Elizabethtown%2C%20Kentucky%29">Helm Place</a>. Helm Place was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on November 9, 1976.

Panzer Dragoon Saga

Panzer Dragoon Saga is a 1998 <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> (RPG) published by <a href="Sega">Sega</a> and developed by <a href="Sega%20Sports%20R%26amp%3BD">Team Andromeda</a> for the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>. It departs from the linear <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up%23Types">rail shooter</a> gameplay of the "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon">Panzer Dragoon</a>" series, introducing traditional RPG elements such as <a href="Random%20encounter">random encounters</a>, semi-<a href="Turns%2C%20rounds%20and%20time-keeping%20systems%20in%20games">turn-based</a> battles, and free-roaming exploration. The player controls Edge, a young mercenary who rides a powerful dragon and encounters a mysterious girl from a vanished civilization. 

Development began in early 1995 alongside "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20II%20Zwei">Panzer Dragoon II Zwei</a>" (1996). Sega felt an RPG was critical to succeed against the <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, and wanted to compete with "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>". The game underwent an arduous development process. Much of the challenge came from incorporating the series' shooting elements into an RPG with full <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D computer graphics</a> and voice acting; both were unusual features in RPGs at the time, and pushed the Saturn to its technical limits. Two staff members died during development, which director <a href="Yukio%20Futatsugi">Yukio Futatsugi</a> attributed to the stressful working conditions of the video game industry.

"Panzer Dragoon Saga" is the most critically acclaimed Saturn game, and is often listed as one of the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">greatest games of all time</a>; it earned particular praise for its story, graphics and combat. However, the game suffered from a limited release in the west as Sega had shifted focus to its <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> console, and worldwide sales were poor. It has not been rereleased and English copies sell for high prices. After its release, Sega disbanded Team Andromeda; several staff members joined Sega's <a href="Smilebit">Smilebit</a> studio and developed the final game in the series, "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20Orta">Panzer Dragoon Orta</a>" (2002), for <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a>.

Unlike the other "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon">Panzer Dragoon</a>" games, which are <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up">rail shooters</a>, "Panzer Dragoon Saga" is a <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> (RPG). The player controls Edge, a young mercenary who rides a flying dragon. Gameplay is divided into three modes: traversing large areas on the dragon, battling enemies, and exploring on foot. On foot, Edge can talk to <a href="Non-player%20character">non-player characters</a> (NPCs), upgrade his weapons, buy items such as potions, and use a targeting <a href="reticle">reticle</a> to interact with locks, doors, and other elements; on the dragon, this reticle is used to fire lasers to activate triggers or break objects. In one sequence, Edge rides a <a href="hoverbike">hoverbike</a> instead of the dragon. The player travels through environments including canyons, deserts, forests, and subterranean ruins; these are accessed from the map screen, and new areas are added as the game progresses. Campsites serve as rest areas and <a href="Saved%20game">save points</a>. The game features full voice acting and numerous <a href="Full%20motion%20video">FMV</a> <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s.

"Saga" simplifies many RPG conventions. For example, it has few travel sequences and <a href="Quest%20%28video%20gaming%29">side quests</a>, requires little "maintenance work" such as managing inventories or <a href="Skill%20tree">skill trees</a>, and features only Edge and his dragon rather than a party of playable characters. It can also be completed in less than 20 hours, making it much shorter than most RPGs at the time.

"Panzer Dragoon Saga" uses a <a href="Random%20encounter">random encounter</a> system, in which battles are triggered at random intervals as the player rides the dragon. Battles mix <a href="Turns%2C%20rounds%20and%20time-keeping%20systems%20in%20games">real-time and turn-based</a> elements. Three action gauges charge in real time; when a gauge fills, the player can perform an action, such as attacking or using items. Waiting for multiple gauges to charge gives the enemy more opportunity to attack, but grants the player more options, such as making multiple moves in quick succession. The speed at which the gauges charge is governed by the dragon's agility <a href="Attribute%20%28role-playing%20games%29">attribute</a>; if higher than the enemy's agility, the player can act more frequently than the enemy, and vice versa.

The player can circle the enemy by moving between quadrants to expose weak points and escape dangerous positions. A radar at the bottom of the screen indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with the front and rear quadrants typically posing the most danger. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges. Enemies may also change position to force the dragon into vulnerable areas. Weak points can sometimes be attacked only from dangerous areas, and enemy attack patterns may change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.

The two primary attacks are the dragon's laser, which strikes multiple targets simultaneously, and Edge's gun, which focuses damage on a single target and is useful for striking weak points. Edge's gun can be upgraded with <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s including three-way fire and the "Sniper" modification, which deals additional damage to weak points. The dragon's "berserks", the equivalent of <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">magic spells</a> in other RPGs, can heal, boost the dragon's attributes, or inflict powerful attacks. Berserks require berserk points and sometimes multiple action gauges. Certain enemy attacks change the dragon's status: "stun" prevents it from using its lasers or berserks; "stop" prevents it from changing position; "poison" slowly drains its health points; "pain" slowly drains its defense attribute; "slow" increases the gauge charge time; and "bind" prevents all but the first gauge from charging.

Players can morph the dragon to change its attack, defense, agility and spiritual attributes. Boosting one attribute diminishes another; for example, boosting the attack attribute reduces the spiritual attribute, which increases the cost of berserks, and boosting agility fills gauges faster but lowers defense. Certain berserks are only available in certain dragon configurations, and the dragon learns some types of berserks more quickly in different forms. After battle, the player earns a ranking based on their performance; better rankings reward the player with more <a href="experience%20point">experience points</a> and items.

Edge, a mercenary hired by the Empire, guards an excavation site filled with artifacts from the Ancient Age, a vanished advanced civilization. Fending off an ancient monster, he discovers a girl buried in a wall. The site is attacked by the <a href="Mutiny">mutinous</a> Black Fleet, who seize the girl, kill Edge's companions, and shoot Edge. Edge survives, escapes with the help of a mysterious flying dragon, and swears revenge on the Black Fleet leader, Craymen. 

Edge rescues Gash, a member of the Seekers, a scavenger group. Gash directs him to a nearby <a href="Caravan%20%28travellers%29">nomadic caravan</a>, where he learns the location of the Black Fleet. Edge and his dragon defeat the fleet, but learn that Craymen has already reached the Tower, an ancient structure of tremendous power. He fends off an attack by the girl from the excavation site, who has sworn allegiance to Craymen and rides an enormous dragon called Atolm.

In the town of Zoah, Edge meets Paet, an engineer who offers information about the Tower in exchange for artifacts. Searching an ancient vessel for parts, Edge is captured and tortured by imperial soldiers but rescued by Gash. Paet reveals that the Tower can be reached via the ruins of Uru; there, Edge and the dragon are attacked again by the girl and Atolm. After the battle, Edge and the girl are separated from their dragons and fall into an ancient underground facility. They form a truce to escape. The girl explains that she is an ancient <a href="Biological%20engineering">bio-engineered</a> lifeform named Azel, created in the facility and designed to interface with ancient technology. After Edge's dragon rescues them, Azel warns Edge that she will kill him if he crosses Craymen's path again; she leaves on Atolm. 

Craymen surprises Edge in Zoah and requests his help fighting the Empire. Paet tells Edge he can find the Tower by deactivating Mel-Kava, an ancient machine that obscures the Tower's location with fog. For destroying an imperial base, the Zoah leader gives Edge access to an ancient artifact that grants a vision of Mel-Kava's location. Edge and the dragon destroy Mel-Kava, clearing the fog, but are attacked again by Azel and Atolm. They shoot down Atolm and rescue Azel as she falls.

The Emperor's flagship, Grig Orig, destroys Zoah, but the Black Fleet intervenes before Edge and the dragon are killed. At the Tower, Craymen tells Edge that the Tower is one of several that manufacture monsters to combat humanity's destructive forces. He needs Azel to activate the Tower and destroy the Empire before they can use it for themselves. Imperials arrive and capture Edge and Craymen. After the Emperor forces Azel to activate the Tower, monsters emerge and kill Craymen, the Emperor, and their men. Edge and Azel escape on Edge's dragon. At the Seeker stronghold, Gash explains that the Tower will destroy humanity if it is not deactivated. He believes Edge's dragon is the prophesied Divine Visitor who will be humanity's salvation. Edge and the dragon battle rampaging monsters and destroy the infested Grig Orig.

Edge rescues Azel from monsters in the Uru facility, where she has returned to contemplate her purpose. They infiltrate the Tower and Azel prepares to transfer Edge and the dragon into Sestren, the <a href="Artificial%20intelligence">AI</a> network that controls the towers. She confesses her love for Edge and he promises to return. Inside Sestren, Edge and the dragon defeat the network's "anti-dragon" programs. The dragon reveals that it is not the Divine Visitor but the Heresy Program, a rogue Sestren AI. The real Divine Visitor is "the one from the outside world" who has guided Edge, the player, and must now destroy Sestren to free humanity from the Ancient Age. After the player presses a button, Edge and the dragon vanish. Gash awaits Edge in a desert. Azel, searching for Edge, asks directions across treacherous land.

In March 1995, following completion of the original "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20%28video%20game%29">Panzer Dragoon</a>", producer Yoji Ishiji suggested making an RPG to explore the "Panzer Dragoon" world, as this had been praised in reviews"." Sega's president instructed the team to create an RPG to outsell "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" and help the Saturn beat the PlayStation in the console war. <a href="Sega">Sega's</a> <a href="Team%20Andromeda">Team Andromeda</a> studio split into two teams: one worked on "Saga" while the other developed a shooter sequel, "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20II%20Zwei">Panzer Dragoon II Zwei</a>". "Saga" had a staff of about 40, twice that for "Zwei". Both teams used the "Zwei" <a href="Game%20engine">engine</a> and the 3D modeling software <a href="Autodesk%20Softimage">Softimage</a>. 

Director <a href="Yukio%20Futatsugi">Yukio Futatsugi</a> said that "Saga" was the most difficult "Panzer Dragoon" game to develop, as many of its features, such as fully 3D environments, were unusual for RPGs at the time. "No matter what aspect of the game we worked on, we had the challenge of making it entirely from whole cloth," he said. The engine had to support free exploration, battle sequences, and real-time morphing and <a href="shading">shading</a>, pushing the Saturn to its limits. Futatsugi felt the game would have been impossible to develop on the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> console, as the Saturn's "cloudier" palette gives the "Panzer Dragoon" series its atmosphere. The team did not use any of Sega's existing <a href="Graphics%20library">graphic libraries</a> and programmed everything from scratch.

Akihiko Mukaiyama, who had worked on RPGs including "<a href="Sakura%20Wars">Sakura Wars</a>," was brought in to design the battle system, replacing "Zwei" producer Tomohiro Kondo. Mukaiyama expected his job to be simple, but found problems with Kondo's prototype: there was no strategic element, as the player had no reason to change positions. Some staff felt they should create a traditional RPG battle system in which players select commands from a menu, while others wanted to focus on shooting, similar to earlier "Panzer Dragoon" games. Mukaiyama's compromise was to allow players to select menu commands or trigger them immediately with button presses.

The system was recreated numerous times as the team struggled to combine the essential elements of shooters and RPGs. The positioning system developed from an initial concept of fighting enemies for space; this system was initially free-roaming, but was too slow. Mukaiyama simplified it by having the player move between quadrants around the enemy, which better simulated flying and allowed the artists to create dramatic camera movements. The gauge system added further strategy, giving more options to the player.

The dragon's morphing ability was added to compensate for the lack of a large cast of playable characters with different skills common in other JRPGs. The team estimated that having the dragon morph in real time would be too difficult to implement, but a programmer surprised them with a working prototype. The dragon's unconventional design came partly from the need to morph smoothly between different models.

Reworking the series' shooting gameplay into an RPG took about a year. Once the team had settled on the core action of locking on to targets, such as enemies and NPCs, the rest of the design followed. After the battle system was finalized, development proceeded smoothly and some staff were moved to help complete "Zwei".

Rather than create a "save-the-world" story with a large cast, Futatsugi wanted to concentrate on a small number of characters who the player would be "really close to", which he felt would make the story meaningful. An early version had Edge as an imperial soldier who defects, but this made the story overlong; Craymen also had an extensive backstory explaining his motivations for betraying the Empire, but this was cut as it would have filled most of the first disc. Art director Manabu Kusunoki hoped to "leave space for players' imaginations" by not revealing everything about the world. Although Edge is not a <a href="silent%20protagonist">silent protagonist</a>, Futatsugi minimized his dialogue outside cutscenes to focus on Azel's story, who he felt was the most important character. 

"Saga" features full voice acting; by contrast, the "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" series did not feature voice acting until "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>," released three years later. Sega estimated that the script amounted to more than 1,500 pages of Japanese text. Like the other "Panzer Dragoon" games, "Saga" features a <a href="fictional%20language">fictional language</a>, "Panzerese", which combines elements of <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>, <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>; "Saga" only features Panzerese in the introduction and end sequences, with the rest of the dialogue in Japanese. The <a href="Video%20game%20localization">localizers</a> were given incomplete translations, and so inserted their own interpretations of the story, embellishing details and creating new names for monsters. The biggest change was in the depiction of the relationship between Edge and Azel. According to Futatsugi, the romance is obvious in the Japanese version from a Japanese perspective, but would have been lost on a western audience, as emotions are expressed more directly in English. The Japanese voice acting was subtitled rather than dubbed in English.

The team wanted to keep some elements of the story open to interpretation. In Kusunoki's interpretation, Edge dies at the beginning of the story when he is shot, and is brought back to life temporarily by the player; when the game ends, Edge dies.

Kusunoki, the main character and art designer for the previous "Panzer Dragoon" games, brought in several new artists for "Saga": <a href="Katsumi%20Yokota">Katsumi Yokota</a> created the character and cover art, and Satoshi Sakai and Ryuta Ueda designed the dragons. Yokota described the team as "<a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> and anti-establishment". They resisted creating "spiky-haired" characters similar to those of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>" or "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%281996%20video%20game%29">Resident Evil</a>", which were popular at the time, and competed to create unique designs. The team credited the animes "<a href="Nausica%C3%A4%20of%20the%20Valley%20of%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Nausicaä</a>" and "<a href="Neon%20Genesis%20Evangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>," the "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" films, and the comic artist <a href="Jean%20Giraud">Jean Giraud</a> as influences. 

Azel underwent the most revisions; the team did not want her to be a typical energetic <a href="anime">anime</a>-style heroine, and instead tried to make her simultaneously appealing and frightening, emphasizing her human and non-human traits. Yokota said: "She couldn’t just be cute; there had to be something edgy about her. I struggled with questions like, what does it mean to be cute? What does it mean to be human?" He spent months refining Kusunoki's design, creating dozens of concepts. One early design had a hole in her torso. Azel's oversized jacket, belonging to her master Craymen, was inspired by British <a href="Mod%20%28subculture%29">mod fashion</a>, which Yokota had seen in the 1979 film <a href="Quadrophenia%20%28film%29">"Quadrophenia"</a>. The team felt the image conveyed her identity and allegiance to Craymen and symbolized his protection. 

The "Panzer Dragoon Saga" soundtrack was composed by <a href="Saori%20Kobayashi">Saori Kobayashi</a> and <a href="Mariko%20Nanba">Mariko Nanba</a> and arranged by <a href="Hayato%20Matsuo">Hayato Matsuo</a>. It includes South American, <a href="Music%20of%20Africa">African</a>, <a href="Celtic%20music">Celtic</a>, classical and <a href="New-age%20music">new age</a> influences. "The Verge" described it as blend of traditional European and <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20music">Middle Eastern folk</a> styles with "sci-fi"-like synthesizer sounds. Kobayashi said that Futatsugi's only direction was to keep the ethnic sounds and compose something similar to "Zwei." Rather than using prerecorded music, the soundtrack is mostly generated via <a href="pulse-code%20modulation">pulse-code modulation</a> by the Saturn's sound hardware, as with "Zwei". Although the hardware imposed limitations on the compositions, such as reducing the number of possible <a href="Loop%20%28music%29">loops</a>, Kobayashi felt this helped convey the game's desolate world. The orchestrated ending theme, "Sona Mi Areru Ec Sancitu", features lyrics in Panzerese. 

A soundtrack album was released by <a href="Marvelous%20Entertainment">Marvelous Entertainment</a> in February 1998. In January 2018, an anniversary edition, "Resurrection: Panzer Dragoon Saga", was released by Brave Wave Productions on CD, vinyl and download formats. It features rearranged and rerecorded versions of the original soundtrack; as the game's <a href="Music%20sequencer">sequencer</a> data no longer exists, Kobayashi recreated the music from scratch.
In comparison to the small, cohesive teams that had created "Panzer Dragoon" and "Zwei", the "Saga" team was large, and many staff did not know each other. Kusunoki recalled "endless disputes", particularly between staff who had worked on the earlier "Panzer Dragoon" games and those new to the franchise and wanted to explore new ideas. The project was delayed several times, creating the impression that it was struggling, and went through several directors before Kusunoki assumed the role.

Mukaiyama found that whereas game development is usually driven by designers, the "Saga" programmers and artists had their own opinions. The programmers wanted to build on the technically sophisticated shooting of "Zwei," whereas the artists wanted to explore the visual possibilities of 3D to showcase their characters. He said: "Their visions for the game would collide ... it was a constant battle ... I didn’t think there could possibly be a solution to satisfy both parties. It took about a year, and a lot of mistakes, to find a solution."

The development strained the staff. "<a href="The%20Ringer%20%28website%29">The Ringer</a>" characterized "Saga" as "a game about a world in ruins, produced by a disintegrating development team haunted by heartbreak at a company in decline". Sega lacked experience managing large teams; it was the largest team Futatsugi had managed, and he recalled pressure to "domineer" over the staff. Sega's expectations for "Saga" were high and the team faced intense pressure. At the height of production, team members slept in the office or caught early-morning trains home to nap, and relieved stress by playing fighting games on a <a href="Neo%20Geo%20%28system%29">Neo Geo</a> arcade cabinet. 

Two staff members died: one from suicide and the other in a motorcycle accident, which Futatsugi attributed to stress. "All we could do was carry on and finish the game – it was out of my hands," he said. "Part of me did want to stop though. That was definitely the toughest project I've ever worked on." Mukaiyama became depressed, and said it was "the hardest thing I ever experienced in my entire life". Nonetheless, Futatsugi felt the project had benefited from having "someone who plays the bad guy role, someone who acts a little selfish, acts a little forceful to the team to achieve specific goals ... Having team members that will support that kind of bad cop is necessary, and if they don't exist then you can't get those kind of results."

After "Saga's" completion, Sega disbanded Team Andromeda and reassigned some staff to <a href="Smilebit">Smilebit</a>, which developed the final game in the series, "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20Orta">Panzer Dragoon Orta</a>" (2002), for <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a>. Ueda, Sakai and Yokota went on to work on the Sega games "<a href="Jet%20Set%20Radio">Jet Set Radio</a>", "<a href="Phantasy%20Star%20Online">Phantasy Star Online</a>" and <a href="Rez%20%28video%20game%29">"Rez",</a> respectively. Futatsugi left Sega and joined <a href="Konami">Konami</a>.
"Panzer Dragoon Saga" was released in Japan in January 1998 as "Azel: Panzer Dragoon RPG". North American and European releases followed in April, making "Saga" one of the last Saturn games published by Sega and released outside Japan. The game spans four CDs. In the UK, the first disc was released as a <a href="Game%20demo">demo</a> with "<a href="Sega%20Saturn%20Magazine">Sega Saturn Magazine</a>." 

Sega planned "Saga" to compete with the PlayStation RPG "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>", believing that having the best RPG would win the console war, and aimed to sell 1.5 million copies. It was planned for release in the same year as "Final Fantasy", but was delayed to 1998 to avoid competing with "<a href="Grandia%20%28video%20game%29">Grandia</a>", another Saturn RPG. "Final Fantasy VII" sold almost 10 million copies, but sales of "Saga" worldwide were poor.

In the west, where the Saturn had been a commercial failure, Sega had shifted focus to its next console, the <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>, and retailers were reluctant to stock Saturn games. Localizer Chris Lucich said it was a "strange transitional period" for Sega of America, which had shrunk from over 2,000 employees to 200. Sega initially produced only 20,000 North American copies of "Saga." After these sold out in two days, a few thousand more were produced. In Europe, only around 1,000 copies were made. 

As the game received almost no marketing in the west beyond limited print advertisements, Lucich and Underwood sent screenshots to <a href="Blog">bloggers</a>, hoping to generate <a href="Word%20of%20mouth">word-of-mouth</a> interest. Sega allotted only ten copies to give to the press, and focused on hardcore game media, as, according to PR representative Heather Hawkins, "nobody else would really care". As no mainstream media had Saturns, Sega had to provide consoles themselves, then retrieve them to give to other media. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Levi Buchanan characterized the release as an example of the Saturn's "ignominious send-off" in the west, writing: "Sunset Saturn games like "Panzer Dragoon Saga" and "<a href="Burning%20Rangers">Burning Rangers</a>" demanded far better launches. The way these games were slipped into retail with zero fanfare and low circulation was insulting to both hard-working developers and Sega fans."

At the request of Sega producer <a href="Yu%20Suzuki">Yu Suzuki</a>, who was developing an RPG with some similarities, "<a href="Shenmue%20%28video%20game%29">Shenmue</a>", Sega held a meeting with the developers to discuss why "Panzer Dragoon Saga" had failed. Mukaiyama said Sega was "confused" by the failure. Yokota and battle programmer Shin Futakawame felt it would have sold poorly in any situation, as, in Yokota's words, the developers were "not the type of people who liked mass-market, mainstream products. They were niche, alternative, rock 'n' roll and avant-garde ... The game always had to be unique." Localizer Matt Underwood speculated that "Saga's" <a href="Apocalyptic%20and%20post-apocalyptic%20fiction">post-apocalyptic</a> setting, "basically the polar opposite of ["Final Fantasy"] in tone", had been off-putting to players. 

According to the review aggregator <a href="Gamerankings.com">GameRankings</a>, "Panzer Dragoon Saga" is the most critically acclaimed Saturn game, with an aggregate score of 92%. In 2007, "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" wrote that "critically, the game was a smash hit, lauded as one of the year's best, and generally considered the Saturn's finest title". 

The battle system received particular praise. "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" wrote that whereas other RPGs had players selecting menu options, Saga's positioning system forced them to strategize, producing "much more exciting" battles. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s James Mielke described the system as a "revelation" with more strategy and challenge than traditional turn-based systems, and menus that "become more and more intuitive with every counter". "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" praised the range and design of enemies as "consistently superb", and "<a href="Sega%20Saturn%20Magazine">Sega Saturn Magazine</a>" praised the depth and quantity of <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss encounters</a>.

The graphics were also acclaimed. Though Mielke noted occasional slowdown and "rough" textures, he felt the use of techniques such as <a href="gouraud%20shading">gouraud shading</a>, <a href="Transparency%20%28graphic%29">transparency</a> and light sourcing created a "graphic level of excellence on a par with anything available on a home console". He also praised the "fluid easy grace" of the art direction, and the environment design, whose "every exotic location retains a place in your memory". "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" critic Steve Key and "Sega Saturn Magazine" wrote that Team Andromeda had created visual effects that matched other home consoles. "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" described "some of the most beautiful locations ever seen in an RPG ... it's almost unbelievable that they could come from Saturn." "Edge" praised the extensive FMV cutscenes, whose "cinematic quality ... shames the work of almost every other developer" and creates an "RPG of true creative integrity". 

Mielke likened the sound and music to the quality of Hollywood productions. Though it identified the subtitles as a cost-saving measure, "Edge" felt it was "infinitely preferable to the alternative of B-list actors reciting words they have little feeling for ... this dual-language approach keeps "Panzer Dragoon Saga's" strong story lucid and, with only a few exceptions, articulate."

Several critics considered "Saga" a worthy rival to "Final Fantasy VII" and lamented that it would reach a smaller audience. Key felt that if the game were released on PlayStation it would "fly off the shelves". "Edge" wrote: "It's a tragedy that the Saturn's standing will ensure Team Andromeda's adventure, with a radically different approach to "FFVII", will enjoy a fraction of its rival's success." Mielke concluded: ""Saga", in its own way, is so much more than Square's ultimate RPG. It is a worthy successor to a series that with each installment has grown in stature and scope. It is flawlessly executed, limited only by the hardware (and barely that at all) and medium."

Criticism focused on the game's short length. "Sega Saturn Magazine" felt it was too easy, especially the puzzles, though achieving "Excellent" ranks in combat was the "real test". "Computer and Video Games" noted that like the other "Panzer Dragoon" games "Saga" rewarded players for full completion, with "astounding" bonuses.

Many publications praised "Panzer Dragoon Saga" as one of the best RPGs of the year and one of the best on Saturn. Mielke concluded that the game was "possibly the finest RPG of 1998", and "Game Informer" called it "easily" the best Saturn RPG. "Electronic Gaming Monthly" reviewers unanimously commended the game as one of the best RPGs of all time and awarded it the "Editor's Choice Gold Award". "Sega Saturn Magazine" described it as "a monumental effort, a work of art, and quite clearly a labour of love", and the best Saturn adventure.

Retrospective reviews have been largely positive. In 2007, "Game Informer" called "Saga" one of the greatest games ever made, and praised the use of dramatic camera angles and animations to make the battles "very cinematic even by modern standards". In a 2007 article for <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>, James Mielke rated the game 9/10, describing it as "the greatest RPG you've never played" and one of the "most unique" RPGs of all time. According to Mielke, "for a 3D shooter to suddenly make the unexpected jump from shooter to RPG so gracefully was a major accomplishment." <a href="Retro%20Gamer">"Retro Gamer's"</a> Phil Harrison echoed this sentiment, praising the fusion of action and RPG elements. In "<a href="1001%20Video%20Games%20You%20Must%20Play%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a>" (2013), Jason Brookes wrote that only the cutscenes had aged poorly and that "many aspects of the game impress above and beyond even many of the RPGs produced nowadays". Mielke, Harrison and Brookes all praised the story's restraint and lack of cliché. In 2018, "<a href="The%20Ringer%20%28website%29">The Ringer</a>" praised the complexity of its characters, none of whom are "truly heroic". John Szczepaniak, author of "The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers", wrote that "I genuinely cannot think of a game whose story impresses me more" and argued that the primitive graphics assisted the sense of an ancient, alien world.

A 2008 <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> article was more critical; writer Kurt Kalata felt that while the visual design was "still lovely", the graphics showed the Saturn's 3D limitations, with low-resolution textures, "boxy" character models, frequent slowdown, and compressed video. He wrote that the FMV cutscenes, while well directed, were inferior to those of Square RPGs and illustrated the Saturn's shortcomings compared to PlayStation. He also echoed contemporary criticisms that the game was too short and lacked difficulty. Nonetheless, Kalata concluded that "Saga" was "still thoroughly entrancing" and that its battle system made it "completely worth it".

"Panzer Dragoon Saga" was named one of the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">best games of all time</a> by "Computer and Video Games" in 2000, "Electronic Gaming Monthly" in 2001 and 2006, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> readers in 2005, IGN in 2007 and <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a> in 2012. In 2005, 1UP.com placed it #1 in its list of <a href="Cult%20following">cult classic</a> games. "Game Informer" ranked it #1 in its 2006 list of the "top 10 rare RPGs you need". In 2008, IGN named it the greatest Saturn game, and wrote: ""Panzer Dragoon Saga" was the swan song to end all swan songs ... this dark, solemn game [is] wholly unique. It is the gem of the generation." The following year, in its list of the "Greatest Gameplay of All Time", IGN named "Saga" the "Best Game No One Played". In 2017, Jeff Grubb of <a href="VentureBeat">VentureBeat</a> said "Saga" was "arguably" the best Sega game and expressed hope for a rerelease.

Because of its limited release, English copies of "Panzer Dragoon Saga" are rare. Used copies sell for hundreds of US dollars, and factory-sealed copies sell for over $1,000. According to "The Ringer," "Its scarcity has conferred a cult-classic status that's become part of its appeal ... to play it is to enter an exclusive, clued-in club." Japanese copies are far cheaper, but have no English translation and cannot be played on western Saturn consoles. 

The game has not been rereleased. In 2009, a spokesperson for the game-downloading service <a href="GameTap">GameTap</a> stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn <a href="Emulator">emulation</a> is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it a priority. According to Futatsugi, the game's <a href="source%20code">source code</a> has become lost for unspecified reasons, making <a href="porting">porting</a> the game difficult.

Xerochrysum bracteatum

Xerochrysum bracteatum, commonly known as the golden everlasting or strawflower, is a <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a> in the family <a href="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a> native to Australia. Described by <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Pierre%20Ventenat">Étienne Pierre Ventenat</a> in 1803, it was known as "Helichrysum bracteatum" for many years before being transferred to a new genus "<a href="Xerochrysum">Xerochrysum</a>" in 1990. It grows as a woody or herbaceous <a href="Perennial%20plant">perennial</a> or <a href="Annual%20plant">annual</a> shrub up to a metre (3 ft) tall with green or grey leafy <a href="foliage">foliage</a>. Golden yellow or white flower heads are produced from spring to autumn; their distinctive feature is the papery <a href="bract">bract</a>s that resemble petals. The species is widespread, growing in a variety of <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s across the country, from rainforest margins to deserts and <a href="Subalpine%20zone">subalpine</a> areas. The golden everlasting serves as food for various larvae of <a href="lepidoptera">lepidoptera</a>ns (butterflies and moths), and adult butterflies, <a href="hoverfly">hoverflies</a>, native bees, small beetles, and grasshoppers visit the flower heads.

The golden everlasting has proven very adaptable to <a href="plant%20cultivation">cultivation</a>. It was propagated and developed in Germany in the 1850s, and annual <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s in a host of colour forms from white to bronze to purple flowers became available. Many of these are still sold in mixed seed packs. In Australia, many cultivars are perennial <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s, which have become popular garden plants. Sturdier, long-stemmed forms are used commercially in the <a href="cut%20flower%20industry">cut flower industry</a>.

French botanist <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Pierre%20Ventenat">Étienne Pierre Ventenat</a> described the golden everlasting as "<a href="Xeranthemum">Xeranthemum</a> bracteatum" in his 1803 work "Jardin de Malmaison", a book commissioned by Napoleon's first wife <a href="Jos%C3%A9phine%20de%20Beauharnais">Joséphine de Beauharnais</a> to catalogue rare plants that she had collected and grown at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Malmaison">Château de Malmaison</a>. The <a href="Latin">Latin</a> species name "bracteatum" refers to the papery <a href="bract">bract</a>s (often mistakenly called petals) of the flower heads. <a href="Henry%20Charles%20Andrews">Henry Charles Andrews</a> transferred it to the genus "Helichrysum" based on the <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of its receptacle in 1805, and it was known as "Helichrysum bracteatum" for many years. <a href="Henckel%20von%20Donnersmarck">Leo Henckel von Donnersmarck</a> described it as "Helichrysum lucidum" in 1806, and <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a> as "Helichrysum chrysanthum" in 1807. It was given the name "Bracteantha bracteata" in 1991, when Arne Anderberg and Laurie Haegi placed the members that are known as strawflowers of the large genus "<a href="Helichrysum">Helichrysum</a>" into a new genus "Bracteantha", and designated "B. bracteata" as the <a href="type%20species">type species</a>. However, they were unaware that Russian botanist Nikolai Tzvelev had already placed "X. bracteatum" in the new, and at the time <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a>, genus "<a href="Xerochrysum">Xerochrysum</a>" the previous year. This name was derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words "xeros" "dry", and "chrysum" "golden", likely relating to the nature of the distinctive bracts. Confusion existed for a decade, with "Bracteantha" appearing in literature and the horticultural trade until it was clarified in 2002 that the latter name took precedence. Strawflower is the popular name for "X. bracteatum" in Europe, while in Australia it is known as an everlasting or paper daisy. An alternate name in 19th-century Europe was "immortelle". "X. bracteatum" itself is very variable and may represent several <a href="cryptic%20species">cryptic species</a>. Alternately, the Tasmanian species "<a href="Xerochrysum%20bicolor">Xerochrysum bicolor</a>" may be combined with it in future <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> revisions.

"X. bracteatum" and its relatives belong to the <a href="Gnaphalieae">Gnaphalieae</a> or paper daisies, a large <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> within the daisy family, <a href="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a>. However, a 2002 <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> study of the Gnaphalieae has indicated the genus "Xerochrysum" is probably <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>, as the two species sampled, "X. bracteatum" and "<a href="Xerochrysum%20viscosum">X. viscosum</a>", were not closely related to each other. "X. bracteatum" has been recorded <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridising</a> with "X. viscosum" and "<a href="Xerochrysum%20papillosum">X. papillosum</a>" in cultivation, and possibly also "<a href="Coronidium%20elatum">Coronidium elatum</a>" and "<a href="Coronidium%20boormanii">C. boormanii</a>".

The plant is an erect perennial, or occasionally annual, herb that is simple or rarely branched at its base. It generally reaches in height, but can have a <a href="Prostrate%20shrub">prostrate</a> habit in exposed areas such as coastal cliffs. The green stems are rough and covered with fine hairs, and are robust compared with those of other members of the genus. The leaves are <a href="wikt%3Alanceolate">lanceolate</a>, <a href="wikt%3Aelliptical">elliptic</a>, or <a href="wikt%3Aoblanceolate">oblanceolate</a> in <a href="leaf%20shape">shape</a> and measure long and from wide. They are also covered with cobwebby hairs. Sitting atop tall stems above the foliage, the flower heads range from in diameter. Occasionally, multiple heads arise from the one stem. Like the flowers of all Asteraceae, they are composed of a central disc which contains a number of tiny individual flowers, known as <a href="floret">floret</a>s; these sit directly on an enlarged part of the stem known as the <a href="Receptacle%20%28botany%29">receptacle</a>.

Around the disc is an <a href="Involucral%20bract">involucre</a> of modified leaves, the bracts, which in "Xerochrysum", as in most Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create the impression of a shiny and yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin <a href="Cell%20wall%23Layers">primary</a> and a thick <a href="secondary%20cell%20wall">secondary cell wall</a>, a feature only found in <a href="Ground%20tissue%23Sclerenchyma">sclerenchyma</a>, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.

The individual florets are yellow. Those on the outer regions of the disc are female, while those in the centre are bisexual. Female flowers lack <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s and have only a very short, tube-shaped corolla surrounding a <a href="pistil">pistil</a> that splits to form two stigmas, while <a href="Plant%20sexuality%23Individual%20reproductive%20unit%20%28a%20flower%20in%20angiosperms%29">bisexual or hermaphrodite</a> flowers have a longer corolla, and (as in virtually all members of the family) five stamens fused at the anthers, with the pistil emerging from the center. The yellow corolla and pistil are located above an ovary with a single <a href="ovule">ovule</a>, and surrounded by the <a href="pappus%20%28flower%20structure%29">pappus</a>, the highly modified <a href="calyx%20%28botany%29">calyx</a> of Asteraceae. It comprises a number of bristles radiating around the florets. Yellow in colour, they persist and are thought to aid in the <a href="wind%20dispersal">wind dispersal</a> of the long <a href="Asteraceae%23Fruits%20and%20seeds">fruit</a>. The smooth brown fruit, known as a cypsela, is 2 to 3 mm long with the pappus radiating from one end.

In the wild, "X. bracteatum" can be distinguished from "X. bicolor" in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on the stems, and from "<a href="Xerochrysum%20macranthum">X. macranthum</a>" in Western Australia by the flower head colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of "X. bracteatum" are golden yellow. "<a href="Xerochrysum%20subundulatum">Xerochrysum subundulatum</a>" from <a href="Alpine%20climate">alpine</a> and <a href="Subalpine%20zone">subalpine</a> areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania is <a href="rhizome">rhizomatous</a>, and has markedly pointed orange bracts. The eastern Australian species "X. viscosum" may be distinguished by its rough and sticky leaves.

"Xerochrysum bracteatum" occurs in all Australian mainland states and territories, as well as <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. Widespread, it is found from <a href="North%20Queensland">North Queensland</a> across to <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, and in all habitats excluding densely shaded areas. It grows as an annual in patches of red sand in <a href="Central%20Australia">Central Australia</a>, responding rapidly to bouts of rainfall to complete its lifecycle. It is common among <a href="granite">granite</a> outcrops in southwest Western Australia, and is found on heavier and more fertile soils in the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> region, such as <a href="basalt">basalt</a>-, <a href="shale">shale</a>-, or <a href="limestone">limestone-based</a> soils, generally in areas with a high <a href="water%20table">water table</a>. Associated species in the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a> include blackbutt ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20pilularis">Eucalyptus pilularis</a>") in open forest, and the shrubs "<a href="Empodisma%20minus">Empodisma minus</a>" and "<a href="Baloskion%20australe">Baloskion australe</a>" in swampy areas. It has been reported growing in disturbed soil, along roadsides and in fields in the <a href="New%20England">New England</a> region in the United States.
The brightly coloured bracts act as petals to attract insects such as <a href="hoverfly">hoverflies</a>, native bees, and small beetles that pollinate the florets. Grasshoppers also visit the flower heads. The caterpillars of "<a href="Tebenna%20micalis">Tebenna micalis</a>" have been recorded on this species, as have those of the Australian painted lady ("<a href="Vanessa%20kershawi">Vanessa kershawi</a>"). The tiny fruits are dispersed by wind, and germinate and grow after fire or on disturbed ground.

Flower production is related to increasing day length, and in general, plants produced the most flowers from December to March. Varying planting times or artificially changing light levels might be ways to increase production of flowers outside these months.

The water mould (<a href="oomycete">oomycete</a>) "<a href="Bremia%20lactucae">Bremia lactucae</a>" has infected commercial crops in Italy and California. In 2002 on the <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a>n coast, widespread infection of several cultivars, most severely 'Florabella Pink' and to a lesser extent 'Florabella Gold' and 'Florabella White', resulted in leaf blistering and the development of <a href="chlorotic">chlorotic</a> lesions on the leaves, and white patches on the undersides, particularly in areas of poor ventilation. There was an outbreak of <a href="downy%20mildew">downy mildew</a> in a cultivated crop of "Xerochrysum bracteatum" in <a href="San%20Mateo%20County%2C%20California">San Mateo County, California</a> in 2006, in which the leaves developed large chlorotic lesions. A "<a href="Phytoplasma">Phytoplasma</a>" infection damaged "X. bracteatum" crops in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2001, causing poor growth, bronzing of foliage, and malformation of flower heads. Genetically, the <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> was indistinguishable from the agent of <a href="aster%20yellows">aster yellows</a>. The root-knot <a href="nematode">nematode</a> ("<a href="Meloidogyne%20incognita">Meloidogyne incognita</a>") attacks and forms <a href="gall">gall</a>s on the roots, which leads to the morbidity or death of the plant.

"X. bracteatum" had been introduced to <a href="Plant%20cultivation">cultivation</a> in England by 1791. German horticulturist Herren Ebritsch obtained material and developed it at his nursery in <a href="Arnstadt">Arnstadt</a> near <a href="Erfurt">Erfurt</a> in Germany. He bred and sold cultivars of many colours from bronze to white to purple, which spread across Europe in the 1850s. The bracts of these early forms tended to remain cupped around the flower head rather than flatten out like the native Australian forms. These were also annual rather than perennial forms. Many were given cultivar names such as 'atrococcineum' (dark scarlet flower heads), 'atrosanguineum' (dark blood-red flower heads), 'aureum' (golden yellow flower heads), 'bicolor' (red-tipped yellow flower heads), 'compositum' (large multicoloured flower heads), 'macranthum' (large rose-edged white flower heads), and 'monstrosum' (flower heads with many bracts), although today they are generally sold in mixed seed for growing as annuals. Some coloured forms of South African "Helichrysum" are thought to have been introduced to the breeding program, which resulted in the huge array of colours. "X. bracteatum" was one of several species that became popular with European royalty and nobility from the early 19th century, yet were little noticed in Australia until the 1860s, when they became more prominent in Australian gardens.
Most of the cultivars brought into cultivation in Australia in the latter part of the 20th century are perennials. 'Dargan Hill Monarch' was the first of these, and many more have followed. Profusely flowering, these grow in many colours including white, yellow, orange, bronze, pink, and red. Their commercial lifespans are generally around three years. Queensland-based company Aussie Winners has a range of compact plants ranging from orange to white known as Sundaze. Plants of this series usually have larger leaves. This range won the "Gran premio d'oro" at the Euroflora exposition in Geneva in 2001, for the best new plant series in the previous three years. 'Florabella Gold', a member of the Florabella series, won the award for best new pot plant (vegetative) in the Society of American Florists' competition of 1999. The Wallaby cultivars are range of taller forms with narrow leaves and white, yellow or pink flowers. Other commercial ranges include the Nullarbor series, and Queensland Federation daisies, including 'Wanetta Sunshine' and 'Golden Nuggets'.

"X. bracteatum" is easy to grow both from seeds and from cuttings, although named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from <a href="pruning">pruning</a> of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20 days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in <a href="soil%20pH">acid</a>, well-aerated soils of pH 5.5 to 6.3, with low levels of <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>. They are sensitive to <a href="iron%20deficiency%20%28plant%20disorder%29">iron deficiency</a>, which presents as yellowing (<a href="chlorosis">chlorosis</a>) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.

"X. bracteatum" can be grown in large pots or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are suitable for hanging baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried flowers are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial <a href="cut%20flowers">cut flowers</a>. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in <a href="glycerol">glycerol</a> or <a href="polyethylene%20glycol">polyethylene glycol</a> also lengthens lifespan.

Australian boobook

The Australian boobook ("Ninox boobook") is a species of <a href="owl">owl</a> native to mainland Australia, southern New Guinea, the island of <a href="Timor">Timor</a>, and the <a href="Sunda%20Islands">Sunda Islands</a>. Described by <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1801, it was generally considered to be the same <a href="species">species</a> as the <a href="morepork">morepork</a> of New Zealand until 1999. Its name is derived from its two-tone "boo-book" call. Eight subspecies of the Australian boobook are recognized, with three further subspecies being reclassified as separate species in 2019 due to their distinctive calls and genetics.

The smallest <a href="owl">owl</a> on the Australian mainland, the Australian boobook is long, with predominantly dark-brown plumage with prominent pale spots. It has grey-green or yellow-green eyes. It is generally nocturnal, though is sometimes active at dawn and dusk, retiring to roost in secluded spots in the foliage of trees. The Australian boobook feeds on insects and small vertebrates, hunting by pouncing on them from tree perches. Breeding takes place from late winter to early summer, using tree hollows as nesting sites. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> has assessed the Australian boobook as being of <a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a> on account of its large range and apparently stable population.

English ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> <a href="species%20description">described</a> the boobook owl as "Strix boobook" in 1801, writing about it in English, before giving it its scientific name, taking its species epithet from a local <a href="Dharug%20language">Dharug</a> word for the bird. The <a href="species%20description">species description</a> was based on a painting by <a href="Thomas%20Watling">Thomas Watling</a> of a bird—the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>—in the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> district in the 1790s. <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> described "Athene marmorata" in 1846 from a specimen in South Australia; this is regarded as a <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a>. German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Jakob%20Kaup">Johann Jakob Kaup</a> classified the two <a href="Taxon">taxa</a> into subgenus "Spiloglaux" of a new genus "Ieraglaux" in 1852, renaming "S. boobook" to "Ieraglaux (Spiloglaux) bubuk". In his 1865 "<a href="Handbook%20to%20the%20Birds%20of%20Australia">Handbook to the Birds of Australia</a>", Gould recognised three species, all of which he placed in the genus "Spiloglaux": "S. marmoratus" from South Australia, "S. boobook", which is widespread across the Australian mainland and Tasmania, and "<a href="Morepork">S. maculatus</a>" from southeastern Australia and Tasmania. Meanwhile, in India, English naturalist <a href="Brian%20Houghton%20Hodgson">Brian Houghton Hodgson</a> had established the genus "<a href="Ninox">Ninox</a>" in 1837, and his countryman <a href="Edward%20Blyth">Edward Blyth</a> placed the Australian boobook in the new genus in 1849.

"Australian boobook" has been designated the official name by the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a>, changed from "southern boobook in 2019 with the separation of some Indonesian subspecies. The common name comes from the two-tone call of the bird, and has also been transcribed as "mopoke". <a href="William%20Dawes%20%28British%20Marines%20officer%29">William Dawes</a> recorded the name "bōkbōk" "an owl" in 1790 or 1791, in his transcription of the Dharug language, and English explorer <a href="George%20Caley">George Caley</a> had recorded the native name as "buck-buck" during the earliest days of the colony, reporting that early settlers had called it cuckoo owl as its call was reminiscent of the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>. He added, "The settlers in New South Wales are led away by the idea that everything is the reverse in that country to what it is in England; and the "Cuckoo", as they call this bird, singing by night, is one of the instances they point out." Gould recorded local aboriginal names: "Goor-goor-da" (Western Australia), "Mel-in-de-ye" (Port Essington), and "Koor-koo" (South Australia). Alternative common names include spotted owl and brown owl. The <a href="Ngarluma">Ngarluma</a> people of the western Pilbara knew it as "gurrgumarlu". In the Yuwaaliyaay dialect of the <a href="Gamilaraay%20language">Gamilaraay language</a> of southeastern Australia, the Australian boobook is .

Dutch naturalist <a href="Gerlof%20Mees">Gerlof Mees</a> and German evolutionary biologist <a href="Ernst%20Mayr">Ernst Mayr</a> regarded the taxonomy of the boobook owl complex as extremely challenging, the latter remarking in 1943 that it was "one of the most difficult problems I have ever encountered". In his 1964 review of Australian owls, Mees treated Australian and New Zealand boobooks, along with several taxa from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, as one species—"Ninox novaeseelandiae"—with 16 subspecies. In his 1968 book "Nightwatchmen of the Bush and Plain", Australian naturalist <a href="David%20Fleay">David Fleay</a> observed that the boobooks from Tasmania more closely resembled those of New Zealand than those from mainland Australia, though he followed Mees in treating them as a single species. The Australian boobook was split from the Tasmanian boobook and morepork in volume 5 of the "" in 1999, though several authors, including Australian ornithologists <a href="Leslie%20Christidis">Les Christidis</a> and Walter Boles, continued to treat the three taxa (Australian plus Tasmanian boobooks and moreporks) as a single species.

Examining both morphological and genetic (<a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome b</a>) characters in 2008, German biologist Michael Wink and colleagues concluded that the Australian boobook is distinct from the morepork and Tasmanian boobook (which they proposed to be raised to species status as "Ninox leucopsis"), and that it is instead the sister taxon to the <a href="barking%20owl">barking owl</a> ("N. connivens"). A 2017 study by Singapore-based biologist Chyi Yin Gwee and colleagues analysing both multi-locus DNA and boobook calls confirmed a sister relationship of "N. n. novaeseelandiae" and "N." ("n.") "leucopsis" and their close relationship to "N. connivens". Genetic and call analysis show the <a href="Christmas%20boobook">Christmas boobook</a> ("N. natalis") to be very close to the Australian populations of the Australian boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified within this species.

Gwee and colleagues found that boobook populations on larger mountainous islands were more distinct from Australian stock, while those on flatter smaller islands were much more similar, suggesting that these locations were colonised much more recently after previous populations had become extinct.

Eleven subspecies of "Ninox boobook" are recognised in version 7.3 of the IOC World Bird List, published in July 2017:


The smallest owl on the Australian mainland, the Australian boobook is long. The nominate subspecies is the largest. It has short, rounded wings and a short tail, with a compact silhouette in flight. Australian boobooks on the Australian mainland follow <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">Bergmann's rule</a>, in that birds from cooler and more southerly parts of the range tend to be larger. Thus, birds from the <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> region weigh around while those from the <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> and <a href="Broome%2C%20Western%20Australia">Broome</a> are around . Females tend to be a little larger and heavier than males, with males weighing and females .

The Australian boobook has generally dark brown head and upperparts, with white markings on the <a href="List%20of%20terms%20used%20in%20bird%20topography%23Plumage%20features">scapulars</a> and spots on the wings. Its head lacks tufts common in other owls, and has a paler facial disk, with a white supercilium (eyebrow) and dark brown ear <a href="Covert%20feather">coverts</a> and cheeks. The brown feathers of the upper forehead, above the supercilium, and sides of the neck have yellow-brown highlights. The feathers of the <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a>, chin and throat are white with black shafts. The feathers of the underparts are mostly brown with white spots and dark blue-grey bases. The upper tail is dark brown with lighter brown bars and a grey fringe at the end, while the undertail is a lighter grey-brown. The female tends to be more prominently streaked than the male overall, though this is inconsistent and wide variation is seen. The eyes have been described as grey-green, green-yellow, or even light hazel. The bill is black with a pale blue-grey base and <a href="Beak%23Cere">cere</a>. The feet are greyish to pinkish brown with dark grey to blackish claws. The underparts are pale, ranging from buff to cream, and are streaked with brown. The overall colour is variable and does not appear to correspond to subspecies or region. In northern and central Australia, Mayr found that the colour of the plumage appears to correlate with the rainfall or humidity, paler birds being found in three disjunct areas, each around away from the other two: the western <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a> and <a href="Pilbara">Pilbara</a>, Sedan on the <a href="Cloncurry%20River">Cloncurry River</a>, and around <a href="Ooldea%2C%20South%20Australia">Ooldea</a>, with darker birds found on Cape York and Melville Island.

Young Australian boobooks are usually paler than adults, and do not attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale eyebrow and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.

On mainland Australia, it could be confused with the barking owl or the <a href="brown%20hawk-owl">brown hawk-owl</a> ("Ninox scutulata"), a rare <a href="Vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> to the northwest, although the Australian boobook is easily distinguished by its squat posture and distinctive pale border to its face mask. The Tasmanian boobook has been recorded from southern Victoria, with one record from New South Wales. It has darker and more reddish upperparts with brighter white dots, with more prominent white dots and a yellow-brown tinge to the underparts. It has pinkish grey feet and golden eyes.

The Australian boobook is found across Australia, although is scarce in more arid regions such as western New South Wales, southwestern and western Queensland, much of South Australia away from the coast and interior Western Australia and Northern Territory. In drier areas it is generally found along watercourses such as the <a href="Darling%20River">Darling</a> and <a href="Paroo%20River">Paroo River</a>s, and <a href="Lake%20Eyre%20basin">Lake Eyre basin</a>. It is found on numerous offshore islands such as Groote Eylandt, Melville Island, <a href="Mornington%20Island">Mornington Island</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Carpentaria">Gulf of Carpentaria</a> and many islands off eastern Australia. It is found in southern New Guinea, Roti, Timor and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is found in a wide range of habitats, from forest and open woodland to scrubland and semidesert areas. In Australia, it resides in mainly eucalypt forests. It has adapted to landscapes altered by human activity and is found in farmland and suburban areas as long as some scattered trees are present.

The Australian boobook is a mainly nocturnal species, though may be active at dawn and dusk. It is heard much more commonly than seen, being particularly vocal in breeding season. The characteristic two-note "boo-book" call or hoot can be heard up to away, the second note generally lower in pitch than the first. Calling takes place from sunset through till dawn, generally with a peak in the two hours after dusk and just before dawn. It can continue for several hours. The male's hooting is higher pitched and of shorter duration, and is heard much more commonly than that of the female. He uses it as a <a href="contact%20call">contact call</a> and to advertise his <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a> to females, as well as when bringing food to his mate or even before mating. Birds give a harsher version of the call when <a href="Mobbing%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mobbing</a> intruders. Both sexes, though mainly the female, give a single monosyllabic hoot as an alarm call or warning. Australian boobooks also make a repetitive croaking or grunting call while courting, mating, or greeting, or as a response to other boobooks hooting. Birds may switch from croaks to hoots seamlessly. Males generally croak at the beginning of the evening, and when arriving at the nest with food. A purring or braying call is used by both sexes as a contact call around the nest and (more quietly) when bringing food to nestlings, or by the female to beg for food from the male. The female makes a low trill during courtship and nesting. Growls, high-pitched yelps, and screeches can be made when attacking intruders.

The Australian boobook maintains and defends a territory in breeding season; whether this continues for the rest of the year is unclear. It retires to densely foliated spots in trees in the daytime, each individual often having several roosting sites. Caves or ledges are alternative roosting sites if no suitable trees are available. Although unobtrusive, it may give itself away by droppings or <a href="Pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellets</a> on the ground beneath. The Australian boobook is mobbed by passerines if discovered. It may allow people to approach to within .

The maximum age recorded from <a href="Bird%20ringing">banding</a> has been 15 years 11 months, in a bird caught and later caught again on <a href="Black%20Mountain%20%28Australian%20Capital%20Territory%29">Black Mountain</a> in the Australian Capital Territory.

Across Australia, breeding takes place from July to February, though peaks in October, and is generally earlier in more northern areas. Eggs are laid from August to October in Queensland, from September to November in New South Wales and southern Western Australia, July to September in central and northern Western Australia, in October and November in Victoria, and in September to December in South Australia.

The Australian boobook nests in holes in trees between 1 and 20 m (3–70 ft) above the ground. The holes are generally vertical, and mostly in eucalypts, though other trees such as coast banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">Banksia integrifolia</a>") have been recorded. Some sites are reused by the species for up to 20 years, especially if broods have been successfully raised in them before. Boobooks may also evict other birds such as <a href="galah">galah</a>s ("Eolophus roseicapillus") to use their hollows, and have used sites abandoned by <a href="Australo-Papuan%20babbler">babblers</a>, crows, and ravens. The male does more of the site preparation, such as lining the base of the hollow with leaves.

Two or three oval, white eggs, laid two to three days apart, are most commonly laid in a clutch, though one to five may be seen. They average 41.6 mm long by 35.5 mm wide, and are finely pitted. The female alone incubates the eggs, during which time she is fed by the male. She does leave the nest at dusk for around half an hour, sometimes to bathe. Incubation takes 30–31 days, with the young often hatching at the same time. Occasionally, the time between first and last eggs hatching can be a few days.

Newly hatched chicks are covered with whitish <a href="Down%20feather">down</a>, and are blind and largely helpless (<a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>). Their eyes begin to open on day 6 and are fully open by day 15. The juvenile feathers begin growing through the down from days 7 to 10, covering the baby owls by two weeks of age. Their mother broods them continuously for the first week, then in the day only until the third week. Her partner brings food to the nest, which she tears into pieces before feeding the nestlings. The young regurgitate pellets and defecate in the nest, which becomes quite smelly. They leave the nest 5–6 weeks after hatching, by which time they are fully feathered, with downy head and underparts and short tails. The tail reaches its adult length by 65 to 70 days. Young boobooks then live in their parents' territory for a further 2–4 months before dispersing, losing the remainder of their downy feathers by around 5 months of age.

<a href="Brushtail%20possum">Brushtail possum</a>s ("Trichosurus" spp.) and introduced cats and rats raid the nests for nestlings and eggs, and raptors such as the <a href="brown%20goshawk">brown goshawk</a> ("Accipiter fasciatus"), <a href="grey%20goshawk">grey goshawk</a> ("Accipiter novaehollandiae"), <a href="Australian%20masked%20owl">Australian masked owl</a> ("Tyto novaehollandiae"), and probably <a href="powerful%20owl">powerful owl</a> ("Ninox strenua") seize young birds. Juvenile Australian boobooks are at greater risk after bushfires and have perished after being tangled up in dodder ("<a href="Cassytha">Cassytha</a>") or bidgee-widgee ("<a href="Acaena%20novae-zelandiae">Acaena novae-zelandiae</a>").

The Australian boobook generally preys on mice, insects, particularly nocturnal beetles and moths, and birds the size of a <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a> ("Passer domesticus"). A higher proportion of its diet is invertebrates compared with other Australian owls. Fieldwork in the vicinity of Canberra found that vertebrates made up more of the diet in autumn and particularly winter. Although more invertebrates were eaten than vertebrates (even more so in autumn), they made up only 2.8% of the <a href="Biomass%20%28ecology%29">biomass</a> consumed. Mammals were the predominant prey species, especially the <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a> ("Mus musculus"), and also <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"), <a href="bush%20rat">bush rat</a> ("R. fuscipes"), and <a href="Gould%27s%20wattled%20bat">Gould's wattled bat</a> ("Chalinolobus gouldii"). Birds including <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a> ("Sturnus vulgaris"), house sparrow, <a href="red-browed%20finch">red-browed finch</a> ("Neochmia temporalis"), <a href="common%20myna">common myna</a> ("Acridotheres tristis"), <a href="red-rumped%20parrot">red-rumped parrot</a> ("Psephotus haematonotus"), and <a href="white-browed%20babbler">white-browed babbler</a> ("Pomatostomus superciliosus"), and invertebrates including grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, cockroaches, moths, <a href="wolf%20spider">wolf spider</a>s, and <a href="huntsman%20spider">huntsman spider</a>s were also consumed. A study in Victoria found that larger animals were eaten, including <a href="Baillon%27s%20crake">Baillon's crake</a> ("Porzana pusilla"), <a href="common%20ringtail%20possum">common ringtail possum</a> ("Pseudocheirus peregrinus") and feral <a href="European%20rabbit">rabbit</a> ("Oryctolagus cuniculus").

Using a fence, branch, or telegraph pole as a perch or vantage point from which to hunt, the Australian boobook pounces on prey then retreats to a tree or elevated place to eat it. It often hunts in open areas near trees, and also where prey is likely to congregate, such as mice near haystacks or barns, or flying insects near street- or house-lights.

A widespread and generally common species, the Australian boobook is listed as being a <a href="least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, on account of its huge range and stable population, with no evidence of any significant decline. Like most species of owl, the Australian boobook is protected by the <a href="CITES">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. A decline has occurred on the <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a> north of Perth. There, Australian boobook owls are dying after eating rodents that people have killed with second-generation <a href="Rodenticide%23Anticoagulants">anticoagulant rat poison</a>. Older poisons such as <a href="warfarin">warfarin</a> or <a href="coumatetralyl">coumatetralyl</a> were unlikely to affect owls.

Too Much Too Soon (album)

Too Much Too Soon is the second <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by the American <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> band <a href="New%20York%20Dolls">New York Dolls</a>. It was released on May 10, 1974, by <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a>. 

The album was recorded earlier that year at <a href="A%20%26amp%3B%20R%20Recording">A&R Studios</a> in New York City with veteran producer <a href="Shadow%20Morton">Shadow Morton</a>. He had been enlisted by New York Dolls frontman <a href="David%20Johansen">David Johansen</a> after the group felt dissatisfied with the recording of their 1973 <a href="New%20York%20Dolls%20%28album%29">self-titled debut album</a>. Morton was disenchanted by the music industry, but felt motivated by the band's energy and agreed to work with them as a challenge.

Although the Dolls shared an affinity for Morton, they produced little original material with him. To complete "Too Much Too Soon", they <a href="cover%20song">covered</a> older songs and re-recorded their past <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demos</a>. Johansen impersonated different characters while singing some of the <a href="novelty%20song">novelty</a> covers, and Morton incorporated many studio sound effects and female backing vocals in his production. For the album, lead guitarist <a href="Johnny%20Thunders">Johnny Thunders</a> wrote and recorded "Chatterbox", his first recorded performance singing lead.

"Too Much Too Soon" sold poorly and only <a href="record%20chart">charted</a> at number 167 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. After a problem-ridden national tour, the New York Dolls were dropped by Mercury and disbanded a few years later. The album received positive reviews from most critics, some of whom felt Morton's production highlighted the group's raw sound and made it a better record than their first. Like their debut album, "Too Much Too Soon" became one of the most popular <a href="cult%20following">cult</a> records in <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> and has since been viewed by music journalists as a precursor to <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>.

After being signed by <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a>, the New York Dolls released their <a href="New%20York%20Dolls%20%28album%29">self-titled debut album</a> in 1973 to poor sales. Although it was praised by critics, the band was not satisfied with producer <a href="Todd%20Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>'s sound for the album and had disagreements with him before choosing not to retain him. Songwriting and production partners <a href="Jerry%20Leiber%20and%20Mike%20Stoller">Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller</a> were originally enlisted to produce their next album, while the band's guitarist <a href="Johnny%20Thunders">Johnny Thunders</a> wanted to produce it himself. However, Leiber and Stoller withdrew shortly before recording was to begin. The group held a single session with Mercury <a href="A%26amp%3BR">A&R</a> executive <a href="Paul%20Nelson%20%28critic%29">Paul Nelson</a> at <a href="Media%20Sound%20Recording%20Studios">Media Sound Recording Studios</a>, where they recorded 14 songs, most of which were <a href="cover%20songs">covers</a>.

At Leiber and Stoller's recommendation, frontman <a href="David%20Johansen">David Johansen</a> asked veteran producer <a href="Shadow%20Morton">Shadow Morton</a> to work on the album. Morton was best known for his work with <a href="the%20Shangri-Las">the Shangri-Las</a>, of whom the New York Dolls were fans, and had also been Johansen's first choice to produce their debut album. Morton had become disenchanted with the music industry and wanted to challenge himself by producing the band's second album: "The Dolls had energy, sort of a disciplined weirdness. I took them into the room as a challenge. I was bored with the music and the business. The Dolls can certainly snap you out of boredom."

With Morton, the New York Dolls recorded "Too Much Too Soon" in 1974 at <a href="A%20%26amp%3B%20R%20Recording">A&R Studios</a> in New York City. The album was later <a href="audio%20mastering">mastered</a> at <a href="Sterling%20Sound">Sterling Sound</a> and <a href="Masterdisk">Masterdisk</a>. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as <a href="gong">gong</a>s, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", journalist <a href="Lenny%20Kaye">Lenny Kaye</a> wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, "bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'." Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the "looser" feel he provided for their music. "That man is completely unpretentious", Johansen said of the producer. "He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life."

The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together. To complete the album, they had to record cover songs and re-record some of the band's earlier demos; "Babylon", "Who Are the Mystery Girls?", "It's Too Late" and "Human Being" had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist <a href="Sylvain%20Sylvain">Sylvain Sylvain</a>, "Teenage News" and "Too Much Too Soon", before working with Morton, but neither was considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling he had been in a rush: "He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to tell me who had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts."

According to journalist <a href="Tony%20Fletcher">Tony Fletcher</a>, Morton would have been more productive on "Too Much Too Soon" had it not been for his alcoholism and the lifestyles of the band members—bassist <a href="Arthur%20Kane">Arthur Kane</a> was also an alcoholic, while Thunders and drummer <a href="Jerry%20Nolan">Jerry Nolan</a> had <a href="Opioid%20dependence">heroin addictions</a>. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> believed the New York Dolls relied more on cover songs for the album because, "like so many cocky songwriters, David Johansen overloaded his debut with originals and then found that record promotion wasn't a life activity that inspired new ones." English writer <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a> said their inability to sell enough records before may have discouraged them from writing original songs.

According to "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine, "Too Much Too Soon" was another <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> record by the New York Dolls but with more "sophisticated" production. Music journalist <a href="Nina%20Antonia">Nina Antonia</a> wrote that because of the group's "untamable wildness", the record still sounded eccentric despite Morton's attempts to "polish" their sound, such as by subduing their otherwise unrefined guitar playing. The album featured covers of <a href="The%20Cadets%20%28doo%20wop%29">the Cadets</a>' 1956 hit "<a href="Stranded%20in%20the%20Jungle">Stranded in the Jungle</a>", <a href="Archie%20Bell%20%28singer%29">Archie Bell</a>'s 1969 hit "There's Gonna Be a Showdown", and <a href="Sonny%20Boy%20Williamson%20II">Sonny Boy Williamson</a>'s "<a href="Don%27t%20Start%20Me%20Talkin%27">Don't Start Me Talkin'</a>". On the <a href="novelty%20song">novelty</a> cover songs, Johansen impersonated characters such as the high-stepper in "(There's Gonna Be A) Showdown" and <a href="Charlie%20Chan">Charlie Chan</a> in "Bad Detective", which has lyrics describing a nonsensical narrative set in China. On "Stranded in the Jungle", he alternated between a comical reject and a lecherous man at <a href="lover%27s%20lane">lover's lane</a>. Journalist <a href="Ellen%20Willis">Ellen Willis</a> remarked that, like the band's 1973 song "<a href="Personality%20Crisis%20%28song%29">Personality Crisis</a>", "Stranded in the Jungle" suggested a theme of "clashing cultures and the dilemma of preserving one's uniqueness while reaching out to others".

For "Babylon", Johansen wrote the lyrics as a tribute to the New York Dolls' following from outside New York City: "[The song] is about people who live in <a href="Babylon%2C%20New%20York">Babylon, Long Island, New York</a>, who go into the city every night dressed to kill. These people have to get home before sun-up, you know, like vampires that can't get caught by the sun." By contrast, "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" magazine's Eric Weisbard and Craig Marks interpreted "Babylon" as a reference to <a href="Babylon%23Biblical%20narrative">the Biblical city of the same name</a> because of how the song portrayed "the symbol of decadence as a sanctuary". The song's subject leaves Babylon for <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, where she is then hired to work in a <a href="massage%20parlor">massage parlor</a>.

"It's Too Late" was a commentary on nostalgic fashions and made reference to actress <a href="Diana%20Dors">Diana Dors</a> in a lyric rebuking drug use. According to Antonia, the song criticized indifferent, decadent people who cannot, as Johansen sang, "<a href="wikt%3Aparlez%20vous">parlez</a> New York français". On "Who Are the Mystery Girls?", he scolded those who abuse love, wanting to "kick it on the floor" and "beat it like a scatter rug". "Puss 'n' Boots" was titled after an illustrated, podoerotic magazine sold in adult book stores. Johansen said the song was about <a href="shoe%20fetishism">shoe fetishism</a>, "or as Arthur [Kane] observed, it's about 'the woofers in relationship with the woofee'." Its lyrics depicted adversities faced by the protagonist, "Little Rhinestone Target", as he tried to change his name in pursuit of his shoe fetish before the music ended with a gunshot, a sound effect inspired by <a href="The%20Olympics%20%28band%29">the Olympics</a>' 1958 song "Western Movies". Willis interpreted a <a href="feminist">feminist</a> subtext in the song, citing the lyrics "sometimes you gotta get away someway / and now you're walkin' just like you're ten feet tall ... I hope you don't get shot for tryin'."

"Chatterbox" was written and sung by Thunders, whom Willis felt "uses his voice as a wailing instrument" in a manner similar to rock singer <a href="Robert%20Plant">Robert Plant</a>. The song was Thunders's first time singing lead and featured vocals Weisbard and Marks said were delivered in a quavering but proud <a href="New%20York%20accent">New York accent</a>. His lyrics described the narrator's growing frustration over a <a href="Crosstalk%20%28electronics%29">crossed-wire</a> phone connection with a female subject. On "Human Being", an ode to self-respect and <a href="personal%20liberty">personal liberty</a>, Thunders introduced his guitar playing with a roughly performed <a href="Variation%20%28music%29">variation</a> on <a href="Bill%20Doggett">Bill Doggett</a>'s 1956 song "<a href="Honky%20Tonk%20%28composition%29">Honky Tonk</a>". Johansen addressed critics of the band in the song, telling them if they found him objectionable they should instead find themselves "a saint", "a boy who's gonna be what I ain't", and a "plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint who's gonna sit through the madness and always act so quaint".

"Too Much Too Soon" was titled after <a href="Too%20Much%2C%20Too%20Soon">the biography</a> on actress <a href="Diana%20Barrymore">Diana Barrymore</a>. According to music journalist <a href="Jon%20Savage">Jon Savage</a>, the title was "more than applicable to the Dolls themselves" because of alcoholism and other issues among the band members, including Thunders's heroin use and Nolan's contraction of <a href="hepatitis">hepatitis</a>. A dedication to Barrymore was printed in the album's <a href="gatefold">gatefold</a>. For its front cover, the group eschewed the <a href="drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a> image that their first album had presented and they had developed a reputation for in favor of a fake concert shot. During the shoot, Thunders held a doll in his arm as if to strike it against his guitar to add <a href="shock%20value">shock value</a>.

The album was first released on May 10, 1974, in the United States. It was another commercial failure for the New York Dolls, as it only <a href="record%20chart">charted</a> at number 167 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. It performed well below Mercury's expectations and sold less than 100,000 copies. 

Two <a href="double%20A-side">double A-side</a>d, <a href="7%26quot%3B">7"</a> singles were released to promote the album—"Stranded in the Jungle" / "Who Are the Mystery Girls?" in July and "(There's Gonna Be A) Showdown" / "Puss 'n' Boots" in September 1974—but neither charted. According to Antonia, the selected singles demonstrated how "the Dolls were in need of a hit single and their current producer wanted to see them attain it" by accommodating radio audiences with toned-down studio versions of songs the band had performed more rowdily in concert. "Stranded in the Jungle", originally a rowdy concert staple for the band, had been produced by Morton with a more polished sound and feminine vocals; according to popular music academic Nick Talevski, it became the New York Dolls' most successful single. Joe Gross wrote in "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The New Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>" (2004) that the band's attempt to garner more <a href="airplay%20%28radio%29">airplay</a> by enlisting Morton did not work because, "with a slicker sound, background choruses, and cleaner riffs, the Dolls just sounded <a href="wikt%3Askanky">skankier</a>".

When "Too Much Too Soon" was released in Europe in July, the New York Dolls performed at the <a href="Buxton%20Festival">Buxton Festival</a> in <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> and the Rock Prom Festival at <a href="Olympia%20%28London%29">Olympia</a> in London. They also embarked on their second tour of the United States, which lasted only a few months. It was marred by cancelled shows and conflicts between the band members stemming from their escalating addictions to alcohol and other drugs. Because of their alcoholism, they failed to set up a recording session for a scheduled third album after the tour had ended, and by 1975, they were dropped by Mercury before disbanding a few years later.

"Too Much Too Soon" received positive reviews from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album in "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", <a href="Dave%20Marsh">Dave Marsh</a> hailed the New York Dolls as the leading hard rock band in the US and noted what he felt was Nolan's competent drumming, Johansen's ability to add depth to his characters, and Thunders's innovative guitar playing. Marsh especially praised his playing on "Chatterbox", calling it "a classic", and believed even the most brazen songs sounded successful because Morton's production highlighted the group's more unrefined musical qualities. Writing for "<a href="Creem">Creem</a>" magazine, Christgau said the polished <a href="Sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction">sound reproduction</a> preserved the band's raw qualities, especially in the case of Johansen's vocals and Nolan's drumming, and remarked that Rundgren "should be ashamed—Shadow Morton has gotten more out of the Dolls than they can give us live on any but their best nights." <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a> from the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" felt "Too Much Too Soon" was a better-produced album that proved the band to be "the real thing", calling it the best record of derisive <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> since "<a href="Exile%20on%20Main%20St.">Exile on Main St.</a>" by <a href="the%20Rolling%20Stones">the Rolling Stones</a> in 1972. In "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", Ellen Willis wrote that she learned to appreciate "Too Much Too Soon" more than "New York Dolls" after seeing the band perform songs from the former album in concert, particularly "Human Being" and "Puss 'n' Boots", while Ron Ross from "<a href="Phonograph%20Record%20%28magazine%29">Phonograph Record</a>" magazine said the group's "easy going ironic sensibility" was expressed "far more amusingly and accessibly" here than on their debut album.

Some reviewers were critical of "Too Much Too Soon" for what they felt was a poorly recorded and <a href="overproduction%20%28music%29">overproduced</a> sound. In a negative review for "<a href="NME">NME</a>", <a href="Nick%20Kent">Nick Kent</a> said it sounded cluttered and "shot through with unfulfilled potential", while "<a href="Circus%20%28magazine%29">Circus</a>" magazine panned the record as "cut after cut of annoying screeching". It was nonetheless voted the tenth best album of 1974 in the <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>". Willis, one of the critics polled, listed it as her fifth favorite record of the year. Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, named it third best, and in a decade-end list for "The Village Voice", he named it the fourth best album of the 1970s. "Los Angeles Times" critic Richard Cromelin included it in his list of favorite records from the decade and wrote that Morton's production made it slightly better than "New York Dolls".

Along with the New York Dolls' first album, "Too Much Too Soon" became one of the most popular <a href="cult%20following">cult</a> records in rock music. According to <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> senior editor <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a>, the group predated punk rock with their "gleeful sleaziness and reckless sound" on the record, which he said was embellished by Morton's production details and exemplified by "musically visceral and dangerous" songs such as "Human Being". In 1986, "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>" magazine ranked it sixtieth on its list of the 100 best albums of all time. After it was <a href="reissue">reissue</a>d by Mercury in 1987, Don McLeese of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" wrote that Morton's production highlighted the New York Dolls' sense of humor and was rendered vividly by the CD <a href="remaster">remaster</a>. However, he felt "Too Much Too Soon" was marred by inconsistent material and rated it lower than their first record. In a review of the reissue, Don Waller of the "Los Angeles Times" said the album was underappreciated and as much an "instant classic" as "New York Dolls".

In 2005, "Too Much Too Soon" was remastered and reissued by <a href="Hip-O%20Records">Hip-O Select</a> and Mercury, after which Christgau wrote in "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" that both it and "New York Dolls" make up "a priceless <a href="protopunk">proto-punk</a> legacy". He wrote that although Johansen's best original songs are on the first record, "Too Much Too Soon" has consistent <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a>, clever lyrics, and exceptional cover songs, including "two R&B novelties whose theatrical potential was barely noticed until the Dolls penetrated their holy essence". That same year, rock journalist <a href="Toby%20Creswell">Toby Creswell</a> named "Babylon" as one of the greatest songs of all time in his book "<a href="1001%20Songs">1001 Songs</a>". In the "<a href="Encyclopedia%20of%20Popular%20Music">Encyclopedia of Popular Music</a>" (2006), <a href="Colin%20Larkin%20%28writer%29">Colin Larkin</a> felt the band's issues with alcohol and other drugs affected their performance on the record, which he deemed "a charismatic collection of punk/glam-rock anthems, typically delivered with 'wasted' cool".

Push the Button (Sugababes song)

"Push the Button" is a song by English girl group the <a href="Sugababes">Sugababes</a>, released as the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> from their fourth studio album "<a href="Taller%20in%20More%20Ways">Taller in More Ways</a>" (2005). Composed by <a href="Dallas%20Austin">Dallas Austin</a> and the Sugababes, it was inspired by an infatuation that group member <a href="Keisha%20Buchanan">Keisha Buchanan</a> developed with another artist. Musically, "Push the Button" is an <a href="electropop">electropop</a> and <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> song with various computer effects.

The song received positive reviews from critics, who praised its conception and production. Some critics named it one of the best pop singles of the 2000s. "Push the Button" became one of the group's most commercially successful releases. The single peaked at number one in Austria, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and reached the top five across Europe and in Australia. It was nominated for <a href="2006%20BRIT%20Awards%23The%20Awards">Best British Single</a> at the <a href="2006%20Brit%20Awards">2006 Brit Awards</a>.

<a href="Matthew%20Rolston">Matthew Rolston</a> directed the song's <a href="music%20video">music video</a>, which was filmed in <a href="Shepherd%27s%20Bush">Shepherd's Bush</a>, <a href="London">London</a>. It features the Sugababes flirting with three men in a <a href="elevator">lift</a>. The Sugababes performed the single at festivals and events such as <a href="Oxegen%202008">Oxegen 2008</a> and the <a href="V%20Festival">V Festival 2008</a>. "Push the Button" appears on the soundtrack to "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Boy%20Girl%20Thing">It's a Boy Girl Thing</a>" (2006).

Development of "Push the Button" began while the Sugababes travelled to the United States to work on their fourth studio album, "<a href="Taller%20in%20More%20Ways">Taller in More Ways</a>" (2005). American producer and songwriter <a href="Dallas%20Austin">Dallas Austin</a> collaborated with the group during the album's initial stages of development. He visited London to work with them, although the group later travelled to the US and stayed with him at his mansion in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, Georgia. Austin wrote five tracks for the album, including "Push the Button", which he composed in collaboration with the Sugababes. According to group member <a href="Heidi%20Range">Heidi Range</a>, the song was "the very last thing" completed for the album.

"Push the Button" was conceptualised after group member <a href="Keisha%20Buchanan">Keisha Buchanan</a> developed an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" that she made advances towards the man, but he was unaware of her intentions: "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, let me know what it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say." Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to "push that button" or she would eventually move on.

<a href="Mutya%20Buena">Mutya Buena</a>, another member of the Sugababes, clarified Buchanan's encounter with the artist to "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>" magazine's Jackie Hayden, saying: "We all knew there was something going on between them at the time, but we try to give each other space." She described "Push the Button" as a song "with meaning and real life references", and characterised it as having a "street vibe". Austin produced the song, which was recorded at DARP Studios in Atlanta & Home Recordings, London. "Push the Button" was <a href="Mixing%20%28music%20production%29">mixed</a> by Jeremy Wheatley at TwentyOne Studios, London, in collaboration with Richard Edgeler. Rick Shepphard <a href="Engineering%20%28music%29">engineered</a> the song.

"Push the Button" is an <a href="uptempo">uptempo</a> <a href="electropop">electropop</a> and <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> song. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s K. Ross Hoffman called it an "electropop club ditty", while Joe Muggs of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" noted that Austin's production combines "raucous" electropop with "slick" American R&B. According to the digital <a href="sheet%20music">sheet music</a> published by <a href="Hal%20Leonard%20Corporation">Hal Leonard Corporation</a>, "Push the Button" was composed in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="A-flat%20major">A-flat major</a> using <a href="common%20time">common time</a>, with a fast-paced tempo of 126 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. The song's <a href="instrumentation">instrumentation</a> is composed of drums, keys, a guitar and a bass guitar.

The production consists of various computer beats and electronic effects. The song contains an ascending <a href="Bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a> incorporated into the <a href="Chorus%20%28song%29">chorus</a>, which consists of the lines: "If you're ready for me boy / You'd better push the button and let me know / Before I get the wrong idea and go." Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. Joe Macare of <a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a> described Buena's delivery of the lyric "my sexy ass" as "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an "idiosyncratic approach" to the English language. Musically, "Push the Button" received comparisons to the sound of pop group <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a>.

"Push the Button" received positive reviews from many critics. Linda McGee from <a href="RT%C3%89.ie">RTÉ.ie</a> commended the song's beat and melody, and named it the album's best track. The song received a similar response from K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic, who noted it as one of the album's highlights, and praised its simplicity and effectiveness. "The Guardian"'s <a href="Alexis%20Petridis">Alexis Petridis</a> considered the melody as "sweet and addictive as <a href="Smarties">Smarties</a>", while <a href="Kitty%20Empire">Kitty Empire</a> of the same publication wrote that the track's "surface simplicity masks a hook that won't let go".

The music video for "Push the Button" was directed by American director <a href="Matthew%20Rolston">Matthew Rolston</a>, who collaborated with the Sugababes on the videos for their singles "<a href="Hole%20in%20the%20Head">Hole in the Head</a>" and "<a href="In%20the%20Middle%20%28Sugababes%20song%29">In the Middle</a>". It was filmed in <a href="Shepherd%27s%20Bush">Shepherd's Bush</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, during July 2005. The men who appear in the video are models and dancers, and were selected based on their dancing ability. Buena described the video as "really cheeky" and stated that it "turned out really great in the end". Some clips were removed from the final product because of their sexual content, although Buchanan admitted that she wanted it to be more suggestive.

The video features Range, Buchanan and Buena emerging from a lift onto separate floors of a tall building, the lift having been called by unsuspecting men. Range arrives on the floor of the first man, described by Buena as 'Mr Shy Guy', and the two begin flirting with each other. Buchanan opens the lift door to see, the second man, 'Mr Too Cool' and Buchanan is shown flirting and dancing with him. Buena emerges from the lift to find 'Mr Perfect', the third man. Buena takes his folded umbrella and throws it away, and soon begins flirting with him. 
Towards the end of the video, Range bends over 'Mr Shy Guy' in a seductive manner, Buchanan pushes 'Mr Too Cool' to the floor, and Buena gives 'Mr Perfect' a <a href="lap%20dance">lap dance</a>. The Sugababes are shown dancing in the lift throughout the video. "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>"'s Gavin Martin wrote that they "throw caution aside and present themselves as voracious maneaters" in the video. He compared Buchanan's dancing to that of American girl group <a href="Destiny%27s%20Child">Destiny's Child</a> in the video for their single "<a href="Bootylicious">Bootylicious</a>". Madeline Crisp of the same publication described the Sugababes as having a "<a href="60s%20fashion">60s</a> look". The video peaked at number one on the UK TV Airplay chart for two consecutive weeks. In Australia, the clip reached number three on <a href="Rage%20%28TV%20program%29">"Rage"</a>'s top 50 video countdown.

Flying Eagle cent

The Flying Eagle cent is a one-<a href="cent%20%28currency%29">cent</a> piece struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a> as a <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a> in 1856 and for circulation in 1857 and 1858. The coin was designed by Mint Chief Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, with the eagle in flight based on the work of Longacre's predecessor, <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a>.

By the early 1850s, the <a href="large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">large cent</a> (about the size of a <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a>) being issued by the Mint was becoming both unpopular in commerce and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% <a href="copper">copper</a> and 12% <a href="nickel">nickel</a> for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, <a href="34th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.

The new cent was issued in exchange for the worn <a href="Spanish%20colonial%20real">Spanish colonial silver coin</a> that had circulated in the U.S. until then, as well as for its larger predecessor. So many cents were issued that they choked commercial channels, especially as they were not <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> and no one had to take them. The eagle design did not strike well, and was replaced in 1859 by Longacre's <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">Indian Head cent</a>.

The cent was the first official United States coin to be struck at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> in 1793. These pieces, today known as <a href="large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">large cents</a>, were made of pure copper and were about the size of a <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a>. They were struck every year, except 1815 due to a shortage of metal, but were slow to become established in commerce. Worn Spanish colonial silver pieces were then commonly used as money throughout the United States. At the time, both gold and silver were <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> there, but copper coins were not; the federal government would not redeem them or take them in <a href="Taxation%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States">payment of taxes</a>.
The Mint then struck silver or gold in response to deposits by those holding <a href="bullion">bullion</a>, and made little profit from those transactions. By the 1840s, profits, or <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a>, from monetizing copper into cents helped fund the Mint. In 1849, copper prices rose sharply, causing the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Department of the Treasury</a> to investigate possible alternatives to the large one-cent pieces. The cent was unpopular in trade; as it was not a legal tender, nobody had to take it, and banks and merchants often refused it. The cent was disliked for its large size as well. In 1837, the eccentric New York chemist <a href="Lewis%20Feuchtwanger">Lewis Feuchtwanger</a> had experimented with a smaller cent size in making model coins as part of a plan to sell his alloy (similar to base-metal <a href="German%20silver">German silver</a>) to the government for use in coinage. <a href="Feuchtwanger%20Cent">His pieces</a> circulated as <a href="hard%20times%20token">hard times token</a>s in the <a href="List%20of%20recessions%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Free%20Banking%20Era%20to%20the%20Great%20Depression">recession years</a> of the late 1830s and early 1840s.

By 1850, it was no longer profitable for the Mint to strike cents, and on May 14, New York Senator <a href="Daniel%20S.%20Dickinson">Daniel S. Dickinson</a> introduced legislation for a cent made out of <a href="billon%20%28alloy%29">billon</a>, copper with a small amount of silver. At the time, it was widely felt that coins should contain a large proportion of their face value in metal. The coin would be annular; that is, it would have a hole in the middle. The Mint struck experimental pieces, and found that it was difficult to eject such pieces from the presses where they were struck, and that it was expensive to recover the silver from the alloy. Provisions for a smaller cent were dropped from the legislation that gave congressional approval for the <a href="three-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">three-cent piece</a> in 1851. Numismatic historian <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> suggested that one factor in rejecting the holed coins was that they reminded many of <a href="cash%20%28Chinese%20coin%29">Chinese cash</a> coins with their minimal purchasing value. A drop in copper prices in 1851 and early 1852 made the matter of a smaller cent less urgent at the Department of the Treasury, which supervised Mint activities.
Copper prices resurged in late 1852 and into 1853 past the $0.40 per pound that the Mint viewed as the break-even point for cent manufacture after considering the cost of production; of copper made 42⅔ large cents. In 1853, patterns using a base-metal alloy were struck using a quarter eagle <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> die, about the size of a <a href="dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">dime</a>. Some of the proposed alloys contained the metal <a href="nickel">nickel</a>. Also considered for use in the cent was "French bronze" (95% copper with the remainder <a href="tin">tin</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>) and various varieties of German silver. In his 1854 annual report, <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a> <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a> advocated the issue of small, <a href="bronze">bronze</a> cents, as well as the elimination of the <a href="half%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half cent</a>, which he described as useless in commerce. A number of pattern cents were struck in 1854 and 1855. These featured various designs, including several depictions of <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a> and two adaptations of work by the late Mint chief engraver <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a>: one showing a seated Liberty, which Gobrecht had placed on the silver coins in the 1830s, and another of a flying eagle, which Gobrecht had created based upon a sketch by <a href="Titian%20Peale">Titian Peale</a>.

In early 1856, Snowden proposed legislation to allow him to issue a smaller cent, but leaving the size and metallic composition up to him and Secretary of the Treasury <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28Kentucky%29">James Guthrie</a>. Under the plan, the new piece would be legal tender, up to ten cents. It would be issued in exchange for the old Spanish silver still circulating in the United States. In the exchange, the Spanish silver would be given full value (12½ cents per <a href="Spanish%20colonial%20real">real</a>, or <a href="bit%20%28money%29">bit</a>) when normally such pieces traded at about a 20% discount due to wear. The loss the government would take on the trade would be paid for by the seignorage on the base-metal pieces. The new cents would also be issued for the old cents, and in exchange for the same value in half cents—that denomination was to be discontinued. The bill was introduced in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> on March 25, 1856. The old cent weighed ; on April 16, the bill was amended to provide for a cent of at least 95% copper weighing at least and passed the Senate in that form.

While the legislation was being considered, Mint Melter and Refiner <a href="James%20Curtis%20Booth">James Curtis Booth</a> was conducting experiments on alloys that might be appropriate for the new cent. In July 1856, Snowden wrote to Guthrie, proposing an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel as ideal and suggesting amendments to the pending bill that would accomplish this. Booth also wrote to Guthrie to boost the alloy; both men proposed a weight of as convenient as 80 cents would equal a <a href="Pound%20%28mass%29%23Troy%20pound">troy pound</a> (373 g), although the <a href="Pound%20%28mass%29%23Avoirdupois%20pound">avoirdupois pound</a> (454 g) was more commonly used for base metals.

The Mint's chief engraver, <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, was instructed to prepare designs for pattern coins. Initially, Longacre worked with Liberty head designs such as were common at the time, but Snowden asked that a flying eagle design be prepared. This occurred as Booth's experiments continued; the first cent patterns with the flying eagle design were about the size of a quarter. To promote the new alloy, the Mint had 50 half cents struck in it, and had them sent to Washington for Treasury officials to show to officials and congressmen. In early November 1856, Longacre prepared dies in what would prove to be the final design, depicting a flying eagle on the obverse and a wreathed denomination on the reverse, in the size sought by Booth.

The Mint struck at least several hundred patterns using Longacre's flying eagle design in the proposed composition. In an effort to secure public acceptance of the new pieces, these were distributed to various congressmen and other officials, initially in November 1856. Two hundred were sent to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Financial%20Services">House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures</a>, while four were given to President <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>. At least 634 specimens were distributed, and possibly several thousand; extra were available on request. This was the origin of the highly collectable 1856 Flying Eagle cent, which is considered by numismatists as part of the Flying Eagle series although it was actually a pattern or transition piece, not an official coin, as congressional approval had not yet been granted. Additional 1856 small cents were later struck by Snowden for illicit sale, and to exchange for pieces the Mint sought for <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">its coin collection</a>.
In December 1856, Snowden wrote to Missouri Representative <a href="John%20S.%20Phelps">John S. Phelps</a>, hoping for progress with the legislation, and stating that he was already "pressed on all hands, and from every quarter, for the new cent—in fact, the public are very anxious for its issue". When the legislation, amended to include the weight and alloy the Mint had decided on, was debated in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> on December 24, it was opposed by Tennessee Congressman <a href="George%20Washington%20Jones%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">George Washington Jones</a> over the legal tender provision; Jones felt that under the <a href="Contract%20Clause">Constitution's Contract Clause</a>, only gold and silver should be made legal tender. Phelps defended the bill on the ground that Congress had the constitutional power to regulate the value of money, but when the bill was brought back up to be considered on January 14, 1857, the legal tender provision had been removed. This time, the bill was opposed by New York Congressman <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Whitney">Thomas R. Whitney</a>, who objected to a provision in the bill that legalized the Mint's practice of designing and striking medals commissioned by the public, feeling that the government should not compete with private medallists. The provision was removed, and the bill passed the following day. The House version was then considered by the Senate, which debated it on February 4, and passed it with a further amendment allowing the redemption of the Spanish coins for a minimum of two years. The House agreed to this on February 18, and President Pierce signed the bill on the 21st. The act made foreign gold and silver coins no longer legal tender, but Spanish dollars were redeemable at their nominal value for two years in exchange for the new copper-nickel cents. The half cent was abolished. The new pieces would be the same size (19 mm), though somewhat heavier, than cents are today.

In anticipation of the success of the legislation, most of the 333,456 large cents struck in 1857 never left the Philadelphia Mint, and were later melted. Snowden purchased a new set of rollers and other equipment so that the Mint could produce its own cent <a href="planchet">planchet</a>s, the first time it had done so in over 50 years. Although the legislation was still a day from final passage, Snowden recommended Longacre's designs to Guthrie on February 20. Guthrie approved them on the 24th, though he requested that the edge of the coin be made less sharp; Snowden promised to comply. Flying Eagle cents were struck beginning in April 1857 and were held pending official release. The Mint stored the pieces pending accumulation of a sufficient supply; in mid-May, Snowden notified Philadelphia newspapers that distribution would begin on May 25.

Longacre's obverse of an eagle in flight is based on that of the Gobrecht dollar, struck in small quantities from 1836 to 1839. Although Gobrecht's model is not known with certainty, some sources state that the bird in flight was based on <a href="Peter%20%28eagle%29">Peter the eagle</a>, a tame bird fed by Mint workers in the early 1830s until it was caught up in machinery and killed. The bird was stuffed, and is still displayed at the Philadelphia Mint.

Despite its derivative nature, Longacre's eagle has been widely admired. According to art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> in his book on U.S. coins, the flying eagle motif, when used in the 1830s, was "the first numismatic bird that could be said to derive from nature rather than from colonial carving or heraldry". Vermeule described the Flying Eagle cent's replacement, the <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">Indian Head cent</a>, as "far less attractive to the eye than the Peale-Gobrecht flying eagle and its variants". Sculptor <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>, when commissioned in 1905 to provide new designs for American coinage, sought to return a flying eagle design to the cent, writing to President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, "I am using a flying eagle, a modification of the device which was used on the cent of 1857. I had not seen that coin for many years, and was so impressed by it that I thought if carried out with some modifications, nothing better could be done. It is by all odds the best design on any American coin." Saint-Gaudens did return the flying eagle to American coinage, but his design was used for the reverse of the double eagle rather than the cent.

The wreath on the reverse is also derivative, having been previously used on Longacre's Type II gold dollar of 1854, and the <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a> of the same year. It is composed of leaves of wheat, corn, cotton and tobacco, thus including produce associated with both the North and the South. The cotton leaves are sometimes said to be maple leaves; the two types are not dissimilar, and maple leaves are more widely known than cotton leaves. An ear of corn is also visible.

The Philadelphia Mint released the new cents to the public on May 25, 1857. In anticipation of large popular demand, Mint authorities built a temporary wooden structure in the courtyard of the Philadelphia facility. On the morning of the date of release, hundreds of people queued, one line for those exchanging Spanish silver for cents, the other for those bringing in old copper cents and half cents. From 9 am, clerks paid out cents for the old pieces; outside the Mint precincts, early purchasers sold the new cents at a premium. Snowden wrote to Guthrie, "the demand for them is enormous … we had on hand this morning $30,000 worth, that is three million pieces. Nearly all of this amount will be paid out today." The 1856 specimen became publicly known about the time of issuance, and had the public checking their pocket change; 1856 small cents sold for as much as $2 by 1859. The public interest in the new cents set off a coin collecting boom: in addition to seeking the rare 1856 cent, some tried to collect sets of large cents back to 1793, and found they would have to pay a premium for the rarer dates.

The Mint had trouble striking the new design. This was due to the hard copper-nickel alloy and the fact that the eagle on one side of the piece was directly opposite parts of the reverse design; efforts to bring out the design more fully led to increased die breakage. Many Flying Eagle cents show weaknesses, especially at the eagle's head and tail, which are opposite the wreath. In 1857, Snowden suggested the replacement of the eagle with a head of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>. Longacre replied that as there had been objections to proposals to place <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> on the coinage, there would also be opposition to a Columbus design. Despite the difficulties, the 17,450,000 Flying Eagle cents struck at Philadelphia in 1857 constituted the greatest production of a single coin in a year at a U.S. mint to that time.
In 1858, the Mint tried to alleviate the breakage problem using a new version of the cent with a shallower relief. This attempt led to the major variety of the series, as coins of the revised version have smaller letters in the inscriptions than those struck earlier. The two <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23variety">varieties</a> are about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint used up older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used in the new year.

The Mint prepared pattern coins with a much smaller eagle in 1858, which struck well, but which officials disliked. Snowden directed Longacre to prepare various patterns that he could select from for a new piece to replace the Flying Eagle cent as of January 1, 1859. The Mint produced between 60 and 100 sets of twelve patterns showing various designs; these were circulated to officials and also were quietly sold by the Mint over the next several years. Longacre's design showing Liberty wearing an Indian-style headress was adopted, with a wreath with lower relief for the reverse of the Indian Head cent, solving the metal flow issues. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to the Treasury Department, stating that the Flying Eagle cent had proved "not very acceptable to the general population" as they felt the bird was not true to life, and that the Native American design would "giv[e] it the character of America".
By September 1857, the volume of Spanish silver coming to the Mint had been so large that Snowden gave up the idea of being able to pay for it just with cents, authorizing payment with gold and silver coins. On March 3, 1859, the redemption of the foreign pieces was extended for an additional two years. As commerce was choked with the new cents, <a href="36th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> repealed this provision in July 1860, though Snowden continued the practice for more than a year without authorization from Congress. "Bankers Magazine" for October 1861 reported the end of the exchange, and quoted the Philadelphia "Press": "the large issue of the new nickel cents has rendered them almost as much of a nuisance as the old Spanish currency." According to Breen, "the foreign silver coins had been legal tender, receivable for all kinds of payments including postage stamps and some taxes; the nickel cents were not. They quickly filled shopkeepers' cashboxes to the exclusion of almost everything else; they began to be legally refused in trade." The glut was ended by the hoarding of all federal coinage in the wake of the economic upset caused by the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>.

After the war, the hoarded Flying Eagle cents re-entered circulation. Many remained there only a few years, being pulled out from among the new bronze cents in Treasury Department redemption programs in the 1860s and 1870s—thirteen million copper-nickel cents were retired by exchange for other base-metal coinage. By the 1880s, it was a rarity in circulation. The 2018 edition of <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists the 1857, 1858 large letters, and 1858 small letters each at $30 in <a href="coin%20grading">G-4 Good condition</a>, the next to lowest collectable grade (AG-3). The 1856 is $6,500 in that grade, rising to $20,000 in uncirculated MS-63. The 1858/7 starts at $75 in G-4, rising to $11,000 in MS-63. An 1856 cent in MS-66 condition sold at auction in January 2004 for $172,500.

Interstate 470 (Ohio–West Virginia)

Interstate 470 (I-470) is a <a href="auxiliary%20Interstate%20Highway">auxiliary Interstate Highway</a> of <a href="Interstate%2070">I-70</a> that <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypasses</a> the city of <a href="Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wheeling, West Virginia</a>, in the United States. I-470 is one of 13 auxiliary Interstate Highways in Ohio and the only auxiliary Interstate Highway in <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>. The western terminus of I-470 is an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2070%20in%20Ohio">I-70</a> in <a href="Richland%20Township%2C%20Belmont%20County%2C%20Ohio">Richland Township</a>, Ohio. Traveling southeast through rural <a href="Belmont%20County%2C%20Ohio">Belmont County</a>, I-470 approaches the <a href="Interstate%20470%20Bridge">Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge</a>, which spans the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a>. After crossing the river into <a href="Ohio%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Ohio County, West Virginia</a>, the highway turns east towards the Wheeling communities of <a href="Bethlehem%2C%20West%20Virginia">Bethlehem</a> and <a href="Elm%20Grove%2C%20West%20Virginia">Elm Grove</a> and its eastern terminus at <a href="Interstate%2070%20in%20West%20Virginia">I-70</a> near Elm Grove. The portion of the highway in West Virginia is named the USS "West Virginia" Memorial Highway, by proclamation of then Governor <a href="Cecil%20H.%20Underwood">Cecil Underwood</a> on the 59th anniversary of the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor attack</a>.

Construction of the freeway began in 1975 in the two states. Due to a chronic lack of funding, construction in Ohio was stalled between 1976 and 1981. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) <a href="fuel%20tax">fuel tax</a> increase, Ohio was able to restart construction, and by 1983, both states had completed construction on the freeway. The <a href="three-level%20diamond%20interchange">three-level diamond interchange</a> with <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrent</a> highways <a href="U.S.%20Route%20250%20in%20West%20Virginia">U.S. Route 250</a> (US 250) and <a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%202">West Virginia Route 2</a> (WV 2) on the eastern banks of the Ohio River was thought to be the most complex interchange in West Virginia's <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> at the time of construction. On average, between 25,500 and 37,840 vehicles use the highway daily.

The freeway begins at a <a href="interchange%20%28road%29%23Two-way%20interchanges">partial interchange</a> with I-70 in <a href="Richland%20Township%2C%20Belmont%20County%2C%20Ohio">Richland Township, Belmont County, Ohio</a>. An exit for County Road 28 (CR 28), the second-last exit for westbound traffic, provides motorists access to <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20Ohio">US 40</a>. The highway curves to the southeast, passing near the Belmont Memorial Park and through woodlands. I-70 forms part of the northeastern border of <a href="Neffs%2C%20Ohio">Neffs</a>, <a href="Pease%20Township%2C%20Belmont%20County%2C%20Ohio">Pease Township</a>, and briefly parallels High Ridge Road (CR 214) then meets it at a <a href="diamond%20interchange">diamond interchange</a> in <a href="Pultney%20Township%2C%20Belmont%20County%2C%20Ohio">Pultney Township</a>. High Ridge Road to the north connects back to I-70, and to the south links <a href="Bellaire%2C%20Ohio">Bellaire</a> to the bypass. I-470 continues easterly into a valley before intersecting a <a href="trumpet%20interchange">trumpet interchange</a> leading to another interchange with <a href="Ohio%20State%20Route%207">State Route 7</a> (SR 7) along the western banks of the Ohio River. The <a href="Interstate%20470%20Bridge">Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge</a> carries I-470 over three rail lines and the Ohio River (the state line between Ohio and West Virginia). The rail lines on the western banks of the river belong to the <a href="Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway">Norfolk Southern Railway</a> and the <a href="Wheeling%20and%20Lake%20Erie%20Railway%20%281990%29">Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway</a>'s <a href="River%20Subdivision%20%28Wheeling%20and%20Lake%20Erie%20Railway%29">River Subdivision</a>. The <a href="American%20Automobile%20Association">American Automobile Association</a> considers the stretch of I-470 though Ohio to be a <a href="scenic%20highway">scenic highway</a> due to its natural beauty.
I-470 enters the <a href="city%20limits">city limits</a> of Wheeling and <a href="Ohio%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Ohio County, West Virginia</a>; the <a href="Greater%20Wheeling%20Trail">Greater Wheeling Trail</a>, a <a href="rail%20trail">rail trail</a>, passes under the freeway as I-470 approaches a <a href="three-level%20diamond%20interchange">three-level diamond interchange</a> with US 250 and WV 2. The concurrent highways connect to downtown Wheeling in the north and <a href="Benwood%2C%20West%20Virginia">Benwood</a> to the south. I-70 climbs from the banks of the river into more woodlands before an interchange with West Bethlehem Boulevard, which provides access to the village of <a href="Bethlehem%2C%20West%20Virginia">Bethlehem</a> to the south. Continuing easterly, I-470 comes to its end at an incomplete interchange with its parent, I-70, over <a href="Wheeling%20Creek%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Wheeling Creek</a> near <a href="Elm%20Grove%2C%20West%20Virginia">Elm Grove</a> and to the north of the J.B. Chambers Youth Sports Complex and Wheeling Skate Park. Traffic from I-470 can only access eastbound I-70, and only traffic traveling westbound on I-70 can access I-470. The eastern branch of the Greater Wheeling Trail, which parallels the creek, passes underneath I-470 as it merges into I-70.

I-470 is one of 13 <a href="auxiliary%20Interstate%20Highway">auxiliary Interstate Highway</a>s in Ohio and the only auxiliary Interstate Highway in West Virginia. The <a href="Ohio%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Ohio Department of Transportation</a> and <a href="West%20Virginia%20Division%20of%20Highways">West Virginia Division of Highways</a> (ODOT and WVDOH) conduct surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a> (AADT), a measure of average traffic volume for any day of the year. In 2012, they calculated that 26,500 vehicles traveled along the highway at the eastern terminus in West Virginia, and 37,840 vehicles used I-470 across the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge. As part of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>, the entire route is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>—a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.

Plans for a southern bypass of Wheeling were first published in 1955 in <a href="Bureau%20of%20Public%20Roads">Bureau of Public Roads</a> document titled "<a href="General%20Location%20of%20National%20System%20of%20Interstate%20Highways">General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas</a>". An <a href="environmental%20impact%20statement">environmental impact statement</a> was filed in 1972 by West Virginia, detailing the I-470 interchange with US 250/WV 2 along the eastern banks of the Ohio River. Tunnels used by the nearby LaBelle Nail Plant, LaBelle being the original French word for the Ohio River, were unearthed during construction of this interchange. A segment in West Virginia was bid out at just over $16.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) in 1976.

Ohio had completed the stretch of highway between I-70 to just before the SR 7 interchange by 1976, but due to budget deficiencies work did not resume in Ohio until 1981. Construction of the bridge linking the two portions of highway was scheduled to be completed by 1981, but construction did not begin until that year. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) <a href="fuel%20tax">fuel tax</a> increase, Ohio was able to fund the project again. Bids for construction work on the remainder of the Ohio portion of the freeway were solicited in 1981, with an estimated construction time of 37 months for the stretch between I-70 and the bridge.

The West Virginia portion was under construction by 1976, and work in both states was completed by 1983. The three-level diamond interchange on the eastern banks of the Ohio River was said to be the most complex interchange in West Virginia at the time of construction by the WVDOH spokesman Gary Chernenko. The opening of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge, along with another bridge in nearby <a href="Moundsville%20Bridge">Moundsville</a> was thought to have reduced the amount of traffic, and thus tolls collected by the nearby <a href="Bellaire%20Bridge">Bellaire Bridge</a> by up to 50 per cent in 1987.

Between September 12 and December 22, 1996, about of I-470 in Ohio was closed so ODOT could stabilize and repave the roadway, as the rocks forming the top of an abandoned mine underneath the freeway had become overstressed. The <a href="Fort%20Henry%20Bridge">Fort Henry Bridge</a> (which carries I-70), the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge and the <a href="Wheeling%20Suspension%20Bridge">Wheeling Suspension Bridge</a> were all closed in January 2005, stopping any traffic from Ohio or Wheeling Island from entering mainland West Virginia for a few days because barges broke loose during heavy flooding along the Ohio River. The <a href="Wheeling%20Tunnel">Wheeling Tunnel</a> was closed for reconstruction work in 2007, 2008, and 2010, causing motorists who wished to travel through on I-70 to detour. The two detour routes were city streets in downtown Wheeling and the I-470 loop.

Then West Virginia governor, <a href="Cecil%20H.%20Underwood">Cecil Underwood</a>, issued a proclamation on December 7, 2000, the 59th anniversary of the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, naming I-470 in West Virginia the USS "West Virginia" Memorial Highway, in honor of the <a href="USS%20West%20Virginia%20%28BB-48%29">battleship of that name</a>.

Hurricane Gert

Hurricane Gert was a large <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that caused extensive flooding and mudslides throughout Central America and Mexico in September 1993. The seventh <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a> and third hurricane of the <a href="1993%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">annual hurricane season</a>, Gert originated as a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> over the southwestern <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> on September 14. The next day, the cyclone briefly attained <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a> strength before moving ashore in <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> and proceeding through <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>. It reorganized into a tropical storm over the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Honduras">Gulf of Honduras</a> on September 17, but weakened back to a depression upon crossing the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>. Once over the warm waters of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Campeche">Bay of Campeche</a>, Gert quickly strengthened into a <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale%23Category%202">Category 2 hurricane</a> by September 20. The hurricane made a final <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20Mexico">Gulf Coast of Mexico</a> near <a href="Tuxpan%2C%20Veracruz">Tuxpan, Veracruz</a>, with peak winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). The rugged terrain disrupted the cyclone's structure; Gert entered the Pacific Ocean as a depression near the state of <a href="Nayarit">Nayarit</a> on September 21, where it briefly redeveloped a few strong thunderstorms before dissipating at sea five days later.

Gert's broad wind circulation produced widespread and heavy rainfall across Central America through September 15–17. Combined with saturated soil from <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Bret%20%281993%29">Tropical Storm Bret</a>'s passage a month earlier, the storm triggered widespread floods and mudslides that isolated numerous communities. In <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>, the blustery weather destroyed a national park and led to significant losses for the agricultural and tourism sectors. Much of the <a href="Mosquito%20Coast">Mosquito Coast</a> of Nicaragua and Honduras endured overflowing rivers, with many cities, villages, and crops in those countries left under water. Although Gert's highest winds occurred upon landfall in Mexico, the worst effects in the country were due to an extreme rainfall event in the <a href="La%20Huasteca">Huasteca region</a>, where as many as 31.41 inches (798 mm) of rain fell. As an increasing number of major rivers burst their banks, catastrophic flooding submerged extensive areas around the <a href="P%C3%A1nuco%20River">Pánuco basin</a>. Tens of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate, and scores of structures were demolished in what was described as the region's worst disaster in 40 years.

In the wake of the hurricane, the road networks of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116 people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170 million (1993 USD).

Hurricane Gert had a complex lifespan as a large and slow-moving tropical cyclone, repeatedly interacting with nearby landmasses and other atmospheric systems. Its genesis can be traced to a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a>—an <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">area of low pressure</a> oriented north to south—that moved off the <a href="Africa">Africa</a>n coast well south of <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a> on September 5, 1993. The wave tracked rapidly westward across the <a href="tropical%20Atlantic">tropical Atlantic</a> at a relatively low <a href="latitude">latitude</a>, causing it to interact with the <a href="Intertropical%20Convergence%20Zone">Intertropical Convergence Zone</a> and fostering <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> in its vicinity. It developed a weak <a href="Low-pressure%20area">low-pressure center</a> at sea level, which passed directly over <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> on September 11. Despite having most of its cloud pattern move over the northern coast of <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, the system maintained its identity and emerged over the southwestern <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> on September 13. There, it began showing signs of <a href="Tropical%20cyclogenesis">development</a> owing to favorable <a href="Troposphere">tropospheric</a> conditions aloft, developing curved, well-defined <a href="Rainband">bands</a> of deep convection. Based on the improved cyclonic structure alongside the presence of a surface circulation, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) classified the system as a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> at 1800 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> on September 14, when it was located 105 miles (165 km) north of the northern coast of <a href="Panama">Panama</a>.

From its inception onwards, the depression had a rather large wind field as observed from <a href="Weather%20satellite">satellite images</a> and <a href="rawinsonde">rawinsonde</a> data. As its structure gradually coalesced, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Gert at 0900 UTC on September 15. After tracking west-northwestward, the center of the storm moved ashore near <a href="Bluefields">Bluefields</a>, <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, around 1800 UTC that day, producing <a href="Maximum%20sustained%20wind">winds</a> of 40 mph (65 km/h). Gert's interaction with land impeded further development and eventually caused the storm to weaken back to a tropical depression six hours later. Although the cyclone's center stayed over land for nearly two days, parts of the large circulation remained in contact with the adjacent Caribbean and <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a> waters. This allowed Gert to retain its status as a tropical cyclone as it trailed northwestward through Nicaragua and <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>, consistently defying the NHC's forecasts of its dissipation over land.
On September 17, Gert moved over the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Honduras">Gulf of Honduras</a>, where it soon restrengthened into a tropical storm. Its duration over water and its opportunity for additional strengthening were curtailed after a mid- to <a href="tropical%20upper-tropospheric%20trough">upper-level trough</a> over the eastern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> turned the storm to the north-northwest, bringing it over the coast of Belize on the next day. Once inland, Gert began to feel the effects of a <a href="Ridge%20%28meteorology%29">high-pressure ridge</a> to the northwest, which nudged the storm on a more west-northwestward course. After crossing the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> and winding down over land, Gert entered the <a href="Bay%20of%20Campeche">Bay of Campeche</a> offshore <a href="Champot%C3%B3n%2C%20Campeche">Champotón</a> late on September 18 as a tropical depression. The open tropical waters, combined with light <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> aloft, allowed the cyclone's deep convection to reconsolidate; around 0600 UTC the next day, Gert again restrengthened into a tropical storm. The storm veered toward the west and slowed slightly in response to a <a href="Shortwave%20%28meteorology%29">shortwave trough</a> to its north, giving it more time to mature over water. On September 20, data from a <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">United States Air Force aircraft</a> indicated that Gert had become a hurricane with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h); it attained its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir–Simpson scale</a> soon thereafter, with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum <a href="Atmospheric%20pressure">pressure</a> of 970 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 28.64 <a href="Inch%20of%20mercury">inHg</a>).

Around 2100 UTC on September 20, Gert made a final <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> at peak intensity on the coast of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, just north of <a href="Tuxpan">Tuxpan</a>, <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>. The hurricane accelerated and weakened rapidly over the mountainous region of the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20Oriental">Sierra Madre Oriental</a>, deteriorating into a tropical depression by September 21. Despite its declining strength, the large circulation remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert exited the coast of <a href="Nayarit">Nayarit</a> and entered the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> later that day, where the NHC <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming%23Tropical%20cyclone%20renaming">reclassified</a> it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The remaining deep convection waxed and waned in intensity; satellite observations indicated the depression could have briefly regained tropical storm strength on September 22. It continued a west to west-northwestward motion for two days, though low-level <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Steering%20winds">flow</a> steered it toward the southwest after the convection diminished. There was no redevelopment due to cool sea temperatures, and the system dissipated at sea on September 26.

After confirming the development of a tropical depression, authorities in <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a> issued a green alert for coastal regions on September 14. The following day, a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Tropical%20Storm%20Warning">tropical storm warning</a> was issued for the Atlantic coast of the country. National television and radio stations broadcast warning messages to the public, and emergency crews were dispatched in case conditions were to warrant intervention. This helped with the effective and timely clearing of hospitals, as well as the evacuation of residents in high-risk zones. A tropical storm warning was posted for the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on September 15, extending south from <a href="Puerto%20Cabezas">Puerto Cabezas</a> to the adjacent islands. In Honduras, early storm warnings allowed several hundred residents to evacuate well ahead of Gert's arrival. Once it became evident that the storm would strike the Yucatán Peninsula, coastal areas from <a href="Belize">Belize</a> northward to <a href="Cozumel%2C%20Mexico">Cozumel, Mexico</a>, were placed under a tropical storm warning on September 17 until Gert's landfall the next day.

While Gert was still located over the peninsula, the government of Mexico issued a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Tropical%20Storm%20Watch">tropical storm watch</a> for the Gulf Coast from the city of <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Veracruz</a> northward to <a href="Soto%20la%20Marina%2C%20Tamaulipas">Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas</a>. By September 18, it was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and extended southward to <a href="Minatitl%C3%A1n%2C%20Veracruz">Minatitlán</a>, although the initial watch area was placed under a <a href="Hurricane%20Watch">hurricane watch</a> after Gert showed signs of strengthening. The next day, the tropical storm watch from Soto La Marina to <a href="Nautla%2C%20Veracruz">Nautla</a> was upgraded to a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Hurricane%20Warning">hurricane warning</a> as it became clearer where Gert would make landfall. Prior to impact, several ports along the Gulf Coast halted their operations, and people living in risk zones were evacuated. All warnings and watches were discontinued after the hurricane moved inland.

Gert was a large tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan; it always remained close enough to the coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over a large area, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico. The disaster resulted in at least 116 deaths and 16 missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops and vegetation surmounted $170 million.

Although Gert's center remained off the coast of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1 inches (332 mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor <a href="hydraulic%20conductivity">hydraulic conductivity</a> and were therefore prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the <a href="Tempisque%20River">Tempisque River</a> prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequences. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as <a href="Quepos">Quepos</a>, <a href="P%C3%A9rez%20Zeled%C3%B3n%20Canton">Pérez Zeledón</a>, and <a href="Osa%20Peninsula">Osa</a> experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.

The floods ruined about of banana crop and damaged <a href="oil%20palm">oil palm</a> plantations. Small-scale farmers of <a href="reed%20%28plant%29">reed</a>, <a href="maize">maize</a>, beans, and rice were also affected. The storm disrupted local fishing and wrecked several small boats in Quepos. High winds brought great destruction to about 65 percent of the vegetation in the <a href="Manuel%20Antonio%20National%20Park">Manuel Antonio National Park</a>, vastly impacting the tourism-driven economy of Quepos. Gert left moderate property damage in its wake; it destroyed 27 homes and otherwise damaged 659, mostly because of flooding. Overall costs totaled $3.1 million, of which $1.7 million was due to the impaired infrastructure. Roughly 1,000 people sought shelter during the storm. Owing to the timely preparations in the country, only one cardiac arrest fatality was attributable to Gert when a landslide buried a home.

Moving ashore in Nicaragua a month after <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Bret%20%281993%29">Tropical Storm Bret</a>'s passage, Gert caused excessive rainfall over already saturated regions. Despite striking the Atlantic coast, the storm produced the largest amounts of precipitation over northern and Pacific coastal areas. A maximum of 17.8 in (452 mm) fell at <a href="Corinto%2C%20Nicaragua">Corinto</a>; other significant totals include 17.6 in (447 mm) at <a href="Chinandega%2C%20Chinandega">Chinandega</a> and 17.5 in (444 mm) at <a href="Le%C3%B3n%2C%20Nicaragua">León</a>. The capital of <a href="Managua">Managua</a> recorded 9.8 in (249 mm) of rain during the event. Sustained winds from the storm reached no more than 40 mph (65 km/h) upon landfall near Bluefields, though they downed trees and power lines and generated high waves of up to 12 feet (3.7 m) offshore. After weakening to a depression inland, Gert continued to produce moderate gales along its path through the country.

In total, Gert destroyed 252 houses and damaged another 293 across 14 of Nicaragua's departments; the storm was also responsible for considerable infrastructural damage and economic losses. As many as 123,000 people were affected throughout the country, and there were 37 confirmed fatalities. The impact on the ecology was profound: rivers, estuaries, and <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s in and around lakes Nicaragua and <a href="Lake%20Managua">Managua</a>, as well as the inhabiting fauna, suffered from severe erosion and <a href="siltation">siltation</a>. Since flooding from Tropical Storm Bret had occurred just one month earlier, an exclusive damage estimate for Gert is unavailable. The two storms inflicted a combined $10.7 million in damage, primarily to private property.

Although it had weakened to a depression, Gert continued to drop significant rainfall while crossing Honduras. In <a href="Tegucigalpa">Tegucigalpa</a>, at least 6.77 in (172 mm) of rain were recorded. Damaging floods swept through 13 of <a href="Departments%20of%20Honduras">the country's 18 departments</a>; however, northern Honduras and the <a href="La%20Mosquitia">Mosquitia Region</a>, which had already endured the onslaught of Tropical Storm Bret in the previous month, bore the brunt of the devastation. The additional flooding from Gert affected 24,000 people in the region and made communication with surrounding areas nearly impossible. Elsewhere, the rain filled several major rivers, including the <a href="Ul%C3%BAa%20River">Ulúa</a>; many rivers across the <a href="Sula%20Valley">Sula Valley</a> had their banks destroyed, flooding much of <a href="San%20Pedro%20Sula">San Pedro Sula</a>—the country's second-largest city—and adjacent municipalities in the <a href="Cort%C3%A9s%20Department">Cortés Department</a>. The rising water prompted many residents to evacuate, and the <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Villeda%20Morales%20International%20Airport">Ramón Villeda Morales International Airport</a> halted all of its operations. The storm devastated <a href="Puerto%20Cort%C3%A9s">Puerto Cortés</a>, one of the most important port cities in Central America. Elsewhere in the Cortés Department, a river in <a href="Choloma">Choloma</a> overflowed and triggered widespread flooding; landslides in that area claimed the lives of six people.

In all, Gert wrought $10 million worth of damage to roads, bridges, and property. The country's agriculture was devastated, losing about of low-lying farmland with banana, sugar, and citrus crops. The disaster affected 67,447 people, of which roughly 60 percent had to evacuate from their homes. In its final public statement, the government of Honduras confirmed 27 deaths, though 12 missing persons remained unaccounted for.

While passing through Central America, Gert generated an increase in cloudiness and showers across <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>, with a maximum 15.35 in (390 mm) of rain recorded. Strong winds uprooted trees or snapped their limbs, damaging power lines and knocking out power. In one community, mudslides destroyed a major highway. The <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Grande%20de%20San%20Miguel">Río Grande de San Miguel</a> caused an excessive discharge of water just southwest of <a href="Usulut%C3%A1n">Usulután</a>, washing out about of crops from adjacent plantations. Several other areas faced significant losses from the flooding, including <a href="San%20Marcos%2C%20El%20Salvador">San Marcos</a> and <a href="San%20Vicente%2C%20El%20Salvador">San Vicente</a>; some property and road damage occurred in <a href="San%20Miguel%2C%20El%20Salvador">San Miguel</a>. Although fishing operations were suspended at the height the storm, four Salvadorean fishermen disappeared at sea. Overall, Gert affected nearly 8,000 residents and destroyed twelve homes in El Salvador; officials there confirmed five drowning deaths related to the storm.

In <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, torrential rains from Gert affected approximately 20,000 people and killed one girl. The agricultural sector in the country suffered substantial losses from the flooding, though there were no specific reports of material damage. Gert moved ashore near Belize City as a minimal tropical storm, dropping rainfall in coastal areas. Just offshore, a weather station on <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20Belize%23Southern%20groups">Hunting Caye</a> recorded 9.5 in (241 mm) during the event. Despite the rain, only minor flooding occurred in Belize City.

While crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, Gert dropped considerable rainfall in <a href="Quintana%20Roo">Quintana Roo</a>; a 24-hour accumulation of 7.4 in (188 mm) was recorded at <a href="Chetumal%2C%20Quintana%20Roo">Chetumal</a>, although higher localized totals of around 15 in (380 mm) fell elsewhere in the state. Gusty winds briefly buffeted the coast during the storm's landfall, with a maximum wind speed of 44 mph (70 km/h) recorded in Chetumal. The effects of the storm were limited to localized floods, however, which cut off one road to traffic and forced the inhabitants from low-lying areas in Chetumal and <a href="Felipe%20Carrillo%20Puerto%2C%20Quintana%20Roo">Felipe Carrillo Puerto</a> to evacuate to higher ground. Scattered showers also caused light flooding in parts of the state of <a href="Campeche">Campeche</a>, including <a href="Ciudad%20del%20Carmen">Ciudad del Carmen</a>.
Upon Gert's final landfall, high gales and waves battered wide stretches of coastline in the states of <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a> and Veracruz, though hurricane-force winds were largely confined to areas within the cyclone's southern <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eyewall</a>. Tuxpan, just south of where the eye moved ashore, recorded wind velocities of more than 100 mph (160 km/h), while 80 mph (130 km/h) gusts occurred farther south in <a href="Poza%20Rica%2C%20Veracruz">Poza Rica</a>. To the north, winds reached 55 mph (90 km/h) in <a href="Tampico%2C%20Tamaulipas">Tampico, Tamaulipas</a>. Despite the severity of the winds, the worst of Gert was due to <a href="orographic%20lift">orographic lift</a> when its broad circulation interacted with the eastern side of the Sierra Madre Oriental, generating extreme precipitation over much of the <a href="La%20Huasteca">Huasteca region</a>. As many as 31.41 in (798 mm) of rain were recorded in <a href="Aquism%C3%B3n">Aquismón</a>, <a href="San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD">San Luis Potosí</a>, while <a href="Tempoal">Tempoal</a> in Veracruz observed a 24-hour total of 13.35 in (339 mm) from the storm.

The first signs of damage were from high winds on September 20, which uprooted trees and tore off residential roofs in Tuxpan, <a href="Naranjos%20Amatl%C3%A1n">Naranjos</a>, <a href="Cerro%20Azul%2C%20Veracruz">Cerro Azul</a>, and Poza Rica. Following Gert's extreme rains, catastrophic flooding struck Mexico's Huasteca region over a period of several days, as many of its rivers rose to critical levels. In Veracruz, the imminent overflow of the <a href="Tempoal%20River">Tempoal</a>, <a href="Moctezuma%20River">Moctezuma</a>, and <a href="Calabozo%20River">Calabozo</a> rivers forced thousands of residents from the municipalities of <a href="Tempoal%20de%20S%C3%A1nchez%2C%20Veracruz">Tempoal</a>, <a href="El%20Higo%20%28municipality%29">El Higo</a>, and <a href="Plat%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez%20%28municipality%29">Platón Sánchez</a> to leave their homes. The Calabozo River eventually topped its banks, cutting the village of <a href="Plat%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez">Platón Sánchez</a> off from the outside world. By far the most devastating, however, was the overflow of the <a href="P%C3%A1nuco%20River">Pánuco River</a> on September 24, which runs from the <a href="Valley%20of%20Mexico">Valley of Mexico</a> through the municipality of <a href="P%C3%A1nuco%20Municipality%2C%20Veracruz">Pánuco</a> and empties in the gulf. Rushing water swept through 30 of <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Veracruz">Veracruz's 212 municipalities</a>, completely submerging more than 5,000 homes. El Higo bore the brunt of the flooding, with 90 percent of its residential area left under water.

After days of continued downpours in Gert's wake, the Pánuco River rose to 27.60 ft (8.72 m) above normal by September 27—its highest level in 40 years. Once again exceeding its banks, the river destroyed a major levee in city of <a href="P%C3%A1nuco%2C%20Veracruz">Pánuco</a>, forcing 8,000 residents to evacuate. Disastrous flooding reached as far north as southern Tamaulipas, where 5,000 people had to seek refuge. Half of Tampico was coated in deep layers of mud, with scores of structures demolished. The urban areas of <a href="Ciudad%20Madero">Madero</a> and <a href="Altamira%20Municipality%2C%20Tamaulipas">Altamira</a> were also hit by the deluge. Roughly of land around the Pánuco basin and Tampico were under water, including vast amounts of citrus, coffee, corn, maiz, bean, grain, and soy crops. Telephone, water, and electricity services throughout the region were severely disrupted, and numerous communities were isolated due to broken bridges and roads. In San Luis Potosí, water damage to schools, bridges, and roads was particularly widespread. The agricultural sector suffered heavy losses when the flooding washed away large amounts of livestock and roughly 80 percent of its crops. Throughout the state, 55,000 residents were affected by the storm, and 25 people lost their lives. Gert's trail of destruction extended as far inland as <a href="Hidalgo%20%28state%29">Hidalgo</a>, where 35 rivers overtopped their banks. Floods and mudslides destroyed 38 bridges and 86 roads, as well cutting off power, telephone, and water services, disrupting communication in 361 localities. Property damage in Hidalgo was significant; 4,425 homes, 121 schools, and 49 public buildings were compromised across 35 municipalities. About of farmland were destroyed in the storm. Fifteen deaths occurred in the state, and eight people sustained injuries.

Overall, Gert became the worst natural disaster to strike the region in 40 years; it displaced 203,500 people—many in need of shelter—and left 29,075 houses damaged or destroyed across Mexico. More than of crops were in ruins. Material damage totaled $156 million, and the death toll stood at 45.

Because of the storm's impact on the country, the government of Costa Rica declared a <a href="national%20emergency">national emergency</a> on September 16, 1993. Emergency crews were dispatched to assess the damage and distribute life supplies to the affected population, including 90,940 lbs (41,250 kg) of food, 1,422 mattresses, and 1,350 blankets. With much of the road network left disrupted across the affected regions, the country's agriculture, tourism, and commerce suffered considerable losses. In particular, the obstruction of the major <a href="Pan-American%20Highway%20%28North%20America%29">Pan-American Highway</a>, which connects the central region to the south of the country, had a discernible impact on the local economy. Following the expansive flooding of farmland, many independent crop producers were unable to partake in subsequent <a href="sowing">sowing</a>s.

Prior to Gert, a state of emergency had been in effect for Nicaragua as a result of Tropical Storm Bret. National and regional aid agencies, including the <a href="Nicaraguan%20Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>, accordingly extended their relief efforts with the passage of Gert. Following the widespread muddy floods, many rural areas along the coast where the storm made landfall necessitated purification of their water wells and reconstruction of those that had been destroyed. Although the government did not reappeal for international assistance, several cash donations were made by overseas organizations through a transfer channel at the <a href="Swiss%20Bank%20Corporation">Swiss Bank Corporation</a>. The <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> provided $50,000 for the purchase of fuel, and <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> distributed $25,000 worth of household supplies and medicine. The <a href="World%20Food%20Programme">World Food Programme</a> donated 160,000 lbs (72 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s) of food supplies and offered disaster expert services. The federal governments of Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, and Spain donated a combined $300,000 in aid.

On September 18, the President of Honduras declared a state of emergency for several municipalities after surveying the affected regions by helicopter. The governments of Japan, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom provided a combined $310,300 for the purchase of relief items. Although most storm victims received aid within a few days, the deteriorated road network caused a large delay in relief efforts to the hard-hit Mosquitia region. Sewage systems and waterworks countrywide were in serious need of restoration. With the destruction of its sole water reservoir, much of Puerto Cortés endured potable water shortages for months in Gert's wake. Public health concerns rose in the wake of Gert, with the cost of required medicines pinned at $208,000. A contamination of the water supplies in rural areas exacerbated a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> outbreak. By September 28, about 27,000 residents unable to reenter their flooded homes remained in government shelters. Seven weeks later, a temporary housing project was implemented for the 120 families most in need. Approximately 5,900 families across Honduras lost their source of income due to the storm.

In response to the flood disaster, the Red Cross immediately began distributing aid to victims across the Huasteca region. After assessing the situation by helicopter, the President of Mexico declared the Pánuco river basin an emergency zone and ordered <a href="search%20and%20rescue">search and rescue</a> missions. Many homes sustained irreparable damage to their roofs, leaving tens of thousands homeless. The government appealed for international aid, seeking clothes, food, and medical supplies. Five storage centers in Hidalgo provided more than 93 million lbs (42,000 tonnes) of food supplies. Throughout San Luis Potosí, 142,000 lbs (64 tonnes) of chicken, 45,000 pantries, and 76,000 disposable plates were distributed, as well as 50,440 blankets and 6,081 airbeds. Several schools served as shelters for the homeless; the sheltered elderly, children, and pregnant or nursing women received $27,000 worth of milk powder donations.

In the wake of Gert, the amount of respiratory disease and skin infection cases rose slightly, although the overall health situation for the country remained well under control. By two weeks after the hurricane, over 65,000 people across the region had been accommodated in the shelters; most of the sheltered stayed there until the floods receded, although many who returned home a month later continued to rely on relief provisions. A grant of $22,000 was made available for the purchase of roofing sheets for those in urgent need of home repair. The president approved $37.4 million for the reconstruction of roads and housing and the assistance of farmers throughout the region.

Monte Ne

Monte Ne is an area in the <a href="Ozarks">Ozark hills</a> of the <a href="White%20River%20%28Mississippi%20River%29">White River</a> valley east of <a href="Rogers%2C%20Arkansas">Rogers</a>, on the edge of <a href="Beaver%20Lake%20%28Arkansas%29">Beaver Lake</a>, in the US state of <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. From 1901 until the mid-1930s the area was a <a href="spa%20town">health resort</a> and ambitious <a href="planned%20community">planned community</a>. It was owned and operated by <a href="William%20Hope%20Harvey">William Hope Harvey</a>, a financial theorist and one-time <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201932">U.S. Presidential nominee</a>. Two of its hotels, "Missouri Row" and "Oklahoma Row", were the largest <a href="log%20building">log building</a>s in the world. Oklahoma Row's "tower section" is one of the earliest examples of a multi-story concrete structure. The tower is the only structure of Monte Ne still standing that can be seen at normal lake levels. Monte Ne introduced the first <a href="natatorium">indoor swimming pool</a> in Arkansas, and was also the site of the only <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20nominating%20convention">presidential convention</a> ever held in the state.

The Monte Ne resort was not a financial success, due in part to Harvey's failure to adequately manage the resort's funds. All ventures associated with Harvey's original Monte Ne concept either were never completed or experienced <a href="Bankruptcy%20in%20the%20United%20States">bankruptcy</a>, and shortly after his death in 1936, the property was sold off in lots. The remainder of the resort and town was almost completely submerged after Beaver Lake was created in 1964. All that remains today are foundations and one severely vandalized structure. The area on the edge of Beaver Lake that is still referred to as Monte Ne is owned and managed by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> and serves mainly as a <a href="boat%20ramp">boat ramp</a>.

The area that would become Monte Ne was known to have had two establishments often considered essential to a pioneer settlement, a <a href="grist%20mill">grist mill</a> and a <a href="distillery">distillery</a>. It is unknown when the distillery was built. It was owned in the 1830s by Abe McGarrah and his brother-in-law; they also operated a small store. The distillery's output each day was given as thirty gallons by the Federal whiskey gauger who resided in the area. The grist mill was built in 1856, and was owned by J.R. Pettigrew. It would later be owned by James Wyeth and Amelia Crowder Blake, the parents of Betty Blake, who is often referred to as the "Leading Lady" of Rogers, and who married entertainer <a href="Will%20Rogers">Will Rogers</a> in 1908. In 1875, the post office in the area changed its name from Mountain Springs to Pettigrew's Mill. The Blakes owned the mill until 1882, when James Blake died. The mill was later operated by David Portnell from 1889 to 1895. He sold his interest in the mill to a retired <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregational</a> minister J.G. Bailey. Bailey later became postmaster. He petitioned the <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">Post Office Department</a> to change the name of the office to Vinola, in honor of a well-known vineyard that belonged to his neighbor Carl A. Starek. The letter was written in longhand, and the o and l were spaced too close together. As a result, the clerk misread the name as "Vinda", which is how it was recorded. The area's name was later changed to Silver Springs. Bailey sold 325 acres of land and a cabin to Harvey.

Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William "Coin" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at <a href="Colorado%20Silver%20Boom">silver mining in Colorado</a>, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of <a href="Free%20Silver">free silver</a>. His most popular pamphlet, entitled "<a href="Coin%27s%20Financial%20School">Coin's Financial School</a>", was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">1896 presidential campaign</a> of <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201900">1900 campaign</a>. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.

After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day <a href="Rogers%2C%20Arkansas">Rogers</a>) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.

Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with <a href="Siloam%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Siloam Springs, Arkansas</a>. Harvey chose the name Monte Ne, which supposedly combined the Spanish and <a href="Omaha%20%28tribe%29">Omaha</a> Indian words for "mountain water", because it "fit the tongue attractively". Harvey was familiar with European health spas, and wanted to turn Monte Ne into a "watering hole" in the Ozarks. He first commissioned the dredging of a canal, and Silver Springs Creek was narrowed between Big Spring and Elixir Spring, which created Big Spring Lake. The Creek was then channeled to form what Harvey referred to as "the lagoon". <a href="Limestone">Limestone</a> retaining walls were built along the banks of the creeks and the lake, and along boardwalks and park areas. Monte Ne quickly became a popular spot for pleasure boating, picnics, and other outdoor activities. Many people noted how clear the water was. "The Rogers Democrat" said that it looked "like pure alcohol".

In December 1900, with US$52,000 of individual investors' money and $48,000 of his own, Harvey formed the Monte Ne Investment Company, which held the deeds to all of the land. The first hotel completed was the Hotel Monte Ne in April 1901, which opened in May. It was three stories high and had two wings 300 feet (91 m) long. Each room had a doorway to the outside, and the hotel was surrounded with wide porches. 

In April 1904, Harvey organized the Monte Ne Club House Hotel and Cottage Company with capital stock of $250,000. A. O. Clarke, from <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, served as architect and superintendent of the company. Harvey proposed to build five large hotels: a three-story main building called the Club House Hotel and four 300 to 450 foot (91 to 137 m) long "cottage rows", each to be named for a state bordering on Arkansas. Stock holders in the company received stock certificates that listed privileges such as transportation on the Monte Ne Railroad with 150 lb (68 kg) of baggage and a 25% discount for the stockholder and his family at the Hotel Monte Ne. Missouri Row, begun in August 1904, was the first hotel constructed. This Clarke-designed building was wide and long and built of 8,000 logs with a concrete floor and red tile roof. Fourteen thousand cubic feet (396 m³) of concrete were used. The tiles were shipped from <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. The center and two ends of the hotel rose to two stories, the remainder being a single story. Hotel Monte Ne and Missouri Row both featured porches long. The hotel had forty 16 feet square (4.9 metres square) rooms, each with a fireplace. Harvey employed area carpenters and stonemasons to build Missouri Row. In April 1905, to save time and money, the work schedule was changed from 9 to 10 hours per day and some wages were cut. Many workers went on strike, and when their demands were not met, they quit. The men formed a union, and although Harvey thought of himself as a friend to the working man, he viewed unions as another kind of monopoly or trust. The strike delayed construction, but by the end of May 1905, a full workforce was in place. In July, carpet, <a href="washstand">washstand</a>s and furniture, including iron-and-brass bedsteads, were installed in the rooms. Cannonballs and shells from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pea%20Ridge">Pea Ridge battlefield</a> were sunk into the concrete porch on either side of the main entrance. The hotel opened in September 1905 with room rates of $1 a day and $6 a week.

In February 1907, with nearly 300 new stockholders, Harvey began construction on his next hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built to the west of Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the dining room and center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.

In 1901, Harvey commissioned a theme song for Monte Ne. "Beautiful Monte Ne" was written by a Rogers local, Edward Wolfe, and copyrighted by Harvey in 1906. 

"Beautiful Monte Ne, God's gift to man they say"
"Health resort of all the world is beautiful Monte Ne"
"Rosy cheeks and purer blood they gain there day by day"
"in mountain air water rare at beautiful Monte Ne" 

Harvey needed a way to get people to Monte Ne. In 1900, there were few adequate roads, and automobiles were not yet practical. The natural solution seemed to be to build a railroad from <a href="Lowell%2C%20Arkansas">Lowell, Arkansas</a> to Monte Ne. The <a href="Arkansas%20Railroad%20Commission">Arkansas Railroad Commission</a> granted a charter on April 26, 1902, and the Monte Ne Railway Company was incorporated in May 1902, with a capital stock of $250,000. Besides Harvey, the company included: Carl A. Starck, P. G. Davidson, A. L. Williams, B. R. Davidson, J. H. McIlroy, J. W. Kimmons, F. F. Freeman, J. F. Felker, Robert H. Harven and Thomas W. Harvey (Coin's brother). Another of Harvey's brothers, a banker at <a href="Huntington%2C%20West%20Virginia">Huntington, West Virginia</a>, furnished $25,000. Of the 250 shares in the company, 240 were registered in Harvey's name. The five-mile (8 km) private railroad spur started at the Lowell transfer station. Fourteen thousand oak railway ties were laid running through Cross Hollows, south of Rogers, where two ravines met. It then passed through Limedale, terminating above Big Spring Lake at a log cabin depot with open-air waiting rooms. Harvey leased an engine, a tender, and a passenger coach from the <a href="Frisco%20Railroad">St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad</a>. The railway opened on June 19, 1902. Harvey imported a 50-foot (15 m) <a href="gondola">gondola</a> from <a href="Venice">Venice</a> in July 1901 to meet guests arriving by rail and carry them to the resort.

The gondola was a very popular attraction, and Harvey often promoted Monte Ne as: "the only place in America where the gondola meets the train."

The little railroad went broke a few years later. At about this time, the <a href="Arkansas%2C%20Oklahoma%20%26amp%3B%20Western%20Railroad">Arkansas, Oklahoma & Western Railroad</a> (AO&W) was forming. The railroad ran from Rogers to Siloam Springs, over a distance of approximately 30 miles (43 km). It was opened for traffic on New Year's Day 1908, connecting with the Frisco at Rogers and the <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Pittsburgh%20%26amp%3B%20Gulf%20Railroad">Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf</a> (P&G) at Siloam Springs. The AO&W planned to build eastward to <a href="Eureka%20Springs">Eureka Springs</a>. On December 1, 1909, the AO&W purchased the Monte Ne railroad. To connect the AO&W and the Monte Ne, a track would have to be laid from Hazelwood, Arkansas on the AO&W to Lowell; the Frisco line was in the way, and they would not allow a connection. The AO&W instead built an expensive underpass of the Frisco. The construction of the underpass enabled the Monte Ne line to turn over much of its outbound freight business to the AO&W rather than competitor Frisco. So the line enjoyed a brief but substantial volume of outgoing freight traffic from the <a href="Rogers%20White%20Lime%20Company">Rogers White Lime Company</a> located at <a href="Limedale%2C%20Arkansas">Limedale</a>. The underpass still exists and is still crossed by trains of Frisco Central Division successor <a href="Arkansas%20and%20Missouri%20Railroad">Arkansas and Missouri Railroad</a>.

The AO&W went bankrupt a few years later and was bought by another startup railroad, the <a href="Kansas%20City%20%26amp%3B%20Memphis%20Railroad">Kansas City & Memphis Railroad</a> (KC&M) in early 1911. It would build from <a href="Cave%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Cave Springs</a>, a few miles west of Rogers, through <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20Arkansas">Fayetteville</a> and towards <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. In 1912 the <a href="Ozark%20Land%20and%20Lumber%20Company">Ozark Land and Lumber Company</a> began construction of a 5-mile extension east of Monte Ne from the <a href="White%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">White River</a> to the Piney community and leased the line to the KC&M. The White River bridge consisted of 780 feet of trestle and 2,152 foot steel spans, making it the longest railroad bridge in <a href="Benton%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Benton County</a>. This extension was used to haul out forestry products. The KC&M entered receivership in 1914, and in September of that year passenger service to Monte Ne ended. When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, many railroads were seized by the United States government. The KC&M was not seized, and due to unfavorable rulings by the <a href="United%20States%20Railroad%20Administration">United States Railroad Administration</a> and Arkansas Railroad Commission saw much of its revenue evaporate. In January 1918 <a href="Roscoe%20Hobbs">Roscoe Hobbs</a>, one of the court-appointed receivers of the KC&M, went to Washington, D.C. to provide testimony to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Commerce%2C%20Science%20and%20Transportation">Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce</a> on the effects of these decisions on small railroads. As part of that testimony Hobbs reported 215 cars from the Rogers White Lime Company and 216 cars of pit props and railroad ties being hauled on the Monte Ne portion of the railway in 1917. Hobbs was unsuccessful in having the decisions reversed, and most portions of the KC&M were abandoned by October 1918. The Monte Ne portion was used until 1919. The White River bridge survived longer and was used for horse and foot traffic before becoming unsafe. The steel spans were scrapped during World War II.

In August 1901, Harvey's son Hal and brother-in-law Ernest Halliday opened a large bathhouse on Silver Springs Creek, across the lagoon from Hotel Monte Ne. The indoor pool was the first in Arkansas. It was 25 by 50 ft (7.6 by 15 m) and deep and included springboards and slides. Water from the spring flowed into the swimming pool, half of which was sectioned off and featured heated water piped in from a wood-fired boiler. The bathhouse also had a two-lane bowling alley. The pool continued to be a popular attraction throughout the life of Monte Ne until the opening of an outdoor pool in <a href="Willola%2C%20Arkansas">Willola</a> in 1923.

In April, Harvey began seeking industries to move to Monte Ne, but few actually did. Monte Ne's small downtown area had at one time a <a href="general%20store">general store</a>, a <a href="livery%20stable">livery stable</a>, a <a href="gristmill">gristmill</a>, and a <a href="post%20office">post office</a>. The general store also served as a host for school plays and as a <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a>.

Harvey issued his own money, or <a href="scrip">scrip</a>, which was accepted and used as cash in and around Monte Ne. Scrip was a way of financing his mercantile without requiring operating capital. Harvey would purchase items with the scrip and promised to redeem it within 30 days. If the item did not sell, the scrip had no value. Also in downtown was the Bank of Monte Ne. It was organized by Harvey in 1905 and the building was designed, like many buildings in Monte Ne, by A. O. Clarke. The two-story, 50 by 70 ft (15 by 21 m) building (usually referred to as the "Bank Block") included the bank and a store room on the main floor, as well as a lodge room and offices on the second floor. The building was across the street from the post office. The Interstate Bankers' Summer Club held their 1906 meeting there and the local <a href="Odd%20Fellows">Odd Fellows</a> lodge were among the groups who used the upstairs offices. Harvey sold stock in the bank for $15 a share. The bank lasted until 1914. Depositors and lenders were paid off and any other funds were transferred to a bank in Rogers.

To help attract tourists, Harvey often brought in musicians and hosted dances and other events to give Monte Ne a constant festive atmosphere. He used the "Monte Ne Herald", run by his son Tom, to promote these events. The newspaper only lasted until 1905, probably due to financial troubles and Harvey's publication of personal attacks. There were sporting events in Monte Ne such as tennis, croquet, and fox hunting. Monte Ne also had the first golf course, which was built sometime before 1909. Harvey's difficult-to-please nature often ended up driving away more people than it attracted. Harvey had a lights-out at 10 p.m. policy, and would cut the main electricity to the town if the policy was disobeyed, prompting disgruntled guests to leave prematurely. He was also criticized for holding events on Sunday and for banning children and people who were ill from the resort.

After the Monte Ne Railroad failed, Harvey needed to find other ways for people to get to his resort. He realized the coming importance of the automobile, and in 1911 he campaigned for a project he called "The Great White Way", a turnpike between Monte Ne and <a href="Muskogee%2C%20Oklahoma">Muskogee, Oklahoma</a>. Harvey Requested that a "Good Roads" meeting be held by the Commercial Club of Rogers; however, they did not feel that it was their meeting because, while fairly well attended, hardly any Rogers businessmen were present. Harvey assessed the project would cost Rogers $5,000 without their permission or consent, and this estimate was far less than what engineers advising the Rogers businessmen believed the cost would be. Ultimately the "Great White Way" project failed, and Harvey blamed the community of Rogers for lack of support.

In 1913 he spearhead the founding of <a href="The%20Ozark%20Trails%20Association">The Ozark Trails Association</a> (OTA) to promote the building and education of quality highway design, but not actually building or funding them. At first, he was only interested in bringing people to Monte Ne, he stated: "My Personal interest in the Ozark Trails is that they all lead to Monte Ne" However, he seems to have taken on a more egalitarian opinion of the Ozark Trails as time went on because he later said: "My inclination runs toward doing something of a progressive nature that will promote the collective good, and I have now concentrated all that inclination on carrying out a system of roads known as the Ozark Trails." The Ozark Trails Association became Harvey's most successful endeavor. Interest in the project spread, and membership swelled to 7,000 delegates from states as far away as New Mexico. The group built large obelisks, listing the names of the benefactors, along the routes and trails that it sponsored. He even ran for Congress on a platform of building a national highway system, but lost to <a href="John%20W.%20Tillman">John W. Tillman</a> who had strong support in <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Washington County</a>.

Interest in the group began to waver noticeably when Harvey finally stepped down as president at a 1920 convention in <a href="Pittsburg%2C%20Kansas">Pittsburg, Kansas</a> that was attended by only 200 delegates. By the mid-1920s, highways and roads had become completely government-funded and there was no longer a need for local sponsorship. The group's system of giving them historic names and those of contributors had also become confusing and inefficient because of the myriad names and disputes over different names for the same stretch of roadway, so the <a href="U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Public%20Roads">U.S. Bureau of Public Roads</a> (BPR) changed all the roadways' names to uniform numbers, despite fierce protest from the OTA. The group had lost its relevance and disbanded in 1924, but many of the roads they helped develop became part of the historic <a href="U.S.%20Route%2066">U.S. Route 66</a>.

Another group, with no affiliation but with the same name, was created in the early 1970s to promote the maintenance of recreational trails in the Ozarks.

By 1910, Harvey was facing serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal had died in 1903 and was interred in a mausoleum in Monte Ne. His other son, Tom, had left in 1908 never to return. The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> failed to find a place for him in the new <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the <a href="Arkansas%27s%203rd%20congressional%20district">Third Congressional District</a> of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also gone out of business. Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning that the end of civilization was at hand. In February 1920, he published "Common Sense", in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future in the form of a <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a>.
Harvey did some deep research into the history of the Ozark Mountains. He claimed that they were some of the oldest mountains in the world and definitely the oldest in the United States. They had been untouched by <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es and <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s. He believed that the mountains around Monte Ne would eventually crumble and fill the valley with silt and sediment. Figuring that the mountains were approximately high, Harvey planned to construct a massive concrete obelisk, and its <a href="coping%20%28architecture%29">capstone</a> would remain above the debris. Archaeologists in the distant future would be able to dig down and find the monument. He called the project "The Pyramid", and dedicated the rest of his life to its construction.

The first part of the obelisk would be 40 ft² (12 m²) square and high. It then would reduce to 32 ft² (9 m²) square and rise . The next segment would be 22 ft² (6 m²) and would rise to become 6 ft² (1.8 m²) at the top. The total height would be . In the pedestal there would be 300 ft² (91 m²) of floor space. Harvey's books, explaining 20th-century civilization, as well as a world <a href="globe">globe</a>, a <a href="bible">bible</a>, <a href="encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>s, and newspapers, were to be placed inside two vaults and hermetically sealed in glass. Harvey also wanted to place in this large room: "numerous small items now used in domestic and industrial life, from the size of a needle and safety pin up to a <a href="Victrola">Victrola</a>." It was estimated that the construction would use 16,000 bags of cement, 30,000 ft³ (850 m³) of sand, 58,000 ft³ (1,642 m³) of gravel, and tons of corrugated steel reinforcement. The <a href="Portland%20Cement%20Association">Portland Cement Association</a> donated the service of one of its experts, who pronounced that the Pyramid would not deteriorate or suffer from erosion and would last for over a million years. To prevent water in the valley from interfering with the foundation and to shore up the low knoll to support the heavy Pyramid, Harvey constructed a long retaining wall of stone and concrete.

He also built a roughly semi-circular, terraced amphitheater at the foundation of the Pyramid which he called the "foyer". He intended to rent this out and use the revenue for the pyramid project. The land for the amphitheater was first dug in late 1923, and construction continued off and on for the next five years whenever financing, building materials, and labor were available. Unlike other Monte Ne building projects designed by architect A. O. Clark, the amphitheater apparently had no architectural input and was not built according to blueprints or a single design. Those who worked with Harvey noted that he seemed to just "work it out in his mind from day to day". The result was a unique structure, irregular in formation, with seating capacity for anywhere from 500 to 1,000. The amphitheater averaged high and long. In the middle of the amphitheater was a small island with two concrete chairs and a concrete couch, intended for an orchestra to play or a speaker to make a presentation. Harvey dedicated the amphitheater before 500 people in 1928.

Following the Egyptian mania that gripped the country after the discovery of <a href="King%20Tut">King Tut</a>'s tomb in 1922, Harvey's Pyramid project sparked a lot of interest and was widely reported throughout the U.S. Tens of thousands of people came to Monte Ne during the 1920s to see its progress. Harvey continued to raise funds from events held at the amphitheater, such as conventions.

Harvey moved his office to his cottage next to the amphitheater, as work continued on the Pyramid. In January 1929, Harvey, along with Lowell and H. L. Hardin of Kansas City, incorporated the project creating The Pyramid Association. The association was to fulfill Harvey's Pyramid plans in the event of his death. The estimated cost of the Pyramid itself was $75,000, but Harvey exhausted his funds on construction of the amphitheater. The <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">stock market crash of 1929</a> ended all construction. In a last-ditch effort to save the project, Harvey sent letters to wealthy men asking for funds to complete the project. In his letters he explained that civilization was dying and that only rich men, like the intended readers, could save it, if they could send money for his pyramid. Despite the fact that Harvey claimed his correspondence was "the most important letter ever written" he received no replies and the pyramid was never built. All that remains of the project is a retaining wall and the amphitheater that are under the waters of Beaver Lake most of the time.

As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were <a href="foreclosure">foreclosed</a> and sold at <a href="public%20auction">public auction</a>. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.

After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.

Harvey returned to politics after the <a href="1929%20stock%20market%20crash">1929 stock market crash</a> and the beginning of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. He decided to run for the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidency</a>. He formed the <a href="Liberty%20Party%20%281930s%29">Liberty Party</a> and held their national convention at Monte Ne. It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas. Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates, media facilities, upgraded roads, and food concessions, anticipating 10,000 delegates. He tented the amphitheater, set up seating, and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside. Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey's newest book "The Book", which dealt with the harmful effects of <a href="usury">usury</a> by the government. In the end only 786 delegates attended, and Harvey was the only candidate the delegates could agree on. They nominated <a href="Andrae%20Nordskog">Andrae Nordskog</a> of Los Angeles for <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a>. The Liberty Party ended up merging with the Jobless Party, and Harvey ran for president as an independent; however, he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election. Regardless, <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> won the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201932">1932 presidential election</a>, and Harvey only drew 800 votes.

Harvey continued to publish his newsletter, "The Liberty Bell", and sold his books as his health and eyesight continued to fail. On February 11, 1936, he died at Monte Ne due to <a href="peritonitis">peritonitis</a> after an attack of <a href="stomach%20flu">intestinal influenza</a>. The tomb made to house his son in 1903 was blasted open, and Harvey's simple cheap pine casket and that of his son were placed in a glass casket filled with copies of Harvey's books and some of his other papers. The tomb was then resealed. A small funeral was held on February 14, and a small plaque bearing the names and dates of the two Harveys was posted.

He died with a balance of $138, debt of $3000 and no will. The courts decided that the property that was still deeded to the Pyramid foundation belonged to his widow, May, who sold it before moving to <a href="Springfield%2C%20Missouri">Springfield, Missouri</a>, never to return. She died in 1948.

The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced <a href="poultry">poultry</a> equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.

In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to <a href="Springdale%2C%20Arkansas">Springdale</a> businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a> law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.

Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the <a href="Maurice%20Maeterlinck">Maurice Maeterlinck</a> play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after <a href="Greek%20Mythology">Greek goddesses</a>, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building. In 1955 Dallas Barrack, a Springdale antique dealer, bought Oklahoma Row, and renovated it into an antique store called the Palace Art Galleries. He was to have carried "some of the finest antiques in the area" and believed that "the splendor of the old hotel only adds to their value".

A Baptist church was organized at Monte Ne under the sponsorship of the <a href="Benton%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Benton County</a> <a href="Baptist%20Church">Baptist</a> Association as a result of a series of revival meetings conducted there. The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active. For a time in the summer of 1946, the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances (old Hotel Monte Ne). Although it was not as active as it once was, the old filling station and store in downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population.

The Monte Ne Inn, two to three miles (3 to 5 km) away from where the resort was on <a href="Arkansas%20Highway%2094">Highway 94</a>, opened in 1972 and is still in business.

In 1948, W.T. McWhorter purchased Harvey's former log home and office and the amphitheater nearby, and turned it into a restaurant serving chicken, steak, and fish. There was also a concession stand at the amphitheater that operated until 1957, selling drinks, candy, souvenirs, and pamphlets about Harvey.

In January 1957, the "<a href="Tulsa%20Daily%20World">Tulsa Daily World</a>" reported that 30,000 tourists visited Monte Ne annually to see Harvey's now deteriorating dream. The Arkansas State Historical Society held its 1960 annual meeting at Monte Ne and gathered at the amphitheater to hear Clara Kennan, a Rogers native and school teacher who had been fascinated by Monte Ne her whole life, give a talk on Harvey and his Pyramid project. Her oral history and interviews provide some of the best information on Harvey and Monte Ne.

Discussion of damming the <a href="White%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">White River</a> for flood control began in the 1930s, and the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> (CoE) held hearings on building a dam in January 1946. The new dam would create a lake 50 miles (80 km) long, and one arm would extend to Monte Ne. Work on Beaver Dam began in 1960 as the CoE impounded and bought land around the White River. In July 1962, Mary Powell sold Camp Joyzelle to the CoE, and W. T. McWhorten sold his land as well.

The Federal Government required that all cemeteries and burial grounds be moved. This included the Harvey tomb, and it was no easy task. In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40-ton tomb and one to move it. The first attempt broke a flatbed truck. Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in. A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey's tomb. The tomb was placed on the crest of a hill donated by Harvey's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Doescher. Today, the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake. Relocation of the aging tomb put pressure on it, causing it to crack.

The CoE mistakenly believed that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover the area of the large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been at the base of the amphitheater. They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate the lawns of their Town and Country restaurant and motel. The chairs are still located in Rogers; however, they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance. The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater, because no one wanted to try to move it.

For years, stories circulated of a treasure being buried within the amphitheater. W. T. McWhorter was determined to find out if it was true, so he planned to dynamite the amphitheater on the day he was to transfer the deed to the CoE. Spectators attended the planned explosion, but it was stopped just in time by CoE attorney David Waid.

The dam was completed, and Beaver Lake was at full height by June 1966. For all intents and purposes, Harvey's Monte Ne was gone. However, in times of drought, some of the structures become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27 feet (8 m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible for the first time in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.

In 2006, the waters of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100 feet (335 m). This generated a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted to the edge of the lake to explore the remains. The upper part of the amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake.

The flooded Monte Ne has become a site of interest for <a href="scuba%20diver">scuba diver</a>s who dive by the amphitheater to get a look at the submerged structure. The water is moderately clear and temperatures comfortable.

A log portion of the original Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits on the east side of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the <a href="suite%20%28hotel%29">honeymoon suite</a>. Monte Ne was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with <a href="spray%20paint">spray paint</a> and <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.

All that is left of Missouri Row is a four-sided concrete fireplace surrounded by pieces of foundation, a few sets of stairs, metal plumbing, and a retaining wall. East of that, surrounding what is now the Monte Ne boat launch, are remnants of limestone structures. Some of these are foundations from the broad wooden staircase built in front of Hotel Monte Ne; some are structural components for the twin stone bridges that crossed the lagoon and some are simply low retaining walls. The amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the Pyramid are underwater. Occasionally, when water levels drop in summer, they can be seen.

A few of the roads surrounding the area that was Monte Ne on the edge of Beaver Lake have names reflecting what once was there. <a href="Arkansas%20Highway%2094">Highway 94</a>, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and is a few hundred feet from where the Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.

Hurricane Emily (1993)

Hurricane Emily in 1993 caused record flooding in the <a href="Outer%20Banks">Outer Banks</a> of North Carolina while remaining just offshore. The fifth <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a> and the first yet strongest hurricane of the <a href="1993%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">year's hurricane season</a>, Emily developed from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> northeast of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> on August 22. It moved northwestward and strengthened into a <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a> on August 25, after becoming nearly stationary southeast of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. Emily then curved to the southwest but quickly resumed its northwest trajectory while strengthening into a hurricane. Late on August 31, the hurricane reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) on its approach to North Carolina. Although part of the <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> passed over <a href="Hatteras%20Island">Hatteras Island</a> in the Outer Banks, its absolute center remained 23 mi (37 km/h) offshore. Gradually weakening, the hurricane swerved away from the coast toward the northeast and later east. Emily stalled again, this time northeast of Bermuda, and dissipated on September 6 to the southeast of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>.

The threat of Emily prompted <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">hurricane warnings</a> for much of the North Carolina coast and northward through <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>. A mandatory evacuation for <a href="Ocracoke%20Island">Ocracoke</a> and Hatteras islands displaced 160,000 people during the busy <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a> weekend; the loss in tourism revenue amounted to $10 million (1993 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). About 1,600 residents on these islands rode out the storm in their homes, and emergency officials stayed behind. Most of the evacuees went to hotels or stayed with friends or relatives, causing an increase in business across southeastern Virginia, where effects were minimal. Due to uncertainty in forecasting Emily's path, there were also evacuations from the coasts of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, Delaware, and <a href="Fire%20Island">Fire Island</a> in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>.

While bypassing the Outer Banks, Emily produced strong winds that coincided with high tides during a full moon, causing severe flooding along the <a href="Pamlico%20Sound">Pamlico Sound</a>. In <a href="Buxton%2C%20North%20Carolina">Buxton</a>, the floods left behind water marks as high as , and the entire villages of <a href="Avon%2C%20North%20Carolina">Avon</a> and <a href="Hatteras%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hatteras</a> were inundated. The storm downed thousands of trees and wrecked 553 homes—168 of which completely destroyed—leaving a quarter of the Cape Hatteras population homeless. Structural damage in North Carolina was estimated at $35 million. Along the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia, three swimmers drowned as a result of Emily.

Hurricane Emily originated from an African <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> that passed through the <a href="Cape%20Verde%20Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a> on August 17, 1993. The wave traversed the <a href="tropical%20Atlantic">tropical Atlantic</a> and <a href="Tropical%20cyclogenesis">developed</a> a closed cyclonic circulation five days later about east-northeast of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, when the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) classified it as a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a>. Moving northwestward, the depression remained poorly organized for several days, with an ill-defined circulation center and sporadic thunderstorms, in part due to unfavorable <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> from an <a href="Upper%20tropospheric%20cyclonic%20vortex">upper-level low</a> to its north. On August 25, the depression became nearly stationary in response to weakening <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Environmental%20steering">steering currents</a>. As the upper environment turned less hostile to development, a <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">reconnaissance aircraft</a> found unusually high <a href="Maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained winds</a>—an indication that the cyclone had quickly strengthened into a strong <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a>. The NHC named the storm Emily and upgraded it to a hurricane the following day, based on reports of 75 mph (120 km/h) winds from a second reconnaissance mission.

Upon becoming a hurricane, Emily was centered roughly 1,000 mi (1,600 km) east of the <a href="Florida">Florida</a> peninsula, passing well south of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. A <a href="Ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge of high pressure</a> began to mature to its north, forcing the hurricane westward on August 27. Emily's winds vacillated between tropical storm and hurricane force over the course of the day, although the cyclone resumed its strengthening by August 28 upon developing favorable upper-level <a href="Outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a>. Traversing warm <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s, the hurricane continued to improve in appearance on <a href="Weather%20satellite">satellite images</a>, and the <a href="Atmospheric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> within its <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> steadily decreased. Emily retraced toward the northwest on August 29, when a <a href="Shortwave%20%28meteorology%29">shortwave trough</a> eroded the southern periphery of the contiguous ridge. The NHC expressed uncertainty in forecasting Emily's track, stating that <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, and <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a> were at risk of a direct hit from the hurricane. As high pressure re-established itself off the North Carolina coast, Emily briefly turned west-northwestward on August 30 before initiating a prolonged curve toward the north. By that time, the NHC forecast Emily to remain offshore, though one <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20forecast%20model">tropical cyclone forecast model</a> projected that the hurricane would move inland.

Early on August 31, a reconnaissance flight indicated that Emily had become a Category 2 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir–Simpson scale</a>, and further intensification was expected because of warm waters. Later that day, reconnaissance reported that Emily had achieved a peak intensity of , a Category 3 <a href="major%20hurricane">major hurricane</a>; the aircraft also observed flight-level winds of . At its peak, the center of the hurricane was located 23 mi (37 km) east of <a href="Hatteras%20Island">Hatteras Island</a> while turning northward. Its eye measured 45 mi (75 km) in diameter, and a portion moved over Hatteras and the <a href="Pamlico%20Sound">Pamlico Sound</a>, constituting a direct hit but not a <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a>. After affecting the Outer Banks, Emily continued around the large high-pressure area, turning northeastward into an area with cooler ocean temperatures. The eye nonetheless remained distinct, and Emily maintained much of its intensity through September 2. Later that day, the hurricane turned sharply eastward in response to a trough nearby. Wind shear over the region increased, weakening Emily as its eye feature quickly dissipated. Emily turned to the southeast and diminished to a tropical storm on September 3, about 500 mi (800 km) northeast of Bermuda, with a significant deterioration of the convection. Once again becoming nearly stationary, Emily further weakened to a tropical depression late on September 4, after only a small area of thunderstorms remained near the center. It accelerated toward the northeast and became <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> on September 6, dissipating shortly thereafter.

The NHC forecasts for Emily were generally accurate. On August 29, two days before the storm's closest approach, the NHC issued a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">hurricane watch</a> from <a href="Cape%20Romain%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Cape Romain, South Carolina</a>, to <a href="Fenwick%20Island%2C%20Delaware">Fenwick Island, Delaware</a>, including the Albemarle and Pamlico sounds of North Carolina as well as the Chesapeake Bay south of the <a href="Patuxent%20River">Patuxent River</a>. The next day, the watch was discontinued south of <a href="Little%20River%2C%20South%20Carolina">Little River, South Carolina</a>. A hurricane warning was issued from <a href="Bogue%20Banks">Bogue Inlet</a> to the border of North Carolina and Virginia on August 30, and was extended a day later to <a href="Cape%20Henlopen">Cape Henlopen</a>, Delaware. The watches and warnings were canceled as Emily turned out to sea.

During the week when Emily approached shore, the North Carolina government was scheduled to have a two-day emergency management exercise involving a hurricane strike; the storm caused the exercise to be postponed. On August 29, a voluntary evacuation was issued for the Outer Banks, and within 36 hours of the storm's approach, a mandatory evacuation was issued for <a href="Ocracoke%2C%20North%20Carolina">Ocracoke</a> and Hatteras Island. A total of 160,000 people (mostly tourists) evacuated from the Outer Banks, representing about 90% of the population there. The evacuation was completed within 12 hours, expedited by highway patrol and making <a href="U.S.%20Route%20158">U.S. Route 158</a> and the <a href="Wright%20Memorial%20Bridge">Wright Memorial Bridge</a> only one direction, away from the coast. About 1,000 residents on Hatteras Island and another 600 on Ocracoke rode out the storm in their homes. The <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> evacuated personnel to the mainland, leaving behind a skeleton crew to maintain their facilities. The National Park Service closed the campground on Ocracoke two days before the storm. Several towns in southeastern North Carolina were also evacuated, and schools closed across the region.

Because of the uncertainty in forecasting when and if Emily would make its northeast turn, <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">Virginia Governor</a> <a href="Douglas%20Wilder">Douglas Wilder</a> declared a state of emergency and put the <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a> on alert. In Virginia Beach, residents of seaside homes and low-lying areas were recommended to evacuate, while a mandatory evacuation was ordered for <a href="Tangier%2C%20Virginia">Tangier Island</a> in the Chesapeake Bay. Residents in mobile homes and on campgrounds were also advised to seek shelter. At least 750 people left their homes, 711 of whom resided in storm shelters. The <a href="Norfolk%20International%20Airport">Norfolk International Airport</a> was closed for 13 hours, and rail service was suspended. To the north, officials in <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ocean City, Maryland</a>, declared a phase-one emergency ahead of the storm; beaches were closed, and tourists were recommended to leave. About 100,000 people evacuated from the coast of Maryland; 3,600 stayed in storm shelters. In Delaware, 892 people used storm shelters after voluntarily evacuating. Beaches in New Jersey closed due to threatening waves. About 20,000 people also evacuated from <a href="Fire%20Island">Fire Island</a>, New York. Across the Atlantic coast, 33 emergency shelters were opened in response to Emily, though most evacuees instead relied on hotels or the homes of friends and relatives to ride out the storm.

The <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) assisted in coordinating preparations for Emily. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a> sent power equipment, previously used during the <a href="Great%20Flood%20of%201993">Great Flood of 1993</a>, to <a href="Fort%20Bragg">Fort Bragg</a>, while the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> stockpiled food in risk zones. Power companies deliberately shut off the power in the Outer Banks to reduce damage to the system and mitigate the risk of electrocutions. At <a href="Naval%20Station%20Norfolk">Naval Station Norfolk</a>, 28 ships sailed out to sea to ride out the storm; aircraft were evacuated, and nonessential personnel were sent home. The North Carolina government announced ahead of the storm that it would not create a State Disaster Fund, instead relying on private relief organizations such as the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> and the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a>. The state's park service pre-positioned 60 members with chainsaws to help clear downed trees. Because Emily hit during the busy <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a> weekend, the tourism industry suffered about $10 million in business losses. Many of the evacuees relocated to southeastern Virginia, which saw greatly increased business during the weekend.

As Emily approached the Outer Banks of North Carolina, <a href="Diamond%20Shoal%20Light">Diamond Shoal Light</a> off Cape Hatteras recorded 2-minute sustained winds of 99 mph (159 km/h), along with gusts of 147 mph (237 km/h). Closer to shore, surface winds reached 115 mph (185 km/h) in the Pamlico Sound. The <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> in <a href="Buxton%2C%20North%20Carolina">Buxton</a> reported sustained winds of 60 mph (96 km/h), with gusts to , before the wind recording instrument failed due to water intrusion. A reliable but unofficial wind station at a commercial building reported a gust of . These high winds lasted for several hours due to the storm's slow movement. There were two possible tornadoes in the Outer Banks region. On the south side of Hatteras Island, the storm coincided with high tides, producing a peak <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> of in Buxton. Large waves caused moderate beach erosion, comparable to that of a winter storm. The heaviest rainfall related to Emily occurred over the Outer Banks, where a peak total of was recorded in Buxton. Minimal rain fell farther inland, with only reported at Gum Neck in mainland <a href="Tyrrell%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Tyrrell County</a>.

Overall damage from the storm was lighter than expected, largely confined to the barrier islands of <a href="Dare%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Dare</a> and <a href="Hyde%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hyde</a> counties. Severe flooding from the storm affected a stretch of the Hatteras Island. Coinciding with , the hurricane's winds pushed water from the Pamlico Sound to the south, lowering levels along the mainland and inundating the barrier islands; surge flooding was minor on the ocean side. At <a href="Frisco%2C%20North%20Carolina">Frisco</a> and <a href="Hatteras%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hatteras</a>, water levels along the Pamlico Sound reached above normal—their highest in the 20th century, surpassing those in <a href="Hurricane%20Gloria">Hurricane Gloria</a> eight years prior. These water levels may have been the highest in the region since the <a href="1899%20San%20Ciriaco%20hurricane">1899 San Ciriaco hurricane</a>. In Buxton, the waters rose per hour at one point, leaving behind flood marks as high as . The entire villages of <a href="Avon%2C%20North%20Carolina">Avon</a> and Hatteras were inundated. Only the highest dunes along the <a href="Cape%20Hatteras%20National%20Seashore">Cape Hatteras National Seashore</a> remained dry, and a section of dunes just north of Buxton was nearly breached. The waters— higher than the predicted <a href="Return%20period">100-year flood</a>—broke through windows and entered houses; some residents who did not exit their homes had to ride out the storm in their attics to escape the flooding. Officials at the Dare County Emergency Operations Center evacuated due to intrusion of floodwaters. The Cape Hatteras National Weather Service office was flooded for the first time since its inception in 1957, and sustained damage to its rain chart and an antenna. Many boats in <a href="marina">marina</a>s were wrecked, and hundreds of cars floated away from parking lots or streets; flooded police cars had their emergency lights activated after the wires were damaged. Farther south, impact from the storm was limited on Ocracoke Island.

Emily's winds destroyed several roofs and knocked down thousands of trees and power lines, with many signs and sheds damaged. All towns south of the <a href="Oregon%20Inlet%23Herbert%20C.%20Bonner%20Bridge">Bonner Bridge</a> were without power, affecting at least 1,500 people, and Buxton lost water supply after the main water line was damaged. The combination of strong winds and floods left 553 homes uninhabitable in the Outer Banks, with 168 houses completely destroyed, including three that were washed away. Six of the destroyed homes were owned by the Coast Guard. The heaviest damage was largely in older homes or structures not up to <a href="Building%20code">code</a>. About 25% of the Hatteras population was left homeless. The Cape Hatteras School sustained about $3.1 million in damage, after flooding deep destroyed computers and textbooks. Tidal floods, sand, and debris forced authorities to close <a href="North%20Carolina%20Highway%2012">Highway 12</a>. Traffic lights along the route were damaged, and downed trees blocked the road in two areas. Sinkholes, some the size of three cars, developed along the route. Throughout North Carolina, damage from the storm was estimated at $35 million, mostly on Hatteras Island and chiefly to the south of Avon. Rough surf killed two people in <a href="Nags%20Head%2C%20North%20Carolina">Nags Head</a>, despite the beach being closed to swimming, and one person suffered injuries while escaping a flooded home.

Outside of North Carolina, Emily produced gusts of 37 mph (59 km) at the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay%20Bridge%E2%80%93Tunnel">Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel</a>. To the north of the storm, Ocean City, Maryland, measured of precipitation. Above-normal tides were reported as far south as <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>; high tides also spread farther north, with a storm surge of at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel and in <a href="Lewes%2C%20Delaware">Lewes, Delaware</a>.

High waves caused beach erosion northward through Virginia. At <a href="Virginia%20Beach%2C%20Virginia">Virginia Beach</a>, the waves led to minor flooding along the <a href="Sandbridge%2C%20Virginia%20Beach%2C%20Virginia">Sandbridge</a> section; rough surf and a strong <a href="Undertow%20%28water%20waves%29">undertow</a> drowned one swimmer there. The storm triggered statewide power outages that affected about 5,000 residents, as well as the <a href="Hampton%20Roads%20Bridge%E2%80%93Tunnel">Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel</a>. In <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News</a>, lightning set a roof on fire in the <a href="Lee%20Hall%2C%20Virginia">Lee Hall</a> section of the city. Emily's light rains in the area were not enough to break a prolonged drought that plagued Virginia. Rough seas and high tides later caused coastal flooding along Fire Island in New York.

As Emily's winds eased over land, various assessment teams left Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to determine the extent of damage. FEMA informed the <a href="United%20States%20congressional%20delegations%20from%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina congressional delegation</a> about the storm's threat to their constituents. The agency later received compliments for their timely preparations for storm-related operations. All airports on the Outer Banks were reopened by September 1. In response to the extensive scale of the power outages, power companies flew a helicopter over the region to assess the damage. The power was expected to be out for two weeks. Six emergency vehicles were sent to Dare County to provide drinking water.

On September 3, <a href="Governor%20of%20North%20Carolina">Governor</a> <a href="Jim%20Hunt">Jim Hunt</a> declared a state of disaster for North Carolina, while <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> declared Dare County a disaster area a week later. This allowed residents there to apply for federal assistance, as well as local governments to request aid to rebuild public buildings. Operating out of Avon, FEMA distributed about $1 million in housing assistance to 444 people and provided $400,000 in individual grants to 153 applicants. The <a href="Small%20Business%20Administration">Small Business Administration</a> received 812 applications for small business loans.

Shelters closed by September 1 and residents returned to their homes, although Hatteras Island remained off-limits to everyone but emergency workers for several days. Unemployment across Hatteras rose in the wake of the damage to local businesses, and many restaurants lost product when their refrigerators failed during the power outages. Residents piled debris from their damaged homes on roads, primarily Highway 12, and workers responded by clearing the debris. The highway was speedily reopened and repaired at a cost of around $1 million. Within two weeks of the storm, businesses resumed as cleaning work was under way, and the island was reopened to tourists. Clean-up operations in the region lasted weeks to months. In the three months after the storm, saltwater intrusion into the Cape Hatteras water supply boosted <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> levels from 40 milligrams (0.0014 ounces) to 280 milligrams (0.01 ounces) per liter; it took another three months for the chlorine to decrease to normal concentrations. Around 50 homeowners affected by Emily raised their houses to prevent a recurrence, partially funded by flood insurance payments.

<doc id="3401001" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3401001" title="Pyramid of Neferirkare">
Pyramid of Neferirkare

The Pyramid of Neferirkare (in <a href="Egyptian%20language">ancient Egyptian</a> the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23Ba%20%28soul%29">Ba</a> of Neferirkare) was built for the <a href="Fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty</a> pharaoh <a href="Neferirkare%20Kakai">Neferirkare Kakai</a> referred to as Neferirkare in the 25th century BC. It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a> found between <a href="Giza%20Plateau">Giza</a> and <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the <a href="Abusir%20Papyri">Abusir papyri</a>.

The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a>. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a <a href="step%20pyramid">step pyramid</a>: a design that had been antiquated after the <a href="Third%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Third Dynasty</a> (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material.

Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where <a href="Funerary%20cult">cult priests</a> could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>; and his sons, <a href="Neferefre">Neferefre</a> and <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a>, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre.

The Pyramid of Neferirkare is situated on the necropolis at <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a>, between <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> and the <a href="Giza%20Plateau">Giza Plateau</a>. Abusir assumed great import in the Fifth Dynasty after <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a>, the first ruler, built his sun temple and, his successor, <a href="Sahure">Sahure</a> inaugurated a royal necropolis there with his funerary monument. Sahure's successor, his son Neferirkare, was the second ruler to be entombed in the necropolis. The Egyptologist Jaromír Krejčí proposes a number of hypotheses for the position of Neferirkare's complex in relation to Sahure's complex: (1) that Neferirkare was motivated to distance himself from Sahure and thus chose to found a new cemetery and redesign the mortuary temple plan to differentiate it from Sahure's; (2) that geomorphological pressures particularly the slope between Neferirkare's and Sahure's complexes required Neferirkare to situate his complex elsewhere; (3) on the basis of the site being the highest point, Neferirkare may have selected it to ensure his complex dominated the surrounding area and; (4) that the site may have been intentionally selected to build the pyramid in line with <a href="Heliopolis%20%28ancient%20Egypt%29">Heliopolis</a>. The Abusir diagonal is a figurative line connecting the north-west corners of the pyramids of Neferirkare, Sahure and Neferefre. It is similar to the Giza axis, which connects the south-east corners of the Giza pyramids, and converges with the Abusir diagonal to a point in Heliopolis.
The location of the complex impacted the construction process. The Egyptologist Miroslav Bárta states that one of the major factors influencing the location was their position in relation to the administrative capital of the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>, Inbu-Hedj known today as <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>. Providing that the location of ancient Memphis is accurately known, the Abusir necropolis would have been no further than from the city centre. The benefit of the site being close to the city was the increased access to resources and manpower. South-west of Abusir, workers could exploit a limestone quarry to gather resources for the manufacture of masonry blocks used in the construction of the pyramid. The limestone there was particularly easy to quarry considering that gravel, sand and "tafl" layers sandwiched the limestone into thin segments of between and thick making it easier to dislodge from its matrix.

In 1838, The British Egyptologist <a href="John%20Shae%20Perring">John Shae Perring</a> cleared the entrances to the pyramids of <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Sahure">Sahure</a>, Neferirkare and <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Nyuserre">Nyuserre</a>. Five years later, The Prussian Egyptologist <a href="Richard%20Lepsius">Richard Lepsius</a> explored the Abusir necropolis and <a href="Lepsius%20list%20of%20pyramids">catalogued</a> Neferirkare's pyramid as "XXI". It was Lepsius who proposed the theory that the accretion layer method of construction was applied to the pyramids of the Fifth and <a href="Sixth%20Dynasty">Sixth Dynasty</a>. One important development was the discovery of the <a href="Abusir%20Papyri">Abusir papyri</a>, found in the temple of Neferirkare during illicit excavations in 1893. In 19028, the German Egyptologist <a href="Ludwig%20Borchardt">Ludwig Borchardt</a>, working for the <a href="Deutsche%20Orient-Gesellschaft">Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft or German Oriental Society</a>, resurveyed those same pyramids and had their adjoining temples and causeways excavated. His findings were published in "Das Grabdenkmal des Königs Nefer-Ir-Ke-Re" (1909). The <a href="Charles%20University">Czech Institute of Egyptology</a> has had a long-term excavation project going at the site since the 1960s.

<a href="Egyptian%20pyramid%20construction%20techniques">Pyramid construction techniques</a> underwent a transition in the Fifth Dynasty. The monumentality of the pyramids diminished, the design of <a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a>s changed, and the substructure of the pyramid became standardized. By contrast, <a href="relief%20%28art%29">relief</a> decoration proliferated and the temples were enriched with greater storeroom complexes.

These two conceptual changes had developed by the time of Sahure's reign at the latest. Sahure's mortuary complex indicates that symbolic expression through decoration became favoured over sheer magnitude. For example, <a href="Fourth%20Dynasty">Fourth Dynasty</a> pharaoh <a href="Khufu">Khufu</a>'s complex had a total of 100 linear metres (330 linear feet) reserved for decoration, while Sahure's temple had around 370 linear metres (1,200 linear feet) dedicated to relief decorations. Bárta identifies that storage space in mortuary temples expanded consistently from Neferirkare's reign onwards. This was a result of the combined centralization of administrative focus onto the <a href="funerary%20cult">funerary cult</a>, the increase in the numbers of priests and officials involved in the maintenance of the cult, and the increase in their revenues. The discovery of considerable remains of stone vessels mostly broken or otherwise incomplete in the pyramid temples of Sahure, Neferirkare, and <a href="Neferefre">Neferefre</a> bears testament to this development.

Old Kingdom mortuary complexes consisted of five essential components: (1) a valley temple; (2) a causeway; (3) a pyramid, or mortuary, temple; (4) a cult, or satellite, pyramid; and (5) the main pyramid. Neferirkare's mortuary complex only had two of these basic elements: a mortuary temple which had been hastily constructed from cheap mudbrick and wood; and the largest main pyramid at the site. The valley temple and causeway that were originally intended for Neferirkare's monument were co-opted by Nyuserre for his own mortuary complex. Conversely, a cult pyramid never entered construction, as a consequence of the rush to complete the monument upon Neferirkare's death. Its replacement was a small settlement and lodgings constructed from mudbrick to the south of the complex where the priests would live. An enormous brick enclosure wall was built around the perimeter of the pyramid and mortuary temple to complete Neferirkare's funerary monument.

The monument was intended as a <a href="step%20pyramid">step pyramid</a>, an unusual choice for a Fifth Dynasty king, given that the era of step pyramids ended with the <a href="Third%20Dynasty">Third Dynasty</a> (26th or 27th century BC) centuries prior, depending on the scholar and source. The reasoning behind this choice is not understood. The Egyptologist <a href="Miroslav%20Verner">Miroslav Verner</a> considers a speculative connection between the Turin Canon's listing him "as the founder of a new dynasty" and the original project, though he also considers the possibility of religious reasons and power politics as well. The first build contained six carefully laid steps of high quality stone blocks reaching a height of . A <a href="Limestone">white limestone</a> casing was to be applied to the structure, but after minimal work on this was completed extending only to the first step the pyramid was redesigned to form a "true pyramid". Verner describes the architecture of a Fifth Dynasty pyramid thusly;

To convert the step into a genuine pyramid, the whole structure was extended outwards by about and raised a further two steps in height. This expansion project was completed in rough order with small stone fragments that were intended to be cased in <a href="Granite">red granite</a>. The premature death of the king halted the project after only the lowest level(s) of the casing had been completed. The resultant base of the structure measured on each side, and, had the project been completed, the pyramid would have reached approximately in height with an inclination from base to tip of about 54°. Despite the incompleteness of the structure, the pyramid which is of comparable size to <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Menkaure">Menkaure's</a> pyramid at Giza dominates over its surrounds as a result of the position of its site standing on a hill some above the <a href="Nile%20delta">Nile delta</a>.

The descending corridor near the middle of the north face of the pyramid serves as the entry into the substructure of Neferirkare's pyramid. The corridor begins approximately above ground level and ends at a similar depth below ground level. It has proportions of height and width. It is reinforced at the entrance and exit points with granite casing. The corridor breaks out into a <a href="Vestibule%20%28architecture%29">vestibule</a> leading to a longer corridor that is guarded by a <a href="portcullis">portcullis</a>. This second corridor has two turns, but maintains a generally eastward direction and ends in an <a href="antechamber">antechamber</a> that is offset from the <a href="burial%20chamber">burial chamber</a>. The roof of the corridor is unique: the flat roof has a second gabled roof made of limestone on top of it which itself has a third roof made from a layer of reeds. 

The burial and ante chamber's ceilings were constructed with three gabled layers of limestone. The beams disperse weight from the superstructure onto either side of the passageway, preventing collapse. Thieves have ransacked the chambers of its limestone making it impossible to properly reconstruct, though some details can still be discerned. Namely, that (1) both rooms were oriented along an east-west axis, (2) both chambers were the same width; the antechamber was shorter of the two, and (3) both chambers had the same style roof, and are missing one layer of limestone.

Overall, the substructure is badly damaged: the collapse of a layer of the limestone beams has covered the burial chamber. No trace of the <a href="mummy">mummy</a>, <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a>, or any burial equipment has been found inside. The severity of the damage to the substructure prevents further excavation.

The mortuary temple is located at the base of the pyramid's Eastern face. It is larger than is typical for the period. Archaeological evidence suggests that it was unfinished at Neferirkare's death, and was completed by Neferefre and Nyuserre. For example, while the inner temple and <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">statue niches</a> were built from stone, much of the rest of the temple, including the court and entrance hall, was apparently hastily completed using cheap mudbrick and wood. This left large portions of the mortuary temple susceptible to erosion from rain and wind, where stone would have given it significant durability. The site was less aesthetically impressive, although its basic layout and features remained roughly analogous to Sahure's temple. Its enlarged size can be attributed to a design decision to build the complex without a valley temple or a causeway. Instead, the causeway and temple, whose foundations had been constructed, were diverted to Nyuserre's complex.

The temple was entered through the columned <a href="portico">portico</a>, and columned entrance hall which terminates into a large columned courtyard. The columns of the hall and courtyard are made from wood arranged into the form of lotus stalks and buds. The courtyard is adorned with thirty-seven such columns; these columns are asymmetrically positioned. The archaeologist <a href="Herbert%20Ricke">Herbert Ricke</a> hypothesized that columns near the altar may have been damaged by fire and removed. A papyrus fragment from the temple archives corroborates this story. A low stepped ramp in the courtyard's west leads to a transverse (north-south) corridor which leads south into storerooms and north into another smaller corridor containing six wooden columns through which the open courtyard of the main pyramid can be accessed. It is in the southern storerooms that the Abusir papyri were discovered by graverobbers in the 1890s. Beyond the storerooms is a gate which has another access point to the main pyramid's courtyard, and through which a second excavated south-western gate leads to <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II's complex</a>. Finally, traversing across the corridor leads directly into the inner sanctuary or temple.
The surviving reliefs are fragmentary. Of the preserved materials, one particular block stands out as vitally important in reconstructing the genealogy of the royal family at this time. A limestone block, discovered in the 1930s by Egyptologist <a href="%C3%89douard%20Ghazouli">Édouard Ghazouli</a>, depicts Neferirkare with his consort, <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>, and eldest son, Neferefre. It was not found at the site of the pyramid, but as a part of a house in the village of Abusir.

The Abusir papyri document details concerning Neferirkare's mortuary temple at Abusir. One testimony from the papyri is that five statues were housed in the niches of the central chapel. The central statue depicted Neferirkare as the deity <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, whereas the two outermost statues portrayed him as the king of <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper</a> and <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a> respectively. The papyri also record the existence of at least four funerary boats at Abusir. Two boats are located in sealed rooms while the other two are to the north and south of the pyramid itself. The southern boat was discovered when Verner unearthed the funerary boat during excavations.

Only the foundations of the valley temple and causeway intended for Neferirkare's complex had been laid at the time of his death. The causeway's foundation had been laid about two thirds of the way from the valley temple to the mortuary temple. As a result, when Nyuserre took over the site, the causeway had to be diverted from its original destination, so that it travels in one direction for more than half its distance before bending to another for the remainder of its length. 

The precise function of the satellite pyramid remains unclear, though it may have had some association with the <a href="Ka%20%28Egyptian%20soul%29">Ka</a> of the pharaoh. Neferirkare's monument has no cult pyramid. Rather, the cult pyramid was replaced with a small settlement, called Ba Kakai, of mudbrick lodgings for priests, south of the monument. The omission of these "essential" elements have themselves had one significant impact. Under normal circumstances, the priests tending to the deceased pharaoh's funerary cult would have lived in a 'pyramid town' built in the vicinity of the valley temple situated on the Abusir Lake. Naturally, the daily administrative records kept by the priests would have had their residence with the priests. Instead, as a matter of circumstance, these documents were instead kept in the mortuary temple. This fact preserved the existence of their archives which would have otherwise long ago disintegrated, buried under the mud. The presence of the settlement near to the complex sites also allowed small restoration and architectural works to be conducted.

Nyuserre was the last king to build his funerary monument at Abusir; his successors <a href="Menkauhor">Menkauhor</a> and <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a> abandoned the site in favour of sites elsewhere. Abusir thus ceased to be the royal necropolis. This did not mean that the site had been abandoned. The records of the Abusir Papyri demonstrate that funerary cults remained active at Abusir at least until the reign of <a href="Pepi%20II">Pepi II</a> at the end of the Sixth Dynasty. 

Verner believes that royal cultic activities ceased by the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a>. Another Egyptologist, Jaromír Malek, notes that some limited evidence for the continuation of the cults of Neferirkare and Nyuserre exists throughout the Herakleopolitan Period, though this means that Nyuserre's cult operated continually until at least the Twelfth Dynasty. Professor Antonio Morales believes that funerary cults may have continued beyond the Old Kingdom, in particular the cult of Nyuserre appears to have survived both in its official form and in popular public veneration until the early <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>, and some scant evidence in the form of two statues dated to the Middle Kingdom may suggest that Neferirkare's cult was active during that period as well.

The necropolae near Memphis, specifically those at Saqqara and Abusir, were used extensively during the <a href="Twenty-Sixth%20Dynasty">Twenty-Sixth Dynasty</a> (ca. 664525 BC). Considerable quantities of stone were required for these tombs which very probably came from the Old Kingdom pyramids, causing further damage to them. Graves estimated to be from the fifth century BC have been discovered in the vicinity of Neferirkare's mortuary temple. One yellow calcite gravestone, discovered by Borchardt, bears an Aramaic inscription: "(Belonging) to "Nsnw", the daughter of Paḥnûm" alternatively read as "(Belonging) to Nesneu, the daughter of Tapakhnum". A second inscription, found by Verner on a limestone block in the mortuary temple bears the inscription: "Mannu-ki-na'an son of Šewa". The dating of this second inscription is uncertain, but may plausibly be from the same period.

Originally thought to be a <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a> by Borchardt, the ruined structure found on the southern side of Neferirkare's complex was considered to be of, at most, secondary importance. In consequence, Borchardt neglected to properly examine it beyond conducting a brief survey of the site while there. It was not until Verner's Czech team's excavations in the 1970s that the structure was identified as being the pyramid tomb of Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II. Perring had previously discovered griffonage on a limestone block from the site of Neferirkare's tomb which attested to his consort "the King's wife Khentkawes". Further corroborating evidence is her appearance in a relief of the royal family found on another limestone block on which Neferirkare's son, Neferefre, also appears.

Her pyramid was constructed in two phases. The first phase of the construction must have begun during Neferirkare's reign, as is evidenced by the inscription that Perring had discovered. The project was halted around the tenth year of Neferirkare's reign, but later resumed until the complex was completed. Verner suggests that Neferirkare's untimely death interrupted the project and that it was ultimately finished during Nyuserre's reign. The word "mother" appears inscribed above "wife" on another block indicating that the relationship between Khentkaus II and Nyuserre was as mother and son. The completed structure has a square base measuring across each side, and with a slope of 52° would stand tall were it not in ruins. Her mortuary complex also includes a satellite pyramid, a courtyard, and an extended mortuary temple.

Located directly south-west of Neferirkare's monument, and just to the west of Khentkaus II's, Neferefre's unfinished pyramid is another member of the family cemetery born around Neferirkare's tomb. Built on the Abusir diagonal, Neferefre's pyramid was never completed owing to the unexpectedly early death of the pharaoh. Originally built with a base length of , slightly shorter than that of Sahure's pyramid, and with only a single step completed, the plan had to be altered to accommodate the remains of the king. For this reason, the pyramid was hastily converted into a squared mastaba and completed with the application of limestone facing at a slope of 78° and a clay and desert stone capping. The accompanying mortuary temple is believed to have been built promptly following Neferefre's death. The main features of the temple were a <a href="Hypostyle">hypostyle hall</a>, two large wooden boats, and a number of broken statues found in rooms near the aforementioned hall.

Nyuserre joined his family with his own mortuary complex. Upon taking the throne, Nyuserre undertook to complete the three unfinished monuments of his closest family members: his father, Neferirkare; his mother, Khentkaus II; and his brother, Neferefre. This task, and its costs, burdened the construction of his own monument. The location of Nyuserre's mortuary complex is itself unusual. Instead of being seated on the Abusir-Heliopolis axis, Nyuserre's pyramid is nestled between Neferirkare's and Sahure's pyramids. For Nyuserre's pyramid to be placed on the axis it would have needed to be located in the desert, far from the Nile valley. The costs of such a project were unreasonable. The pyramid, located to the north-east of Neferirkare's pyramid, stands around tall and has a base length of about . The causeway that connects the valley temple to the mortuary complex was originally destined for Neferirkare's pyramid, but Nyuserre had the causeway diverted, and the valley temple co-opted, to serve his monument.

The monument's significance comes from the circumstances of its construction, and the contents of the Abusir papyri archives. The French Egyptologist <a href="Nicolas%20Grimal">Nicolas Grimal</a> states that: "[t]his was the most important known collection of papyri from the Old Kingdom until the 1982 expedition of the Egyptological Institute of the University of Prague discovered an even richer cache in a storeroom of the nearby mortuary temple of Neferefre."

The first fragments of the Abusir papyri were discovered by illicit diggers in 1893, and sold and distributed around the world in the antiquities market. Later, Borchardt discovered additional fragments while excavating in the same area. The fragments were found to be written in <a href="hieratic">hieratic</a>; a cursive form of hieroglyphics. Other papyri found in Neferirkare's tomb were comprehensively studied and published by the French Egyptologist <a href="Paule%20Posener-Kri%C3%A9ger">Paule Posener-Kriéger</a>.

The papyri records span the period between the reign of Djedkare Isesi through to the reign of Pepi II. They recount all aspects of the management of the funerary cult of the king including the daily activities of priests, lists of offerings, letters, and inventory checks of the temple. Importantly, the papyri connect the larger picture of the interplay between the mortuary temple, sun temple and other institutions. For example, the fragmentary evidence of the papyri indicates that goods for Neferirkare's funerary cult were transported by ship to the pyramid complex of the king. The full extent of the records of the papyri found at Abusir is unknown as more recent findings remain unpublished.

Oryzomys

Oryzomys is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> rodents in the tribe <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a> living in southern North America and far northern South America. It includes eight species, two of which—the <a href="marsh%20rice%20rat">marsh rice rat</a> ("O. palustris") of the United States and "<a href="Oryzomys%20couesi">O. couesi</a>" of Mexico and Central America—are widespread; the six others have more restricted distributions. The species have had eventful <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> histories, and most species were at one time included in the marsh rice rat; additional species may be recognized in the future. The name "Oryzomys" was established in 1857 by <a href="Spencer%20Fullerton%20Baird">Spencer Fullerton Baird</a> for the marsh rice rat and was soon applied to over a hundred species of American rodents. Subsequently, the genus gradually became more narrowly defined until its current contents were established in 2006, when ten new genera were established for species previously placed in "Oryzomys".

Species of "Oryzomys" are medium-sized rats with long, coarse fur. The upperparts are gray to reddish and the underparts white to <a href="Buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a>. The animals have broad feet with reduced or absent <a href="ungual%20tufts">ungual tufts</a> of hair around the claws and, in at least some species, with <a href="interdigital%20webbing">webbing between the toes</a>. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is broad and the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> is high. Both the marsh rice rat and "O. couesi" have 56 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, lack a <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a>, and have a complex penis (as is characteristic of the Sigmodontinae) with some traits that are rare among oryzomyines; these characteristics are unknown in the other species of this genus.

The habitat includes various kinds of wetlands, such as lakes, marshes, and rivers. "Oryzomys" species swim well, are active during the night, and eat both plant and animal food. They build woven nests of vegetation. After a <a href="gestation%20period">gestation period</a> of 21 to 28 days, about four young are born. Species of "Oryzomys" are infected by numerous <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s and carry at least three <a href="hantavirus">hantavirus</a>es, one of which (<a href="Bayou%20virus">Bayou virus</a>) also infects humans. Two, maybe three, species have gone extinct over the last two centuries and at least one other is endangered, but the widespread marsh rice rat and "O. couesi" are not threatened.

"Oryzomys" is one of about thirty genera within the tribe <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a>, a diverse group of well over a hundred species, many of which were formerly also included in "Oryzomys". Oryzomyini is one of several tribes within the subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a> of the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, which includes hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents, distributed mainly in the Americas and Eurasia.

Within Oryzomyini, a 2006 <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> analysis by Marcelo Weksler which used both <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> and <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data found some evidence that "Oryzomys" is most closely related to a group including "<a href="Holochilus">Holochilus</a>", "<a href="Lundomys">Lundomys</a>", and "<a href="Pseudoryzomys">Pseudoryzomys</a>". Although analyses based on morphological and combined data supported this relationship, sequences of the <a href="RBP3">"Rbp3"</a> gene alone instead placed "Oryzomys" among a group that included "<a href="Nectomys">Nectomys</a>", "<a href="Sigmodontomys">Sigmodontomys</a>", and a few other genera. In all analyses, "Oryzomys" appeared within <a href="Oryzomyini%23clade%20D">clade D</a> of Oryzomyini. The relationship between "Oryzomys" and the "Holochilus" group was supported by five <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a> (shared derived characters)—absence or reduction of both the hypothenar and interdigital <a href="paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a>; reduction of <a href="ungual%20tuft">ungual tuft</a>s of hairs surrounding the claws; having the back margin of the <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a> of the skull at the same level as the front of the first upper <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a>; and the <a href="anterocone">anterocone</a> (front cusp) of the first upper molar divided by an <a href="anteromedian%20fossette">anteromedian fossette</a>. The first three are adaptations to the <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> lifestyle that "Oryzomys" and the members of the "Holochilus" group share, and may thus be examples of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>.

The name "Oryzomys" was introduced in 1857 by <a href="Spencer%20Fullerton%20Baird">Spencer Fullerton Baird</a> for the <a href="marsh%20rice%20rat">marsh rice rat</a> (now "Oryzomys palustris") of the eastern United States, which had been first described twenty years earlier by <a href="Richard%20Harlan">Richard Harlan</a>. The name combines the Greek "oryza" "rice" and "mys" "mouse" and refers to the feeding habits of the marsh rice rat. Baird placed "Oryzomys" as a <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> of the now-defunct genus "<a href="Hesperomys">Hesperomys</a>" and included only the marsh rice rat in it, a classification which was followed by <a href="Elliott%20Coues">Elliott Coues</a> in 1874 and 1877. In 1890, "Oryzomys" was raised to generic rank, and in subsequent years numerous additional species were ascribed to it, many of which were soon moved to separate genera. In the 1898 "Catalogus Mammalium", <a href="%C3%89douard%20Louis%20Trouessart">Édouard Louis Trouessart</a> listed 67 species of "Oryzomys", including some that are now placed in "<a href="Calomys">Calomys</a>", "<a href="Necromys">Necromys</a>", "<a href="Thomasomys">Thomasomys</a>", and other genera unrelated to "Oryzomys". Some of the new genera proposed were soon subsumed in "Oryzomys" again, and in "The Families and Genera of Living Rodents" (1941), <a href="Sir%20John%20Ellerman%2C%202nd%20Baronet">John Ellerman</a> listed "<a href="Microryzomys">Microryzomys</a>", "<a href="Oligoryzomys">Oligoryzomys</a>", "<a href="Melanomys">Melanomys</a>", "<a href="Nesoryzomys">Nesoryzomys</a>", and "<a href="Oecomys">Oecomys</a>" as <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a> of "Oryzomys" and included about 127 species in it. In 1948, <a href="Philip%20Hershkovitz">Philip Hershkovitz</a> suggested that other oryzomyines like "Nectomys" and "<a href="Megalomys">Megalomys</a>" could as well be included in "Oryzomys", and <a href="Clayton%20Ray">Clayton Ray</a> followed this suggestion in 1962.

Hershkovitz and Ray's classification was never widely followed, and from 1976 on authors started to reinstate some of the other groups lumped in "Oryzomys" as separate genera. The genus was reduced to 43 species (out of 110 in Oryzomyini) in the third edition (2005) of "Mammal Species of the World", but it was still not a natural, <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> group; rather, it mostly united those oryzomyines that lacked the conspicuous specializations of other genera. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler's comprehensive phylogenetic analysis produced further evidence that the genus was <a href="polyphyly">polyphyletic</a>, as species of "Oryzomys" were dispersed all over the oryzomyine tree. He proposed that eleven new genera should be created to accommodate those species that were not closely related to the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Oryzomys", the marsh rice rat; he considered other options that would require fewer new genera, but argued that that would result in less meaningful genus-level groups in Oryzomyini. Later in the same year, Weksler, Percequillo, and Voss created ten new genera—"<a href="Aegialomys">Aegialomys</a>", "<a href="Cerradomys">Cerradomys</a>", "<a href="Eremoryzomys">Eremoryzomys</a>", "<a href="Euryoryzomys">Euryoryzomys</a>", "<a href="Hylaeamys">Hylaeamys</a>", "<a href="Mindomys">Mindomys</a>", "<a href="Nephelomys">Nephelomys</a>", "<a href="Oreoryzomys">Oreoryzomys</a>", "<a href="Sooretamys">Sooretamys</a>", and "<a href="Transandinomys">Transandinomys</a>"—for species formerly placed in "Oryzomys" and placed six more species related to "<a href="Handleyomys%20alfaroi">"Oryzomys" alfaroi</a>" in "<a href="Handleyomys">Handleyomys</a>" pending the description of more new genera for them. They left only five species in "Oryzomys", which was now finally a natural, monophyletic group. Because of subsequent taxonomic work, the number of species has since increased to at least eight.

Some problems remain: <a href="%3FOryzomys%20pliocaenicus">?"Oryzomys pliocaenicus"</a>, a <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> fossil from Kansas, is of uncertain identity but may belong in "<a href="Bensonomys">Bensonomys</a>", and fossils from the Miocene of Oregon and <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> of New Mexico have also been ascribed to "Oryzomys", but probably incorrectly. A possible "Oryzomys" has been recorded from the <a href="Irvingtonian">Irvingtonian</a> (Pleistocene) of <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>.

The current concept of "Oryzomys" derives from the "palustris-mexicanus" group recognized within a much larger genus "Oryzomys" by Merriam (1901) and the "palustris" group proposed by Goldman (1918). Merriam recognized 21 species within his group, but Goldman consolidated them into eight—the marsh rice rat in the United States, "<a href="Oryzomys%20couesi">O. couesi</a>" in far southern Texas, Mexico, and Central America, and six others with small distributions. In 1960, <a href="Raymond%20Hall">Raymond Hall</a> united "O. couesi" and the marsh rice rat into a single species, "Oryzomys palustris", and thereafter, other localized forms were also included in "O. palustris". Hershkovitz described another species in the group, "<a href="Oryzomys%20gorgasi">O. gorgasi</a>" from Colombia, in 1970 and the next year he noted that "<a href="Oryzomys%20dimidiatus">O. dimidiatus</a>", previously classified as a "Nectomys", was similar to "O. palustris". After 1979, the marsh rice rat and "O. couesi" were again regarded as separate as a result of further work in Texas, where their ranges meet. While reviewing "O. gorgasi" in 2001, J. Sánchez H. and colleagues redefined and characterized the "O. palustris" group and listed "O. couesi", "O. dimidiatus", "O. gorgasi", and the marsh rice rat as its members; <a href="Guy%20Musser">Guy Musser</a> and <a href="Michael%20Carleton">Michael Carleton</a> in the 2005 third edition of "Mammal Species of the World" additionally listed "<a href="Oryzomys%20nelsoni">O. nelsoni</a>" from <a href="Islas%20Mar%C3%ADas">María Madre Island</a> in western Mexico.

In 2006, Weksler and colleagues followed the 2001 definition by Sánchez and others for the restricted genus "Oryzomys", but added "<a href="Oryzomys%20antillarum">O. antillarum</a>" from <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> as a species. Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed "Oryzomys" from western Mexico in 2009 and in this context provided an extended diagnosis of "Oryzomys". They recognized eight species: the six previously mentioned plus "<a href="Oryzomys%20albiventer">O. albiventer</a>" and "<a href="Oryzomys%20peninsulae">O. peninsulae</a>". Also in 2009, Robert Voss and Weksler identified the <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> "Oryzomys curasoae" from <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Curaçao</a> as an island population of "O. gorgasi". The next year, Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study using DNA sequence data from the <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a>, <a href="interphotoreceptor%20retinoid-binding%20protein">interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein</a>, and <a href="alcohol%20dehydrogenase">alcohol dehydrogenase</a> 1 genes to assess relationships within "Oryzomys". They recommended that the marsh rice rat be split into two species and that "O. couesi" be split into four species on the basis of the observed sequence divergence and other data.

Merriam divided his "palustris-mexicanus" group in two "series" according to the color of the underparts (white or <a href="wikt%3Afulvous">fulvous</a>). Goldman divided his "palustris" group in two "sections"—a "couesi" section with "O. couesi" and six related species, and a "palustris" section with "O. palustris" only. He noted that the latter differed from the former in the generally darker, more brownish, longer fur, and larger <a href="sphenopalatine%20vacuities">sphenopalatine vacuities</a> (openings in the <a href="mesopterygoid%20fossa">mesopterygoid fossa</a>, the gap behind the end of the <a href="palate">palate</a>). As Weksler's 2006 analysis included only "O. couesi" and the marsh rice rat among species of "Oryzomys" in the strict sense, he could not test those groups. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred with Goldman's division, listing additional characters, and noted that the "palustris" group may be more semiaquatically adapted than the members of the "couesi" group are. In the latter, the fur is usually reddish-brown, as opposed to grayish-brown in the "palustris" group. Members of the "couesi" group have smaller sphenopalatine vacuities and a smaller <a href="sphenopalatine%20foramen">sphenopalatine foramen</a>, a <a href="foramen">foramen</a> (opening) in the side of the skull above the molars, and a more highly developed <a href="anterolabial%20cingulum">anterolabial cingulum</a> on the third lower molar (a crest at the front of the tooth). The hypothenar pad of the hindfoot, located on the sole far from the fingers, is present in the "couesi" group, but absent in the "palustris" group. <a href="Interdigital%20webbing">Interdigital webbing</a> may be more highly developed in the "palustris" group. Using morphological data, Voss and Weksler found a closer relationship between "O. couesi" and "O. gorgasi" to the exclusion of "O. palustris", but with low confidence. The DNA sequence data of Hanson and colleagues supported a deep separation between the "palustris" and "couesi" groups, but a Costa Rican sample (assigned to "O. couesi") was about as distant from the two groups as they were from each other.

The genus currently includes the following species:

"Oryzomys" contains medium-sized, semiaquatically specialized oryzomyine rodents. They have long, coarse fur that is grayish to reddish on the upperparts and white to buff on the underparts. The marsh rice rat superficially resembles the <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a> <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> and <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a>, but has larger differences in color between the upper- and underparts. The <a href="vibrissa">vibrissa</a>e (whiskers) are short and the ears are small and well-haired. The tail is usually as long as or longer than the head and body and is sparsely haired, but the hairs on the lower side are longer than those above. Females have eight <a href="mammae">mammae</a>, as in most oryzomyines. The hindfeet are broad and have the first and fifth digits notably shorter than the middle three. The upper surface is hairy, but the underside is naked and covered with small irregularities (<a href="squamae">squamae</a>). The pads are generally poorly developed, as are the ungual tufts. Interdigital webbing may be present, but its development is variable within the genus.

The <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> has been recorded in various populations of the marsh rice rat and "O. couesi" and is apparently stable within the genus at 56 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, with the <a href="karyotype%23Fundamental%20number">fundamental number</a> of chromosomal arms ranging from 56 to 60 (2n = 56, FN = 56–60). In both species, the <a href="stomach">stomach</a> has the characteristic pattern of sigmodontines (<a href="Locule">unilocular</a>-hemiglandular): it is not split in two chambers by an <a href="incisura%20angularis">incisura angularis</a> and the front part (<a href="antrum">antrum</a>) is covered by a <a href="glandular%20epithelium">glandular epithelium</a>. Furthermore, the <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a> is absent, a synapomorphy of Oryzomyini.

"Oryzomys" species have a large skull with a short rostrum and high <a href="braincase">braincase</a>. The <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a>, located between the eyes, is narrowest to the front and is flanked by well-developed beads at its margins. The zygomatic plate is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct <a href="jugal%20bone">jugal bone</a>. The <a href="interparietal%20bone">interparietal bone</a>, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for "O. couesi" plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin at the front of the first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>ry bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed <a href="posterolateral%20palatal%20pits">posterolateral palatal pits</a>. There is no <a href="alisphenoid%20strut">alisphenoid strut</a>, an extension of the <a href="alisphenoid%20bone">alisphenoid bone</a> that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The <a href="auditory%20bulla">auditory bulla</a>e are large. The condition of the <a href="artery">arteries</a> in the head is highly <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a>. In the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw), the <a href="coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid process</a>, a <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">process</a> at the back, is well developed and the <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a>, a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.

As usual in oryzomyines, the molars are <a href="pentalophodont">pentalophodont</a> (have the <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a>s and <a href="mesolophid">mesolophid</a>s, accessory crests, well developed) and <a href="bunodont">bunodont</a>, with the cusps higher than the connecting crests. The cusps on the upper molars are arranged in two longitudinal series, not three as in the black and brown rats. The front cusps of the first upper and lower molar (anterocone and <a href="anteroconid">anteroconid</a>, respectively) are broad and not divided completely by an <a href="anteromedian%20flexus">anteromedian flexus</a> or <a href="anteromedian%20flexid">flexid</a>. Behind the anterocone, the <a href="anteroloph">anteroloph</a> (a smaller crest) is complete and separated from the anterocone. On both the second and third lower molars, the <a href="anterolophid">anterolophid</a> (a crest on the inner front corner) is present, a putative synapomorphy of the genus. The first molars have additional small roots in addition to the main ones, so that the upper first molar has four and the lower has three or four roots.

As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat and "O. couesi" have a complex penis, with the <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly <a href="penile%20spines">covered by small spines</a>, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character these two species share only with "Oligoryzomys" among oryzomyines examined. On the <a href="urethral%20process">urethral process</a>, located in the crater at the end of the penis, a fleshy process (the <a href="subapical%20lobule">subapical lobule</a>) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except "<a href="Holochilus%20brasiliensis">Holochilus brasiliensis</a>". Both traits are recovered as synapomorphies of "O. couesi" plus the marsh rice rat in Weksler's analysis.

The range of "Oryzomys" extends from <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> in the eastern United States through Mexico and Central America south to northwestern Colombia and east to northwestern Venezuela and Curaçao. Species of "Oryzomys" usually live in wet habitats such as marshes, streams, and <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s, but both the marsh rice rat and "O. couesi" are also occasionally encountered in drier habitats. They occur or occurred on many <a href="continental%20shelf">continental-shelf</a> islands and one <a href="oceanic%20island">oceanic island</a>, Jamaica; their adeptness at colonizing islands may be caused by their close association with water and frequent occurrence in coastal wetlands. The oldest fossils date to the <a href="Rancholabrean">Rancholabrean</a> of the United States, about 300,000 years ago; although there have been some earlier North American records, those are not in fact referable to "Oryzomys" or even Oryzomyini. Oryzomyines likely evolved in South America east of the Andes; the presence of "Oryzomys" in Central America and other trans-Andean regions is thought to be the result of one of several independent invasions of this region by oryzomyines. Alternatively, "Oryzomys" may have evolved from the Pliocene North American "<a href="Jacobsomys">Jacobsomys</a>". "O. antillarum" may have reached Jamaica during the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a> while sea levels were low.

Behavior is known mainly from the marsh rice rat and "O. couesi", with some scattered data from the other species. "Oryzomys" are semiaquatic, spending much time in the water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both the marsh rice rat and "O. couesi" are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also <a href="nocturnal">active during the night</a> and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28 days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and "O. couesi" become reproductively active when about 50 days old.

The marsh rice rat, "O. couesi", and "O. gorgasi" are known to be <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>s, eating both plant and animal material. They eat both seeds and green plant parts and consume a variety of animals, including <a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, and many others. The <a href="barn%20owl">barn owl</a> ("Tyto alba") is a major predator on the marsh rice rat and remains of "O. antillarum", "O. couesi", and "O. gorgasi" have been found in <a href="owl%20pellet">owl pellet</a> deposits. Several other animals are known to prey on "Oryzomys". A variety of <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s are known from "O. couesi" and the marsh rice rat and two parasitic <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s have been found in "O. gorgasi".

Two species of "Oryzomys", "O. antillarum" and "O. nelsoni", have gone extinct since the 19th century, and a third, "O. peninsulae", is unlikely to be still extant. Their extinction may have been caused by habitat destruction and by introduced species such as the <a href="small%20Asian%20mongoose">small Asian mongoose</a> and the brown and black rat. These same causes may threaten "O. gorgasi", which the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> assesses as "<a href="Endangered">Endangered</a>". "O. albiventer" has been affected by human alteration of its habitat, but likely still survives. In contrast, the widespread species, the marsh rice rat and "O. couesi", are common and of no conservation concern—indeed, both have been considered a pest—but some populations are threatened. Like these two species, "O. dimidiatus" is assessed as "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>" by the Red List.

The marsh rice rat is the <a href="natural%20reservoir">natural reservoir</a> of the <a href="Bayou%20virus">Bayou virus</a>, the second most common cause of <a href="hantavirus%20pulmonary%20syndrome">hantavirus pulmonary syndrome</a> in the United States. Two other hantaviruses, <a href="Catacamas%20virus">Catacamas virus</a> and <a href="Playa%20de%20Oro%20virus">Playa de Oro virus</a>, occur in "O. couesi" in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively, but are not known to infect humans.

Baldwin of Forde

Baldwin of Forde or Ford (<a href="circa">c.</a> 1125 – 19 November 1190) was <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> between 1185 and 1190. The son of a clergyman, he studied <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> and theology at <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> and was tutor to <a href="list%20of%20popes">Pope</a> <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20III">Eugene III</a>'s nephew before returning to England to serve successive <a href="Bishop%20of%20Exeter">bishops of Exeter</a>. After becoming a <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> <a href="monk">monk</a> he was named abbot of his monastery at <a href="Forde%20Abbey">Forde</a> and subsequently elected to the episcopate at <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>. Before becoming a bishop, he wrote theological works and sermons, some of which have survived.

As a bishop, Baldwin came to the attention of King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a>, who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in <a href="Medieval%20Wales">Wales</a> with <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a>, preaching and raising money for the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>. After the coronation of King <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a>, the new king sent Baldwin ahead to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>, where he became embroiled in the politics of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>. Baldwin died in the Holy Land while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as more damaging to Christianity than <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>.

Born in <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a> around 1125, Baldwin was the son of <a href="Hugh%20de%20Avigo">Hugh d'Eu</a>, <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Totnes">Archdeacon of Totnes</a>, and a woman of unknown name who later became a nun. <a href="Gervase%20of%20Canterbury">Gervase of Canterbury</a>'s story that he was from an even humbler background has been shown by modern scholarship to stem from bias on the medieval chronicler's part. It is possible that he studied at Bologna in the 1150s with the future Pope <a href="Pope%20Urban%20III">Urban III</a>. <a href="Robert%20Warelwast">Robert Warelwast</a>, who was Bishop of Exeter from 1138 to 1155, had sent Baldwin to Italy to study law. Baldwin was also said to have taught at Exeter, although this is not substantiated by any contemporary record. In 1150 or 1151 Pope Eugene III appointed him tutor to Eugene's nephew. By 1155 Baldwin seems to have returned to England, where he joined the household of <a href="Robert%20of%20Chichester">Robert of Chichester</a>, Bishop of Exeter.

Baldwin attracted the attention of <a href="Bartholomew%20Iscanus">Bartholomew Iscanus</a>, Bishop of Exeter, who made him <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> at <a href="Totnes">Totnes</a> in about 1161, after Baldwin's father's death. Baldwin was known as a <a href="canon%20lawyer">canon lawyer</a> during his holding of Totnes. He received a letter from <a href="John%20of%20Salisbury">John of Salisbury</a> in 1167, complaining about Bartholomew's conduct during the <a href="Becket%20controversy">Becket controversy</a>. John accused Bartholomew of not properly supporting <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a> the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> in his dispute with the king, urging Baldwin to influence the bishop to increase his support, and not to sign any appeal by the English bishops against Becket. Other letters from John dealt with rumours concerning <a href="Roger%20of%20Worcester">Roger</a>, the Bishop of Worcester, who John had heard was speaking badly of Becket. John's purpose seems to have been to have Baldwin pass along a warning from Becket to Roger about his behaviour; John was a supporter of Becket's during the latter's exile. In 1169 Baldwin was once again peripherally involved in the Becket dispute, when he objected to Becket's excommunication of a number of noblemen and clergy for opposing Becket's cause. Baldwin's objection was not so much that they were excommunicated, but that no warning had been given that such an action was contemplated.

Baldwin became a monk in about 1170, and then <a href="abbot">abbot</a> of the Cistercian monastery of <a href="Forde%20Abbey">Forde</a>. He was well known as a <a href="canon%20law">canonist</a>, and often acted as a <a href="papal%20judge-delegate">judge-delegate</a> for the papacy, hearing cases that had reached the Roman <a href="Curia">Curia</a> and been remanded to local experts for decision. In 1166, Baldwin was the addressee of a work by John of Salisbury, "Expectiatione longa", which was one of the tracts written during the Becket controversy. It was probably at this time that Baldwin wrote "De sacramento altaris". In 1175 he served with his old bishop, Bartholomew, as joint papal judge in a dispute between <a href="Malmesbury%20Abbey">Malmesbury Abbey</a> and <a href="Josceline%20de%20Bohon">Josceline de Bohon</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>. In 1178 he was recommended to Pope Alexander as a possible candidate for a <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinalship</a>, but this never occurred.

Baldwin became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a> on 10 August 1180. While at Worcester, he impressed King Henry II by intervening in a secular case to prevent a hanging on a Sunday. Although the medieval writer <a href="Walter%20Map">Walter Map</a> said that Baldwin was determined to continue writing even after his election to the bishopric, none of Baldwin's writings can be dated to his time as bishop except for one sermon.

Baldwin was <a href="Translation%20%28ecclesiastical%29">translated</a> from the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Worcester">see of Worcester</a> to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">see of Canterbury</a> in December 1184, after Henry II let it be known that he would accept only Baldwin at Canterbury; the previous incumbent, <a href="Richard%20of%20Dover">Richard of Dover</a>, had died in April that year. The monks put forward three candidates from within <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Christ Church Priory</a>: Odo, who had been <a href="prior">prior</a> of Christ Church and was then Abbot of <a href="Battle%20Abbey">Battle Abbey</a>, <a href="Peter%20de%20Leia">Peter de Leia</a>, a <a href="Cluny%20Abbey">Cluniac</a> prior of <a href="Much%20Wenlock%20Priory">Wenlock Priory</a> and later <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s">Bishop of St David's</a>, and Theobald, <a href="Abbot%20of%20Cluny">Abbot of Cluny</a>, but none of them found favour with the English bishops. Instead, the prelates selected the king's choice, Baldwin. The selection of Baldwin took place only after a dispute between the members of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury and the <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan bishop</a>s of Canterbury, both of whom claimed the right to elect the new archbishop.

Baldwin received his <a href="pallium">pallium</a> from Pope <a href="Pope%20Lucius%20III">Lucius III</a> along with Lucius' approval of his translation. Baldwin was named a <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a> in 1185, although his authority was limited to his own archdiocese and did not extend into the <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20York">Archdiocese of York</a>.

During his time as archbishop there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election. For his part, Baldwin did not approve of the luxurious and pampered life the monks of Christ Church lived, and felt that they profited too much from the cult of Thomas Becket.

The dispute escalated when Baldwin deprived the monks of some of the revenues of their monastic estates. After that, Baldwin proposed to establish a church dedicated to Becket in Canterbury itself, staffed by <a href="secular%20clergy">secular</a> rather than monastic clergy. The monks of the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> saw this proposed foundation as the first step in an attempt to change the see of Canterbury from a monastic cathedral chapter, a peculiarity of the English Church, to the more normal pattern of secular clergy. It is not clear if Baldwin himself intended such a plan, but the other bishops supported the effort, as contemporary writers made clear. Baldwin sought the advice of <a href="Hugh%20of%20Lincoln">Hugh</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, who advised Baldwin to abandon the plan as it would only cause distress to all parties. The controversy was long and involved and, at one point, the monks were imprisoned within their own buildings for a year and a half, from January 1188 to August 1189. This led to the suspension of the <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> in the cathedral. Eventually all the prominent ecclesiastics and monastic houses of Europe were forced into choosing sides in the dispute. In October 1189, in an attempt to gain control, Baldwin appointed <a href="Roger%20Norreys">Roger Norreys</a> as the chapter's prior, an appointment widely acknowledged by contemporaries as putting a useless individual into the office. His plan for financing the church involved soliciting contributions from donors by promising a one-third reduction in penances for annual donations.

In 1188 King Henry II of England called for a tax to support the Third Crusade, following the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%281187%29">fall of Jerusalem</a> to Saladin in 1187. It was collected at the rate of a tenth of all the property and income of any person not vowing to go on crusade. It was popularly known as the "<a href="Saladin%20tithe">Saladin tithe</a>" and was the most extensive tax ever collected in England up to that point. Being a tithe and not a secular tax, it was collected by <a href="diocese">diocese</a>s rather than by <a href="shire">shire</a>s. Baldwin especially was blamed for its harshness, although in February, along with his advisor <a href="Peter%20of%20Blois">Peter of Blois</a>, he was in Normandy with the king.

Baldwin took the cross, or vowed to go on crusade, along with King Henry and many others in January 1188, or when he began his preaching campaign on 11 February 1188 to drum up support for the Third Crusade. In April 1188, Baldwin was in Wales on a tour attempting to secure support for the king's crusade, and was forcing his servants and followers to exercise on foot up and down hills in preparation for the journey to the Holy Land. He spent most of the year in Wales, preaching the crusade, accompanied by the chronicler Gerald of Wales. Gerald claimed about 3000 recruits for the crusade from his and Baldwin's efforts in Wales, although he also suggested that Baldwin mainly embarked on the tour to avoid his dispute with the Canterbury monks.

A side effect of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied assertion of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, especially when he made a point of celebrating <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a> at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at <a href="St%20Asaph%27s%20Cathedral">St Asaph's Cathedral</a>. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear before him and take the cross, <a href="Owain%20Cyfeiliog">Owain Cyfeiliog</a>.

Baldwin was with King Henry shortly before the latter's death, taking part in unsuccessful efforts to negotiate a truce with Henry's heir, Prince Richard, who had rebelled against his father. After Henry's death, Richard sought and obtained <a href="absolution">absolution</a> for the sin of disobedience to his father from both Baldwin and <a href="Walter%20de%20Coutances">Walter de Coutances</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Rouen">Archbishop of Rouen</a>. Baldwin, along with Coutances, was with Richard on 20 July 1189 at Rouen when the king was invested with the Duchy of Normandy. Baldwin crowned Richard at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on 13 September 1189 in the first English coronation for which a detailed description survives.

After the death of Henry II, and the accession of Richard as king, the monks of Christ Church Priory petitioned Richard to intercede in the long-running dispute between them and the archbishop. In November 1189, Richard and the whole court, including the Queen Mother <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, travelled to Canterbury in an attempt to end the controversy before the papacy become involved. Richard finally settled the dispute by persuading Baldwin to abandon his church-building project and to dismiss Norreys. Soon after this, Richard left England and Baldwin declared that he was going to found the proposed church at <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>, and then join Richard on crusade. Both Richard and Baldwin agreed to appoint Norreys to <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham Abbey</a>, as the previous <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">abbot of Evesham</a>, <a href="Adam%20of%20Evesham">Adam of Evesham</a>, had recently died. This appointment eventually led, after Baldwin's death, to the <a href="Case%20of%20Evesham">Case of Evesham</a>. In August 1189 Baldwin objected to the marriage of Prince <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a>, later King John, to <a href="Isabel%20of%20Gloucester">Isabel of Gloucester</a>, on the grounds of <a href="consanguinity">consanguinity</a>. John promised to obtain a papal <a href="Dispensation%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">dispensation</a>, but never did so. Baldwin laid John's lands under <a href="interdict">interdict</a>, but it was lifted by a papal legate who declared the marriage legal. Richard also restored to the archbishops of Canterbury the right to operate a <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">mint</a>, staffed by three <a href="moneyer">moneyer</a>s.

In April 1190 Baldwin left England with Richard on the Third Crusade. Leading the English advance guard, Baldwin left Marseilles ahead of Richard together with <a href="Hubert%20Walter">Hubert Walter</a> and <a href="Ranulf%20de%20Glanvill">Ranulf de Glanvill</a>. The group sailed directly to Syria on 5 August 1190. Baldwin delegated the administration of his <a href="spiritualities">spiritualities</a> and <a href="temporalities">temporalities</a> to <a href="Gilbert%20Glanvill">Gilbert Glanvill</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>, but entrusted any archiepiscopal authority to <a href="Richard%20FitzNeal">Richard FitzNeal</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. The custom of giving the archiepiscopal authority to London had originated in Archbishop <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>'s time. Baldwin continued to conduct some ecclesiastical business however, dealing with the suspended <a href="Hugh%20Nonant">Hugh Nonant</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Coventry">Bishop of Coventry</a>. Baldwin had suspended Nonant in March 1190 for holding secular office as sheriff, but Baldwin wrote to FitzNeal after his departure that Nonant had agreed to relinquish his secular offices.

Baldwin and his group arrived at <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was to look out for the king's interests while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of <a href="Frederick%20Barbarossa">Frederick Barbarossa</a>'s death on the way to the Holy Land.

When Baldwin arrived at <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a> on 12 October 1190, the Muslim forces in the city were <a href="Siege%20of%20Acre%20%281189%E2%80%931191%29">under siege</a> by the Frankish forces led by King <a href="Guy%20of%20Lusignan">Guy of Lusignan</a> and Queen <a href="Sibylla%20of%20Jerusalem">Sibylla of Jerusalem</a>, who in turn were being besieged by Saladin. Soon after Baldwin's arrival, there was a succession crisis in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>. Sibylla, a first cousin of Henry II, and her two young daughters all died in July from an epidemic ravaging the siege camp where they were living. This left Guy without a legal claim to the kingdom as he had held the kingship through his wife. The heiress to the kingdom was Sibylla's half-sister <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Jerusalem">Isabella</a>; she was already married to <a href="Humphrey%20IV%20of%20Toron">Humphrey IV of Toron</a>, but he was loyal to Guy and seems to have had no ambition to be king. A more promising candidate for the throne was <a href="Conrad%20of%20Montferrat">Conrad of Montferrat</a>, uncle of the last undisputed king, <a href="Baldwin%20V%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin V</a>. Conrad had saved the kingdom from destruction by leading the successful <a href="Siege%20of%20Tyre%20%281187%29">defence of Tyre</a>, and had the support of Isabella's mother <a href="Maria%20Komnene%2C%20Queen%20consort%20of%20Jerusalem">Maria Comnena</a> and stepfather <a href="Balian%20of%20Ibelin">Balian of Ibelin</a>. Maria and Balian abducted Isabella from Humphrey, and compelled her to seek an annulment, so that she could be married to Conrad and enable him to claim the kingship.

Baldwin supported Guy's claim, but <a href="Ubaldo%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Pisa">Ubaldo</a>, <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20Pisa">Archbishop of Pisa</a>, <a href="Philip%20of%20Dreux">Philip of Dreux</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Beauvais-Noyon-Senlis">Bishop of Beauvais</a>, and <a href="Patriarch%20Heraclius%20of%20Jerusalem">Eraclius</a>, <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Patriarch of Jerusalem</a>, supported Conrad. Isabella and Humphrey's marriage was forcibly annulled. Baldwin, already ailing, attempted to excommunicate everyone involved in the annulment, but he died on 19 November 1190. He wrote his will shortly before his death, and died surrounded by his followers on the crusade. Hubert Walter assumed the leadership of the English forces, and also became Baldwin's executor. Walter paid the wages of some soldiers and knights from Baldwin's estate, and distributed the rest of the money to the poor.

"De sacramento altaris", dealing with the <a href="eucharist">eucharist</a> and <a href="passover">passover</a>, is Baldwin's longest surviving work, in 12 manuscripts. It also includes a discussion of martyrdom that reads much like a vindication of Becket's status as a martyr. It was first printed in 1662, and has more recently been edited and published in the series <a href="Sources%20Chr%C3%A9tiennes">Sources Chrétiennes</a>, as volumes 93 and 94, in 1963. Others works include 22 sermons, and a work on faith, "De commendatione fidei", that only survives in two manuscripts, although another five are known to have existed. One of the missing manuscripts survived until at least the mid-1600s, as it formed the basis of the first printed edition of "De commendatione fidei" in 1662. The modern critical edition of "De commendatione" was published, along with the sermons, in 1991 as "Balduini de Forda Opera: Sermones, De Commendatione Fidei". with the "De commendatione fidei" translated into English in 2000.

Renowned for his preaching, Baldwin's surviving sermons show that interest in them continued after his death. His sermons were first published in 1662; the modern edition includes two more (titled "de obedientia" and "de sancta cruce") that were not in the original publication. It appears that originally there were 33 sermons, with the others now lost. The sermons survive in 12 manuscripts, although only 5 are collections of substantial numbers of the works. None of the surviving manuscripts has a complete collection of the 22 sermons.

Baldwin also collaborated with Bartholomew Iscanus on a "Liber penitentialis", which is jointly ascribed to both of them in a <a href="Lambeth%20Palace">Lambeth Palace</a> manuscript, MS 235. Another work often attributed to Baldwin, the "Ad laudem Bartholomaei Exoniensis episcopi de coloribus rhetoricis", survives in three manuscripts and a fragment of a fourth. A number of other works are known to have been authored by Baldwin, but do not survive. These include "Carmen devotionis", which was seen by <a href="John%20Bale">John Bale</a> at <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury Abbey</a> in the 16th century. Other lost works were a commentary on the <a href="biblical">biblical</a> books of "<a href="Book%20of%20Samuel">Samuel</a>" and "<a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Kings</a>", "De sectis haereticis" which existed at Christ Church Priory in the 13th century, and "De orthodoxis fidei dogmatibus", which was seen by <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a> at Christ Church in the 16th century. Some of Baldwin's letters existed in manuscript form, although they appear never to have circulated as a collection, but they are no longer extant. One of his letters is mentioned in a <a href="Rievaulx%20Abbey">Rievaulx Abbey</a> catalogue, and Leland mentions others in his works.

Besides Baldwin's own writings, there is a <a href="decretal">decretal</a> collection known as the "Collectio Wigorniensis", still extant in manuscript (MS) form. It now resides in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> as Royal MS 10.A.ii. This collection may have belonged to Baldwin. It was probably compiled at Worcester Cathedral before December 1184, when Baldwin went to Canterbury, and besides a basic collection of Pope <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Alexander III</a>'s decretals it includes a number of letters from the papacy addressed to Baldwin as Bishop of Worcester and as Archbishop of Canterbury. Although the main contents are unexceptional, the compiler of the work numbered the books and <a href="Pilcrow%23History%20and%20etymology">capitula</a> into which the work was divided, an innovation that allowed for much more efficient use of the collection. It is likely that the compiler was one of Baldwin's clerks, and that this testified to Baldwin's continuing interest in canon law. The manuscript itself was likely owned either by Baldwin himself or a member of his household.

The historian <a href="Frank%20Barlow%20%28historian%29">Frank Barlow</a> stated that Baldwin was "one of the greatest English decretalists". His work was more influential in his inspiration and support for the development of decretal collections, rather than in terms of the actual influence of his judicial decisions themselves. Another collection of writings associated with Baldwin is the correspondence relating to his dispute with the Christ Church monks. The documents relating to this dispute, which dragged on into the archbishopric of Hubert Walter, are published in one whole volume of the <a href="Rolls%20Series">Rolls Series</a>, which was edited by the Victorian historian <a href="William%20Stubbs">William Stubbs</a>.

Baldwin's long-running dispute with his cathedral chapter caused the chronicler Gervase of Canterbury to characterise him as "a greater enemy to Christianity than Saladin." Another contemporary, Gerald of Wales, praised Baldwin as "distinguished for his learning and religion", but also claimed that he was gloomy and nervous. <a href="Herbert%20of%20Bosham">Herbert of Bosham</a> dedicated his "History of Thomas", a story of Thomas Becket, to the archbishop in the late 1180s. The historian <a href="Austin%20Lane%20Poole">A. L. Poole</a> called Baldwin a "distinguished scholar and deeply religious man, [but he] was injudicious and too austere to be a good leader." Baldwin was also known as a theologian, as well as being a canon lawyer. His clerk and nephew, <a href="Joseph%20of%20Exeter">Joseph of Exeter</a>, accompanied Baldwin on the crusade, and wrote two works after his return to England: "<a href="Antiocheis">Antiocheis</a>", an epic poem about King Richard on crusade, and "<a href="De%20bello%20Troiano">De Bello Trojano</a>", a rewriting of the Trojan War.

Political integration of India

At the time of <a href="Indian%20Independence%20Act%201947">Indian independence</a> in 1947, India was divided into two sets of territories, one under direct British rule, and the other under the <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> of the British Crown, with control over their internal affairs remaining in the hands of their hereditary rulers. The latter included 554 princely states, having different types of revenue sharing arrangements with the British, often depending on their size, population and local conditions. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and Portugal. The political integration of these territories into India was a declared objective of the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a>, and the <a href="Government%20of%20India">Government of India</a> pursued this over the next decade. Through a combination of factors, Sardar <a href="Vallabhbhai%20Patel">Vallabhbhai Patel</a> and <a href="V.%20P.%20Menon">V. P. Menon</a> convinced most of the rulers of the various <a href="princely%20states">princely states</a> to accede to India. Having secured their accession, they then proceeded, in a step-by-step process, to secure and extend the central government's authority over these states and transform their administrations until, by 1956, there was little difference between the territories that had been part of <a href="British%20India">British India</a> and those that had been princely states. Simultaneously, the Government of India, through a combination of diplomatic and military means, acquired "de facto" and "<a href="de%20jure">de jure</a>" control over the remaining colonial enclaves, which too were integrated into India.

Although this process successfully integrated the vast majority of the princely states into India, it was not as successful for a few, notably the former princely states of <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%20%28princely%20state%29">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, <a href="Tripura%20%28princely%20state%29">Tripura</a> and <a href="Manipur%20%28princely%20state%29">Manipur</a>, where active secessionist movements exist.

The early history of British expansion in India was characterised by the co-existence of two approaches towards the existing princely states. The first was a policy of annexation, where the British sought to forcibly absorb the Indian princely states into the provinces which constituted their <a href="British%20India">Empire in India</a>. The second was a policy of indirect rule, where the British assumed <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> and <a href="paramountcy">paramountcy</a> over princely states, but conceded to them sovereignty and varying degrees of internal self-government. During the early part of the 19th century, the policy of the British tended towards annexation, but the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a> forced a change in this approach, by demonstrating both the difficulty of absorbing and subduing annexed states, and the usefulness of princely states as a source of support. In 1858, the policy of annexation was formally renounced, and British relations with the remaining princely states thereafter were based on <a href="subsidiary%20alliance">subsidiary alliance</a>s, whereby the British exercised paramountcy over all princely states, with the <a href="British%20crown">British crown</a> as ultimate <a href="suzerain">suzerain</a>, but at the same time respected and protected them as allies, taking control of their external relations. The exact relations between the British and each princely state were regulated by individual treaties and varied widely, with some states having complete internal self-government, others being subject to significant control in their internal affairs, and some rulers being in effect little more than the owners of landed estates, with little autonomy.

During the 20th century, the British made several attempts to integrate the princely states more closely with British India, in 1921 creating the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Princes">Chamber of Princes</a> as a consultative and advisory body, and in 1936 transferring the responsibility for the supervision of smaller states from the provinces to the centre and creating direct relations between the <a href="Government%20of%20India">Government of India</a> and the larger princely states, superseding political agents. A more ambitious aim was a scheme of federation contained in the <a href="Government%20of%20India%20Act%201935">Government of India Act 1935</a>, which envisaged the princely states and British India being united under a federal government. This scheme came close to success, but was abandoned in 1939 as a result of the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. As a result, in the 1940s the relationship between the princely states and the crown remained regulated by the principle of paramountcy and by the various treaties between the British crown and the states.

Neither paramountcy nor the subsidiary alliances could continue after <a href="Indian%20Independence%20Act%201947">Indian independence</a>. The British took the view that because they had been established directly between the British crown and the princely states, they could not be transferred to the newly independent <a href="dominion">dominion</a>s of India and Pakistan. At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it was not prepared to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states. The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties between them and the princely states, would come to an end upon the British departure from India.

The termination of paramountcy meant that all rights flowing from the states' relationship with the British crown would return to them, leaving them free to negotiate relationships with the new states of India and Pakistan "on a basis of complete freedom". Early British plans for the transfer of power, such as the offer produced by the <a href="Cripps%20Mission">Cripps Mission</a>, recognised the possibility that some princely states might choose to stand out of independent India. This was unacceptable to the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a>, which regarded the independence of princely states as a denial of the course of Indian history, and consequently regarded this scheme as a "<a href="Balkanisation">Balkanisation</a>" of India. The Congress had traditionally been less active in the princely states because of their limited resources which restricted their ability to organise there and their focus on the goal of independence from the British, and because Congress leaders, in particular <a href="Mohandas%20Gandhi">Mohandas Gandhi</a>, were sympathetic to the more progressive princes as examples of the capacity of Indians to rule themselves. This changed in the 1930s as a result of the federation scheme contained in the Government of India Act 1935 and the rise of socialist Congress leaders such as <a href="Jayaprakash%20Narayan">Jayaprakash Narayan</a>, and the Congress began to actively engage with popular political and labour activity in the princely states. By 1939, the Congress's formal stance was that the states must enter independent India, on the same terms and with the same autonomy as the provinces of British India, and with their people granted responsible government. As a result, it attempted to insist on the incorporation of the princely states into India in its negotiations with the British, but the British took the view that this was not in their power to grant.

A few British leaders, particularly <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten</a>, the last British <a href="viceroy%20of%20India">viceroy of India</a>, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely states to the British India through a complex network of interests. Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, and other similar agreements would get terminated, posing a serious threat to the economic life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian officials such as <a href="V.%20P.%20Menon">V. P. Menon</a> that the integration of the princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage the wounds of <a href="Partition%20of%20India">partition</a>. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress. However, <a href="Vallabhbhai%20Patel">Sardar Patel</a> looked back on events at a press conference in January 1948, declaring "As you are all aware, on the lapse of Paramountcy every Indian State became a separate independent entity."

The rulers of the princely states were not uniformly enthusiastic about integrating their domains into independent India. Some, such as the rulers of <a href="Bikaner%20State">Bikaner</a> and <a href="Jawhar%20State">Jawhar</a>, were motivated to join India out of ideological and patriotic considerations, but others insisted that they had the right to join either India or Pakistan, to remain independent, or form a union of their own. <a href="Bhopal%20State">Bhopal</a>, <a href="Travancore">Travancore</a> and <a href="Hyderabad%20state">Hyderabad</a> announced that they did not intend to join either dominion. Hyderabad went as far as to appoint trade representatives in European countries and commencing negotiations with the Portuguese to lease or buy <a href="Goa">Goa</a> to give it access to the sea, and Travancore pointed to the strategic importance to western countries of its <a href="thorium">thorium</a> reserves while asking for recognition. Some states proposed a subcontinent-wide confederation of princely states, as a third entity in addition to India and Pakistan. Bhopal attempted to build an alliance between the princely states and the <a href="All-India%20Muslim%20League">Muslim League</a> to counter the pressure being put on rulers by the Congress.

A number of factors contributed to the collapse of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> rulers did not trust <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> princes, in particular <a href="Hamidullah%20Khan">Hamidullah Khan</a>, the <a href="Nawab%20of%20Bhopal">Nawab of Bhopal</a> and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League to stay out of the <a href="Constituent%20Assembly%20of%20India">Constituent Assembly</a> was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of <a href="Baroda%20State">Baroda</a>, Bikaner, <a href="Cochin%20State">Cochin</a>, <a href="Gwalior%20State">Gwalior</a>, <a href="Jaipur%20State">Jaipur</a>, <a href="Jodhpur%20State">Jodhpur</a>, <a href="Patiala%20State">Patiala</a> and <a href="Rewa%20%28princely%20state%29">Rewa</a> took their seats in the Assembly.

Many princes were also pressured by popular sentiment favouring integration with India, which meant their plans for independence had little support from their subjects. The Maharaja of Travancore, for example, definitively abandoned his plans for independence after the attempted assassination of his dewan, Sir <a href="C.%20P.%20Ramaswami%20Iyer">C. P. Ramaswami Iyer</a>. In a few states, the chief ministers or <a href="dewan">dewan</a>s played a significant role in convincing the princes to accede to India. The key factors that led the states to accept integration into India were, however, the efforts of Lord Mountbatten, Sardar <a href="Vallabhbhai%20Patel">Vallabhbhai Patel</a> and <a href="V.%20P.%20Menon">V. P. Menon</a>. The latter two were respectively the political and administrative heads of the <a href="States%20Department">States Department</a>, which was in charge of relations with the princely states.

Mountbatten believed that securing the states' accession to India was crucial to reaching a negotiated settlement with the Congress for the transfer of power. As a relative of the British King, he was trusted by most of the princes and was a personal friend of many, especially the Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan. The princes also believed that he would be in a position to ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> and Patel had asked him to become the first <a href="Governor%20General">Governor General</a> of the <a href="Dominion%20of%20India">Dominion of India</a>.

Mountbatten used his influence with the princes to push them towards accession. He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status to any of the princely states, nor would it accept them into the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth</a>, which meant that the states would sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He pointed out that the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> was one economic entity, and that the states would suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of <a href="Communalism%20%28South%20Asia%29">communal violence</a> and <a href="Communism">communist movements</a>.

Mountbatten stressed that he would act as the trustee of the princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which he was free to do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.

At the time, several princes complained that they were being betrayed by Britain, who they regarded as an ally, and Sir <a href="Conrad%20Corfield">Conrad Corfield</a> resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> before the <a href="Anschluss">invasion of Austria</a>. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten played a crucial role in ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.

By far the most significant factor that led to the princes' decision to accede to India was the policy of the Congress and, in particular, of Patel and Menon. The Congress' stated position was that the princely states were not sovereign entities, and as such could not opt to be independent notwithstanding the end of paramountcy. The princely states must therefore accede to either India or Pakistan. In July 1946, Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India. In January 1947, he said that independent India would not accept the <a href="divine%20right%20of%20kings">divine right of kings</a>, and in May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. Other Congress leaders, such as <a href="C.%20Rajagopalachari">C. Rajagopalachari</a>, argued that as paramountcy "came into being as a fact and not by agreement", it would necessarily pass to the government of independent India, as the successor of the British.

Patel and Menon, who were charged with the actual job of negotiating with the princes, took a more conciliatory approach than Nehru. The official policy statement of the Government of India made by Patel on 5 July 1947 made no threats. Instead, it emphasised the unity of India and the common interests of the princes and independent India, reassured them about the Congress' intentions, and invited them to join independent India "to make laws sitting together as friends than to make treaties as aliens". He reiterated that the States Department would not attempt to establish a relationship of domination over the princely states. Unlike the Political Department of the British Government, it would not be an instrument of paramountcy, but a medium whereby business could be conducted between the states and India as equals.

Patel and Menon backed up their diplomatic efforts by producing treaties that were designed to be attractive to rulers of princely states. Two key documents were produced. The first was the <a href="Standstill%20agreement%20%28India%29">Standstill Agreement</a>, which confirmed the continuance of the pre-existing agreements and administrative practices. The second was the <a href="Instrument%20of%20Accession">Instrument of Accession</a>, by which the ruler of the princely state in question agreed to the accession of his kingdom to independent India, granting the latter control over specified subject matters. The nature of the subject matters varied depending on the acceding state. The states which had internal autonomy under the British signed an Instrument of Accession which only ceded three subjects to the government of India—defence, <a href="external%20affairs">external affairs</a>, and communications, each defined in accordance with List 1 to Schedule VII of the <a href="Government%20of%20India%20Act%201935">Government of India Act 1935</a>. Rulers of states which were in effect estates or <a href="taluk">taluk</a>as, where substantial administrative powers were exercised by the Crown, signed a different Instrument of Accession, which vested all <a href="Separation%20of%20legislative%20powers%20in%20India">residuary powers</a> and jurisdiction in the Government of India. Rulers of states which had an intermediate status signed a third type of Instrument, which preserved the degree of power they had under the British.

The Instruments of Accession implemented a number of other safeguards. Clause 7 provided that the princes would not be bound to the <a href="Constitution%20of%20India">Indian constitution</a> as and when it was drafted. Clause 8 guaranteed their autonomy in all areas that were not ceded to the Government of India. This was supplemented by a number of promises. Rulers who agreed to accede would receive guarantees that their <a href="extra-territorial">extra-territorial</a> rights, such as <a href="immunity%20from%20prosecution">immunity from prosecution</a> in Indian courts and exemption from customs duty, would be protected, that they would be allowed to democratise slowly, that none of the eighteen major states would be forced to merge, and that they would remain eligible for <a href="British%20honours">British honours and decorations</a>. In discussions, Lord Mountbatten reinforced the statements of Patel and Menon by emphasising that the documents gave the princes all the "practical independence" they needed. Mountbatten, Patel and Menon also sought to give princes the impression that if they did not accept the terms put to them then, they might subsequently need to accede on substantially less favourable terms. The Standstill Agreement was also used as a negotiating tool, as the States Department categorically ruled out signing a Standstill Agreement with princely states that did not sign an Instrument of Accession.

The limited scope of the Instruments of Accession and the promise of a wide-ranging autonomy and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient comfort to many rulers, who saw this as the best deal they could strike given the lack of support from the British, and popular internal pressures. Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on 15 August 1947, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession. A few, however, held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession. <a href="Piploda%20State">Piploda</a>, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948. The biggest problems, however, arose with a few border states, such as <a href="Jodhpur%20State">Jodhpur</a>, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with <a href="Junagadh%20State">Junagadh</a>, which actually did accede to Pakistan, and with <a href="Hyderabad%20state">Hyderabad</a> and <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%20%28princely%20state%29">Kashmir</a>, which declared that they intended to remain independent.

The ruler of Jodhpur, <a href="Hanwant%20Singh">Hanwant Singh</a>, was antipathetic to the Congress, and did not see much future in India for him or the lifestyle he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of <a href="Jaisalmer%20State">Jaisalmer</a>, he entered into negotiations with <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a>, who was the designated head of state for <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. Jinnah was keen to attract some of the larger border states, hoping thereby to attract other <a href="Rajput">Rajput</a> states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> and <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab</a>. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that it would be difficult for him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the <a href="two-nation%20theory">two-nation theory</a> on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.

Although the states were in theory free to choose whether they wished to accede to India or Pakistan, Mountbatten had pointed out that "geographic compulsions" meant that most of them must choose India. In effect, he took the position that only the states that shared a border with Pakistan could choose to accede to it.

The Nawab of <a href="Junagadh%20State">Junagadh</a>, a princely state located on the south-western end of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> and having no common border with Pakistan, chose to accede to Pakistan ignoring Mountbatten's views, arguing that it could be reached from Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh—<a href="Mangrol%20State">Mangrol</a> and <a href="Babariawad">Babariawad</a>—reacted to this by declaring their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India. In response, the Nawab of Junagadh militarily occupied the states. The rulers of neighbouring states reacted angrily, sending their troops to the Junagadh frontier and appealed to the Government of India for assistance. A group of Junagadhi people, led by <a href="Samaldas%20Gandhi">Samaldas Gandhi</a>, formed a government-in-exile, the "Aarzi Hukumat" ("temporary government").

India believed that if Junagadh was permitted to go to Pakistan, the communal tension already simmering in Gujarat would worsen, and refused to accept the accession. The government pointed out that the state was 80% Hindu, and called for a referendum to decide the question of accession. Simultaneously, they cut off supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and reoccupied the principalities of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India. Pakistan agreed to discuss a plebiscite, subject to the withdrawal of Indian troops, a condition India rejected. On 26 October, the Nawab and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops. On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State's administration. The Government of India agreed. A plebiscite was conducted in February 1948, which went almost unanimously in favour of accession to India.

At the time of the transfer of power, the state of <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%20%28princely%20state%29">Jammu and Kashmir</a> (widely called "Kashmir") was ruled by <a href="Maharaja">Maharaja</a> <a href="Hari%20Singh">Hari Singh</a>, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority. Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by <a href="Sheikh%20Abdullah">Sheikh Abdullah</a>, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the <a href="Jammu%20%26amp%3B%20Kashmir%20National%20Conference">National Conference</a>, who demanded his abdication.

Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of <a href="Poonch">Poonch</a> by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, <a href="Pashtun%20people">Pathan</a> tribesmen from the <a href="North-West%20Frontier%20Province%20%281901%E2%80%931955%29">North-West Frontier Province</a> of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards <a href="Srinagar">Srinagar</a>. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an <a href="Instrument%20of%20Accession%20%28Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%29">Instrument of Accession</a> and setting up an <a href="interim%20government">interim government</a> headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.

Indian troops secured <a href="Jammu">Jammu</a>, Srinagar and the valley itself during the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201947">First Kashmir War</a>, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions. The plebiscite was never held, and on 26 January 1950, the Constitution of India came into force in Kashmir, but with <a href="Article%20370">special provisions</a> made for the state. India did not, however, secure administrative control over all of Kashmir. The northern and western portions of Kashmir came under Pakistan's control in 1947, and are today <a href="Azad%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Pakistan-administered Kashmir</a>. In the 1962 <a href="Sino-Indian%20War">Sino-Indian War</a>, China occupied <a href="Aksai%20Chin">Aksai Chin</a>, the north-eastern region bordering <a href="Ladakh">Ladakh</a>, which it continues to control and administer.

Hyderabad was a landlocked state that stretched over 82,000 square miles (over 212,000 square kilometres) in southeastern India. While 87% of its 17 million people were Hindu, its ruler <a href="Nizam">Nizam</a> <a href="Osman%20Ali%20Khan">Osman Ali Khan</a> was a Muslim, and its politics were dominated by a Muslim elite. The Muslim nobility and the <a href="Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen">Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen</a>, a powerful pro-Nizam Muslim party, insisted Hyderabad remain independent and stand on an equal footing to India and Pakistan. Accordingly, the Nizam in June 1947 issued a "<a href="Firman%20%28decree%29">firman</a>" announcing that on the transfer of power, his state would be resuming independence. The Government of India rejected the firman, terming it a "legalistic claim of doubtful validity". It argued that the strategic location of Hyderabad, which lay astride the main lines of communication between northern and southern India, meant it could easily be used by "foreign interests" to threaten India, and that in consequence, the issue involved national-security concerns. It also pointed out that the state's people, history and location made it unquestionably Indian, and that its own "common interests" therefore mandated its integration into India.

The Nizam was prepared to enter into a limited treaty with India, which gave Hyderabad safeguards not provided for in the standard Instrument of Accession, such as a provision guaranteeing Hyderabad's neutrality in the event of a conflict between India and Pakistan. India rejected this proposal, arguing that other states would demand similar concessions. A temporary Standstill Agreement was signed as a stopgap measure, even though Hyderabad had not yet agreed to accede to India. By December 1947, however, India was accusing Hyderabad of repeatedly violating the Agreement, while the Nizam alleged that India was blockading his state, a charge India denied.

The Nizam was also beset by the <a href="Telangana%20Rebellion">Telangana Rebellion</a>, led by communists, which started in 1946 as a peasant revolt against feudal elements; and one which the Nizam was not able to subjugate. The situation deteriorated further in 1948. The <a href="Razakars%20%28Hyderabad%29">Razakars</a> ("volunteers"), a militia affiliated to the Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen and set up under the influence of Muslim radical <a href="Qasim%20Razvi">Qasim Razvi</a>, assumed the role of supporting the Muslim ruling class against upsurges by the Hindu populace, and began intensifying its activities and was accused of attempting to intimidate villages. The Hyderabad State Congress Party, affiliated to the Indian National Congress, launched a political agitation. Matters were made worse by communist groups, which had originally supported the Congress but now switched sides and began attacking Congress groups. Attempts by Mountbatten to find a negotiated solution failed and, in August, the Nizam, claiming that he feared an imminent invasion, attempted to approach the <a href="UN%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a> and the <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Justice">International Court of Justice</a>. Patel now insisted that if Hyderabad was allowed to continue its independence, the prestige of the Government would be tarnished and then neither Hindus nor Muslims would feel secure in its realm.

On 13 September 1948, the <a href="Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> was sent into Hyderabad under <a href="Operation%20Polo">Operation Polo</a> on the grounds that the law and order situation there threatened the peace of <a href="South%20India">South India</a>. The troops met little resistance by the Razakars and between 13 and 18 September took complete control of the state. The operation led to massive communal violence with estimates of deaths ranging from the official one of 27,000–40,000 to scholarly ones of 200,000 or more. The Nizam was retained as the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> in the same manner as the other princes who acceded to India. He thereupon disavowed the complaints that had been made to the UN and, despite vehement protests from Pakistan and strong criticism from other countries, the Security Council did not deal further with the question, and Hyderabad was absorbed into India.

The Instruments of Accession were limited, transferring control of only three matters to India, and would by themselves have produced a rather loose federation, with significant differences in administration and governance across the various states. Full political integration, in contrast, would require a process whereby the political actors in the various states were "persuaded to shift their loyalties, expectations, and political activities towards a new center", namely, the <a href="Republic%20of%20India">Republic of India</a>. This was not an easy task. While some princely states such as <a href="Mysore%20State">Mysore</a> had legislative systems of governance that were based on a broad franchise and not significantly different from those of British India, in others, political decision-making took place in small, limited aristocratic circles and governance was, as a result, at best paternalistic and at worst the result of courtly intrigue. Having secured the accession of the princely states, the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 turned to the task of welding the states and the former British provinces into one polity under a single republican constitution.

The first step in this process, carried out between 1947 and 1949, was to merge the smaller states that were not seen by the Government of India to be viable administrative units either into neighbouring provinces, or with other princely states to create a "princely union". This policy was contentious, since it involved the dissolution of the very states whose existence India had only recently guaranteed in the Instruments of Accession. Patel and Menon emphasised that without integration, the economies of states would collapse, and anarchy would arise if the princes were unable to provide democracy and govern properly. They pointed out that many of the smaller states were very small and lacked resources to sustain their economies and support their growing populations. Many also imposed tax rules and other restrictions that impeded free trade, and which had to be dismantled in a united India.

Given that merger involved the breach of guarantees personally given by Mountbatten, initially Patel and Nehru intended to wait until after his term as <a href="Governor-General%20of%20India">Governor-General</a> ended. An <a href="adivasi">adivasi</a> uprising in <a href="Orissa%2C%20India">Orissa</a> in late 1947, however, forced their hand. In December 1947, princes from the Eastern India Agency and Chhattisgarh Agency were summoned to an all-night meeting with Menon, where they were persuaded to sign Merger Agreements integrating their states into Orissa, the <a href="Central%20Provinces">Central Provinces</a> and <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a> with effect from 1 January 1948. Later that year, 66 states in Gujarat and the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a> were merged into <a href="Bombay%20Presidency">Bombay</a>, including the large states of <a href="Kolhapur">Kolhapur</a> and <a href="Baroda">Baroda</a>. Other small states were merged into <a href="Madras%20Presidency">Madras</a>, <a href="East%20Punjab">East Punjab</a>, West Bengal, the <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20Agra%20and%20Oudh">United Provinces</a> and <a href="Assam">Assam</a>. Not all states that signed Merger Agreements were integrated into provinces, however. Thirty states of the former <a href="Punjab%20Hill%20States%20Agency">Punjab Hill States Agency</a> which lay near the international border and had signed Merger Agreements were integrated into <a href="Himachal%20Pradesh">Himachal Pradesh</a>, a distinct entity which was administered directly by the centre as a <a href="Chief%20Commissioner%27s%20Province">Chief Commissioner's Province</a>, for reasons of security.

The Merger Agreements required rulers to cede "full and exclusive jurisdiction and powers for and in relation to governance" of their state to the <a href="Dominion%20of%20India">Dominion of India</a>. In return for their agreement to entirely cede their states, it gave princes a large number of guarantees. Princes would receive an annual payment from the Indian government in the form of a <a href="privy%20purse%20in%20India">privy purse</a> as compensation for the surrender of their powers and the dissolution of their states. While state property would be taken over, their <a href="private%20property">private property</a> would be protected, as would all personal privileges, dignities and titles. Succession was also guaranteed according to custom. In addition, the provincial administration was obliged to take on the staff of the princely states with guarantees of equal pay and treatment.

<a href="Cutch%20%28princely%20state%29">Kutch</a> in western India, and <a href="Tripura%20%28princely%20state%29">Tripura</a> and <a href="Manipur%20%28princely%20state%29">Manipur</a> in <a href="Northeast%20India">Northeast India</a>, all of which lay along international borders, were also asked to sign Merger Agreement, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. <a href="Bhopal%20State">Bhopal</a>, whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the <a href="Maratha">Maratha</a> states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did <a href="Bilaspur%20State">Bilaspur</a>, much of which was likely to be flooded on completion of the <a href="Bhakra%20dam">Bhakra dam</a>.

The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a "princely union" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the <a href="Rajpramukh">Rajpramukh</a> of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of <a href="salute%20state">salute state</a>s, and a <a href="presidium">presidium</a>, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy "Uprajpramukh" were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a <a href="privy%20purse">privy purse</a> and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.

Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the <a href="Kathiawar">Kathiawar</a> peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of <a href="Saurashtra%20%28state%29">Saurashtra</a> in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. <a href="Madhya%20Bharat">Madhya Bharat</a> emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of <a href="Gwalior%20State">Gwalior</a>, <a href="Indore%20State">Indore</a> and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the <a href="Patiala%20and%20East%20Punjab%20States%20Union">Patiala and East Punjab States Union</a> was formed on 15 July 1948 from <a href="Patiala%20State">Patiala</a>, <a href="Kapurthala%20State">Kapurthala</a>, <a href="Jind%20State">Jind</a>, <a href="Nabha%20State">Nabha</a>, <a href="Faridkot%20State">Faridkot</a>, <a href="Malerkotla%20State">Malerkotla</a>, <a href="Nalargarh%20State">Nalargarh</a>, and <a href="Kalsia%20State">Kalsia</a>. The <a href="United%20State%20of%20Rajasthan">United State of Rajasthan</a> was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of <a href="Travancore-Cochin">Travancore-Cochin</a>. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

Merging the administrative machineries of each state and integrating them into one political and administrative entity was not easy, particularly as many of the merged states had a history of rivalry. In the former <a href="Central%20India%20Agency">Central India Agency</a>, whose princely states had initially been merged into a princely union called <a href="Vindhya%20Pradesh">Vindhya Pradesh</a>, the rivalry between two groups of states became so bad that the Government of India persuaded the rulers to sign a Merger Agreement abrogating the old Covenants of Merger, and took direct control of the state as a Chief Commissioner's State. As such, the mergers did not meet the expectations of the Government of India or the States Department. In December 1947, Menon suggested requiring the rulers of states to take "practical steps towards the establishment of popular government". The States Department accepted his suggestion, and implemented it through a special covenant signed by the rajpramukhs of the merged princely unions, binding them to act as constitutional monarchs. This meant that their powers were "de facto" no different from those of the <a href="Governors%20of%20India">Governors</a> of the former British provinces, thus giving the people of their territories the same measure of responsible government as the people of the rest of India.

The result of this process has been described as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form. While this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had always been that independent India would inherit the position of being the paramount power.

Democratisation still left open one important distinction between the former princely states and the former British provinces, namely, that since the princely states had signed limited Instruments of Accession covering only three subjects, they were insulated from government policies in other areas. The Congress viewed this as hampering its ability to frame policies that brought about <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a> and national development. Consequently, they sought to secure to the central government the same degree of powers over the former princely states as it had over the former British provinces. In May 1948, at the initiative of V. P. Menon, a meeting was held in Delhi between the Rajpramukhs of the princely unions and the States Department, at the end of which the Rajpramukhs signed new Instruments of Accession which gave the Government of India the power to pass laws in respect of all matters that fell within the seventh schedule of the <a href="Government%20of%20India%20Act%201935">Government of India Act 1935</a>. Subsequently, each of the princely unions, as well as Mysore and Hyderabad, agreed to adopt the Constitution of India as the constitution of that state, thus ensuring that they were placed in exactly the same legal position vis-à-vis the central government as the former British provinces. The only exception was Kashmir, whose relationship with India continued to be governed by the original Instrument of Accession, and the constitution produced by the <a href="Constituent%20assembly%20of%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">state's Constituent Assembly</a>.

Effective from 1950, the Constitution of India classified the constituent units of India into three classes—Part A, B, and C states. The former British provinces, together with the princely states that had been merged into them, were the Part A states. The princely unions, plus Mysore and Hyderabad, were the Part B states. The former Chief Commissioners' Provinces and other centrally administered areas, except the <a href="Andaman%20and%20Nicobar%20Islands">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a>, were the Part C states. The only practical difference between the Part A states and the Part B states was that the constitutional heads of the Part B states were the Rajpramukhs appointed under the terms of the Covenants of Merger, rather than Governors appointed by the central government. In addition, Constitution gave the central government a significant range of powers over the former princely states, providing amongst other things that "their governance shall be under the general control of, and comply with such particular directions, if any, as may from time to time be given by, the President". Apart from that, the form of government in both was identical.

The distinction between Part A and Part B states was only intended to last for a brief, transitional period. In 1956, the <a href="States%20Reorganisation%20Act">States Reorganisation Act</a> reorganised the former British provinces and princely states on the basis of language. Simultaneously, the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution removed the distinction between Part A and Part B states, both of which were now treated only as "states", with Part C states being renamed "<a href="union%20territories">union territories</a>". The Rajpramukhs lost their authority, and were replaced as the constitutional heads of state by Governors, who were appointed by the central government. These changes finally brought the princely order to an end. In both legal and practical terms, the territories that had been part of the princely states were now fully integrated into India and did not differ in any way from those that had been part of British India. The personal privileges of the princes—the privy purse, the exemption from customs duty, and customary dignities—survived, only to be abolished in 1971.

Although the progressive integration of the princely states into India was largely peaceful, not all princes were happy with the outcome. Many had expected the Instruments of Accession to be permanent, and were unhappy about losing the <a href="autonomy">autonomy</a> and the guaranteed continued existence of their states they had expected to gain. Some felt uneasy about the disappearance of states that generations of their family had controlled, while others were unhappy about the disappearance of administrative structures they had worked hard to build up and which they believed to be efficient. The majority, however, despite the "strain and tension" of adapting to life as private citizens, were content to retire on the generous pension provided by the privy purse. Several took advantage of their eligibility to hold public offices under the central government. The Maharaja of <a href="Bhavnagar%20State">Bhavnagar</a>, <a href="Krishna%20Kumarasingh%20Bhavasingh">Col. Krishna Kumarasingh Bhavasingh Gohil</a>, for example, became the Governor of <a href="Madras%20State">Madras State</a>, and several others were appointed to <a href="Diplomat">diplomatic posts</a> overseas.

The integration of the princely states raised the question of the future of the remaining colonial <a href="enclave">enclave</a>s in India. At independence, the regions of <a href="Pondicherry">Pondicherry</a>, <a href="Karaikal">Karaikal</a>, <a href="Yanam%2C%20French%20India">Yanam</a>, <a href="Mah%C3%A9%2C%20India">Mahe</a> and <a href="Chandernagore">Chandernagore</a> were still colonies of France, and <a href="Daman%20and%20Diu">Daman and Diu</a>, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and <a href="Goa">Goa</a> remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India. It was ceded to India on a "de facto" basis on 14 August 1949 and "<a href="de%20jure">de jure</a>" on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by <a href="Edouard%20Goubert">Edouard Goubert</a>, used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20de%20Yanaon">demonstrations in Yanam</a> and <a href="Mah%C3%A9%2C%20India">Mahe</a> resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in <a href="Pondicherry">Pondicherry</a> and <a href="Karaikal">Karaikal</a> in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20France">French National Assembly</a> in May 1962, "de jure" control of the enclaves was also transferred.

Portugal, in contrast, resisted diplomatic solutions. It viewed its continued possession of its Indian enclaves as a matter of national pride and, in 1951, it amended its <a href="Constitution%20of%20Portugal">constitution</a> to convert its possessions in India into Portuguese provinces. In July 1954, an uprising in Dadra and Nagar Haveli threw off Portuguese rule. The Portuguese attempted to send forces from Daman to reoccupy the enclaves, but were prevented from doing so by Indian troops. Portugal initiated proceedings before the <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Justice">International Court of Justice</a> to compel India to allow its troops access to the enclave, but the Court rejected its complaint in 1960, holding that India was within its rights in denying Portugal military access. In 1961, the Constitution of India was amended to incorporate Dadra and Nagar Haveli into India as a Union Territory.

Goa, Daman and Diu remained an outstanding issue. On 15 August 1955, five thousand non-violent demonstrators marched against the Portuguese at the border, and were met with gunfire, killing 22. In December 1960, the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> rejected Portugal's contention that its overseas possessions were provinces, and formally listed them as "non-self-governing territories". Although Nehru continued to favour a negotiated solution, the Portuguese suppression of a revolt in <a href="Angola">Angola</a> in 1961 radicalised Indian public opinion, and increased the pressure on the Government of India to take military action. African leaders, too, put pressure on Nehru to take action in Goa, which they argued would save Africa from further horrors. On 18 December 1961, following the collapse of an American attempt to find a negotiated solution, the Indian Army entered Portuguese India and defeated the Portuguese garrisons there. The Portuguese took the matter to the <a href="Security%20Council">Security Council</a> but a resolution calling on India to withdraw its troops immediately was defeated by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">USSR</a>'s <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20veto%20power">veto</a>. Portugal surrendered on 19 December. This take-over ended the last of the European colonies in India. <a href="Indian%20annexation%20of%20Goa">Goa was incorporated</a> into India as a centrally administered union territory and, in 1987, became a state.

Three princely states bordering India—<a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> and <a href="Sikkim">Sikkim</a>—were not integrated into the Republic of India in the period between 1947 and 1950. Nepal had been recognised by the British and the Government of India as being "de jure" independent. Bhutan had in the British period been considered a <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> outside the international frontier of India. The Government of India entered into a treaty with Bhutan in 1949 continuing this arrangement, and providing that Bhutan would abide by the advice of the Government of India in the conduct of its external affairs.

Historically, Sikkim was a British <a href="Dependent%20territory">dependency</a>, with a status similar to that of the other princely states, and was therefore considered to be within the frontiers of India in the colonial period. On independence, however, the <a href="Chogyal">Chogyal</a> of Sikkim resisted full integration into India. Given the region's strategic importance to India, the Government of India signed first a Standstill Agreement and then in 1950 a full treaty with the Chogyal of Sikkim which in effect made it a protectorate which was no longer part of India. India had responsibility for defence, external affairs and communications, and ultimate responsibility for law and order, but Sikkim was otherwise given full internal autonomy. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Chogyal <a href="Palden%20Thondup%20Namgyal">Palden Thondup Namgyal</a>, supported by the minority <a href="Bhutia">Bhutia</a> and <a href="Lepcha%20people">Lepcha</a> upper classes, attempted to negotiate greater powers, particularly over external affairs, to give Sikkim more of an international personality. These policies were opposed by <a href="Kazi%20Lhendup%20Dorji">Kazi Lhendup Dorji</a> and the <a href="Sikkim%20State%20Congress">Sikkim State Congress</a>, who represented the ethnic <a href="People%20of%20Nepal">Nepali</a> middle classes and took a more pro-Indian view.

In April 1973, anti-Chogyal agitation broke out and protestors demanded popular elections. The Sikkim police were unable to control the demonstrations, and Dorji asked India to exercise its responsibility for law and order and intervene. India facilitated negotiations between the Chogyal and Dorji, and produced an agreement, which envisaged the reduction of the Chogyal to the role of a <a href="constitutional%20monarch">constitutional monarch</a> and the holding of elections based on a new ethnic power-sharing formula. The Chogyal's opponents won an overwhelming victory, and a new Constitution was drafted providing for Sikkim to be associated with the Republic of India. On 10 April 1975, the Sikkim Assembly passed a resolution calling for the state to be fully integrated into India. This resolution was endorsed by 97 percent of the vote in a referendum held on 14 April 1975, following which the Indian Parliament amended the constitution to admit Sikkim into India as its 22nd state.

While the majority of princely states absorbed into India have been fully integrated, a few outstanding issues remain. The most prominent of these is in relation to Kashmir, where a <a href="Kashmir%20conflict">violent secessionist insurgency</a> has been raging since the late 1980s.

Some academics suggest that the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly a result of the manner in which it was integrated into India. Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for. Instead, the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir</a> and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the <a href="politics%20of%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">politics of Jammu and Kashmir</a>. The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the "status quo" felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active insurgency.

Separatist movements also exist in two other former princely states located in Northeast India—Tripura and <a href="Manipur">Manipur</a>. These separatist movements are generally treated by scholars as being part of the broader problem of <a href="Insurgent%20groups%20in%20Northeast%20India">insurgencies in North-east India</a>, rather being a result of specific problems in integrating the princely states into India, as the Kashmir problem is and, in particular, to reflect the failure of the Government of India to adequately address the aspirations of tribal groups in the Northeast, or to tackle the tensions arising from the immigration of people from other parts of India to the north-eastern areas.

The integration of former princely states with other provinces to form new states has also given rise to some issues. The <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a> region, comprising the <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>-speaking districts of the former Hyderabad State, were in many ways different from the Telugu-speaking areas of British India with which they were merged. In recognition of these differences, the <a href="States%20Reorganisation%20Commission">States Reorganisation Commission</a> originally recommended that Telangana be created as a separate state, rather than as part of a broader Telugu-speaking entity. This recommendation was rejected by the Government of India, and Telangana was merged into <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. The result was the emergence in the 1960s of a movement demanding a separate Telangana state. The demand has been accepted by the Union Government, leading to formation of Telangana as the 29th state of India in June 2014. A similar movement, although less strong, exists in the <a href="Vidarbha">Vidarbha</a> region of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>, which consists of the former <a href="Nagpur%20state">Nagpur state</a> and the <a href="Berar%20Division">Berar</a> region of the former Hyderabad state.

The integration process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported the right of the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the <a href="Government%20of%20Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a> accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as "de jure" Pakistani territory.

Different theories have been proposed to explain the designs of Indian and Pakistani leaders in this period. <a href="Rajmohan%20Gandhi">Rajmohan Gandhi</a> postulates that an ideal deal working in the mind of Patel was that if Muhammad Ali Jinnah let India have Junagadh and Hyderabad, Patel would not object to Kashmir acceding to Pakistan. In his book "Patel: A Life", Gandhi asserts that Jinnah sought to engage the questions of Junagadh and Hyderabad in the same battle. It is suggested that he wanted India to ask for a plebiscite in Junagadh and Hyderabad, knowing thus that the principle then would have to be applied to Kashmir, where the Muslim-majority would, he believed, vote for Pakistan. A speech by Patel at the Bahauddin College in Junagadh following the latter's take-over, where he said that "we would agree to Kashmir if they agreed to Hyderabad", suggests that he may have been amenable to this idea. Although Patel's opinions were not India's policy, nor were they shared by Nehru, both leaders were angered at Jinnah's courting the princes of Jodhpur, Bhopal and Indore, leading them to take a harder stance on a possible deal with Pakistan.

Modern historians have also re-examined the role of the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the accession process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and <a href="cession">cession</a> of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion. Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a moral obligation to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, one of the reasons why the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option. Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the <a href="British%20Empire">Empire</a> had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century—unite all of India under one rule.

Fly Club

The Fly Club is a <a href="final%20club">final club</a>, traditionally "punching" (inviting to stand for election) male undergraduates of <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a> during their sophomore or junior year. Undergraduate and graduate members participate in club activities.

Founded 1836 as a literary society by the editors of "<a href="Harvardiana">Harvardiana</a>", the club was granted a charter by the <a href="Alpha%20Delta%20Phi">Alpha Delta Phi</a> fraternity in 1837 and remained a chapter until surrendering its charter in 1865. With the graduation of the members of the class of 1868, the club was discontinued until 1878, when graduate members, including <a href="Edward%20Everett%20Hale">Edward Everett Hale</a> (class of 1839) and <a href="Phillips%20Brooks">Phillips Brooks</a> (class of 1855), initiated undergraduates from the class of 1879, to whom the old charter was restored. In 1906, the charter was once again surrendered, and in 1910, the organization officially adopted the name "Fly Club," its unofficial title since 1885. In 1996, the Fly Club merged with the DU Club, another final club, and the combined entity retained the name "Fly Club." 

Some sources maintain that the club's name was derived by combining the "PH" from "Alpha," the "l" from "Delta," and the "i" from "Phi," to get "Phli," pronounced "Fly".

The club motto, suggested by Prof. <a href="Morris%20H.%20Morgan">Morris H. Morgan</a> (class of 1881) and adopted Feb. 1902, reads DURATURIS HAUD DURIS VINCULIS, an ablative absolute construction translated as "Bonds should be lasting, not chafing or hard."

Constructed in 1896, with brick facade added in 1902, the Fly clubhouse is located at Two Holyoke Place, near Harvard Square, along the "Gold Coast" of formerly private residences that now comprise Harvard's <a href="Adams%20House%20%28Harvard%20University%29">Adams House</a> (completed 1932) The Fly sits in front of Harvard's <a href="Lowell%20House">Lowell House</a> (1930), across Mt. Auburn St. from the <a href="Harvard%20Lampoon%20building">Harvard Lampoon building</a> (1909).

The Fly Club Gate is located along the exterior of <a href="Winthrop%20House">Winthrop House</a>. An <a href="English%20Baroque">English Baroque</a> structure, the gate was built in 1914 by a grant from members of the Fly Club. The Fly's symbol, a "leopard rampant gardant" (known as the "Kitty"), is centered within the ironwork above the entry. Inscribed below is a dedication: "For Friendships Made in College the Fly Club in Gratitude has Built this Gate."

<doc id="3454180" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3454180" title="Hurricane Charley (1986)">
Hurricane Charley (1986)

Hurricane Charley was the first hurricane to threaten the East Coast of the United States since <a href="Hurricane%20Gloria">Hurricane Gloria</a> the <a href="1985%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">previous year</a>. The third tropical storm and second hurricane of the season, Charley formed as a <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical low</a> on August 13 along the Florida panhandle. After moving off the coast of South Carolina, the system transitioned into a tropical cyclone and intensified into a tropical storm on August 15. Charley later attained hurricane status before moving across eastern North Carolina. It gradually weakened over the north Atlantic Ocean before transitioning into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> on August 20. Charley's remnants remained identifiable for over a week until after crossing the British Isles and dissipating on August 30.

The storm brought light to moderate precipitation to much of the southeastern United States. In Georgia and South Carolina, the rainfall alleviated drought conditions. In North Carolina, where the hurricane made landfall, tidal flooding and downed trees were the primary impacts. The storm brought high winds to southeastern Virginia, where 110,000 people were left without power. Minor damage extended along the Atlantic coastline northward through Massachusetts. One traffic fatality was reported each in North Carolina and Virginia. Three people in Maryland died due to a plane crash related to the storm. Throughout the United States, Hurricane Charley caused an estimated <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>15 million in damage (). One person drowned in Newfoundland.

As an extratropical cyclone, Charley brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom, causing at least 11 deaths. In Ireland, the rainfall set records for 24-hour totals, including an accumulation of more than 7.8 in (200 mm) which set the record for the greatest daily rainfall total in the country. In the country, the rainfall caused widespread flooding, causing two rivers to exceed their banks. In the Dublin area, 451 buildings were flooded, some up to a depth of 8 ft (2.4 m). In the United Kingdom, the storm flooded rivers and brought down trees and power lines.

Hurricane Charley originated in an area of <a href="atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> associated with a <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> of low pressure first observed on August 11 across southern Florida and the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The area of disturbed weather spread northward, spawning a broad <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure area</a> on August 12. Moving northward over the Florida panhandle, the low became slightly better organized as it merged with a weakening <a href="weather%20front">weather front</a>. On August 13, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) identified the system as a developing <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical low</a> near <a href="Apalachee%20Bay">Apalachee Bay</a> along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The agency defines a subtropical cyclone as "a non-frontal low pressure system that has characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones."

After becoming a subtropical low, the cyclone tracked northeastward through Georgia, before turning eastward and exiting South Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean. Its track was influenced by the western periphery of the <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a>, which is a large belt of <a href="high-pressure%20area">high pressure</a>. While moving over land, the cyclone had become better organized, and on August 15 it <a href="Tropical%20cyclogenesis">transitioned</a> into a tropical depression about 70 miles (110 kilometres) southeast of <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. The depression strengthened further, and based on reports from the <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a>, it intensified into Tropical Storm Charley late on August 15. With a weak <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to its north, the storm initially tracked slowly eastward just off the coast of North Carolina, before turning to the north-northeast as a trough approached from the west. A broad cyclone, Charley gradually intensified, and a single ring of convection around the center developed into an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eyewall</a>. At 1200 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on August 17, it attained hurricane status about 13 mi (21 km) off the North Carolina coastline. About two hours later, Hurricane Charley made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near Cape Lookout, and it subsequently moved across the eastern portion of the state.

Hurricane Charley did not weaken while moving over land; instead, it intensified, attaining peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the North Carolina–Virginia border. Within 12 hours of reaching peak intensity, however, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status. The approaching trough, which had previously caused Charley to turn northward, forced the hurricane to accelerate northeastward and later eastward, bringing the storm about 80 mi (130 km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts on August 19. As the trough was not very strong, Charley slowly underwent the process of <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical transition</a>, unlike other tropical cyclones that complete the transition much quicker with a stronger trough. As a result, the storm maintained hybrid, or subtropical characteristics for several days. By August 21, Charley completed the transition south of Atlantic Canada.

After becoming extratropical, Charley re-intensified under <a href="Baroclinity">baroclinic instability</a>. The resulting storm was a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">atmospheric pressure</a> of 980 <a href="bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a>, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. While in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.

As the hurricane paralleled the east coast of the United States and its exact track and strength were uncertain, there were several <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">tropical cyclone warnings and watches</a> issued in association with Charley; in a post-storm analysis, the NHC described "the complication of the warning process for this type of situation." Initially, the storm was not expected to affect land. In its first advisory on Charley, the NHC issued a 22% probability of Charley passing within 65 mi (105 km) of land; specifically, it was predicted to be closest to the South Carolina coastline. About 16 hours prior to the hurricane's landfall, the NHC issued a gale warning between <a href="Bogue%20Banks">Bogue Inlet</a> and <a href="Oregon%20Inlet">Oregon Inlet</a> along the North Carolina coastline, including the <a href="Pamlico%20Sound">Pamlico Sound</a>. When the storm's intensification and track close to land became apparent, the gale warning was replaced by a hurricane warning, and additional gale warnings were issued westward to <a href="Topsail%20Beach%2C%20North%20Carolina">Topsail Beach</a> and northward to <a href="Virginia%20Beach%2C%20Virginia">Virginia Beach, Virginia</a>. Up to 10,000 people evacuated the Outer Banks, which resulted in traffic jams on roadways heading out of the area. <a href="Ocracoke%2C%20North%20Carolina">Ocracoke</a> island was partially evacuated by six ferries, although many people were unable to leave and instead rode out the storm on the island.

Hurricane Charley affected at least ten U.S. states, resulting in five total deaths and $15 million in damage (1986 USD). The precursor disturbance to Charley brought rainfall to much of Florida, including a total of 8.61 inches (219 millimetres) in <a href="Steinhatchee%2C%20Florida">Steinhatchee</a>; that rainfall maxima was the greatest total associated with Charley within the United States. The system also produced light to moderate rainfall across Georgia and South Carolina, which proved beneficial as the region was in a major drought. However, its heaviest rainfall remained over open waters.

Moving across eastern North Carolina as a minimal hurricane, Charley produced locally strong wind gusts, peaking at 80 mph (130 km/h) in <a href="Frisco%2C%20North%20Carolina">Frisco</a>. However, no stations recorded sustained winds of hurricane force. The cyclone dropped rainfall along the coastline, amounting to over 7 in (175 mm) near <a href="Manteo%2C%20North%20Carolina">Manteo</a>. As it moved ashore, the storm generated high tides reaching 5.78 <a href="foot%20%28unit%29">feet</a> (1.76 metres) at the <a href="Duck%2C%20North%20Carolina">Duck Coe fishing pier</a>. Near Cape Hatteras, a woman drowned while attempting to drive through a flooded roadway. The hurricane's passage left roads and bridges flooded with up to of water, including a portion of <a href="North%20Carolina%20Highway%2012">North Carolina Highway 12</a> on <a href="Hatteras%20Island">Hatteras Island</a>. Across the Outer Banks, the storm left about 8,000 people without power, but damage was minimal and limited to shingles and roofs. Impact in the state was primarily caused by tidal flooding and downed trees, and a preliminary damage estimate placed total monetary losses at $400,000 (1986 USD).

As Charley moved across eastern North Carolina, hurricane warnings were extended northward, first to Virginia Beach; they were later extended to <a href="Cape%20Charles%2C%20Virginia">Cape Charles</a>, then to the Maryland/Delaware border, and ultimately as far north as <a href="Sandy%20Hook%2C%20New%20Jersey">Sandy Hook, New Jersey</a>. Prior to its arrival, the storm resulted in the closure of <a href="Norfolk%20International%20Airport">Norfolk International Airport</a>, and more than 9,000 people evacuated the coastline for emergency shelters. Tropical storm force winds spread across southeastern Virginia, with wind gusts reaching 82 mph (133 km/h) on Cape Charles. Offshore, a station on the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay%20Bridge%E2%80%93Tunnel">Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel</a> recorded sustained winds of 97 mph (157 km/h) with gusts to 104 mph (168 km/h). After the gust, the bridge-tunnel was closed overnight. The winds downed many trees, and in Norfolk, a motorist died after crashing into a downed tree. In Virginia Beach, the winds blew off the roof of a hotel and destroyed two homes under construction. Across the area, the storm left about 110,000 customers without power. Rainfall in Virginia was fairly light, including a 24-hour total of just over 1 in (25 mm) in Norfolk. Strong waves destroyed 250 ft (76 m) of Harrison's Pier in Norfolk. A preliminary damage estimate for the area was $1 million (1986 USD).

Thunderstorms to the north of the circulation brought moderate rainfall to Maryland; the same thunderstorms caused a light aircraft to crash near Baltimore, resulting in the death of its three occupants. Rainfall spread across much of Maryland, peaking at 4.24 in (105 mm) in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Maryland">Hollywood</a>. Tropical storm force winds extended into Delaware, and a peak wind gust of 75 mph (121 km/h) was reported in <a href="Rehoboth%20Beach%2C%20Delaware">Rehoboth Beach</a>. Only isolated and minor damage occurred in Maryland and Delaware. In New Jersey, a hurricane force wind gust was reported on <a href="Long%20Beach%20Island">Long Beach Island</a>, and 1.3 in (33 mm) of rainfall was reported in <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City</a>. In the southernmost counties in the state, the winds left about 15,000 electrical customers without power. In New York, after <a href="Hurricane%20Gloria">Hurricane Gloria</a> in the previous season left thousands of customers without power, the Long Island Lighting Co. arranged for additional workers for potential power restoration. Light rainfall and gusty winds extended into the New York metropolitan area.

Officials issued gale warnings through <a href="Chatham%2C%20Massachusetts">Chatham, Massachusetts</a>, including <a href="Martha%27s%20Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a> and <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a>. As Charley passed south of Massachusetts, it produced precipitation in the southeastern portion of the state. Nantucket reported 3.20 in (81 mm) of rainfall, and Chatham recorded 2.68 in (68 mm) in a 24-hour period. Nantucket also reported sustained winds of 60 mph (96 km/h), and as the storm passed the island it produced a storm tide of 3.5–4 ft (1–1.2 m). High tides and heavy rain caused significant street flooding on Nantucket. Several boats were damaged, others were beached, and one large boat sunk in Nantucket Harbor. Damage on the island $75,000 (1986 USD).

Before becoming extratropical, the storm brushed the coast of Nova Scotia with wind gusts of 65 mph (105 km/h) and moderate precipitation totaling 4.57 in (116 mm). Strong waves damaged several boats along the coasts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, killing one person in <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's, Newfoundland</a>.

After Charley became extratropical, the United Kingdom <a href="Met%20Office">Met Office</a> issued weather alerts prior to the arrival of the storm, noting the potential for "extremely heavy rainfall [which would] cause local flooding." In the United Kingdom, the threat of the storm resulted in the cancellation of ferry service between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, as well between Great Britain and France. The extratropical remnants of Hurricane Charley moved across Ireland and United Kingdom with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm's rainfall significantly affected most of both countries, with the exception of Scotland in the United Kingdom. In the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, waves up to 26 ft (8 m) in height breached and flooded a ship; the 31 passengers on board were rescued by helicopters and other ships. Throughout the region, the storm resulted in at least 11 deaths.
First passing just south of <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> on August 25, the storm dropped heavy rainfall and brought strong winds, significantly affecting the coastline where winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) were reported. Rainfall spread across the entire country, peaking at 11.0 in (280 mm) in <a href="Kippure">Kippure</a> mountain. There, a station reported more than 7.8 in (200 mm) in 24 hours, which set the record for the greatest daily rainfall total in the country. Several 24-hour rainfall records were set during the storm, and new six-hour and twelve-hour record totals at <a href="Casement%20Aerodrome">Casement Aerodrome</a> were set with 1.63 in (41.5 mm) and 2.61 in (66.2 mm), respectively. The rainfall left some areas flooded, particularly in the Dublin area where 451 buildings were inundated, some up to a depth of 8 ft (2.4 m). Preliminarily, it was described as the worst flooding in the <a href="history%20of%20Dublin">history of Dublin</a>. Two small rivers, the <a href="River%20Dodder">Dodder</a> and the <a href="River%20Dargle">Dargle</a>, overflowed their banks due to the rainfall. The River Dargle overflowed in <a href="Bray%2C%20County%20Wicklow">Bray</a>, flooding some areas up to a depth of 5 ft (1.5 m) and forcing about 1,000 people to evacuate; several special-needs people were evacuated by boat. The flood, which originated about one mile north of the town, damaged over 500 houses and brought down several trees. Despite local politicians promising for flood protection after the flood, the town remained vulnerable to such flooding at least 20 years after the storm. The River Dodder, which also overflowed, nearly exceeded the reservoir dam in Bohernabreena in <a href="South%20Dublin">South Dublin</a> (flooding of the Dodder has been a periodic problem for centuries). Additional <a href="spillway">spillway</a>s were later added in the event of another similar flood. In the <a href="Wicklow%20Mountains">Wicklow Mountains</a>, the rainfall resulted in significant <a href="Surface%20runoff">runoff</a>, which caused erosion along the Cloghoge River. The passage of the storm left heavy crop damage, part of a larger period of poor agriculture in the country. Throughout the country, the storm caused at least thirteen deaths, four of which were drownings in flooded rivers; one death was caused by a heart attack while being evacuated from flooding. Two months after the storm struck, the government of Ireland allocated <a href="Irish%20pound">IR£</a>6,449,000 (1986 <a href="Irish%20pound">IEP</a>, $8,650,000 1986 USD) to repair roads and bridges damaged by the weather system.

The storm also affected the United Kingdom as it moved across the southern portion of the country. In <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, Charley produced record-breaking daily rainfall, which surpassed 4 inches (100 mm) in <a href="Dyfed">Dyfed</a>. Some locations received <a href="Return%20period">hundred-year rainfall</a>. The storm struck the area during the <a href="Late%20Summer%20Bank%20Holiday">Late Summer Bank Holiday</a>, creating unfavorable conditions for driving and resulting in several accidents. Heavy rainfall flooded rivers, which swept away several people. This prompted officials to deploy boats and helicopters to assist in rescues, although at least three deaths were reported due to drowning in the rivers. Severe flooding was reported in <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a> and <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>. The storm also left roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines. At the start of the storm, the inaugural Birmingham Super Prix motorsport race was just getting underway but poor visibility from precipitation contributed to an accident which temporarily called halt to proceedings. In <a href="Whitland">Whitland</a>, Wales, local soldiers assisted rescuing people, and later contributed to the cleanup of the town. Throughout the country, five people were missing after the storm, all of whom are presumed to have drowned; an additional death was confirmed in <a href="Newry">Newry</a>, <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.

Tom Driberg

Thomas Edward Neil Driberg, Baron Bradwell (22 May 1905 – 12 August 1976) was a British journalist, politician, <a href="High%20church">High Anglican churchman</a> and possible <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> spy, who served as a <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) from 1942–55, and again from 1959–74. A member of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> for more than twenty years, he was first elected to parliament as an Independent, and joined the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> in 1945. He never held any ministerial office, but rose to senior positions within the Labour Party and was a popular and influential figure in <a href="left-wing%20politics">left-wing politics</a> for many years.

The son of a retired colonial officer, Driberg was educated at <a href="Lancing%20College">Lancing</a> and <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>. After leaving the university without a degree, he attempted to establish himself as a poet before joining the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" as a reporter, later becoming a columnist. In 1933 he began the <a href="William%20Hickey%20%28columnist%29">"William Hickey" society column</a>, which he continued to write until 1943. He was later a regular columnist for the <a href="Co-operative%20Group">Co-operative Group</a> newspaper "<a href="Reynold%27s%20News">Reynold's News</a>" and for other left-leaning journals. He wrote several books, including biographies of the press baron <a href="Max%20Aitken%2C%201st%20Baron%20Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a> and the Soviet spy <a href="Guy%20Burgess">Guy Burgess</a>. He retired from the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> in 1974, and was subsequently raised to the peerage as Baron Bradwell, of <a href="Bradwell%20juxta%20Mare">Bradwell juxta Mare</a> in the County of Essex.

Driberg made no secret of his homosexuality, which he practised throughout his life despite its being a criminal offence in Britain until 1967; his ability to avoid any consequences for his risky and often brazen behaviour baffled his friends and colleagues. Always in search of bizarre experiences, Driberg befriended at various times the occultist <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> and the <a href="Kray%20twins">Kray twins</a>, along with honoured and respected figures in the worlds of literature and politics. He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to <a href="Anglo-Catholicism">Anglo-Catholicism</a>. After his death, allegations were published about his role over many years as an <a href="MI5">MI5</a> informant, a <a href="KGB">KGB</a> agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.

Driberg was born on 22 May 1905 in <a href="Crowborough">Crowborough</a>, a small <a href="commuter%20town">dormitory town</a> about south of London. He was the third and youngest of three sons born to John James Street Driberg, a former officer in the <a href="Indian%20Civil%20Service">Indian Civil Service</a>, and his wife Amy Mary Irving Driberg (née Bell). The Driberg family had immigrated from Holland about 200 years previously; the Bells were lowland Scots from <a href="Dumfriesshire">Dumfriesshire</a>. John Driberg had retired in 1896 after 35 years in <a href="Assam">Assam</a>, latterly as head of the state's police, and was 65 years old when his youngest son was born. For Tom Driberg, growing up mostly alone with his elderly parents was a stifling experience; he would later describe Crowborough as "a place which I can never revisit, or think of, without a feeling of sick horror".

At the age of eight Driberg began as a day-boy at the Grange school in Crowborough. In his autobiography he mentions in particular two aspects of his time there: learning the "facts of life" from other boys, with extensive experimentation, and his discovery of what he calls "exotic" religion—<a href="High%20church">High Anglicanism</a>. These experiences formed what he called two "conflicting compulsions", soon to be joined by a third—<a href="left-wing%20politics">left-wing politics</a>—to shape the ruling passions of his life.

In 1918, when he was 13, Driberg left the Grange for <a href="Lancing%20College">Lancing College</a>, the public school on the south coast where, after some initial bullying and humiliation, he was befriended by fellow-pupil <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>. Under Waugh's sponsorship Driberg joined an intellectual society, the Dilettanti, which promoted literary and artistic activities alongside political debate. He began to write poetry; his aesthetic education was further assisted by the charismatic <a href="J.%20F.%20Roxburgh">J. F. Roxburgh</a>, "a magnetically brilliant teacher" who later became headmaster of <a href="Stowe%20School">Stowe School</a>. 

Lancing's <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> chapel gave Driberg the religious atmosphere he sought, though he found the services disappointingly "moderate". By 1920 he was inclining to the political left and was in rebellion against his conservative upbringing. Finding the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> too dull and respectable for his radical tastes, he joined the Brighton branch of the newly formed <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">British Communist Party</a>.

After Driberg had risen to responsible positions within the school (deputy head boy, head librarian, and chief <a href="sacristan">sacristan</a>, among others), his Lancing career ended suddenly in the autumn of 1923, when two boys complained about his sexual overtures. To avoid distressing the widowed Amy Driberg (John Driberg had died in 1919), the headmaster allowed him to remain in the school for the remainder of the term, stripped of his offices and segregated from all social contact with other boys. At the end of the term he was required to leave, on the pretext that he needed private tuition to pass his <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a> entrance examination which he had failed the previous summer. Back in Crowborough, after several months' hard application under the guidance of his tutor, the future <a href="Colin%20Pearson%2C%20Baron%20Pearson">Lord Justice Pearson</a>, Driberg won a <a href="classics">classics</a> scholarship to <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>.

Oxford in 1924 featured an <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> aesthetic movement in which personalities such as <a href="Harold%20Acton">Harold Acton</a>, <a href="Brian%20Howard%20%28poet%29">Brian Howard</a>, <a href="Cyril%20Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a> and, a little later, <a href="W.%20H.%20Auden">W. H. Auden</a> were leading lights. Driberg was soon immersed in a world of art, politics, poetry and parties: "There was just no time for any academic work", he wrote later. With Auden, he discovered <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s "<a href="The%20Waste%20Land">The Waste Land</a>", which they read again and again, "with growing awe". A poem by Driberg, in the style of <a href="Edith%20Sitwell">Edith Sitwell</a>, was published in "Oxford Poetry 1926"; when Sitwell came to Oxford to deliver a lecture, Driberg invited her to have tea with him, and she accepted. After her lecture he found an opportunity to recite one of his own poems, and was rewarded when Sitwell declared him "the hope of English poetry".

Meanwhile, together with the future historian <a href="A.%20J.%20P.%20Taylor">A. J. P. Taylor</a>, Driberg formed the membership of the Oxford University Communist Party. During the <a href="General%20Strike%20of%201926">General Strike of May 1926</a>, most Oxford students supported the government and enrolled as special constables and strike-breakers. A minority, which included the future <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> leader <a href="Hugh%20Gaitskell">Hugh Gaitskell</a> and the future <a href="Poet%20Laureate">Poet Laureate</a> <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a>, sided with the strikers, while Driberg and Taylor offered their services at the British Communist Party's headquarters in London. The Party showed no urgency to employ them, and Taylor soon left. Driberg, given a job distributing strike bulletins, was arrested by the police before he could begin and was detained for several hours. This ended his active role in the strike. Notwithstanding his extreme left-wing associations, he secured 75 votes (against the winner's 152) in the 1927 elections for the presidency of the <a href="Oxford%20Union">Oxford Union</a>.

Throughout his time at Oxford, Driberg followed his passion for Anglican rituals by regularly attending Mass at <a href="Pusey%20House%2C%20Oxford">Pusey House</a>, an independent religious institution with a mission to "[restore] the Church of England's Catholic life and witness". In spite of the prevalent Oxford homoerotic ethos, his sexual energies were largely devoted to casual encounters with working-class men, rather than to relationships with his fellow undergraduates. He experienced sexual relations with only one <a href="University%20don">don</a>, whom he met outside the university, unaware of the latter's identity.

One of Driberg's elaborate hoaxes was a concert called "Homage to Beethoven", which featured megaphones, typewriters and a flushing lavatory. Newspaper accounts of this event raised the interest of the occultist <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>. Driberg accepted an invitation to lunch with Crowley for the first of several meetings between them, at one of which Crowley nominated Driberg as his successor as World Teacher. Nothing came of the proposal, though the two continued to meet; Driberg received from Crowley manuscripts and books that he later sold for sizeable sums. These various extracurricular activities resulted in neglect of his academic work. He failed his final examinations and, in the summer of 1927, he left Oxford without a degree.

After leaving Oxford, Driberg lived precariously in London, attempting to establish himself as a poet while doing odd jobs and pawning his few valuables. Occasionally he had chance encounters with Oxford acquaintances; Evelyn Waugh's diary entry for 30 October 1927 records: "I went to church in <a href="All%20Saints%2C%20Margaret%20Street">Margaret Street</a> where I was discomposed to observe Tom Driberg's satanic face in the congregation". Driberg had maintained his contact with Edith Sitwell, and attended regular literary tea parties at her <a href="Bayswater">Bayswater</a> flat. When Sitwell discovered her protégé's impoverished circumstances she arranged an interview for him with the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>". After his submission of an article on London's nightlife, he was engaged in January 1928 for a six-week trial as a reporter; coincidentally, Waugh had undergone an unsuccessful trial with the same newspaper a few months earlier.

Within a month of beginning his duties, Driberg achieved a scoop with the first national newspaper reports of the activities in Oxford of the American evangelist <a href="Frank%20Buchman">Frank Buchman</a>, whose movement would in time be known as <a href="Moral%20Re-Armament">Moral Re-Armament</a>. Driberg's reports were generally abrasive, even mocking in tone, and drew complaints from Buchman's organisation about news bias. The trial period at the "Express" was extended, and in July 1928 Driberg filed an exclusive report on a society party at the swimming baths in Buckingham Palace Road, where the guests included <a href="Lytton%20Strachey">Lytton Strachey</a> and <a href="Tallulah%20Bankhead">Tallulah Bankhead</a>. This evidence of Driberg's social contacts led to a permanent contract with the "Express", as assistant to Percy Sewell who, under the name "The Dragoman", wrote a daily feature called "The Talk of London". Driberg later defended his association with an inconsequential society column by arguing that his approach was satirical, and that he deliberately exaggerated the doings of the idle rich as a way of enraging working-class opinion and helping the Communist Party.

Driberg used the column to introduce readers to up-and-coming socialites and literary figures, <a href="Harold%20Acton">Acton</a>, <a href="John%20Betjeman">Betjeman</a>, <a href="Nancy%20Mitford">Nancy Mitford</a> and <a href="Peter%20Quennell">Peter Quennell</a> among them. Sometimes he introduced more serious causes: capital punishment, modern architecture, the works of <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a> and <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Jacob Epstein</a>, and the lesbian novel "<a href="The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness">The Well of Loneliness</a>" by <a href="Radclyffe%20Hall">Radclyffe Hall</a>, which had been denounced in the "Express" editorial columns as "infamous". By prior arrangement with Waugh, the column included a discreet announcement in September 1930 of Waugh's conversion to <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a>; Driberg was his only guest at the service. He further assisted Waugh in 1932 by giving him space in the column to attack the editor of the Catholic journal "<a href="The%20Tablet">The Tablet</a>", after it had described Waugh's "<a href="Black%20Mischief">Black Mischief</a>" as blasphemous.

Sewell retired in 1932, leaving Driberg in sole charge of "The Talk of London" column. He grew increasingly frustrated with the trivial nature of his work. Following the intervention of "Express" proprietor <a href="Max%20Aitken%2C%201st%20Baron%20Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a>, the column was relaunched in May 1933 as "These Names Make News", and its <a href="by-line">by-line</a> changed to "<a href="William%20Hickey%20%28columnist%29">William Hickey</a>", after the 18th century diarist and rake. Driberg described the new feature as "...an intimate biographical column about ... men and women who matter. Artists, statesmen, airmen, writers, financiers, explorers..." Historian <a href="David%20Kynaston">David Kynaston</a> calls Driberg the "founder of the modern gossip column", although it soon began to move decisively away from chit-chat and towards social and political issues. The tone of the column was described by Driberg's <a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">ODNB</a> biographer <a href="Richard%20Davenport-Hines">Richard Davenport-Hines</a> as "wry, compassionate, and brimm[ing] with ... open-minded intelligence".

Beaverbrook, who had developed a fondness for Driberg, was amused by the disparity between his columnist's professed left-wing sympathies and "bon vivant" lifestyle. The proprietor knew of Driberg's persistent mismanagement of his personal finances, and on various occasions helped out with loans and gifts. During his time in London, Driberg had continued to indulge his taste for rough, casual sex; his memoir records many such instances. In the autumn of 1935 he was charged with indecent assault, after an incident in which he had shared his bed with two Scotsmen picked up late one night, in the bohemian district of London which Driberg had christened "<a href="Fitzrovia">Fitzrovia</a>" in the Hickey column. Beaverbrook paid for a leading counsel, <a href="James%20Cassels%20%28politician%29">J. D. Cassels</a>, and two unimpeachable character witnesses were recruited by the defence. Driberg was acquitted, and Beaverbrook's influence ensured that the case went unreported by the press. This was the first known instance of what writer <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a> called the "baffling immunity [Driberg] enjoyed from the law and the Press to the end of his days".

In the latter part of the 1930s Driberg travelled widely: twice to Spain, to observe the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, to Germany after the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> of 1938, to Rome for the coronation of <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a> and to New York for the <a href="1939%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair">1939 New York World's Fair</a>. After the <a href="Nazi-Soviet%20Pact">Nazi-Soviet Pact</a> was announced in August 1939, he informed his readers that there would be "no war this crisis". Nine days later, after the German invasion of Poland precipitated the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, he apologised for his mistake, and ended his first wartime column with the words "We're all in it". His opposition to the Nazi-Soviet Pact and his support for the war in September 1939 may have been the reason for his expulsion from the Communist Party in 1941. An alternative explanation, proffered later, is that he was reported by <a href="Anthony%20Blunt">Anthony Blunt</a> for passing information on the Party to <a href="Maxwell%20Knight">Maxwell Knight</a> of MI5. Driberg and Knight were long-standing acquaintances who met frequently and, among other things, shared a mutual interest in the works of <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>.

Driberg's mother had died in July 1939. With his share of her money and the help of a substantial mortgage, he bought and renovated Bradwell Lodge, a country house in <a href="Bradwell-on-Sea">Bradwell-on-Sea</a> on the <a href="Essex">Essex</a> coast, where he lived and entertained until the house was requisitioned by the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) in 1940. He continued to write the Hickey column, not always to his editor's satisfaction; his protestations against indiscriminate bombing of German civilians were particularly frowned on. In November 1941 he went to America and was in Washington on Monday 8 December, after the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, to report <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">President Roosevelt</a>'s speech to <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">Congress</a> announcing America's entry into the war.

When Driberg returned to Britain in March 1942 he found widespread public dissatisfaction with the government's conduct of the war. This mood was reflected in a series of parliamentary <a href="by-elections">by-elections</a> in which candidates supporting the wartime <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a> were defeated by Independents — the major parties had agreed to a pact under which they would not contest by-elections in seats held by their respective parties. Driberg, in his column, generally welcomed this trend, while questioning "the merit of some of the candidates likely to get in if the reaction against the Party machines continues". On 12 May 1942 the death was announced of <a href="Sir%20Edward%20Ruggles-Brise%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Edward Ruggles-Brise</a>, the Conservative member for <a href="Maldon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Maldon</a>—the constituency in which Bradwell Lodge was situated. Next day, Driberg requested three weeks' leave from his column to fight the <a href="Maldon%20by-election%2C%201942">by-election</a>. Contrary to the belief of prime minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and others that Driberg was being "run" by Beaverbrook, the "Express" proprietor was unenthusiastic; an <a href="editorial">editorial</a> on 25 May drew attention to Driberg's individual viewpoint and stated that "The "Daily Express" does not support his candidature".
Driberg's campaign slogan was "A Candid Friend For Churchill", personally supportive but critical of many of the prime minister's circle. The lacklustre campaign of his <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right-wing</a> Conservative opponent helped to secure Driberg a wide range of support, from moderate Conservatives, <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberals</a> and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">socialists</a>. His fame as "William Hickey", and his stance as the only candidate with a home in the constituency, gave him a strong local profile. His previous Communist Party associations were not revealed. At the poll, on 25 June, he overturned a previous Conservative majority of 8,000 to finish 6,000 votes ahead of his opponent. In his war memoirs, Churchill called the result "one of the by-products of Tobruk"—which had <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">fallen to Rommel</a> on 21 June. Waugh, in his diary, remarked that the presentation of Driberg during the by-election merely as a journalist and churchwarden gave "a very imperfect picture of that sinister character".

On 2 July 1942 Driberg cast his first vote in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, in support of Churchill against a rebel motion of censure on the government's conduct of the war. The rebels' case was put incompetently, which ensured that the motion gained only 25 votes, as against 477 cast for the government. Driberg delivered his <a href="maiden%20speech">maiden speech</a> on 7 July, in a debate on the use of propaganda. He called for the lifting of the ban on the Communist Party's newspaper, the "<a href="Morning%20Star%20%28British%20newspaper%29%23World%20War%20II">Daily Worker</a>", which he saw as a potentially valuable weapon of home propaganda.

In the following months he tabled questions and intervened in debates on behalf of various progressive causes. For example, on 29 September 1942 he asked the prime minister to "make friendly representations to the American military authorities asking them to instruct their men that the colour bar is not a custom in this country". He continued to write the Hickey column, and used his parliamentary salary to fund a constituency office in Maldon.

In January 1943, while in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> to campaign in another by-election, Driberg was caught by a policeman while in the act of <a href="fellatio">fellating</a> a Norwegian sailor. In his own account of the incident Driberg records that he escaped arrest by identifying himself as "William Hickey" and as a member of parliament. These disclosures evidently overawed the constable, who took no further action; indeed, Driberg says, the incident began a chaste friendship with the officer that endured for more than ten years. Meanwhile, Beaverbrook had become disenchanted with him, and did not intervene when <a href="Arthur%20Christiansen">Arthur Christiansen</a>, the "Express" editor, sacked the columnist in June 1943 over a story detrimental to a government minister, <a href="Andrew%20Rae%20Duncan">Andrew Rae Duncan</a>. Driberg subsequently signed up with "<a href="Reynold%27s%20News">Reynolds News</a>", a Sunday newspaper owned by the <a href="Co-operative%20Group">Co-operative Group</a>, and undertook a regular parliamentary column for the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>". He also contributed to a weekly BBC European Service broadcast until, in October 1943, he was banned after government pressure. He reported the post-<a href="D-Day">D-Day</a> allied advances in France and Belgium as a war correspondent for "Reynolds News", and as a member of a parliamentary delegation witnessed the aftermath of the liberation of <a href="Buchenwald%20concentration%20camp">Buchenwald concentration camp</a> in April 1945.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">General election of July 1945</a> Driberg increased his majority at Maldon to 7,727. Before the election he had joined the Labour Party and had been welcomed by the local constituency party as their candidate. He was thus one of the 393 Labour MPs in the <a href="List%20of%20landslide%20victories">landslide election victory</a> that replaced Churchill as prime minister with <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>.

Within a few days of his victory, Driberg left for the Far East, to report on the conditions of the allied troops in <a href="Burma">Burma</a>. The Supreme Allied Commander, <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten</a>, knew him slightly and made him an unofficial temporary special adviser. In this role he met the Patriotic Burmese Forces leader, <a href="Aung%20San">Aung San</a>, who impressed him as honest and incorruptible, "unlike some of the older Burmese politicians". Later, he visited <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> and offered to mediate with <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>, who had recently declared an independent <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> state. Driberg later maintained that, had his offer been taken up, he might have prevented the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

Because of his journalism, Driberg was a well-known figure within the Labour Party generally, and in 1949 was elected to the party's <a href="National%20Executive%20Committee">National Executive Committee</a> (NEC). In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201950">February 1950 General Election</a> he was again elected at Maldon, while nationally Labour lost 68 seats, reducing its parliamentary majority to six. With so small a majority, members' regular attendance in the Commons chamber became important; however, in August 1950 Driberg left the country for Korea, where Britain had joined the United States in a <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> military expedition to repel the North Korean invasion of the South. Driberg and a few other <a href="left-wing%20politics">left-wing</a> MPs had objected to British involvement; In his "Reynolds News" column, Driberg had written of "Tories (Conservatives) who ... cannot help baying their delight at the smell of blood in the air", a comment that caused outrage in parliament among the Conservative members. Whatever his reservations, Driberg's war dispatches to "Reynolds News" were strongly supportive of the British troops. He participated in several night operations, and won respect from many of the soldiers for his courage despite, as one Marine put it "being a bit bent". He was away from parliament for three months, missing many critical House of Commons divisions, and on his return was severely censured by his fellow Labour MPs for neglecting his duties. His general standing in the party was unaffected; he had been re-elected "in absentia" to the NEC in September 1950.

In April 1951 the Labour government was hit by the resignations of three ministers—<a href="Aneurin%20Bevan">Aneurin Bevan</a>, the future prime minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, and <a href="John%20Freeman%20%28British%20politician%29">John Freeman</a>—over the imposition of prescription charges to pay for an increased armaments programme. Driberg was sympathetic to the rebels, though he tried to find a basis for compromise that would avoid resignations. The former ministers strengthened the small Labour group known as "Keep Left", in which Driberg was prominent; the group would henceforth be known as "Bevanites". In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201951">October 1951 General Election</a> the Labour Party was defeated, and Churchill resumed office; Driberg held on to his Maldon seat by 704 votes. Through the years of Labour government he had neither received nor sought office, having what historian <a href="Kenneth%20O.%20Morgan">Kenneth O. Morgan</a> called a "backbench mindset". He still enjoyed aspects of his parliamentary life, such as in 1953 when he showed the American singing sensation <a href="Johnnie%20Ray">Johnnie Ray</a> round the House of Commons; his attempts to seduce the singer were politely resisted. However, he needed to earn more money, and in the spring of 1952 responded to a suggestion that he should write a biography of Beaverbrook. The press lord was amenable, and work began in the summer of 1953. The project extended over several years, by which time Driberg was no longer in parliament; he had announced in March 1954 that he was standing down from Maldon, which at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201955">General Election of May 1955</a> fell, as he had expected, to the Conservatives.

On 16 February 1951 Driberg surprised his friends by announcing his engagement to Ena Mary Binfield (née Lyttelton). A former <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> <a href="county%20councillor">county councillor</a>, she worked as an administrator at the Marie Curie Hospital in London and was well known in senior Labour circles; she had met Driberg in 1949, at a weekend party given by the government minister <a href="George%20Strauss">George Strauss</a>. According to her son, she was fully aware of Driberg's sexual preferences, but looked forward to some political excitement, and "thought they could do a useful job as Mr. and Mrs." Driberg's motives are less clear, but he told his friend John Freeman that he needed someone to run Bradwell Lodge, to which he had returned in 1946 after its release by the RAF.

At Driberg's insistence, Ena, a non-practising Jew, was baptised into the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> before the wedding at St Mary the Virgin, <a href="Pimlico">Pimlico</a>, on 30 June 1951. The bride entered the church to a chorale arranged from the Labour Party anthem "<a href="The%20Red%20Flag">The Red Flag</a>"; this was followed by a nuptial mass described by Driberg's biographer <a href="Francis%20Wheen">Francis Wheen</a> as "outrageously ornate". Four hundred guests then attended an elaborate reception at the House of Commons.

In the ensuing years Ena tried hard to adapt to Driberg's way of life and to control his wayward finances, but with little success. He continued his frequent travels and casual homosexual liaisons, and was hostile to her efforts to control or change any aspect of his life. In 1961 she wrote to him: "I have tried for ten years to make a compromise with you in your extraordinary mode of life and have now given up." Thereafter they often lived apart, though they never formally separated. Even after a final breach in 1971, they remained legally married.

On leaving parliament in 1955, Driberg's main task was to complete the Beaverbrook biography. Although Beaverbrook had initially promised no interference with the text, he changed his mind when he began to read Driberg's drafts. In the course of a prolonged disagreement, Beaverbrook accused his biographer of being driven by "malice and hatred". When the manuscript was finally cleared for publication, much of the objectionable material had been removed; nevertheless, Beaverbrook used the "Daily Express" to campaign against the book and denounce its hostile tone. Evelyn Waugh, to whom Driberg sent a copy, expressed disappointment that the work was in fact "a honeyed eulogy".

In an effort to build his post-parliamentary career, Driberg turned briefly to creative writing, but without success. In his more familiar field of journalism he caused a sensation by flying to Moscow in August 1956 to interview <a href="Guy%20Burgess">Guy Burgess</a>, the former British diplomat who in 1951 had defected to Russia with his colleague <a href="Donald%20Maclean%20%28spy%29">Donald Maclean</a>. The pair had emerged in Moscow in February 1956, to give a brief press conference. Driberg had known Burgess in the 1940s, and the two shared similar homosexual inclinations; this acquaintance was sufficient to secure the Moscow interview. On his return home Driberg rapidly wrote a book from the interview material, the serial rights of which were sold to the "Daily Mail". Critics drew attention to the book's relatively sympathetic portrayal of Burgess; some believed the book had been vetted by the KGB, while others saw it as part of an MI5 plot to trap Burgess into revealing secret information for which he could be prosecuted should he ever return to Britain. 

In 1956 Driberg convened a group of Christian socialists that met regularly at the Lamb public house in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> to discuss issues such as imperialism, colonialism, immigration and nuclear disarmament. The group's dispatches, "Papers from the Lamb", led to the foundation in 1960 of the <a href="Christian%20Socialist%20Movement">Christian Socialist Movement</a>. Although no longer an MP, Driberg remained a member of the Labour Party's NEC and was active in party affairs. In 1957, in the face of antagonism from trade union leaders repelled by his lifestyle, he became <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Labour%20Party">Labour Party chairman</a>, a largely ceremonial role. He travelled widely during his year in office, generally as a "Reynolds News" correspondent but using the party title to advantage whenever he could. Thus, in a 1958 visit to Moscow to interview space scientists, he obtained two meetings with <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>.

In his final speech as chairman, to the party conference in 1958, Driberg angered the Conservatives and their press supporters by referring to the Tory ideology as not essentially different from the German "<a href="Herrenvolk">Herrenvolk</a>" philosophy. He had been contemplating for some time a return to the House of Commons, and in February 1959 was adopted as a candidate by the safe <a href="Barking%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Barking</a> constituency. In the General Election of October 1959, which delivered a 100-seat majority to <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>'s Conservative government, he won at Barking with a majority of exactly 12,000.

A dominant issue when Driberg returned to Westminster was that of the use or outlawing of nuclear weapons. The <a href="Campaign%20for%20Nuclear%20Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> (CND) had been launched on 17 February 1958, though Driberg's involvement with the issue predated CND by three years. On 2 March 1955, in an amendment to a House of Commons motion, he had called for Great Britain to "regain the moral leadership of the world by taking an initiative ... that may lead to the outlawing of ... thermo-nuclear weapons".

In October 1960 he supported the <a href="unilateralism">unilateralist</a> motions passed at the Labour Party conference, and fought unsuccessfully in the NEC for them to be adopted as party policy. The conference motion was reversed the following year, but he continued to pursue the matter in parliament. On 29 May 1962 he urged that Britain not be a party to the renewal of nuclear tests, and in a speech on 23 July he said: "The unilateral abandonment of testing—or, better still, a test ban agreement—would be the most valuable first step towards general and complete disarmament."

According to his colleague <a href="Ian%20Mikardo">Ian Mikardo</a>, Driberg was less than enthusiastic about his duties in Barking—"a very, very bad constituency MP". Even his strongest supporters acknowledged that he attended as few local events as possible. In the Commons chamber he was a regular speaker on issues that concerned him, in particular disarmament, church affairs and racial discrimination. He supported the lowering of the voting age to 18, and the broadcasting of parliamentary debates; he opposed increases to judges' salaries, and the extension of <a href="Stansted%20Airport">Stansted Airport</a>. After the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">General Election</a> of 1964, which narrowly returned Labour to power under <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, he was not offered a place in the new government, and soon found himself in opposition to Wilson's policies on Vietnam, the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">Common Market</a>, immigration and other major issues. He joined with Mikardo and other dissidents to form <a href="Tribune%20%28magazine%29%23The%20Tribune%20Group">the "Tribune Group"</a>, with the aim of promoting more left-wing policies. The group's influence lessened after March 1966, when in another <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201966">General Election</a> Wilson increased his majority to 98.

Driberg embraced enthusiastically the climate of the 1960s and the social and cultural freedoms that the decade introduced. In 1963 he met the <a href="Kray%20twins">Kray twins</a>, prominent London gangland figures, and began a lengthy friendship with them and their associates. In July 1964 two backbench Conservative MPs reported to their Chief Whip that Driberg and <a href="Lord%20Boothby">Lord Boothby</a> (a well-known Conservative peer) had been importuning males at a dog track, and were involved with gangs of thugs.

At parties which Driberg and Boothby attended at the Krays' flat, "rough but compliant East End lads were served like so many canapés", according to Wheen. While Driberg avoided publicity, Boothby was hounded by the press and forced to issue a series of denials. After the twins had been convicted of murder in 1969, Driberg frequently lobbied the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> about their prison conditions, requesting that they be given more visits and allowed regular reunions. Driberg was impressed with <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>, to whom he was introduced in 1965, and tried hard over a number of years to persuade the singer to take up active Labour politics. He also began a long association with the satirical magazine "<a href="Private%20Eye">Private Eye</a>", supplying it with political gossip and, under the pseudonym "Tiresias", compiling a regular, highly risqué prize <a href="cryptic%20crossword">cryptic crossword</a> puzzle which on one occasion was won by the wife of the future <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>.

In 1964 Driberg published a critical study of Moral Re-armament, which brought him attacks from the movement on the basis of his homosexuality and communist past. Although he made money from this book, throughout the 1960s he was beset by financial problems. When "Reynolds News", which had evolved into the "Sunday Citizen", finally folded in 1967, he became fully dependent on his parliamentary salary and casual journalism. He had long considered selling Bradwell Lodge, preferably to the <a href="National%20Trust">National Trust</a> on a basis that would allow him to continue living there. However, the Trust required the property to be mortgage-free and endowed with a substantial fund to cover future repairs, neither of which terms could be arranged. In the event the house remained unsold until 1971. As the 1970 election approached, Driberg wished to retire from parliament, and asked Wilson to appoint him as ambassador to the <a href="Holy%20See">Vatican</a>. Wilson refused, citing Driberg's age—at 65 he was beyond the retirement age for senior diplomats. Against his will, but with few other sources of income available to him, Driberg fought the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201970">June 1970 General Election</a>. He was returned for Barking with a comfortable though reduced majority; nationally, Wilson's government was defeated by <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a>'s Conservatives.

Hampered by age and declining health, Driberg became less active politically, and in 1972 was voted off Labour's NEC. The sale of Bradwell Lodge to a private buyer removed his main burden of debt, and he rented a small flat in the <a href="Barbican%20Estate">Barbican</a> development in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. In February 1974, at the age of 68, he retired from the House of Commons with the intention of writing his memoirs. Still short of income, he first completed a biography of his fellow-journalist <a href="Hannen%20Swaffer">Hannen Swaffer</a>, which was indifferently received—"a feeble potboiler", according to Davenport-Hines. Friends organised an elaborate 70th birthday party for him on 21 May 1975; "one duke, two dukes' daughters, sundry lords, a bishop, a poet laureate—not bad for an old left-wing MP", Driberg observed to a guest.

In November 1975 he was granted a <a href="life%20peerage">life peerage</a>, and on 21 January 1976 was introduced to the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> as Baron Bradwell, of <a href="Bradwell-juxta-Mare">Bradwell juxta Mare</a> in the County of <a href="Essex">Essex</a>. On 14 April he tabled a motion in the Lords calling on the government to consider the withdrawal of troops from <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, but won little support. His health was failing, though he continued to work on his memoirs. His final contribution to the House of Lords was on 22 July, in a debate on entry vouchers for the dependents of immigrants.

Three weeks later, on 12 August 1976, while travelling by taxi from Paddington to his Barbican flat, he suffered a fatal heart attack. The funeral was held on 19 August at St Matthew's, Westminster; he was buried in the cemetery attached to St Thomas's Church, Bradwell.

After the publication of his relatively sympathetic portrait of Burgess in 1956, Driberg had been denounced as a "dupe of Moscow" by some elements of the press. Two years after Driberg's death, the investigative reporter <a href="Chapman%20Pincher">Chapman Pincher</a> alleged that he had been "a Kremlin agent of sympathy" and a supporter of Communist front organisations. In 1979 <a href="Andrew%20Boyle">Andrew Boyle</a> published "The Climate of Treason", which exposed Anthony Blunt and led to a period of "spy mania" in Britain. Boyle's exhaustive account of the Burgess–Maclean–<a href="Kim%20Philby">Philby</a>–Blunt circle mentioned Driberg as a friend of Burgess, "of much the same background, tastes and views", but made no allegations that he was part of any espionage ring.

In this atmosphere, Pincher published "Their Trade is Treachery" (1981), in which he maintained that Driberg had been recruited by MI5 to spy on the Communist Party while still a schoolboy at Lancing, and that he was later "in the KGB's pay as a double agent". Other writers added further details; the former British Intelligence officer <a href="Peter%20Wright%20%28MI5%20officer%29">Peter Wright</a>, in "<a href="Spycatcher">Spycatcher</a>" (1987), alleged that Driberg had been "providing material to a Czech controller for money". The former Kremlin archivist <a href="Vasili%20Mitrokhin">Vasili Mitrokhin</a> asserted that the Soviets had blackmailed Driberg into working for the KGB by threatening to expose his homosexuality. In a 2016 biography of Burgess, Andrew Lownie reports that Driberg was "caught in a KGB sting operation" at a Moscow urinal, and as a result agreed to work as a Soviet agent.

The weight of information, and its constant repetition, made an apparently strong case against Driberg, and former friends such as <a href="Mervyn%20Stockwood">Mervyn Stockwood</a>, the <a href="Anglican%20Bishop%20of%20Southwark">Bishop of Southwark</a>, became convinced that he had indeed betrayed his country. Other friends and colleagues were more sceptical. According to ex-Labour MP <a href="Reginald%20Paget%2C%20Baron%20Paget%20of%20Northampton">Reginald Paget</a>, not even the security services were "lunatic enough to recruit a man like Driberg", who was famously indiscreet and could never keep a secret. Mitrokhin's "blackmail" story is questioned by historian <a href="Jeff%20Sharlet%20%28writer%29">Jeff Sharlet</a>, on the grounds that by the 1950s and 1960s Driberg's homosexuality had been an open secret in British political circles for many years; he frequently boasted of his "rough trade" conquests to his colleagues. The journalist <a href="A.%20N.%20Wilson">A. N. Wilson</a> quotes Churchill commenting years before that "Tom Driberg is the sort of person who gives sodomy a bad name".

Pincher, however, argued that as homosexual acts were criminal offences in Britain until 1967, Driberg was still vulnerable to blackmail, although he also claimed that the MI5 connection secured Driberg a lifelong immunity from prosecution. Driberg's colleague <a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a> denied Pincher's claim that <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, when prime minister, had made a secret agreement with Foot to protect Driberg if Foot, in turn, would remain silent about the supposed treachery of <a href="Roger%20Hollis">Roger Hollis</a>, another of Pincher's recently dead targets.

Wheen asserts that Pincher was not an objective commentator; the Labour Party, and its supposed infiltration by Communist agents, had been his target over many years. Pincher's verdict on Driberg is that "in journalism, in politics and intelligence ... eventually he betrayed everybody". Wheen argues that Driberg's greatest vice was indiscretion; he gossiped about everyone, but "indiscretion is not synonymous with betrayal". Driberg's Labour Party colleague, <a href="Leo%20Abse">Leo Abse</a>, offers a more complex explanation: Driberg was an adventurer who loved taking risks and played many parts. "Driberg could have played the part of the spy with superb skill, and if the officers of MI5 were indeed inept enough to have attempted to recruit him, then, in turn, Tom Driberg would have gained special pleasure in fooling and betraying them".

In his will Driberg had stipulated that at his funeral his friend Gerard Irvine, an <a href="Anglo-Catholicism">Anglo-Catholic</a> priest, should deliver an "anti-panegyric" in place of the normal eulogy. Irvine obliged, with a detailed assessment of Driberg against the <a href="Seven%20Deadly%20Sins">Seven Deadly Sins</a>, finding him guilty of Gluttony, Lust and Wrath, but relatively free from Avarice and Envy and entirely untouched by Sloth. Pride, Irvine maintained, was in Driberg's case mitigated by "the contrary virtue of humility". Ena did not attend the funeral; she gave a single press interview in which she expressed "huge respect for Tom's journalistic skills, political power and championship of the underdog". She added that if her admiration for him did not extend to their personal life together, that was a private matter.

Driberg prided himself on being an exception to a rule propounded by <a href="Cyril%20Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a>, that the war between the generations is the one war in which everyone changes sides eventually. <a href="Mervyn%20Stockwood">Mervyn Stockwood</a>, in his address at the funeral service, praised Driberg as "a searcher for truth", whose loyalty to the socialist cause was beyond question. This verdict was echoed by <a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a>, who in a postscript to Driberg's memoir wrote of Driberg's "great services" to the Labour Party in the various offices that he occupied. Foot believed that Driberg's homosexual passion, rather than bringing him fulfilment, had "condemned him to a lifetime of deep loneliness". "The Times" obituarist described Driberg as "A journalist, an intellectual, a drinking man, a gossip, a high churchman, a liturgist, a homosexual", the first time, according to journalist <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a>, that the newspaper had ever defined a public figure specifically as homosexual.

Nevertheless, Driberg's incomplete memoir "Ruling Passions", when published in June 1977, was a shock to the public and to some of his erstwhile associates, despite advance hints of the book's scandalous content. Driberg's candid revelations of his "<a href="cottaging">cottaging</a>" and his descriptions of casual oral sex were called by one commentator "the biggest outpouring of literary dung a public figure has ever flung into print." The comedians <a href="Peter%20Cook">Peter Cook</a> and <a href="Dudley%20Moore">Dudley Moore</a> depicted Driberg as a sexual predator, wearing "fine fishnet stockings" and cavorting with a <a href="rent%20boy">rent boy</a>, in a sketch, "Back of the Cab", which they recorded in 1977.

More vituperation followed when Pincher's allegations of Driberg's links with the Russian secret service were published in 1981; Pincher christened him "Lord of the Spies". However, Foot dismissed these accusations as typical of the "fantasies of the secret service world that seem to have taken possession of Pincher's mind". Foot added that Driberg "had always been much too ready to look forgivingly on Communist misdeeds, but this attitude was combined with an absolutely genuine devotion to the cause of peace".

In his 2004 biographical sketch Davenport-Hines describes Driberg as "a sincere if eccentric Christian socialist who detested racism and colonialism", who at the same time "could be pompous, mannered, wayward, self-indulgent, ungrateful, bullying and indiscreet". As to the apparent contradiction between sincere Christianity and promiscuous homosexuality, Wheen argues that "there had been a recognisable male homosexual subculture in the Anglo-Catholic movement since the late nineteenth century". This theme is explored in a paper by David Hilliard of <a href="Flinders%20University">Flinders University</a>, who maintains that "the [19th century] conflict between Protestantism and Anglo-Catholicism within the Church of England was ... regularly depicted by Protestant propagandists as a struggle between masculine and feminine styles of religion".

Driberg throughout his life was a devout Anglo-Catholic; Wheen suggests that Evelyn Waugh, in "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited">Brideshead Revisited</a>", may have had Driberg in mind when the novel's protagonist Charles Ryder is warned on arrival at Oxford to "beware of Anglo-Catholics—they're all sodomites with unpleasant accents."

Driberg was the subject of a play, "Tom and Clem", by <a href="Stephen%20Churchett">Stephen Churchett</a>, which was staged at London's <a href="Aldwych%20Theatre">Aldwych Theatre</a> in April 1997. The action takes place during Driberg's brief visit to the <a href="Potsdam%20Conference">Potsdam Conference</a> in July 1945, and deals with the contrast of compromise, represented by the pragmatic Clement Attlee, and post-war idealism, personified by Driberg. <a href="Michael%20Gambon">Michael Gambon</a>'s portrayal of Driberg, as "a slovenly, paunchy Bacchus with a mouth that can suddenly gape like a painfully-hooked fish", won special praise from "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" critic <a href="Benedict%20Nightingale">Benedict Nightingale</a>.

Driberg wrote or compiled the following books:

Neilston

Neilston (, , ) is a village and <a href="List%20of%20civil%20parishes%20in%20Scotland">parish</a> in <a href="East%20Renfrewshire">East Renfrewshire</a> in the west <a href="central%20Lowlands">central Lowlands</a> of Scotland. It is in the <a href="River%20Levern">Levern Valley</a>, southwest of <a href="Barrhead">Barrhead</a>, south of <a href="Paisley%2C%20Renfrewshire">Paisley</a>, and south-southwest of <a href="Renfrew">Renfrew</a>, at the southwestern fringe of the <a href="Greater%20Glasgow">Greater Glasgow conurbation</a>. Neilston is a <a href="dormitory%20village">dormitory village</a> with a resident population of just over 5,000 people.

Neilston is mentioned in documents from the 12th century, when the feudal lord Robert de Croc, endowed a chapel to Paisley Abbey to the North. Neilston Parish Church—a <a href="Listed%20building">Category B listed building</a>—is said to be on the site of this original chapel and has been at the centre of the community since 1163. Little remains of the original structure. Before <a href="industrialisation">industrialisation</a>, Neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-storey houses, many of them <a href="thatching">thatched</a>. Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax.

The urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Industrial scale <a href="Textile%20manufacture%20during%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution">textile processing</a> was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several <a href="cotton%20mill">cotton mill</a>s. Neilston became a centre for cotton and <a href="Calico%20%28textile%29">calico</a> bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a <a href="spinning%20%28textiles%29">spinning</a> and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former <a href="Mill%20town">milling village</a>, <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> has played, and continues to play, an economic role. The annual Neilston Agricultural Show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest Scotland each spring.

Although heavy industry died out in the latter half of the 20th century, as part of Scotland's densely populated <a href="Central%20Belt">Central Belt</a>, Neilston has continued to grow as a <a href="commuter%20village">commuter village</a>, supported by its position between Paisley and <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, from roughly 1,000 people in 1800 to 5,168 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments.

Local historians have proposed various theories for the origin of the name Neilston. Although the first element is likely to derive from either the <a href="Scots%20Gaelic">Gaelic</a> forename "Niall" (<a href="genitive">genitive</a> "Nèill") or else from the <a href="Old%20French">French</a> "Nigel", there is disagreement as to whether the second element represents the English "stone" or "town". The earliest mention of Neilston is in the "Chartulary of Paisley Abbey", which mentions that the <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> knight, <a href="Robert%20Croc">Robert Croc</a> of "Crocstown" (<a href="Crookston%2C%20Glasgow">Crookston</a>), assigned the patronage of "Neilstoun" to the monks of <a href="Saint%20Mirin">St Mirren</a>'s in 1163, on condition that <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">masses</a> should be regularly said for the benefit of his soul. <a href="G.%20W.%20S.%20Barrow">G. W. S. Barrow</a> suggested that the settlement may be identified with the follower of <a href="Walter%20fitz%20Alan">Walter fitz Alan</a>, Lord of <a href="Kyle%2C%20Ayrshire">Kyle</a> and <a href="Strathgryfe">Strathgryfe</a> (and <a href="Homage%20%28medieval%29">liege lord</a> of Robert Croc), named "Nigel de Cotentin".

Despite this, some writers have given etymological explanations which post-date 1163. For instance, it has been written that "Neil" was a <a href="General%20Officer">General</a> of <a href="Haakon%20IV%20of%20Norway">King Haakon IV of Norway</a>, who, fleeing from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Largs">Battle of Largs</a> (1263), was overtaken in this locality and put to death. According to the custom of the age a <a href="tumulus">burial mound</a> was supposedly erected over his grave and the locality ultimately received the name of the General. In a similar semi-legendary <a href="Folk%20etymology">popular etymology</a>, Neilston's origin was said to derive from a stone erected over the grave of a <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highland</a> chief named Neil who was allegedly killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Harlaw">Battle of Harlaw</a> (1411), in the reign of <a href="James%20I%20of%20Scotland">King James I of Scotland</a>.

Before its recorded history began, and possibly before its founding, the territory of what became Neilston is known to have formed part of the ancient <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Kingdom of Strathclyde</a>. Evidence attests that Neilston is much older than its larger neighbour <a href="Barrhead">Barrhead</a>, as the first recorded mention of Barrhead was almost 600 years after Neilston's mention in the "Chartulary of Paisley Abbey" of 1163. The <a href="chartulary">chartulary</a> dealt with the foundation of the <a href="Paisley%20Abbey">Clunaic Monastery in Paisley</a> and its relationship to a chapel in Neilston, which were both answerable to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> via the <a href="Cluniac%20Houses%20in%20Britain">Clunaic Movement</a>. Because of its chapel, which later became a parish church, Neilston was the most important settlement in the Levern Valley and much of rural <a href="Renfrewshire%20%28historic%29">Renfrewshire</a>.

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> Neilston's position in the Barrhead Gap, a pass linking <a href="Ayrshire">Ayrshire</a> to <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, gave it strategic importance. Robert Croc may have had a fort or <a href="watchtower">watchtower</a> at Coldoun in Neilston in the 12th century. "Doun" is a corruption of "<a href="dun">dun</a>" meaning castle or fort, and the prefix perhaps implies the lack of physical warmth within the tower or the greeting received by unwelcome guests. Despite this distinction of local importance, Neilston remained a scattered community of small dwellings and farms, changing only with the arrival of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.

In the 17th century Neilston shared in a national hysteria about <a href="European%20witchcraft">witchcraft</a> that plagued Scotland. In 1650 a number of people from <a href="Inverkip">Inverkip</a>, Linwood and Neilston were accused of witchcraft. However, they passed certain tests which would disprove them to be witches. In 1697, Christian Shaw of <a href="Lambroughton">Lambroughton</a> succeeded in convincing a Minister that she was a victim of witchcraft. A Commission of Enquiry, which included the <a href="Laird">Laird</a> of Glanderston, was appointed to investigate. As a result of the investigation, later known as the <a href="Paisley%20Witch%20Trials">Paisley Witch Trials</a>, four women and three men were arrested and eventually condemned to death and executed at Paisley. The Minister of Neilston Church, the Reverend David Brown, officiated at the <a href="hanging">hanging</a>; he preached to them before the execution "beseeching them to turn to God, God having exercised a great deal of long-suffering towards them".

The foundations of a textile industry in Neilston were laid by the monks of Paisley Abbey who mastered the local woollen trade in the Middle Ages. Neilston became a centre for cotton and <a href="Calico%20%28textile%29">calico</a> bleaching and printing in the 18th century. This developed into a <a href="spinning%20%28textiles%29">spinning</a> and dying industry and continued into the early 20th century. <a href="Bleachfield">Bleachfield</a>s and textile processing brought rapid <a href="socioeconomic">socioeconomic</a> growth to the village. Neilston was one of the earliest centres of <a href="textile%20manufacture%20during%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution">textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution</a>; the process of bleaching linens was introduced into Neilston in 1765, and a mill in the parish was the second erected in Scotland. By 1780, cotton manufacturing and bleaching had become the main industry in Neilston; the clear busy waters of the <a href="River%20Levern">River Levern</a> being well suited for power and processing. In the "<a href="Statistical%20Accounts%20of%20Scotland">"Old" Statistical Account of Scotland</a>" (1792), compiled under the direction of <a href="Sir%20John%20Sinclair%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster</a>, Neilston was noted to have two <a href="cotton%20mill">cotton mill</a>s employing together more than 300 people, over half of them children. The local Minister was concerned for the children's welfare, remarking on how they missed school to work in the mills where their lungs would be filled with cotton fluff and their skin spoiled by machine oil.

Crofthead Mill (known locally as "Neilston Mill") was established in 1792. It was one of seven large cotton mills on the banks of the River Levern between Neilston and <a href="Dovecothall">Dovecothall</a>, and although it closed for business in the early 1990s, it is the only industrial structure from this period still standing. Because of the large size of the complex, coupled with its short distance from the main residential core of Neilston, it was described in 1830, at the peak of the industry's prosperity, as "a little town of its self". Other mills and factories have existed but have been demolished, including Broadley Spinning and Weaving Factory, and Gateside village and Spinning Mill.

Following its period of rapid <a href="industrialisation">industrialisation</a>, in 1904 about 400 mill houses were constructed forming Lintmill Terrace and its neighbouring streets in what was then the non-<a href="Geographic%20contiguity">contiguous</a> Holehouse area of the Parish of Neilston. Additional housing schemes in the 1920s and 1930s led to Holehouse and old Neilston becoming a single continuously connected urban area, described as that of a "sizable small township". Since this time, much rebuilding and further expansion has taken place. <a href="Gentrification">Gentrification</a> projects since 2000 have included the refurbishment of the parish church in 2004, an experimental <a href="public%20space">public space</a> renewal initiative in 2005 and the renovation of Nether Kirkton House, a mansion.

Neilston is represented by several tiers of elected government. Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten <a href="List%20of%20community%20council%20areas%20in%20Scotland">community councils</a> of the <a href="East%20Renfrewshire">East Renfrewshire</a> <a href="council%20area">council area</a>. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary <a href="local%20authority">local authority</a> for Neilston, is based at <a href="Giffnock">Giffnock</a>, close to the border with the <a href="City%20of%20Glasgow">City of Glasgow</a>, and is the <a href="Executive%20%28government%29">executive</a>, <a href="Deliberation">deliberative</a> and <a href="legislative">legislative</a> body responsible for <a href="local%20government%20in%20Scotland">local governance</a>.

The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Kingdom of Strathclyde</a>. It has lain within the <a href="counties%20of%20Scotland">county boundaries</a> of <a href="Renfrewshire%20%28historic%29">Renfrewshire</a> from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a <a href="Parish%20%28country%20subdivision%29">parish</a> and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the <a href="lord">lord</a>ship of the <a href="Clan%20Muir">Mures</a> of <a href="Caldwell%2C%20East%20Renfrewshire">Caldwell</a> whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was in length and by from to in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of <a href="Barrhead">Barrhead</a>. Neilston <a href="Parochial%20church%20council">Parish Council</a>, a local body with limited power, was established in 1895, following the <a href="Local%20Government%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201894">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894</a>, and abolished in 1930 following the <a href="Local%20Government%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201929">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929</a>. In 1890, Neilston fell under the authority of Renfrewshire <a href="County%20Council">County Council</a>, where it remained until 1975 when the county was superseded by the regional council area of <a href="Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a>. In 1903, Neilston was within the <a href="Paisley%2C%20Renfrewshire">Paisley</a> Small Debt Court District and <a href="Scottish%20Poor%20Law">Poor Combination</a>. From 1975 to 1996, Neilston was in the <a href="Renfrew%20District">Renfrew District</a> of Strathclyde until the two-tier <a href="regions%20and%20districts%20of%20Scotland">regions and districts of Scotland</a> were abolished. Since 1996 it has formed part of the <a href="unitary%20authority">unitary</a> East Renfrewshire council area; East Renfrewshire Council is the local authority. Neilston remains part of Renfrewshire for purposes of <a href="Registration%20county">registration</a> and <a href="Lieutenancy%20areas%20of%20Scotland">Lieutenancy</a>.

Neilston forms part of the multi member ward 1 of East Renfrewshire Council, namely Neilston, Uplawmoor and Newton Mearns North. Four Councillors are elected using the proportional Single Transferable Vote (STV) system. The current elected members are Charlie Gilbert (Conservative) Paul O'Kane (Labour) Elaine Green (Labour) and Tony Buchanan (SNP).

Neilston is part of the <a href="constituencies">county constituency</a> of <a href="East%20Renfrewshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">East Renfrewshire</a>, electing one <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons of the United Kingdom</a> Parliament. Paul Masterton of the <a href="Scottish%20Conservative%20and%20Unionist%20Party">Conservative Party</a> was elected as MP for East Renfrewshire in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202017">2017 General Election</a>. Before the constituency's creation in 2005, Neilston lay in the <a href="Eastwood%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Eastwood</a> constituency. For purposes of the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>, Neilston forms part of the Renfrewshire South Constituency, represented by <a href="Tom%20Arthur%20%28Scottish%20politician%29">Tom Arthur</a> of the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Party">Scottish National Party</a>. In addition to this Neilston is represented by seven <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20constituencies%20and%20regions">regional MSPs</a> from the <a href="West%20of%20Scotland%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20electoral%20region%29">West of Scotland electoral region</a>.

At (55.784°, -4.423°) Neilston is in Scotland's <a href="Central%20Lowlands">Central Lowlands</a>. The community is above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, southwest of Barrhead, south of Paisley, and southwest of Glasgow. The chief river is the <a href="River%20Levern">Levern</a>, which has its source at Long Loch. It flows eastwards through Neilston towards Barrhead, before uniting its waters with those of the <a href="River%20Cart">White Cart Water</a>.

The <a href="topography">topography</a> of Neilston is irregular; to the east nearly flat, and to the south and west, rising to heights of to above the level of the <a href="River%20Clyde">River Clyde</a>. The highest points are Neilston Pad and the Corkendale-law, at about and above sea level, respectively. Neilston Pad is characterised by a craggy face on its eastern side. Between these hills is the narrow valley of the River Levern, along which passes the <a href="Turnpike%20trusts">turnpike road</a> to Glasgow and Paisley. The soil in the eastern parts of Neilston is a dry <a href="loam">loam</a>, occasionally intermixed with gravel. Amongst the hilly areas of the village, the soil is less fertile, whilst in all other rural parts, the land is moss covered <a href="Moorland">moor</a>. The local <a href="geology">geology</a> is represented by <a href="basalt">basalt</a>. The surrounding landscape is dominated by Duncarnock, the resistant core of an ancient and long extinct volcano, known locally as 'the Craigie'.

Neilston experiences a <a href="temperate">temperate</a> <a href="Oceanic%20climate">maritime climate</a>, like much of the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year. Several <a href="lake">lake</a>s and small <a href="loch">loch</a>s have formed around Neilston: Long Loch, Loch Libo, and Loch Cawpla. Aboon the Brae (<a href="Scots%20language">Scots language</a> for "above the hill") is the site of a <a href="Spring%20%28hydrosphere%29">spring</a>. There are a number of small named-localities in and around Neilston: Arthurlie, Holehouse, Crofthead, Kirkstyle, Coldoun, Gateside, Hollows, Broadley, Nether Kirkton and Neilstonside.

Neilston's <a href="built%20environment">built environment</a> is characterised by its mixture of 19th- and 20th-century detached cottages, single and two-story buildings. Several mansion houses were built for the owners of former mills and factories. Many of Neilston's dwellings are painted in whites or ivories. In his book "Ordnance Survey of Scotland" (1884), <a href="Francis%20Hindes%20Groome">Francis Hindes Groome</a> remarked that Neilston "presents an old-fashioned yet neat and compact appearance", a view echoed by Hugh McDonald in "Rambles Round Glasgow" (1910), who stated that Neilston "is a compact, neat, and withal somewhat old-fashioned little township", although continued that it has "few features calling for special remark". It is frequently described as a quiet <a href="dormitory%20village">dormitory village</a>, although some sources from around the turn of the 20th century describe Neilston as a town. There is a mixture of <a href="suburb">suburb</a>s, semi-rural, <a href="rural">rural</a> and former-industrial locations in Neilston, but overwhelmingly the <a href="land%20use">land use</a> in central Neilston is sub-urban. The territory of Neilston is not contiguous with any other settlement, and according to the <a href="General%20Register%20Office%20for%20Scotland">General Register Office for Scotland</a>, does not form part of <a href="Greater%20Glasgow">Greater Glasgow</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20conurbations%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom's fifth largest conurbation</a>.

The Killoch Burn and glen, at the north of Neilston, have become associated with a witch because at low water the numerous pot-holes or <a href="rock-cut%20basin">rock-cut basin</a>s have worn into one another, giving unusual shapes. Locals named some of these the witch's floor, hearth, cradle, water-stoup and grave.

According to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">United Kingdom Census 2001</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20census%20localities%20in%20Scotland">census locality</a> (village and sub-area) of Neilston had a total resident population of 5,168, or 6% of the total of East Renfrewshire. This figure, combined with an area of , provides Neilston with a <a href="population%20density">population density</a> figure of . This is higher than the average population density of Scotland (at ) and nearby Glasgow (at ).

The <a href="median">median</a> age of males and females living in Neilston was 37 and 38 years respectively, compared to 37 and 39 years for those in the whole of Scotland. Forty six percent were married, 3.2% were <a href="Cohabitation">cohabiting</a> couples, 11.3% were lone parent families and 25.5% of households were made up of individuals.

The place of birth of the village's residents was 98.5% United Kingdom (including 94% from Scotland), 0.4% <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, 0.4% from other <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> countries, and 0.8% from elsewhere in the world. The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 45.4% in full-time employment, 11.4% in part-time employment, 5.2% self-employed, 3.5% unemployed, 4% students with jobs, 4% students without jobs, 11.4% retired, 4% looking after home or family, 6.8% permanently sick or disabled, and 3.5% economically inactive for other reasons. Compared with the average <a href="demography%20of%20Scotland">demography of Scotland</a>, Neilston has low proportions of people born outside the United Kingdom, and people over 75 years of age.

Following the <a href="Scottish%20Reformation">Scottish Reformation</a> in 1560, there was no <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> place of worship in Neilston until 1861; it has been said that there was no resident Roman Catholic community in the parish in this time, the parishioners instead being <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a>. It was not until around the time of the <a href="Second%20Industrial%20Revolution">Second Industrial Revolution</a>, when the demand for labour was great, that <a href="Irish%20people">Irish people</a> began to come to Neilston and other parts of Scotland in increasing numbers, many of them because of <a href="The%20Great%20Hunger">The Great Hunger</a> in the mid-19th century. As a result, Neilston, like neighbouring Glasgow, is home to a significant number of Catholic <a href="Irish-Scots">Irish-Scots</a>. St Thomas's, part of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Paisley">Roman Catholic Diocese of Paisley</a>, was built around 1861 to accommodate the new Catholic community.

Long existing as a <a href="rural">rural</a> settlement, Neilston's economy was historically driven by farming, although a trade in <a href="handloom">handloom</a> woven garments from the village's <a href="cottage%20industry">cottage industry</a> also existed from very early times. <a href="Gristmill">Grain mills</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Watermills%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">watermills</a> were operating in Neilston by 1667.

Due to its supply of <a href="hydropower">hydropower</a> from the <a href="River%20Levern">River Levern</a>, Neilston, like neighbouring <a href="Barrhead">Barrhead</a>, developed factories and cotton mills after the arrival of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Neilston fostered a flourishing <a href="Textile%20manufacture%20during%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution">textile processing</a> industry. At the peak of business, the River Levern was lined with <a href="bleachfield">bleachfield</a>s, cotton mills and <a href="Calico%20%28textile%29">calico</a> printfields. Passing through the ownership of a series of successful companies, Crofthead Mill was once the biggest producer of spun cotton in <a href="Renfrewshire%20%28historic%29">Renfrewshire</a>. Thread from Crofthead, and thus Neilston, was traded across the world. It is claimed that thread from Crofthead Mill held together the boots of the climbing team led by <a href="Chris%20Bonington">Chris Bonington</a> on the <a href="Timeline%20of%20climbing%20Mount%20Everest">British Everest Expedition</a> in 1975.

Neilston Agricultural Show is a <a href="Agricultural%20show">cattle show</a>, <a href="sheepdog%20trial">sheepdog trial</a> and sports and arts festival held near the village on the first Saturday of every May with a tradition beginning in the early 19th century. It began as a result of a dispute between two farmers from the village. Each farmer had a prized bull that he said was better than the other's. In a bid to settle the argument, the farmers arranged a contest that would be judged by the other farmers in the area. It is not documented who had the better bull, but the contest grew into an annual event that has become a local custom which is celebrated each year at the end of the show with the burning of a 50ft tall wickerman.

Although agriculture continues to a limited extent on the village's outskirts, Neilston's textile processing industry has diminished. Since <a href="deindustrialisation">deindustrialisation</a>, Neilston is a <a href="commuter%20village">commuter village</a> with significant numbers of its inhabitants travelling to the major urban centres of Glasgow, <a href="Paisley%2C%20Renfrewshire">Paisley</a> and <a href="Barrhead">Barrhead</a> for work. The village has retained a selection of amenities from local shops for local people, leisure facilities, and schooling however. The "Barrhead News", a <a href="local%20newspaper">local newspaper</a> published by Clyde and Forth Press, reports on Neilston, Barrhead, <a href="Nitshill">Nitshill</a> and <a href="Darnley">Darnley</a>.

In 2005 the <a href="Clydesdale%20Bank">Clydesdale Bank</a> closed its branch at Neilston, leaving it without a bank. In 2006 Neilston <a href="development%20trust">Development Trust</a> utilised the <a href="Land%20Reform%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%202003">Land Reform Act</a> to purchase the bank building for community usage with the aid of a grant of <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>210,000 from the <a href="Big%20Lottery%20Fund">Big Lottery Fund</a>. This was the first time this legislation had been successfully used in an urban area. The premises are used as a community café, a service information point, office space and meeting rooms. The trust has been involved in a community energy project, the Neilston Community Wind Farm, which installed four turbines with a capacity of 10MW in 2013.

A chapel at Neilston was first recorded in 1163 in a charter of <a href="Paisley%20Abbey">Paisley Abbey</a>. It was commissioned by Sir Robert Croc, as part of a feudal requirement by the <a href="High%20Steward%20of%20Scotland">High Steward of Scotland</a>, <a href="Walter%20fitz%20Alan">Walter fitz Alan</a>. The original Neilston <a href="Kirk">Kirk</a> was one storey high, and was rebuilt in 1762 to accommodate the growing population of the <a href="parish">parish</a>. The only remaining parts of the original building are a <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> window in a back wall and the burial vault of the <a href="Clan%20Muir">Mure family</a> of Caldwell, including the tomb of <a href="Laird%20%28title%29">Laird</a>, scholar and <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> for <a href="Renfrewshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Renfrewshire</a>, <a href="William%20Mure%20%28scholar%29">William Mure</a> (1799–1860). Between 1796 and 1798 the roof was taken off the church and an additional storey constructed, making space for a gallery to accommodate the growing population of Neilston. The structure has a <a href="spire">spire</a>, a clock, and 940 sittings. The old graveyard is centuries old and has a <a href="headstone">headstone</a> dating from the 15th century. The church is part of the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>, and has a <a href="Listed%20building">Category B listing</a> from <a href="Historic%20Scotland">Historic Scotland</a>.

In 1559, in the <a href="Scottish%20Reformation">Scottish Reformation</a>, an image of <a href="Mary%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary mother of Jesus</a> was taken from Neilston Parish Church and thrown into a pool of the River Levern. The pool ever since has been known as the Midge Hole. One of Neilston Parish Church's most celebrated ministers was Dr Alexander Fleming and his "Life" (1883) contains much of interest relating to Neilston. In 1826, despite enlargement of the church, it was too small to accommodate the population and the <a href="Heritor">Heritor</a>s demanded payment of seat rents for those attending services. Dr Fleming proceeded to preach from a tent erected in the graveyard for a period of about eight years, insisting that "the people of the Parish are entitled to hear the gospel without money or price." The case went to the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> and although it was not successful, the parishioners were subsequently able to return to the church and take their places without paying rent and with no further opposition from the Heritors. In 2003, in a major refurbishment, six skeletons were found beneath the floorboards of the church. Initially sealed off as a crime scene, archeologists from the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> confirmed the skeletons were around 400 years old. A local historian suggested they could be the bones of former priests.

Other listed buildings in Neilston include Nether Kirkton House and Crofthead Mill, both Category B. Nether Kirkton House is a mansion and the former home of <a href="Scotch%20whisky">whisky</a> heiress Marion Buchanan, and Crofthead Mill is Neilston's largest and oldest cotton mill, dating in part from 1792 but predominantly 1880 after much of the original building was destroyed by fire. The mill is now used by J & M Murdoch & Son Ltd., a transport, waste disposal and recycling company.

Western Ganga dynasty

Western Ganga was an important ruling dynasty of ancient <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> in India which lasted from about 350 to 1000 CE. They are known as 'Western Gangas' to distinguish them from the <a href="Eastern%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Eastern Gangas</a> who in later centuries ruled over <a href="Kalinga%20%28historical%20region%29">Kalinga</a> (modern <a href="Odisha">Odisha</a>). The general belief is that the Western Gangas began their rule during a time when multiple native clans asserted their freedom due to the weakening of the <a href="Pallava">Pallava</a> empire in <a href="South%20India">South India</a>, a geo-political event sometimes attributed to the southern conquests of <a href="Samudra%20Gupta">Samudra Gupta</a>. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, initially ruling from <a href="Kolar">Kolar</a> and later, moving their capital to <a href="Talakadu">Talakadu</a> on the banks of the <a href="Kaveri%20River">Kaveri River</a> in modern <a href="Mysore%20district">Mysore district</a>.

After the rise of the imperial <a href="Chalukya%20dynasty">Chalukyas of Badami</a>, the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the <a href="Pallavas">Pallavas</a> of <a href="Kanchi">Kanchi</a>. The Chalukyas were replaced by the <a href="Rashtrakuta%20Dynasty">Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta</a> in 753 CE as the dominant power in the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a>. After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes, the <a href="Chola%20Dynasty">Chola Dynasty</a> of <a href="Tanjavur">Tanjavur</a>. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the <a href="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> river. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region.

Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to <a href="polity">polity</a>, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage toward <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a> and <a href="Kambadahalli">Kambadahalli</a>. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> flourished. <a href="Chavundaraya">Chavundaraya</a>'s writing, "Chavundaraya Purana" of 978 CE, is an important work in Kannada prose. Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from <a href="religion">religion</a> to <a href="elephant">elephant</a> management.

Multiple theories have been proposed regarding the ancestry of the founders of the Western Ganga dynasty (prior to the 4th century). Some mythical accounts point to a <a href="North%20India">northern</a> origin, while theories based on <a href="epigraphy">epigraphy</a> suggest a <a href="South%20India">southern</a> origin. According to some records, the Western Gangas were of the Kanvayana <a href="gotra">gotra</a> and traced their lineage to the <a href="Ikshvaku%20dynasty">Ikshvaku</a>s and the <a href="solar%20dynasty">solar dynasty</a>. Historians who propose the southern origin have further debated whether the early petty chieftains of the clan (prior to their rise to power) were natives of the southern districts of modern Karnataka, the <a href="Kongu%20Nadu">Kongu</a> region in modern <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> or of the southern districts of modern <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. These regions encompass an area of the southern <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a> where the three modern states merge geographically. It is theorised that the Gangas may have taken advantage of the confusion caused by the invasion of southern India by the <a href="North%20India">northern</a> king <a href="Samudra%20Gupta">Samudra Gupta</a> prior to 350, and carved out a kingdom for themselves. The area they controlled was called Gangavadi and included regions of the modern districts of <a href="Mysore%20district">Mysore</a>, <a href="Hassan%20district">Hassan</a> <a href="Chamarajanagar%20district">Chamarajanagar</a>, <a href="Tumkur%20district">Tumkur</a>, <a href="Kolar%20district">Kolar</a>, <a href="Mandya%20district">Mandya</a> and <a href="Bangalore%20district">Bangalore</a> in Karnataka state. At times, they also controlled some areas in modern <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> (Kongu region starting from the 6th century rule of King Avinita) and <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> (Ananthpur region starting from the middle of the 5th century). The founding king of the dynasty was Konganivarma Madhava who made <a href="Kolar">Kolar</a> his capital around 350 and ruled for about twenty years.

By the time of Harivarma in 390, the Gangas had consolidated their kingdom with <a href="Talakad">Talakad</a> as their capital. Their move from the early capital Kolar may have been a strategic one with the intention of containing the growing <a href="Kadamba%20Dynasty">Kadamba</a> power. By 430 they had consolidated their eastern territories comprising modern Bangalore, Kolar and Tumkur districts and by 470 they had gained control over Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu, Sendraka (modern <a href="Chikkamagaluru">Chikkamagaluru</a> and <a href="Belur%2C%20Karnataka">Belur</a>), Punnata and Pannada regions (comprising modern <a href="Heggadadevanakote">Heggadadevanakote</a> and <a href="Nanjangud">Nanjangud</a>) in modern Karnataka. In 529, King <a href="Durvinita">Durvinita</a> ascended the throne after waging a war with his younger brother who was favoured by his father, King <a href="Avinita">Avinita</a>. Some accounts suggest that in this power struggle, the Pallavas of Kanchi supported Avinita's choice of heir and the Badami Chalukya King Vijayaditya supported his father-in-law, Durvinita. From the inscriptions it is known that these battles were fought in Tondaimandalam and Kongu regions (northern Tamil Nadu) prompting historians to suggest that Durvinita fought the Pallavas successfully. Considered the most successful of the Ganga kings, Durvinita was well versed in arts such as music, dance, <a href="ayurveda">ayurveda</a> and taming wild elephants. Some inscriptions sing paeans to him by comparing him to <a href="Yudhishthira">Yudhishthira</a> and <a href="Manu%20%28Hinduism%29">Manu</a> – figures from Hindu mythology known for their wisdom and fairness.

Politically, the Gangas were feudatories and close allies who also shared matrimonial relations with the Chalukyas. This is attested by inscriptions which describe their joint campaigns against their arch enemy, the Pallavas of Kanchi. From the year 725 onwards, the Gangavadi territories came to be called as the "Gangavadi-96000" ("Shannavati Sahasra Vishaya") comprising the eastern and western provinces of modern south Karnataka. King <a href="Sripurusha">Sripurusha</a> fought the Pallava King Nandivarman Pallavamalla successfully, bringing Penkulikottai in north <a href="Arcot">Arcot</a> under his control temporarily for which he earned the title "Permanadi". A contest with the Pandyas of <a href="Madurai">Madurai</a> over control of Kongu region ended in a Ganga defeat, but a matrimony between a Ganga princess and Rajasimha Pandya's son brought peace helping the Gangas retain control over the contested region.

In 753, when the Rashtrakutas replaced the Badami Chalukyas as the dominant force in the Deccan, the Gangas offered stiff resistance for about a century. King <a href="Shivamara%20II">Shivamara II</a> is mostly known for his wars with the Rashtrakuta <a href="Dhruva%20Dharavarsha">Dhruva Dharavarsha</a>, his subsequent defeat and imprisonment, his release from prison and eventually his death on the battle field. The Ganga resistance continued through the reign of Rashtrakuta <a href="Govinda%20III">Govinda III</a> and by 819, a Ganga resurgence gained them partial control over Gangavadi under King Rachamalla. Seeing the futility of waging war with the Western Ganga, Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I gave his daughter Chandrabbalabbe in marriage to Ganga prince Butuga I, son of King Ereganga Neetimarga. The Gangas thereafter became staunch allies of the Rashtrakutas, a position they maintained till the end of the Rashtrakuta dynasty of Manyakheta.

After an uneventful period, <a href="Butuga%20II">Butuga II</a> ascended the throne in 938 with the help of Rashtrakuta <a href="Amoghavarsha%20III">Amoghavarsha III</a> (whose daughter he married). He helped the Rashtrakutas win decisive victories in <a href="Sangam%20period">Tamilakam</a> in the <a href="battle%20of%20Takkolam">battle of Takkolam</a> against the <a href="Chola%20Dynasty">Chola Dynasty</a>. With this victory, the Rashtrakutas took control of modern northern Tamil Nadu. In return for their valour, the Gangas were awarded extensive territories in the <a href="Tungabhadra">Tungabhadra</a> river valley. King Marasimha II who came to power in 963 aided the Rashtrakutas in victories against the Gurjara <a href="Pratihara">Pratihara</a> King Lalla and the <a href="Paramara">Paramara</a> kings of <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a> in <a href="Central%20India">Central India</a>. <a href="Chavundaraya">Chavundaraya</a>, a minister in the Western Ganga court was a valiant commander, able administrator and an accomplished poet in <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> and Sanskrit. He served King Marasimha II and his successors ably and helped King Rachamalla IV suppress a civil war in 975. Towards the end of the 10th century, the Rashtrakutas had been supplanted by the <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20Empire">Western Chalukya Empire</a> in <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a>. In the south, the <a href="Chola%20Dynasty">Chola Dynasty</a> who were seeing a resurgence of power under <a href="Rajaraja%20Chola%20I">Rajaraja Chola I</a> conquered Gangavadi around the year 1000, bringing the Western Ganga dynasty to an end. Thereafter, large areas of south Karnataka region came under Chola control for about a century.

The Western Ganga administration was influenced by principles stated in the ancient text "<a href="arthashastra">arthashastra</a>". The "praje gavundas" mentioned in the Ganga records held responsibilities similar to those of the village elders ("gramavriddhas") mentioned by <a href="Kautilya">Kautilya</a>. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked. The kingdom was divided into "Rashtra" (district) and further into "Visaya" (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and "Desa". From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term "Visaya" was replaced by the <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> term "Nadu". Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000, with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division or the number of villages included in that territory.

<a href="Epigraphy">Inscriptions</a> have revealed several important administrative designations such as prime minister ("sarvadhikari"), treasurer ("shribhandari"), foreign minister ("sandhivirgrahi") and chief minister ("mahapradhana"). All of these positions came with an additional title of commander ("dandanayaka"). Other designations were royal steward ("manevergade"), master of robes ("mahapasayita"), commander of elephant corps ("gajasahani"), commander of cavalry ("thuragasahani") etc. In the royal house, "<a href="Niyogi">Niyogi</a>s" oversaw palace administration, royal clothing and jewellery etc. and the "Padiyara" were responsible for court ceremonies including door keeping and protocol.

Officials at the local level were the "pergade", "nadabova", "nalagamiga", "prabhu" and "gavunda". The "pergades" were superintendents from all social classes such as artisans, gold smiths, black smiths etc. The "pergades" dealing with the royal household were called "manepergade" (house superintendent) and those who collected tolls were called "Sunka vergades". The "nadabovas" were accountants and tax collectors at the "Nadu" level and sometimes functioned as scribes. The "nalagamigas" were officers who organized and maintained defence at the "Nadu" level. The "prabhu" constituted a group of elite people drawn together to witness land grants and demarcation of land boundaries. The "gavundas" who appear most often in inscriptions were the backbone of medieval polity of the southern Karnataka region. They were landlords and local elite whom the state utilized their services to collect taxes, maintain records of landownership, bear witness to grants and transactions and even raise militia when required.

Inscriptions that specify land grants, rights and ownership were descriptive of the boundaries of demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts ("kote") if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included was the type of soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation. Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land. There are numerous references to hamlets ("palli") belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them ("bedapalli"). From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title "arasa". The "arasas" were either <a href="brahmin">brahmin</a>s or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king. The "velavali" who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath ("vele"). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the "velavali" were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.

The Gangavadi region consisted of the <a href="malnad">malnad</a> region, the plains (<a href="Bayaluseemae">Bayaluseemae</a>) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, <a href="betel">betel</a> leaves, <a href="cardamom">cardamom</a> and <a href="Black%20pepper">pepper</a> and the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced <a href="rice">rice</a>, millets such as <a href="Finger%20millet">ragi</a> and <a href="maize">corn</a>, pulses, <a href="oilseed">oilseed</a>s and it was also the base for cattle farming. The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by <a href="Kaveri%20River">Kaveri</a>, <a href="Tungabhadra">Tungabhadra</a> and <a href="Vedavati">Vedavati</a> rivers where cultivations of <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a>, paddy, <a href="coconut">coconut</a>, <a href="areca">areca</a> nut ("adeka totta"), betel leaves, <a href="Plantain%20%28cooking%29">plantain</a> and flowers ("vara vana") were common. Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams ("Katta"). Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.

Soil types mentioned in records are black soil ("Karimaniya") in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil ("Kebbayya mannu") Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land and to a lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called "kalani", "galde", "nir mannu" or "nir panya" and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water. The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms "gosahasra" (a thousand cows), "gasara" (owner of cows), "gosasi" (donor of cows), "goyiti" (cowherdess), "gosasa" (protector of cows) attest to this. Inscriptions indicate ownership of cows may have been as important as cultivable land and that there may have existed a social hierarchy based on this. Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women ("pendir-udeyulcal"), abduction of women by "bedas" (hunter tribes); all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age.

Lands that were exempt from taxes were called "manya" and sometimes consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without any reference to the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished in the line of duty were called "bilavritti" or "kalnad". When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called "Talavritti". Some types of taxes on income were "kara" or "anthakara" (internal taxes), "utkota" (gifts due to the king), "hiranya" (cash payments) and "sulika" (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.

"Siddhaya" was a local tax levied on agriculture and "pottondi" was a tax levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler. Based on context, "pottondi" also meant 1/10, "aydalavi" meant 1/5 and "elalavi" meant 1/7. "Mannadare" literally meant land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax ("Kurimbadere") payable to the chief of shepherds. "Bhaga" meant a portion or share of the produce from land or the land area itself. Minor taxes such as "Kirudere" (due to the landlords) and "samathadere" (raised by the army officers or "samantha") are mentioned. In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer's retinue, villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battles. "Bittuvatta" or "niravari" taxes comprised usually of a percentage of the produce and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks.

The Western Gangas gave patronage to all the major religions of the time; <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> and the Hindu sects of <a href="Shaivism">Shaivism</a>, <a href="Historical%20Vedic%20religion">Vedic</a> <a href="Vedic%20Brahmanism">Brahminism</a> and <a href="Vaishnavism">Vaishnavism</a>. However scholars have argued that not all Gangas kings may have given equal priority to all the faiths. Some historians believe that the Gangas were ardent Jains. However, inscriptions contradict this by providing references to "kalamukhas" (staunch Shaiva ascetics), "pasupatas" and "lokayatas" (followers of "Pasupatha" doctrine) who flourished in Gangavadi, indicating that Shaivism was also popular. King Madhava and Harivarma were devoted to cows and brahmins, King Vishnugopa was a devout <a href="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a>, Madhava III's and Avinita's inscriptions describe lavish endowments to Jain orders and temples and King Durvinita performed Vedic sacrifices prompting historians to claim he was a <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>.

Jainism became popular in the dynasty in the 8th century when the ruler King Shivamara I constructed numerous Jain "<a href="basadi">basadi</a>s". King Butuga II and minister <a href="Chavundaraya">Chavundaraya</a> were staunch Jains which is evident from the construction of the <a href="Gommateshwara">Gommateshwara</a> monolith. Jains worshipped the twenty four "<a href="tirthankar">tirthankar</a>s" ("Jinas") whose images were consecrated in their temples. The worship of the footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of <a href="Bhadrabahu">Bhadrabahu</a> in <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a> from the 10th century is considered a parallel to <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of <a href="Bahubali">Bahubali</a>, the son of "<a href="Tirthankar">Tirthankar</a> Adinatha" (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva). The worship of subordinate deities such as "yaksa" and "yaksi", earlier considered as mere attendants of the "tirthankars" was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century.

Vedic Brahminism was popular in the 6th and 7th centuries when inscriptions refer to grants made to "Srotriya" Brahmins. These inscriptions also describe the "gotra" (lineage) affiliation to royal families and their adherence of such Vedic rituals as "asvamedha" (horse sacrifice) and "hiranyagarbha". Brahmins and kings enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship; rituals performed by the brahmins gave legitimacy to kings and the land grants made by kings to brahmins elevated them in society to the level of wealthy landowners. Vaishnavism however maintained a low profile and not many inscriptions describe grants towards its cause. Some Vaishnava temples were built by the Gangas such as the "Narayanaswami" temples at <a href="Nanjangud">Nanjangud</a>, Sattur and Hangala in modern Mysore district. The deity <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> was depicted with four arms holding a conch ("sanka"), discus ("cakra"), mace ("gada") and lotus ("padma").

From the beginning of the 8th century, patronage to Shaivism increased in every section of the society; the landed elite, landlords, assemblies ("samaya"), schools of learning ("aghraharas") and minor ruling families such as the <a href="Bana%20Kingdom">Bana</a>, <a href="Nolamba">Nolamba</a> and <a href="Chalukya">Chalukya</a> clans. The Shaiva temples contained a Shiva "linga" (phallus) in the <a href="sanctum%20sanctorum">sanctum sanctorum</a> along with images of the mother goddess, <a href="Surya">Surya</a> (Sun god) and <a href="Nandi%20%28bull%29">Nandi</a> (a bull and attendant of Shiva) which was normally enshrined in a separate pavilion facing the sanctum. The "linga" was man made and in some cases had etchings of <a href="Ganapati">Ganapati</a> (son of Shiva) and <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a> (consort and wife of Shiva) on it. Due to the vigorous efforts of priests and ascetics, Shaiva monastic orders flourished in many places such as <a href="Nandi%20Hills%2C%20India">Nandi Hills</a>, <a href="Avani">Avani</a> and Hebbata in modern Kolar district.

The Western Ganga society in many ways reflected the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of Kundattur and the queens of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and feudal king Permadi. Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by the son-in-law, the wife or by the daughter is evident. The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of "nalgavunda" (local landlord) bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, the wife of a fallen hero are examples. When Jakkiabbe took to asceticism, her daughter inherited the position.

The devadasi system ("sule" or courtesan) in temples was prevalent and was modelled after the structures in the royal palace. Contemporaneous literature such a "<a href="Vaddaradhane">Vaddaradhane</a>" makes a mention of the chief queen ("Dharani Mahadevi") accompanied by lower ranking queens ("arasiyargal") and courtesans of the women's royal quarter ("pendarasada suleyargal"). Some of the courtesans and concubines employed in the harem of the kings and chieftains were well respected, examples being Nandavva at whose instance a local chief made land grant to a Jain temple. Education in the royal family was closely supervised and included such subjects as political science, elephant and horse riding, archery, medicine, poetry, grammar, drama, literature, dance, singing and use of musical instruments. Brahmins enjoyed an influential position in society and were exempt from certain taxes and customs due on land. In turn they managed public affairs such as teaching, local judiciary, functioned as trustees and bankers, managed schools, temples, irrigation tanks, rest houses, collected taxes due from villages and raised money from public subscriptions.

By virtue of a Hindu belief that killing of a brahmin ("Bramhatya") was a sin, capital punishment was not applicable to them. Upper caste <a href="kshatriya">kshatriya</a>s ("satkshatriya") were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the <a href="Hindu%20caste%20system">Hindu caste system</a>; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among <a href="vaishya">vaishya</a> and two among <a href="shudra">shudra</a>s. Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. if there were no male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as "Dharmadeya" (charitable asset). Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, "Svayamvara" marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue. Memorials containing <a href="hero%20stone">hero stone</a>s ("virkal") were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.

The presence of numerous "Mahasatikals" (or "Mastikal" – hero stones for a woman who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) indicates the popularity of <a href="Sati%20%28practice%29">Sati</a> among royalty. Ritual death by "<a href="sallekhana">sallekhana</a>" and by "jalasamadhi" (drowning in water) were also practiced. Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a <a href="Dhoti">Dhoti</a> as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore <a href="Sari">Sari</a>s with stitched petticoats. Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds. Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces ("honnasara" and "honnagala sara"), bracelets ("Kaduga") and wristlets ("Kaftkina"). Women wore a nose jewel ("bottu"), nose ring ("mugutti"), bangles ("bale" or "kankana") and various types of necklaces ("honna gante sara" and "kati sutra"). During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, <a href="cockfighting">cock fights</a> and ram fights. There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as "agraharas", "ghatikas", "brahmapura" or "matha". Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, <a href="Balligavi">Balligavi</a>, <a href="Talagunda">Talagunda</a>, <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a>, <a href="Arasikere">Arasikere</a> and other places.

The Western Ganga rule was a period of brisk literary activity in Sanskrit and Kannada, though many of the writings are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them. Chavundaraya's writing, "Chavundaraya Purana" (or "Trishashtilakshana mahapurana") of 978 CE, is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings, "<a href="Adipurana">Adipurana</a>" and "Uttarapurana" which were written a century earlier by <a href="Jinasena">Jinasena</a> and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a>. The prose, composed in lucid Kannada, was mainly meant for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. His writings seem to be influenced by the writings of his predecessor <a href="Adikavi%20Pampa">Adikavi Pampa</a> and contemporary <a href="Ranna%20%28Kannada%20poet%29">Ranna</a>. The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty-four Jain "Tirthankar", twelve "Chakravartis", nine "Balabhadras", nine "Narayanas" and nine "Pratinarayanas".

The earliest postulated Kannada writer from this dynasty is King Durvinita of the 6th century. <a href="Kavirajamarga">Kavirajamarga</a> of 850 CE, refers to a Durvinita as an early writer of Kannada <a href="prose">prose</a>. Around 900 CE, Gunavarma I authored the Kannada works, "Shudraka" and "Harivamsha". His writings are considered extinct but references to these writings are found in later years. He is known to have been patronised by King Ereganga Neetimarga II. In "Shudraka", he has favourably compared his patron to King Shudraka of ancient times. The great Kannada poet Ranna was patronised by Chavundaraya in his early literary days. Ranna's classic "Parashurama charite" is considered a eulogy of his patron who held such titles as "Samara Parashurama".

<a href="Nagavarma%20I">Nagavarma I</a>, a brahmin scholar who came from <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a> in modern Andhra Pradesh (late 10th century) was also patronised by Chavundaraya. He wrote "Chandombudhi" (ocean of prosody) addressed to his wife. This is considered the earliest available Kannada writing in <a href="Prosody%20%28poetry%29">prosody</a>. He also wrote one of the earliest available <a href="Romance%20%28heroic%20literature%29">romance</a> classics in Kannada called "Karnataka Kadambari" in sweet and flowing "champu" (mixed verse and prose) style. It is based on an earlier romantic work in Sanskrit by poet Bana and is popular among critics. "Gajashtaka" (hundred verses on elephants), a rare Kannada work on elephant management was written by King Shivamara II around 800 CE but this work is now considered extinct. Other writers such as Manasiga and Chandrabhatta were known to be popular in the 10th century.

In an age of classical Sanskrit literature, Madhava II (brother of King Vishnugopa) wrote a treatise "Dattaka Sutravritti" which was based on an earlier work on erotics by a writer called Dattaka. A Sanskrit version of "Vaddakatha", a commentary on <a href="P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini">Pāṇini</a>'s grammar called "Sabdavathara" and a commentary on the 15th chapter of a Sanskrit work called "Kiratarjunneya" by poet Bharavi (who was in Durvinita's court) are ascribed to Durvinita. King Shivamara II is known to have written "Gajamata Kalpana". Hemasena, also known as Vidya Dhananjaya authored "Raghavapandaviya", a narration of the stories of <a href="Rama">Rama</a> and the <a href="Pandava">Pandava</a>s simultaneously through puns. "Gayachintamani" and "Kshatrachudamini" which were based on poet Bana's work "Kadambari" were written by Hemasena's pupil Vadeebhasimha in prose style. and Chavundaraya wrote "Charitarasara".

The Western Ganga style of architecture was influenced by the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, in addition to indigenous Jain features. The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head, the stepped "<a href="Sikhara">Vimana</a>" of the shrine with horizontal <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">moulding</a>s and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and <a href="Nolambas">Nolambas</a>.

The monolith of <a href="Gomateshwara">Gomateshwara</a> commissioned by Chavundaraya is considered the high point of the Ganga sculptural contribution in ancient Karnataka. Carved from fine-grained white granite, the image stands on a lotus. It has no support up to the thighs and is tall with the face measuring . With the serene expression on the face of the image, its curled hair with graceful locks, its proportional anatomy, the monolith size, and the combination of its artistry and craftsmanship have led it to be called the mightiest achievement in sculptural art in medieval Karnataka. It is the largest monolithic statue in the world. Their free standing pillars called "Mahasthambha" or "Bhrahmasthambha" are also considered unique, examples of which are the Brahmadeva pillar and <a href="Tyagada%20Brahmadeva%20Pillar">Tyagada Brahmadeva Pillar</a>. At the top of the pillar whose shaft (cylindrical or octagonal) is decorated with creepers and other floral motifs is the seated "Brahma" and the base of the pillar normally has engravings of important Jain personalities and inscriptions.

Other important contributions are the Jain basadis' whose towers have gradually receding stories ("talas") ornamented with small models of temples. These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars (Jain saints). Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative <a href="Kirtimukha">Kirtimukha</a> (demon faces) are used at the top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of <a href="Gomateshwara">Gomateshwara</a> of 982 are the most important monuments at <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a>. Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King <a href="Chandragupta%20Maurya">Chandragupta Maurya</a> are known to be his creation. The <a href="Panchakuta%20Basadi%2C%20Kambadahalli">Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli</a> (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of <a href="Dravidian%20architecture">Dravidian</a> art. The wall niches here are surmounted by "torana" (<a href="Post%20and%20lintel">lintel</a>) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures ("gandharva") and imaginary monsters (<a href="Yalli%20%28motif%29">"makara"</a>) ridden by <a href="Yaksha">"Yaksas"</a> (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.

The Gangas built many Hindu temples with impressive Dravidian <a href="Gopuram">gopuras</a> containing stucco figures from the Hindu pantheon, decorated pierced screen windows which are featured in the "mantapa" (hall) along with "<a href="Matrika">saptamatrika</a>" carvings (seven heavenly mothers). Some well known examples are the <a href="Arakeshvara%20Temple%2C%20Hole%20Alur">Arakeshvara Temple</a> at Hole Alur, Kapileswara temple at Manne, Kolaramma temple at Kolar, <a href="Rameshvara%20Temple%2C%20Narasamangala">Rameshvara temple at Narasamangala</a>, <a href="Nageshvara%20Temple%2C%20Begur">Nagareshvara temple</a> at Begur and the <a href="Kalleshvara%20Temple%2C%20Aralaguppe">Kallesvara temple</a> at Aralaguppe. At Talakad they built the Maralesvara temple, the Arakesvara temple and the Patalesvara temple. Unlike the Jain temples where floral frieze decoration is common, Hindu temples were distinguished by friezes (slab of stone with decorative sculptures) illustrating episodes from the epics and <a href="purana">purana</a>s. Another unique legacy of the Gangas are the number of "virgal" (hero stones) they have left behind; memorials containing sculptural details in relief of war scenes, Hindu deities, "saptamatrikas", Jain tirthankars and ritual death (such as the <a href="Doddahundi%20nishidhi%20inscription">Doddahundi hero stone</a>).

The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit extensively as their language of administration. Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages. In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of Kings and benedictions tended to be in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language. The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries. During the first phase (350–725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration and the fact that majority of the records from this phase were "<a href="brahmadeya">brahmadeya</a>" grants (grants to Brahmin temples). In the second phase (725–1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith. Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early <a href="Indian%20copper%20plate%20inscriptions">copper plate</a> bilingual inscriptions dated 444. The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village. An interesting inscription discovered at Beguru near modern <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> that deserves mention is the epigraph dated 890 that refers to a "Bengaluru" war. This is in "Hale Kannada" (old Kannada) language and is the earliest mention of the name of <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> city. The Western Gangas minted coins with Kannada and Nagari legends, the most common feature on their coins was the image of an elephant on the obverse and floral petal symbols on the reverse. The Kannada legend "Bhadr", a royal umbrella or a conch shell appeared on top of the elephant image. The denominations are the "pagoda" (weighing 52 grains), the "fanam" weighting one tenth or one half of the "pagoda" and the quarter "fanams".

Ngô Đình Cẩn

Ngô Đình Cẩn (; 1911 – 9 May 1964) was a younger brother and confidant of <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>'s first president, <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>, and an important member of the Diệm government. Diệm put Cẩn in charge of central Vietnam, stretching from <a href="Phan%20Thi%E1%BA%BFt">Phan Thiết</a> in the south to the border at the <a href="17th%20parallel%20north">17th parallel</a>, with Cẩn ruling the region as a virtual <a href="dictator">dictator</a>. Based in the former imperial capital of <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF">Huế</a>, Cẩn operated <a href="private%20army">private armies</a> and <a href="secret%20police">secret police</a> that controlled the central region and earned himself a reputation as the most oppressive of the Ngô brothers.

In his youth, Cẩn was a follower of the nationalist <a href="Phan%20B%E1%BB%99i%20Ch%C3%A2u">Phan Bội Châu</a>. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he worked to organise support for Diệm as various Vietnamese groups and international powers sought to stamp their authority over Vietnam. Cẩn, who succeeded in eliminating alternative nationalist opposition in central Vietnam, became the warlord of the region when his brother became president of the southern half of the <a href="partition%20of%20Vietnam">partitioned nation</a> in 1955. He became notorious for his involvement in smuggling and corruption, as well as his autocratic rule. Cẩn was regarded as an effective leader against the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> communist insurgency, which was much weaker in central Vietnam than in other parts of South Vietnam. His Popular Force militia was regarded by US officials in central Vietnam as a successful counter to the communists.

Cẩn's influence began to wane after his elder brother <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Ngô Đình Thục</a> was appointed the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế. Thục overshadowed Cẩn and aggressively promoted <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Catholicism</a>, which led to the banning of the <a href="Buddhist%20flag">Buddhist flag</a> in 1963 during <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a>, the celebration of the birthday of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>. Cẩn's forces <a href="Hue%20Vesak%20shootings">opened fire</a> on a crowd who were protesting the ban, killing nine and precipitating the <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist crisis</a>. Ongoing demonstrations intensified throughout the summer as the regime responded with increased brutality, sparking the toppling of the Diem regime in a <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">November 1963 coup</a>. Cẩn had been offered asylum by the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20State">US Department of State</a>, but ambassador <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge%20Jr.">Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.</a> had <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a> agent <a href="Lucien%20Conein">Lucien Conein</a> arrest the fallen Ngô in Saigon. Cẩn was turned over to the <a href="military%20junta">military junta</a>, which tried and executed him in 1964.

Cẩn was the fifth of six sons born to <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Kh%E1%BA%A3">Ngô Đình Khả</a>, who was a <a href="mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarin</a> in the imperial court of Emperor <a href="Th%C3%A0nh%20Th%C3%A1i">Thành Thái</a>, who was ruling under French control.

Khả retired from the court in protest at French interference, taking up farming. Cẩn's first and third brothers – <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Khoi">Ngô Đình Khôi</a> and Diệm – rose to become provincial governors under French rule. Diệm, like his father, resigned in protest in 1933, while Khôi was assassinated in 1945 by <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Hồ Chí Minh</a>'s cadres. The second brother, <a href="Pierre%20Martin%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục</a>, was appointed as the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Archbishop of Huế. A fourth brother <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a> became the family's chief political strategist, while the youngest, <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Luy%E1%BB%87n">Ngô Đình Luyện</a> was a diplomat when the family held power in <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>. Of the Ngô brothers, only Thục and Luyện avoided being executed or assassinated during Vietnam's political upheavals.

Details about Cẩn's early life are scarce. In his youth, he had studied the writings and opinions of the renowned anti-French Vietnamese nationalist <a href="Phan%20B%E1%BB%99i%20Ch%C3%A2u">Phan Bội Châu</a>, who spent his last years in Huế. Regarded as the leading revolutionary of his time, Châu had been captured and sentenced to death, before having his sentence reduced to house arrest. Cẩn regularly traveled to Châu's <a href="sampan">sampan</a> on the <a href="Perfume%20River">Perfume River</a> with gifts of food and listened to Châu's political lectures. Regarded as the least educated of his family, Cẩn had never traveled outside Vietnam and was the only Ngô brother not to have studied at a European-run institution.

Vietnam was in chaos after the Japanese invaded the country during World War II and displaced the French colonial administration. At the end of the war, the Japanese left the country, and France, severely weakened by political turmoil within the <a href="Vichy%20regime">Vichy regime</a>, was unable to exert control. Hồ Chí Minh's <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> declared independence as the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Democratic Republic of Vietnam</a> and battled other Vietnamese nationalist groups as well as French forces for control of the nation. During this time, Cẩn organised a clandestine support base for Diệm in central Vietnam. At the time, Diệm was one of many nationalists who were attempting to stake a claim to national leadership, having spent a decade in self-imposed exile from public affairs. Cẩn helped weaken other anti-communist nationalist groups, such as the <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Nam%20Qu%E1%BB%91c%20D%C3%A2n%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A3ng">Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng</a> (Vietnamese Nationalist Party) and the <a href="%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i%20Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Qu%E1%BB%91c%20D%C3%A2n%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A3ng">Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng</a> (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), which competed with Diệm for support. On 23 October 1955, Diệm toppled <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a> in a <a href="1955%20State%20of%20Vietnam%20referendum">fraud-ridden referendum</a> orchestrated by Nhu. Diệm declared himself President of the newly proclaimed <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Republic of Vietnam</a> three days later.

Cẩn's men helped to cower the populace into voting for his brother. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with <a href="pepper%20sauce">pepper sauce</a> and water often forced down their nostrils. The violations were particularly flagrant in Cẩn's area, which was the home of the <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20dynasty">Nguyễn dynasty</a> and a source of sympathy towards Bảo Đại. Cẩn ordered the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In <a href="H%E1%BB%99i%20An">Hội An</a>, some people were killed in election day violence.

With Diệm's ascent to the leadership of <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> in 1955, Cẩn's stock rose. Cẩn had no formal position in the government but was effectively regarded as the warlord of central Vietnam. He had almost unlimited power in the region, often interfering with army operations against the <a href="National%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20South%20Vietnam">Việt Cộng</a> in a style described as "feudal". Robert Scigliano, a journalist and academic from the <a href="Michigan%20State%20University%20Vietnam%20Advisory%20Group">Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group</a>, asserted that Cẩn, along with Nhu, <a href="Madame%20Nhu">Madame Nhu</a> and eldest brother Archbishop <a href="Pierre%20Martin%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục</a> formed "an extralegal elite which, with Diệm, directs the destiny of Vietnam". Cẩn sometimes vetoed government-appointed officials posted to central Vietnam from Saigon.

Cẩn ran his own personal army and secret police, which fought the Việt Cộng and imprisoned other anti-communist political opponents. Cẩn accumulated great wealth through corrupt practices such as <a href="Graft%20%28politics%29">graft</a> in awarding <a href="foreign%20aid">foreign aid</a> contracts from the United States governments of <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> to Vietnamese businessmen. He required the businessmen to pay a fee to the National Revolutionary Movement – the official party of the regime – in return for the processing of applications for foreign aid contracts and import licenses. Cẩn was widely believed to be selling <a href="rice">rice</a> to <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> on the <a href="black%20market">black market</a>, as well as organising the <a href="Drug%20trafficking">trafficking</a> of <a href="opium">opium</a> throughout Asia via <a href="Laos">Laos</a>, and monopolising the <a href="cinnamon">cinnamon</a> trade.
He was often in conflict with his brothers regarding internal matters, with Nhu, Diệm's most influential adviser, controlling the southern part of the country. The brothers often competed with each other for US aid contracts and the rice trade, but did not interfere with matters in one another's territorial zone. Cẩn had once tried to set up an office for his secret police in <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> (which was in Nhu's southern region) by showing Diệm his long list of detained political opponents, but insisted that he not have to report to Nhu. He brutally suppressed dissent by using torture and re-education camps to achieve his aims. Comparing Cẩn to his brothers, Scigliano said that he was "also considered the most severe, some would say primitive, member of the family and he rules his domain with a strict and sometimes brutal hand". Referring to his autocratic style, a Vietnamese critic said that unlike Diệm, Cẩn was consistent and left his followers in no doubt as to what he wanted: "They are not confused by double talk about democratic ideals and institutions". His creation of a well-defined system of incentives and deterrence has been cited as one reason for his success.

In spite of his autocracy and iron rule, Cẩn earned praise from Huế-based US officials for his relatively high levels of success against the Việt Cộng insurgency. Cẩn's central region was much more peaceful than the restive areas near Saigon and the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>. Cẩn created the Popular Force organisation to operate in central Vietnam. The Popular Force was an alternative to the <a href="Strategic%20Hamlet%20Program">Strategic Hamlet Program</a> which was used on a much larger scale in the south by Nhu, who moved peasants into fortified camps in an attempt to isolate Vietcong cadres from accessing the rural populace and intimidating or otherwise gaining their support. Cẩn assumed a third or so of the rural peasantry were Việt Cộng sympathisers, significant enough to render the hamlets ineffective by intimidating other villagers from within. Cẩn's Popular Force were a group of volunteers who underwent rigorous training similar to <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Recruit%20Training">United States Marine Corps Recruit Training</a>. Those who passed the training were put into units of 150 men and assigned to live and work in the villages by day. At night, they did defense patrols, using <a href="Hit-and-run%20tactics">hit-and-run</a> tactics against the <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20C%E1%BB%99ng">Việt Cộng</a>. According to the report by US officials in central Vietnam, the program aroused popular support because of the integration of the Popular Force's personnel into the daily life of the village and the sense of security that the force provided. The units were generally regarded as being successful in their six-month deployments, allowing them to be deployed to the next trouble spot. Officials in Washington disagreed with the assessment of their subordinates in central Vietnam, alleging that Cẩn was mainly using the Popular Force for repressing dissidents.

Cẩn was considered the most secular of the four Ngô brothers who controlled Vietnam's domestic affairs. With the appointment of elder brother Thục as the Archbishop of Huế in 1961, Cẩn became less influential as Thục aggressively blurred the distinction between church and state. In early 1963, Nhu sent an emissary from Saigon telling Cẩn to retire and leave for Japan. Unrest erupted in the summer of 1963. After the flying of <a href="Vatican%20flag">Vatican flag</a>s was permitted at a celebration for the anniversary of Thục's consecration as a bishop, the flying of <a href="Buddhist%20flag">Buddhist flag</a>s on 8 May to commemorate <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a> – the birth of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> – was banned. Cẩn's subordinates ordered government forces to fire on the unarmed Buddhist crowd protesting the ban, killing nine. Cẩn believed the United States, whose relations with South Vietnam had become strained, caused an explosion during the Vesak shootings, to destabilise his family's regime.

Another notable religious incident occurred in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized <a href="carp">carp</a> was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of <a href="Da%20Nang">Đà Nẵng</a>. Local Buddhists began to believe that the fish was a <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of one of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>'s disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among Cẩn's district chief and his subordinates. The local law enforcement agencies mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Special%20Forces">Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces</a>, led by Colonel <a href="Le%20Quang%20Tung">Lê Quang Tung</a> under the direction of Nhu. The grenading of the pond finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.

Sparked by the killings in Huế on Vesak, the Buddhists organised nationwide mass protests against the religious bias of the Diệm regime throughout the summer of 1963, demanding religious equality. The protests were met with brutal crackdowns, including ARVN Special Forces attacks on Buddhist pagodas which left hundreds missing, presumed dead. As public discontent heightened, a group of ARVN officers planned and carried out a US-backed coup in November. This came about after Cẩn's protégé <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20%C4%90%C3%ADnh">Tôn Thất Đính</a>, a 37-year-old who became the youngest-ever general in the ARVN due to his loyalty to the Diệm regime, switched sides and helped the coup when his corps was expected to remain loyal. Diệm and Nhu were executed at the conclusion of the coup.

Following the downfall of the Ngô family, the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> came under pressure from the South Vietnamese public to take a hard line against Cẩn. Mass graves containing 200 bodies were found on his land. The US consul in Huế, John Helble, confirmed the existence of rows of 18th-century style dungeons with filthy, dark cells in an old French arsenal. Although junta member General <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%C3%B4n">Trần Văn Đôn</a> asserted that the compound predated the Diệm era, the town's citizens saw Cẩn as a mass murderer. On 4 November, two days after the coup ended, thousands of irate townspeople walked three kilometres to Cẩn's house on the city's southern outskirts – where he lived with his aged mother – demanding vengeance. The <a href="Military%20dictatorship">junta</a> had ringed the home with barbed wire and armoured cars, sensing that the populace would riot and attack Cẩn. By this time, Cẩn had escaped to a Catholic seminary, but was considering applying to the Americans for political asylum. The US State Department was faced with a dilemma: sheltering Cẩn would associate them with the protection of a corrupt and authoritarian regime that had tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of its own people. Allowing Cẩn to be attacked by angry mobs would damage the reputation of the new American-backed junta. The State Department instructed: 

The White House sent a cable to the <a href="US%20Embassy%2C%20Saigon">US Embassy, Saigon</a> on November 4 agreeing that Cẩn and his mother needed evacuation. General <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%97%20Cao%20Tr%C3%AD">Đỗ Cao Trí</a>, the commander of the ARVN I Corps, who had repressed the Buddhists in Huế, privately told Cẩn that the junta would allow him safe passage out of Vietnam. On 5 November, Cẩn sought refuge at the US consulate with a suitcase crammed with US currency. Trí was then told that Cẩn was not safe in Huế and that he was to send Cẩn to Saigon, immediately for his own protection. Trí would only promise safe passage in an American plane to Saigon, where embassy officials would meet Cẩn. On the journey to the capital, Cẩn was accompanied by four Americans: a vice-consul, two <a href="military%20police">military police</a>men and a lieutenant colonel. He had intended to seek asylum in Japan.

US ambassador <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge%2C%20Jr.">Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.</a> had other ideas. Instead of sending embassy officials to <a href="Tan%20Son%20Nhut">Tân Sơn Nhứt</a> airport, Lodge sent CIA agent <a href="Lucien%20Conein">Lucien Conein</a>, who had helped the Vietnamese generals to plan the coup. Conein turned Cẩn over to the junta. Lodge said that General Đôn had promised that Cẩn would be dealt with "legally and judicially". The ambassador told Washington that asylum was unnecessary, saying "It seems to me that our reason for giving him asylum therefore no longer exists". He said that the US could not interfere with justice, since Cẩn was "undoubtedly a reprehensible figure who deserves all the loathing which he now receives". Lodge reasoned that since Cẩn would not be killed, protecting him would give the impression that the US backed his activities. Lodge said that General <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a>, who was the President, implied that Cẩn would receive clemency even if sentenced to death. This contradicted Conein's assertion that the ARVN officer corps felt that Cẩn should be executed. Cẩn's case was damaged by the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners, who recounted tales of torture at the hands of the Ngô brothers.

It was reported that General <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Kh%C3%A1nh">Nguyễn Khánh</a> – who had deposed Minh in a <a href="1964%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">January 1964 coup</a> – offered Cẩn exile if he handed over his foreign bank deposits. Cẩn protested, saying that he had no money. Đôn later claimed that Khánh would have executed Cẩn anyway, as Cẩn would have known of the corruption that the generals were party to. During the Ngô era, Khánh commanded the ARVN <a href="II%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">II Corps</a>, which had operated in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Vietnam%29">Central Highlands</a> under Cẩn's supervision. Despite having helped to arrest Cẩn, Lodge advised Khánh to be restrained in his handling of the case for fear of stoking religious resentment or upsetting international opinion with a death penalty.

Lodge later claimed the South Vietnamese prosecutors failed to make any case against Cẩn. The Vietnamese leader also had to contend with the other side of the arguments, from those who considered themselves to be victims of the Diệm regime. During the trial, <a href="Th%C3%ADch%20Tr%C3%AD%20Quang">Thích Trí Quang</a>, along with other opponents of the old regime, lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minhwho was still the titular head of statein the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard <a href="Nguyen%20Van%20Nhung">Nguyễn Văn Nhung</a> to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.

Cẩn's <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a> worsened during the course of the trial, and by the time he was executed, his elderly mother had died. He suffered a heart attack while in custody. On 9 May 1964, he was carried on a stretcher into the prison courtyard and assisted by guards and two Catholic priests to stand alongside the post to which he was tied. He was blindfolded against his request and shot in front of approximately 200 observers. Lodge defended his actions, claiming the United States did all it could to prevent the execution. The ambassador claimed Cẩn would have been allowed to seek refuge at the US embassy, despite the fact that he had ordered Conein to intercept Cẩn at the airport. Rev. Cao Văn Luân, Catholic rector of <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF%20University">Huế University</a> who had been fired for falling afoul of the powerful Archbishop Thục, asked Lodge that Cẩn not be executed. According to Luân, Lodge reportedly assured the rector the execution would not take place. Cẩn left his personal fortune, which had indeed been deposited in foreign banks, to Catholic charities.

Bruce Castle

Bruce Castle (formerly the Lordship House) is a <a href="Listed%20building">Grade I listed</a> 16th-century <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> in <a href="Lordship%20Lane%20%28Haringey%29">Lordship Lane</a>, <a href="Tottenham">Tottenham</a>, London. It is named after the <a href="House%20of%20Bruce">House of Bruce</a> who formerly owned the land on which it is built. Believed to stand on the site of an earlier building, about which little is known, the current house is one of the oldest surviving English brick houses. It was remodelled in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.

The house has been home to <a href="William%20Compton%20%28courtier%29">Sir William Compton</a>, the <a href="Baron%20Coleraine%23Barons%20Coleraine%2C%20First%20creation%20%281625%29">Barons Coleraine</a> and <a href="Rowland%20Hill%20%28postal%20reformer%29">Sir Rowland Hill</a>, among others. After serving as a school during the 19th century, when a large extension was built to the west, it was converted into a museum exploring the history of the areas now constituting <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Haringey">London Borough of Haringey</a> and, on the strength of its connection with Sir Rowland Hill, the history of the <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a>. The building also houses the archives of the London Borough of Haringey. Since 1892 the grounds have been a public park, Tottenham's oldest.

The name "Bruce Castle" is derived from the <a href="House%20of%20Bruce">House of Bruce</a>, who had historically owned a third of the <a href="manorialism">manor</a> of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area, and it is unlikely that the family lived nearby. Upon his accession to <a href="King%20of%20Scots">the Scottish throne</a> in 1306, <a href="Robert%20I%20of%20Scotland">Robert I of Scotland</a> forfeited his lands in England, including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham, ending the connection between the Bruce family and the area. The former Bruce land in Tottenham was granted to <a href="Richard%20Spigurnell">Richard Spigurnell</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Hethe">Thomas Hethe</a>.

The three parts of the manor of Tottenham were united in the early 15th century under the Gedeney family and have remained united since. In all early records, the building is referred to as the "Lordship House". The name "Bruce Castle" first appears to have been adopted by <a href="Henry%20Hare%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Coleraine">Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine</a> (1635–1708), although Daniel Lysons speculates in "The Environs of London" (1795) the name's use dates to the late 13th century.

A detached, cylindrical <a href="Tudor%20style%20architecture">Tudor</a> tower stands immediately to the southwest of the house, and is generally considered to be the earliest part of the building; however, Lysons believes it to have been a later addition. The tower is built of local red brick, and is tall, with walls thick. In 2006, excavations revealed that it continues for some distance below the current ground level. It was described in 1829 as being over a deep well, and being used as a dairy.

Sources disagree on the house's initial construction date, and no records survive of its construction. There is some archaeological evidence dating parts of the building to the 15th century; William Robinson's "History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham" (1840) suggests a date of about 1514, although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late 16th century. <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> speculates the front may have formed part of a <a href="courtyard%20house">courtyard house</a> of which the remainder has disappeared.

The Grade I mansion's principal facade has been substantially remodelled. The house is made of red brick with <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> <a href="Quoin%20%28architecture%29">quoin</a>ing and the principal facade, terminated by symmetrical matching bays, has tall paned windows. The house and detached tower are among the earliest uses of brick as the principal building material for an English house.

<a href="Henry%20Hare%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Coleraine">Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine</a> (1635–1708) oversaw a substantial remodelling of the house in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and <a href="pilasters">pilasters</a>, a <a href="Baluster">balustraded</a> top and a small tower and <a href="cupola">cupola</a>. A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the house's centre, with service rooms to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's chamber over the porch.

In the early 18th century <a href="Henry%20Hare%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Coleraine">Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine</a> (1694–1749) oversaw a remodelling of the north of the house, that added a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms to the pediment of the north facade. In the late 18th century, under the ownership of <a href="James%20Townsend%20%28Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London%29">James Townsend</a>, the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance. An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground floor, with a library and billiard room on the first floor.

In the early 19th century, the house's west wing was demolished, leaving it with the asymmetrical appearance it retains today. The house was converted into a school, and in 1870 a three-story extension was built in the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> style to the northwest of the house.

The 2006 excavations by the <a href="Museum%20of%20London">Museum of London</a> uncovered the chalk foundations of an earlier building on the site, of which nothing is known. <a href="Manorial%20roll">Court roll</a>s of 1742 refer to the repair of a <a href="drawbridge">drawbridge</a>, implying that the building then had a <a href="moat">moat</a>. A 1911 archaeological journal made passing reference to "the recent levelling of the moat".

It is generally believed the house's first owner was <a href="William%20Compton%20%28courtier%29">Sir William Compton</a>, <a href="Groom%20of%20the%20Stool">Groom of the Stool</a> to <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> and one of the period's prominent courtiers, who acquired the manor of Tottenham in 1514. However, there is no evidence of Compton's living in the house, and there is some evidence the building dates to a later period.

The earliest known reference to the building dates from 1516, when Henry VIII met his sister <a href="Margaret%20Tudor">Margaret, Queen of Scots</a>, at "Maister Compton's House beside Tottenham". The Comptons owned the building throughout the 16th century, but few records of the family or the building survive.

In the early 17th century, <a href="Richard%20Sackville%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Dorset">Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset</a> and <a href="Lady%20Anne%20Clifford">Lady Anne Clifford</a> owned the house. Sackville ran up high debts through gambling and extravagant spending; the house (then still called "The Lordship House") was leased to <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Peniston">Thomas Peniston</a>. Peniston's wife, Martha, daughter of <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Temple%2C%201st%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Stowe">Sir Thomas Temple</a> was said to be the Earl of Dorset's mistress. The house was later sold to wealthy <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> landowner <a href="Hugh%20Hare%2C%201st%20Baron%20Coleraine">Hugh Hare</a>.

Hugh Hare (1606–1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle <a href="Nicholas%20Hare">Sir Nicholas Hare</a>, <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Rolls">Master of the Rolls</a>. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried <a href="Henry%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Manchester">Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester</a>, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in <a href="Noble%20court">Court</a> and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as <a href="Baron%20Coleraine">Baron Coleraine</a> shortly thereafter.

As he was closely associated with the court of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. His <a href="Longford%20Castle">castle at Longford</a> and his house in <a href="Totteridge">Totteridge</a> were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth of England</a> are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating <a href="Domestic%20turkey">turkey</a> while laughing and drinking, and was succeeded by his son <a href="Henry%20Hare%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Coleraine">Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine</a>.

Henry Hare (1635–1708) settled at the Lordship House, renaming it Bruce Castle in honour of the area's historic connection with the <a href="House%20of%20Bruce">House of Bruce</a>. Hare was a noted historian and author of the first history of Tottenham. He grew up at the Hare family house at Totteridge, and it is not known when he moved to Tottenham. At the time of the birth of his first child, Hugh, in 1668, the family were still living in Totteridge, while by the time of the death of his first wife Constantia, in 1680, the family were living in Bruce Castle. According to Hare, Constantia was buried in <a href="All%20Hallows%2C%20Tottenham">All Hallows Church</a> in Tottenham. However, the <a href="parish%20register">parish register</a> for the period is complete and makes no mention of her death or burial.
Following the death of Constantia, Hare married Sarah Alston. They had been engaged in 1661, but she had instead married <a href="John%20Seymour%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">John Seymour, 4th Duke of Somerset</a>. There is evidence that during Sarah's marriage to Seymour and Hare's marriage to Constantia, a close relationship was sustained between them.

The house was substantially remodelled in 1684, following Henry Hare's marriage to the dowager Duchess of Somerset, and much of the existing south facade dates from this time. The facade's central tower with a <a href="Belvedere%20%28structure%29">belvedere</a> is a <a href="Motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motif</a> of the English <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> of the late 16th/early 17th centuries. <a href="Hatfield%20House">Hatfield House</a>, also close to London, had a similar central tower constructed in 1611, as does <a href="Blickling%20Hall">Blickling Hall</a> in Norfolk, built circa 1616.

Although sources such as Pegram speculate that Constantia committed suicide in the face of a continued relationship between Hare and the Duchess of Somerset, little is known about her life and the circumstances of her early death, and her ghost reputedly haunts the castle. 

The earliest recorded reference to the ghost appeared in 1858—almost two hundred years after her death—in the "Tottenham & Edmonton Advertiser". 

The legend has now been largely forgotten, and there have been no reported sightings of the ghost in recent times.

Sarah Hare died in 1692 and was buried in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, and Hare in 1708, to be succeeded by his grandson <a href="Henry%20Hare%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Coleraine">Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine</a>. Henry Hare was a leading <a href="antiquary">antiquary</a>, residing only briefly at Bruce Castle between lengthy tours of Europe.

The house was remodelled again under the 3rd Baron Coleraine's ownership. An extra range of rooms was added to the north, and the pediment of the north front ornamented with a large coat of the Coleraine arms.

Hare's marriage was not consummated, and following an affair with a French woman, Rosa du Plessis, du Plessis bore him his only child, a daughter named Henrietta Rosa Peregrina, born in France in 1745. Hare died in 1749 leaving his estates to the four-year-old Henrietta, but her claim was rejected owing to her French nationality. After many years of legal challenges, the estates, including Bruce Castle, were granted to her husband <a href="James%20Townsend%20%28Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London%29">James Townsend</a>, whom she had married at age 18.
James Townsend was a leading citizen of the day. He served as a <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a>, was Member of Parliament for <a href="West%20Looe%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Looe</a>, and in 1772 became <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20the%20City%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a>, while Henrietta was a prominent artist, many of whose <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s of 18th-century Tottenham survive in the Bruce Castle Museum.

After 1764, under the ownership of James Townsend, the house was remodelled again. The narrow east front was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> house, while the gabled attics on the south front were removed, giving the south facade the appearance it has today.

James and Henrietta Townsend's son, Henry Hare Townsend, showed little interest in the area or in the traditional role of the <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Manor">Lord of the Manor</a>. After leasing the house to a succession of tenants, the house and grounds were sold in 1792 to Thomas Smith of <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn">Gray's Inn</a> as a country residence.

<a href="John%20Wilmot%20%28politician%29">John Eardley Wilmot</a> (c. 1749 – 23 June 1815) was Member of Parliament for <a href="Tiverton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Tiverton</a> (1776–1784) and <a href="Coventry%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Coventry</a> (1784–1796), and in 1783 led the Parliamentary Commission investigating the events that led to the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>. He also led the processing of compensation claims, and the supply of basic housing and provisions, for the 60,000 <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a> refugees who arrived in England after the independence of the United States.

Following the beginning of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> in 1789, a second wave of refugees arrived in England. Although the British government did not offer them organised relief, Wilmot, in association with <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a> and <a href="George%20Nugent-Temple-Grenville%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Buckingham">George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham</a>, founded "Wilmot's Committee", which raised funds to provide accommodation and food, and found employment for refugees from France, large numbers of whom settled in the Tottenham area.

In 1804, Wilmot retired from public life and moved to Bruce Castle to write his memoirs of the American Revolution and his role in the investigations of its causes and consequences. They were published shortly before his death in 1815. After Wilmot's death, London merchant John Ede purchased the house and its grounds, and demolished the building's west wing.

Hill and his brothers had taken over the management of their father's school in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> lines inspired by Hill's friends <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>, <a href="Richard%20Price">Richard Price</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a>; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer <a href="Charles%20Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>.

In 1839 Rowland Hill, who had written an influential proposal on postal reform, was appointed as head of the <a href="General%20Post%20Office">General Post Office</a> (where he introduced the world's first postage stamps), leaving the school in the hands of his younger brother Arthur Hill. 
During the period of the School's operation, the character of the area had changed beyond recognition. Historically, Tottenham had consisted of four villages on <a href="Ermine%20Street">Ermine Street</a> (later the <a href="A10%20road%20%28England%29">A10 road</a>), surrounded by marshland and farmland. The construction of the <a href="Northern%20and%20Eastern%20Railway">Northern and Eastern Railway</a> in 1840, with stations at <a href="Tottenham%20Hale%20station">Tottenham Hale</a> and <a href="Northumberland%20Park%20railway%20station">Marsh Lane</a> (later Northumberland Park), made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time (albeit by a circuitous eight-mile route via <a href="Stratford%2C%20London">Stratford</a>, more than double the distance of the direct road route), as well as providing direct connections to the <a href="Port%20of%20London">Port of London</a>. In 1872 the <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Railway">Great Eastern Railway</a> opened a direct line from <a href="Enfield%20Town%20railway%20station">Enfield</a> to <a href="Liverpool%20Street%20station">Liverpool Street station</a>, including a station at <a href="Bruce%20Grove%20railway%20station">Bruce Grove</a>, close to Bruce Castle; the railway provided subsidised workmen's fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London. As a major rail hub, Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area; by the end of the 19th century, the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle itself, and the waterlogged floodplains of the <a href="River%20Lea">River Lea</a> at <a href="Tottenham%20Marshes">Tottenham Marshes</a> and of the <a href="River%20Moselle%20%28London%29">River Moselle</a> at <a href="Broadwater%20Farm">Broadwater Farm</a>.
In 1877 Birkbeck Hill retired from the post of headmaster, ending his family's association with the school. The school closed in 1891, and <a href="Municipal%20Borough%20of%20Tottenham">Tottenham Council</a> purchased the house and grounds. The grounds of the house were opened to the public as Bruce Castle Park in June 1892, the first public park in Tottenham. The house opened to the public as Bruce Castle Museum in 1906.

Bruce Castle was among the buildings mentioned in <a href="John%20Abraham%20Heraud">John Abraham Heraud</a>'s 1820 <a href="Spenserian%20stanza">Spenserian epic</a>, "Tottenham", a <a href="Romantic%20poetry">romantic</a> depiction of the life of Robert the Bruce:

Bruce Castle is now a museum, holding the archives of the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Haringey">London Borough of Haringey</a>, and housing a permanent exhibition on the past, present and future of Haringey and its predecessor boroughs, and temporary displays on the history of the area. Other exhibits include an exhibition on Rowland Hill and postal history, a significant collection of early photography, a collection of historic manorial documents and court rolls related to the area, and one of the few copies available for public reading of the "Spurs Opus", the complete history of <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. In 1949, the building was <a href="Listed%20building">Grade I listed</a>; the round tower was separately Grade I listed at the same time, and the 17th-century southern and western boundary walls of the park were <a href="Listed%20building">Grade II listed</a> in 1974. In 1969 the castle became home to the regimental museum of the <a href="Middlesex%20Regiment">Middlesex Regiment</a> whose collection was subsequently transferred to the <a href="National%20Army%20Museum">National Army Museum</a>.

In July 2006 a major community archaeological dig was organised in the grounds by the <a href="Museum%20of%20London">Museum of London</a> Archaeological Archive and Research Centre, as part of the centenary celebrations of the opening of Bruce Castle Museum, in which large numbers of local youths took part. As well as large quantities of discarded everyday objects, the chalk foundations of what appears to be an earlier house on the site were discovered.

In 2012 the public grounds at Bruce Castle were used for PARK ART in Haringey, part of the borough's <a href="cultural%20Olympiad">cultural Olympiad</a> offer for 2012. Up Projects, in partnership with Haringey Council and funded by <a href="Arts%20Council%20England">Arts Council England</a>, commissioned <a href="Ben%20Long%20%28British%20artist%29">Ben Long</a> to create "Lion Scaffolding Sculpture", a nine-metre tall classical lion on a plinth that was constructed from builder's <a href="scaffolding">scaffolding</a>. The monumental sculpture, created for the front lawn of Bruce Castle Museum, referenced the traditional archetype of the regal lion commonly found in the grounds of stately homes, but also the heraldic emblem of <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a>, therefore reflecting on the heritage of the building. Build in situ over four weeks, the fabrication became a durational performance, highlighting the role that work and labour play in the development of any artistic or creative pursuit.

P. K. van der Byl

Pieter Kenyon Fleming-Voltelyn van der Byl, <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit%20%28Rhodesia%29">GLM</a> <a href="Independence%20Decoration%20%28Rhodesia%29">ID</a> (11 November 1923 – 15 November 1999) was a <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>n politician who served as his country's Foreign Minister from 1974 to 1979 as a member of the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> (RF). A close associate of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Rhodesia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, Van der Byl opposed attempts to compromise with the British government and domestic black nationalist opposition on the issue of majority rule throughout most his time in government. However, in the late 1970s he supported the moves which led to majority rule and internationally recognised independence for <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>.

Van der Byl was born and raised in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, the son of the South African politician <a href="Pieter%20Voltelyn%20Graham%20van%20der%20Byl">P V van der Byl</a>, and served in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War. After a high-flying international education, he moved to the <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing</a> British colony of <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a> in 1950 to manage family farms. He went into politics in the early 1960s through his involvement with farming trade bodies, and became a government minister responsible for propaganda. One of the leading agitators for <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> in 1965, Van der Byl was afterwards responsible for introducing press censorship. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to persuade international opinion to recognise Rhodesia, but was popular among members of his own party.

Promoted to the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Rhodesia">cabinet</a> in 1968, Van der Byl became a spokesman for the Rhodesian government and crafted a public image as a die-hard supporter of continued white minority rule. In 1974 he was made Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence at a time when Rhodesia's only remaining ally, South Africa, was supplying military aid. His extreme views and brusque manner made him a surprising choice for a diplomat (a November 1976 profile in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described him as "a man calculated to give offence"). After offending the South African government, Van der Byl was removed from the Defence Ministry.

In the late 1970s Van der Byl was willing to endorse the Smith government's negotiations with moderate black nationalist leaders and rejected attempts by international missions to broker an agreement. He served in the short-lived <a href="government%20of%20Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">government</a> of <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a> in 1979, following the <a href="Internal%20Settlement">Internal Settlement</a>. After the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, Van der Byl remained in politics and close to Ian Smith; he loudly attacked former RF colleagues who had gone over to support <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>. He retired to South Africa after the Mugabe government abolished the parliamentary seats reserved for whites in 1987, and died in 1999 at the age of 76.

Van der Byl was born in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, the son of Joyce Clare Fleming, a Scot, and Dutch-descended <a href="Major%20Pieter%20Voltelyn%20Graeme%20van%20der%20Byl">Major Pieter Voltelyn Graeme van der Byl</a>, a member of <a href="Jan%20Smuts">Jan Smuts</a>' South African cabinet during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Like his father, Van der Byl was educated at the <a href="Diocesan%20College">Diocesan College</a> in Rondebosch but his studies were interrupted by war in 1941. He served with the <a href="South%20African%20Army">South African Army</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and served with the British <a href="7th%20Queen%27s%20Own%20Hussars">7th Queen's Own Hussars</a>; he saw active service in the Middle East, Italy and Austria.

After being <a href="demobilised">demobilised</a>, Van der Byl studied law at <a href="Pembroke%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Pembroke College, Cambridge</a> where his aristocratic manner stood out. "P. K." was always elegantly dressed and coiffured, and acquired the nickname "the <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a> Dutchman". He obtained a Third-class degree in his Part II Law examinations in 1947, and went on from Cambridge to study at the <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> Graduate School of Business Administration from 1947 to 1948 (although he did not obtain a degree at the latter). He also studied at the <a href="University%20of%20Witwatersrand">University of Witwatersrand</a> in South Africa.

One of the most conspicuous features of Van der Byl was his manner of speech: although his ancestry was Cape Dutch and his early life was in Cape Town, South Africa, he had what were described (by Chris Whitehead, editor of "<a href="Rhodesians%20Worldwide">Rhodesians Worldwide</a>") as "what he thought was an aristocratic English nasal drawl and imperial English mannerisms". Whitehead was of the opinion that Van der Byl had "adopted" this accent, in common with others who heard him like <a href="Denis%20Hills">Denis Hills</a>, who wrote of Van der Byl having "a flow of mannered phrases which he delivers in a flawed Guards officer accent". 

This personal characteristic was intensely irritating to many people including South African government ministers, but Van der Byl's aristocratic mannerisms appeared uncontentious to many Rhodesian whites. They believed that his "nasal drawl" was the product of his time as an officer in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Royal%20Hussars">Hussars</a> and his <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> education: William Higham described him as "a popular Minister of Defence who, despite his British upper crust accent – undoubtedly honed during his swashbuckling career as an officer in the hussars – hailed from a noble Cape family."

Van der Byl moved to <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a> in 1950 to manage some of his family's tobacco farming interests, hoping to make his own fortune. Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he "suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and decided I was going to go up there and make the family fortune in a place I liked and wanted to be in." He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of <a href="big%20game%20hunting">big game hunting</a>: in that year in <a href="Angola">Angola</a>, then under <a href="Portuguese%20Angola">Portuguese rule</a>, he set a world record for the biggest elephant shot, which stood until 1955.

In 1957 Van der Byl was made a Director of the United Dominions Corporation (Rhodesia) Ltd, having already become an active member of the Rhodesia Tobacco Association. In 1956, he was elected by the members of the <a href="Selous%2C%20Zimbabwe">Selous</a>–<a href="Gadzema">Gadzema</a> district to represent them on the Tobacco Association council. He was also Deputy Chair of the Selous Farmers' Association in 1957. His first involvement in government was in 1960 when the Rhodesia Tobacco Association made him one of their representatives on the National Native Labour Commission, on which he served for two years. In 1961, he also represented the <a href="Rhodesia%20Tobacco%20Association">Rhodesia Tobacco Association</a> on the council of the <a href="Commercial%20Farmers%27%20Union">Rhodesian National Farmers' Union</a>. He was recognised as a leading spokesman for Rhodesian tobacco farmers.

Dominion Party politician <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a> had also led the Rhodesia Tobacco Association, and Van der Byl agreed with him on politics in general. He joined the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> when it was set up under Field's leadership. At the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20general%20election%2C%201962">1962 general election</a>, Van der Byl was elected comfortably to the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> for the Hartley constituency, a rural area to the south-west of <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>.

In 1963, <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a> appointed Van der Byl as a junior government <a href="Whip%20%28politics%29">whip</a>, and on 16 March 1964 he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Justice with responsibility for the Information Service. Although the Van der Byl family were identified as strongly liberal in South African politics, he became identified with the right wing of the party and helped to depose Field from the premiership in early April 1964, when Field failed to persuade the British government to grant Southern Rhodesia its independence. The new Prime Minister, <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, appointed him Deputy Minister for Information. At this time, Van der Byl's chief adviser was a South African called <a href="Ivor%20Benson">Ivor Benson</a>, who also served as press censor. Benson believed that an international communist conspiracy was plotting to overthrow white rule in Rhodesia.

Speaking in the Legislative Assembly on 12 August 1964 he attacked proposals for greater independence for broadcasters by referring to what he perceived to be the social effect in Britain:

By the end of 1964, Van der Byl and his Ministry had control of broadcasting in Rhodesia. Speaking in Parliament he described the aims of his Department as "not merely to disseminate information from an interesting point of view but to play its part in fighting the propaganda battle on behalf of the country". He defined propaganda as "simply the propagation of the faith and the belief in any particular ideology or thing", and also stated that the Department would seek the "resuscitation of the determination of the European to survive and fight for his rights".

In May 1965 the Rhodesian Front government went to the country in a <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201965">general election</a> with Van der Byl one of the leading campaigners. Discussion of unilaterally declaring independence had already begun. Van der Byl argued that only a small fraction of Rhodesian business opposed it; however, his campaign speeches typically included an argument against business involvement in politics. He cited <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> mining interests' support for the Progressive Party in South Africa, big business support for the <a href="National%20Socialist%20German%20Workers%20Party">Nazi Party</a> in Germany, and the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> revolution in Russia being financed by United States big business.

The Rhodesian Front won a landslide victory, winning every single one of the 50 constituencies which had predominantly European voters. At the Rhodesian Front Congress of August 1965, party members strongly attacked the press for failing to support the government. A demand for it to be made compulsory for all political articles to be signed by the author met with Van der Byl's approval.

Within the government, Van der Byl was one of the loudest voices urging Ian Smith to proceed to a <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a>. He angrily denounced the threat of sanctions from Britain, saying on 4 May 1965 that economic destruction of Rhodesia would mean total economic destruction of <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>, formerly Northern Rhodesia. This statement was interpreted as a military threat by David Butler, the Leader of the Opposition. Van der Byl was given the task of selling the UDI to Rhodesian whites and to world opinion. In September 1965, it was announced that he would tour the United Kingdom to promote Rhodesian independence. According to <a href="David%20Steel">David Steel</a>, he claimed then that France and the United States would lead the international recognition of the UDI government. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Information on 22 October and so was present at, but did not sign, the <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> on 11 November 1965.
Van der Byl was greeted by a speech strongly critical of the Rhodesian government from the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Michael%20Ramsey">Michael Ramsey</a>, who supported the use of armed force to bring the Rhodesians in line with United Kingdom policy on decolonisation. He responded by comparing the speech to "the tragic connivance at the destruction of Czechoslovakia in exchange for the useless appeasement at Munich in 1938". Van der Byl's response used the phrase "kith and kin" to refer to the ethnic links between the white Rhodesians and the people of the United Kingdom. He saw no contradiction between signing a letter declaring "constant loyalty" to the Queen and declaring independence a few days later; the Rhodesian Government was careful at the time of UDI to state its continued loyalty to the British Crown, though it later declared Rhodesia a republic.

Despite his enthusiasm for propaganda, Van der Byl was outraged when the BBC subsequently set up a radio station at <a href="Francistown">Francistown</a> in Botswana which broadcast for 27 months, criticising UDI and urging Rhodesians to revoke it. He was later to claim the station was inciting violence, although this was denied by some who had been regular listeners. On 26 January 1966, two months after the UDI, Van der Byl was willing to be quoted as saying that Rhodesian Army troops would follow a "scorched earth" policy should the United Kingdom send in troops, comparing their position to that of the Red Army when Nazi forces invaded the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1941. He was highly critical of <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, describing him as a "highly dangerous, uninformed and conceited little man."

Internally, his policy was enforced through Ministry control of TV and radio and through censorship of newspapers. From 31 December 1965, the Ministry of Information expanded its brief and was renamed the Ministry of Information, Immigration and Tourism, which meant that it was also responsible for deciding whether to grant or revoke permits to visit Rhodesia. Several foreign journalists were expelled: John Worrall, correspondent for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", went in January 1969. "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Zimbabwe%29">The Rhodesia Herald</a>", then in opposition to both the Rhodesian Front and UDI, frequently appeared with large white spaces on its news pages where censored stories had been placed. Stories and editorials personally critical of Van der Byl were immediately removed.

Censorship was tightened still further on 8 February 1966 when it was made illegal to indicate where material had been removed. The censor was also given the power to alter existing material or to move it around the newspaper. Dr <a href="Ahrn%20Palley">Ahrn Palley</a>, the lone white opposition MP, described the powers as "censorship gone mad", and insisted that there would no longer be any guarantee that anything published in the newspapers was authentic. Van der Byl responded by saying that the new measures were a reflection on the newspapers which had made such powers necessary. In 1967 Van der Byl was reported by Malcolm Smith, the former editor of the "Herald", as remarking that a high degree of <a href="self-censorship">self-censorship</a> was required, and support for the government was essential.

"The Herald" (and the "Bulawayo Chronicle") defied the restrictions, boldly printing blank spaces which identified removed material. Van der Byl personally visited the newspaper offices on the day the new regulations came in to warn the staff that if the paper was printed as proposed, they would "publish at your peril." However the papers continued to appear with identifiable censorship in defiance of the government, and in 1968 the regulations were scrapped.

Shortly after UDI, 46 academics working at University College, a racially non-segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in London, denouncing the move. Officers of the <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Police">British South Africa Police</a> visited many of those who had signed to search their houses. Shortly afterwards, the residence permit of one of the academics came up for renewal, which would normally be automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that the reason was his opposition to UDI.

Van der Byl's strategy seemed to work at home, with many Rhodesians remaining unaware until the end just how much was their country's vulnerability and isolation. "The Times" was later to describe him as a "skilled propagandist who believed his own propaganda." When sanctions on Rhodesia were confirmed in January 1967, Van der Byl compared their situation with Spain following World War II, saying that the isolation of Spain had not stopped it from becoming one of the most advanced and economically successful countries in Europe. However, when Van der Byl made informal approaches in April 1966 to see if he might visit Britain "for social reasons" during a tour of Europe, the <a href="Commonwealth%20Relations%20Office">Commonwealth Relations Office</a> replied that he would not be recognised as enjoying any form of recognition or immunity. Other European governments refused to recognise <a href="Rhodesian%20passport">his passport</a> and expelled him from the country.

On 13 September 1968 he was promoted to be the full Minister of Information, Immigration and Tourism. Van der Byl's aristocratic background, military experience and academic credentials combined to give him an almost iconic status within the Rhodesian Front. Many were impressed by his exploits as a big-game hunter, which began when he shot his first lion in a garden in Northern Rhodesia at the age of 15. Writing in South Africa's "<a href="Daily%20Dispatch">Daily Dispatch</a>", Michael Hartnack remarked that many in the Rhodesian Front believed him to be "a 19th century-style connoisseur, a man of culture and an aristocrat-statesman", adding that "poseurs are an incipient hazard in any unsophisticated society." Within the somewhat claustrophobic confines of white Rhodesian society outside the RF, Van der Byl was achieving some degree of respect.

In politics he assumed the position of hard-line opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opponents or the international community. He made little secret of his willingness to succeed Ian Smith as Prime Minister if Smith showed even "the least whiff of surrender," and did his best to discourage attempts to get the Rhodesians to compromise. When <a href="Abel%20Muzorewa">Abel Muzorewa</a> had his passport withdrawn in September 1972 after returning from a successful visit to London, the government did not attempt to counter the rumour that its action was taken following Van der Byl's personal order.

In April 1972 Van der Byl sparked a row over the agreement which Rhodesia and the United Kingdom had made in November 1971. Under this agreement, Rhodesia had agreed to certain concessions to African nationalism in return for the prospect of recognition of its independence; however, implementation of the agreement was to be delayed until the <a href="Pearce%20Commission">Pearce Commission</a> reported on whether the settlement proposals would be approved by the people of Rhodesia. Van der Byl insisted that Rhodesia would not implement any part of the agreement unless Rhodesia's independence was first acknowledged, regardless of the answer from the Pearce Commission. When the Pearce Commission reported that the <a href="Whites%20in%20Zimbabwe">European</a>, <a href="Indians%20in%20Zimbabwe">Asian</a> and <a href="Coloured%23Southern%20Africa">Coloured</a> (mixed race) populations of Rhodesia were in support but the African population were opposed, the agreement was ditched. Many outside and inside Rhodesia had hoped that the government would implement some of the agreement even if Pearce reported against it.

His derision of working class British <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> politicians also caused problems. When, in January 1966, three visiting Labour MPs were manhandled, kicked and punched while attempting to address 400 supporters of the Rhodesian Front, Van der Byl blamed the three for refusing an offer from his Ministry to co-ordinate the visit, and pointed out that they were breaking the law which required government permission for any political meeting of more than 12 people.
The propaganda circulated by his Ministry (typically including references to "happy, smiling natives") was considered laughable. Visiting British journalist <a href="Peregrine%20Worsthorne">Peregrine Worsthorne</a>, who knew Van der Byl socially, reported seeing a copy of "<a href="Mein%20Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>" on his coffee table. His propaganda strategy became increasingly unsuccessful abroad, where Van der Byl alienated many of the foreign journalists and politicians that he came into contact with. <a href="Max%20Hastings">Max Hastings</a>, then reporting for the "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>", described him as "that grotesque parody of a <a href="Dornford%20Yates">Dornford Yates</a> English gentleman" and said that he and Smith "would have seemed ludicrous figures, had they not possessed the power of life and death over millions of people"; Van der Byl had him deported.

While still popular with the Rhodesian Front members, he was criticised at the 1972 Party Congress for his lack of success in improving Rhodesia's image around the world; however, he retained the confidence of Ian Smith and was kept on in a government reshuffle on 24 May 1973. That winter saw him promote a new Broadcasting Bill to transfer control of the monopoly <a href="Zimbabwe%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation</a>. <a href="Allan%20Savory">Allan Savory</a>, then the lone white opposition MP, criticised the Bill for the composition of the proposed board, which was dominated by strong supporters of the Rhodesian Front. Van der Byl insisted, somewhat unsuccessfully to foreign observers, that the government was not trying to take over broadcasting.

Van der Byl was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence on 2 August 1974. These were two distinct portfolios, the first of which (Foreign Affairs) did not amount to much in a state which lacked any form of international recognition. The Defence portfolio, at a time when Rhodesia was drifting into civil war, was an important post; although his previous political experience had been largely in the area of public relations, he was now charged with responsibilities which were central to the survival of Rhodesia.
He promoted aggressive measures against the insurgents, and in so doing, he also sought to raise his own political profile. Clad in immaculately tailored battledress, he would fly by helicopter to a beleaguered army outpost; wearing dark glasses and sporting a swagger stick, deliver a rousing speech for the benefit of the troops and the TV cameras – then return to Salisbury in time for dinner. He drew heavily on <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s oratory style for some of his inspiring speeches. As Minister of Defence, Van der Byl was known to join army counter-insurgency operations while armed with a hunting rifle (with the words "I'd like to bag one of these chaps ..."), and would regularly visit army positions and entertain the troops with his own generous supply of "scotch whisky and fine wines." Such behaviour endeared him to many in Rhodesia: he was far more popular with the troops than his predecessor as Minister of Defence, <a href="Jack%20Howman">Jack Howman</a>. However, this popularity did not extend to senior members of the South African and Rhodesian governments.

Rhodesia's strategic position underwent a fundamental change in June 1975 when the <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> government suddenly withdrew from <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.

There were rumours in February 1976 that Soviet tanks were being unloaded in Mozambique to help in the war. Unluckily for Van der Byl, the British Foreign Office minister was <a href="David%20Ennals">David Ennals</a>, one of those who had received rough treatment in 1966. Ennals announced that in the event of a racial war breaking out in Rhodesia, there would be no British help. Van der Byl responded by claiming this indicated Britain accepting Rhodesia's independence. He attacked Abel Muzorewa for supporting President Machel, saying that "being a good churchman and a Bishop there is a very strong possibility he might be a communist".

Following the example of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments permitted guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and infiltrate Rhodesia. Van der Byl told a newspaper reporter that this had to be expected. As infiltration grew, he declared at the beginning of July that the Rhodesian Army would not hesitate to bomb and destroy villages that harboured guerillas.

In 1975 and 1976, the South African government conducted delicate negotiations with neighbouring states: the South Africans wanted to encourage those states to maintain economic relations with South Africa and Rhodesia while limiting the activities of the ANC, ZANU and ZAPU. However, increasingly aggressive actions by the Rhodesian army outside its own borders resulted in the failure of this conciliatory approach.

A cross-border <a href="Selous%20Scouts">Selous Scouts</a> raid into Mozambique on 9 August 1976 (dubbed "<a href="Operation_Eland">the Nyadzonya Raid</a>") killed over 1,000 people without Rhodesian fatalities, with Van der Byl insisting that the government had irrefutable proof that the raid had targeted a guerrilla training camp. He was unwilling to disclose the nature of the proof, though he invited the UN to conduct its own investigation into the raid. The raid produced a high body count and a major haul of intelligence and captured arms; according to ZANLA's own figures, which were not publicly circulated, most of those present in the camp had been armed guerrillas, though there were some civilians present. In a successful attempt to win global sympathy, ZANU clamoured that Nyadzonya had been full of unarmed refugees, leading most international opinion to condemn the Rhodesian raid as a massacre. Although cross-border raids into Mozambique had been approved by the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Rhodesia">Rhodesian cabinet</a>, the depth and severity of the August incursion was greater than had been intended. Van der Byl had sanctioned the incursion largely on his own initiative. Although a tactical success, the incursion caused a final break with Zambia and Mozambique. The South African government was greatly displeased that its earlier diplomatic efforts were compromised and made this clear to Ian Smith. Smith appeared to consider this "the final straw" as far as Van der Byl's defence portfolio was concerned.

Van der Byl took over at a time when South Africa was putting increasing pressure on the Rhodesians to make an agreement on majority rule. In March 1975, he had to fly urgently to Cape Town to explain why the Rhodesian government had detained Rev. <a href="Ndabaningi%20Sithole">Ndabaningi Sithole</a> of the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union">Zimbabwe African National Union</a>, who was accused of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with <a href="Joshua%20Nkomo">Joshua Nkomo</a>. Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him.
Gradually the South Africans grew unwilling to help Rhodesia. The remaining 200 South African policemen transferred to help in the guerilla war were removed suddenly in August 1975, a move which appeared to precede even more disengagement. Van der Byl responded in a speech on 8 August which asserted that "The terrorists who are trained and equipped outside our border and who invade our country with the willing help of other governments are here for a much wider purpose than the overthrow of Rhodesia. They are here to represent a force which sees Rhodesia as just one more stepping stone to victory over South Africa because they see South Africa as a vital key to the security of America, Europe and the rest of the western world."

When the Rhodesian government <a href="Victoria%20Falls%20Conference%20%281975%29">held talks</a> with the African National Council on the railway bridge across the <a href="Victoria%20Falls%2C%20Zambia">Victoria Falls</a> in August 1975 (the train in which the talks took place was strategically in the middle of the bridge so that the ANC were in Zambia while the Rhodesians remained in Rhodesia), Van der Byl was not a member of the Rhodesian delegation. This was a curious omission given his position. He did however participate in talks with Joshua Nkomo that December.

Van der Byl's habit of referring to the African population as "munts" (he asserted that "Rhodesia is able to handle the munts") led to extreme unpopularity with the South African government, and he did not attend talks with South African Prime Minister <a href="John%20Vorster">John Vorster</a> in October 1975. This was interpreted as being connected to Vorster's dislike of Van der Byl who, despite being of Afrikaner origin, had adopted English mannerisms. 

When, on 26 August 1976, the South African government announced the withdrawal of all its military helicopter crews from Rhodesia, Van der Byl was outspoken in his criticism and Vorster was reported to have refused to have anything to do with "that dreadful man Van der Byl." Smith decided that he "clearly ... had no option" and on 9 September 1976 executed a sudden cabinet reshuffle that ended Van der Byl's tenure as Defence Minister. Smith claimed the South African dislike of Van der Byl was partly motivated by the memory of his father, who had been in opposition to the National Party.

As the prominence of the issue of Rhodesia increased in the late 1970s, attention on Van der Byl increased. Reporters noted his impressively quotable lines at press conferences (such as his explanation for why the Rhodesian government did not usually give the names of guerrillas which it had hanged: "Why should we? Anyway, it's academic because they're normally dead after it"). While negotiating with the Patriotic Front put together by ZANU and ZAPU at the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281976%29">Geneva Conference</a> in November 1976, he described ZANU leader Robert Mugabe as "this bloodthirsty Marxist puppet" and the Patriotic Front proposals as "almost a parody, a music hall caricature of communist invective". Mugabe repeatedly arrived late to the meetings held during the conference, and on one occasion Van der Byl tersely reprimanded the ZANU leader for his tardiness. Mugabe flew into a rage and shouted across the table at Van der Byl, calling the Rhodesian minister a "foul-mouthed bloody fool!"
At this conference, which was organised by Britain with American support, Van der Byl rejected the idea of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a transition to majority rule, which was identified as one of the few ways of persuading the Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement. The conference was adjourned by the British foreign minister, <a href="Anthony%20Crosland">Anthony Crosland</a>, on 14 December 1976, and ultimately never reconvened. The nationalist leaders said they would not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule were made the only topic for discussion. Soon after, on 7 January 1977, Van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of every proposal made in Geneva.

Later that month, Van der Byl was finding pressure put on him by more moderate voices within Rhodesia and hinted that the government might amend the Land Tenure Act, which effectively split the country into sections reserved for each racial group. He also remarked that Bishop Abel Muzorewa "can be said to represent the African in this country", which indicated the direction in which the Smith government was hoping to travel: an accommodation with moderate voices within Rhodesia was likely to be a better end than a capitulation to the Patriotic Front. Van der Byl was prepared to support this strategy and did not go along with the 12 Rhodesian Front MPs who formed the <a href="Rhodesian%20Action%20Party">Rhodesian Action Party</a> in early 1977 claiming that the Front had not adhered to party principles.

Although Van der Byl was now prepared to say that he supported the transition to majority rule, he was quick to put restrictions on it when interviewed in April 1977. He insisted that majority rule would only be possible on a "very qualified franchise—that's what the whole thing is about", and also said that any settlement must be endorsed by a two-thirds majority of the existing House of Assembly (which was largely elected by white Rhodesians). Over the summer of 1977 he continued to warn that insistence on capitulation to the Patriotic Front would produce a white backlash and put negotiations back.

However, the Rhodesian government was forced to put its internal settlement negotiations on hold during a joint US-UK initiative in late 1977. Van der Byl's public comments seemed to be aimed at ensuring this mission did not succeed, as he insisted that it had no chance of negotiating a ceasefire, described the <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Carter</a> administration as "mindless", and the joint mission as being "Anglo-American-Russian". When a plan was published, he described it as "totally outrageous" and involving "the imposition of unconditional surrender on an undefeated people who are not enemies".

The mission did fail and the internal settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; <a href="Lord%20Richard%20Cecil">Lord Richard Cecil</a>, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.

In May Van der Byl greeted news of massacres in <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a> as "a blessing in disguise" because they might ensure that warnings about Soviet penetration in Africa were heeded. He denounced the British government the following month for refusing to recognise that a massacre of Elim missionaries was perpetrated by the Patriotic Front. As the date for the full implementation of the internal settlement grew nearer, Van der Byl's profile decreased, but he remained active in politics: he was elected unopposed for the whites-only Gatooma/Hartley seat to the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia House of Assembly. He handed over power to his African successor on 1 June 1979, and became instead Minister of Transport and Power and Minister of Posts in the new government.

When "the wheels came off the wagon" (as he put it) at <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Agreement">Lancaster House</a> in 1979, Van der Byl greeted the event with amused detachment. He was not a member of any delegation at the conference and did not attend. The weekend after the agreement, he called on the Rhodesian Front to revitalise itself as the only true representative of Europeans in Rhodesia, and he ascribed the result of the conference to "a succession of perfidious British governments".

According to Ian Smith's memoirs, Van der Byl organised a meeting between Ian Smith and Lieutenant-General <a href="Peter%20Walls">Peter Walls</a>, Commander of the Rhodesian Army, shortly before the first Zimbabwean elections in February 1980, where they agreed a strategy to prevent Robert Mugabe winning. They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the early election results in March dented this confidence.

Smith asked Walls for details of his plan ("Operation Quartz") for using force to prevent <a href="ZANU-PF">ZANU-PF</a> taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls insisted that ZANU-PF would not win the election. When it did happen, both Smith and Van der Byl believed that the Army should step in to prevent Mugabe taking over. Walls took the view that it was already too late, and while the others wished for some move, they were forced to concede to this view.

Van der Byl had been elected unopposed to the new <a href="House%20of%20Assembly%20of%20Zimbabwe">House of Assembly</a> for <a href="Kadoma%2C%20Zimbabwe">Gatooma</a>/<a href="Chegutu">Hartley</a> and remained a close associate of Smith, becoming Vice-President of the 'Republican Front' (later renamed the <a href="Conservative%20Alliance%20of%20Zimbabwe">Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe</a>). At the <a href="Zimbabwe%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201985">1985 general election</a> the boundaries for the White Roll seats were altered and Van der Byl fought in Mount Pleasant, opposing Chris Andersen. Andersen had broken with the Rhodesian Front to sit as an Independent and became Minister of State for the Public Service in Robert Mugabe's government. Van der Byl lost the election heavily, polling only 544 votes to 1,017 for Andersen and 466 for a third candidate. The Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe still controlled the election of ten white Senators and Smith agreed to elect Van der Byl to one of the <a href="Senate%20of%20Zimbabwe">Senate</a> seats.

Parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished in 1987. Van der Byl made his last speech in Parliament on 10 September, in which he praised Robert Mugabe for the "absolute courtesy" he had shown since independence. He noted that he was the last surviving member of the 1965 government remaining in Parliament, and declared he hoped "I would have been cherished .. as a sort of national monument, and not flung into the political wilderness". His speech loudly denounced the former Republican Front and Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe members who had gone over to the government, describing them as "dreadful souls screaming in agony". The government minister Dr <a href="Edson%20Zvobgo">Edson Zvobgo</a> responded with a poem referring to the number of rebels killed fighting troops under Van der Byl's command.

On 31 August 1979 at Schloss Waldstein in Austria, Van der Byl married <a href="Archduchess%20Elisabeth%20of%20Austria%20%281922%E2%80%931993%29%23Marriage">Princess Charlotte Maria Benedikte Eleonore Adelheid of Liechtenstein</a>. She was thirty years his junior, the daughter of Prince Heinrich of Liechtenstein and granddaughter of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Austria">Karl I</a>, the last emperor of Austria. The couple had three sons: Pieter Vincenz, Valerian, and Casimir.

In 1983 Van der Byl had inherited from his mother a property described as "the magnificent estate .. near Caledon in the Western Cape," and following the end of his political career had no need to keep a home in Zimbabwe, so he quit the place. He left as a rich man, with an attractive young wife, and enjoyed his retirement. He frequently visited London, where he was a good friend of <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%207th%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Viscount Cranborne</a>, who put him up for membership of the <a href="Turf%20Club%20%28Gentlemen%27s%20Club%29">Turf Club</a>. Both were members of <a href="White%27s%20Club">White's Club</a> and were often seen there when Van der Byl was in town.

Four days after his 76th birthday, Van der Byl died at Fairfield, in <a href="Caledon%2C%20Western%20Cape">Caledon, Western Cape</a>. In his obituary, <a href="Dan%20van%20der%20Vat">Dan van der Vat</a> wrote "The arrival of majority rule in South Africa made no difference, and he died a very wealthy man."

Amargasaurus

Amargasaurus (; "La Amarga lizard") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> from the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> <a href="epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a> (129.4–122.46 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>) of what is now <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. The only known skeleton was discovered in 1984 and is virtually complete, including a fragmentary skull, making "Amargasaurus" one of the best-known sauropods of its epoch. "Amargasaurus" was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 1991 and contains a single known <a href="species%20%28biology%29">species</a>, Amargasaurus cazaui. It was a large animal, but small for a sauropod, reaching in length. Most distinctively, it sported two parallel rows of tall spines down its neck and back, taller than in any other known sauropod. In life, these spines most likely could have stuck out of the body as solitary structures that supported a <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ous sheath. An alternate hypothesis, now less favored, postulates that they could have formed a scaffold supporting a <a href="Neural%20spine%20sail">skin sail</a>. They might have been used for display, combat, or defense.

"Amargasaurus" was discovered in <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s of the <a href="La%20Amarga%20Formation">La Amarga Formation</a>, which dates back to the <a href="Barremian">Barremian</a> and late <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> <a href="stage%20%28geology%29">stage</a>s of the Early Cretaceous. A <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>, it shared its environment with at least three other sauropod genera, which might have exploited different food sources in order to reduce competition. "Amargasaurus" probably fed at mid-height, as shown by the orientation of its <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a> and the articulation of its neck vertebrae, which suggest a habitual position of the snout above the ground and a maximum height of . Within the Sauropoda, "Amargasaurus" is classified as a member of the family <a href="Dicraeosauridae">Dicraeosauridae</a>, which differs from other sauropods in showing shorter necks and smaller body sizes.

"Amargasaurus" was small for a sauropod, measuring in length and weighing approximately . It followed the typical sauropod <a href="body%20plan">body plan</a>, with a long tail and neck, a small head, and a barrel-shaped trunk supported by four column-like legs. The neck of "Amargasaurus" was shorter than in most other sauropods, a common trait within the <a href="Dicraeosauridae">Dicraeosauridae</a>. Measuring in length, the neck corresponded to 136% of the length of the dorsal <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>. This is comparable to "<a href="Dicraeosaurus">Dicraeosaurus</a>" (123%) but greater than in the extremely short-necked form "<a href="Brachytrachelopan">Brachytrachelopan</a>" (75%). The neck consisted of thirteen <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical vertebrae</a>, which were <a href="Vertebral%20column%23Classification">opisthocoelous</a> (convex at the front and hollow at the back), forming <a href="ball-and-socket%20joint">ball-and-socket joint</a>s with neighboring vertebrae. The trunk was made out of nine <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location">dorsal</a> and probably five fused <a href="sacral%20vertebrae">sacral vertebrae</a>. The foremost dorsals were opisthocoelous, while the remaining dorsals were amphyplatyan (flat on both ends). Robust <a href="transverse%20processes">transverse processes</a> (lateral projections connecting to the ribs) indicate a strongly developed rib cage. The dorsal vertebrae of "Amargasaurus" and other dicraeosaurids lacked <a href="Vertebral%20column%23In%20dinosaurs">pleurocoels</a>, the deep lateral excavations that were characteristic for other sauropods.
The most striking features of the skeleton were the extremely tall, upwardly projecting <a href="neural%20spine">neural spine</a>s on the neck and anterior dorsal vertebrae. The neural spines were bifurcated along their entire length, forming a double row. They were circular in cross section and tapered towards their tips. The tallest spines could be found on the middle part of the neck, where they reached on the 8th cervical. On the neck, they were bowed backwards, projecting above the adjacent vertebra. A similar elongated neural spine has been described from the neck region of the closely related "<a href="Bajadasaurus">Bajadasaurus</a>" in 2019. Unlike in "Amargasaurus", this spine was bowed frontwards and broadened towards the tips. The last two dorsal vertebrae, the hip, and the foremost tail in "Amargasaurus" also had elongated spines; these were not bifurcated but flared into a paddle-shaped upper end. The pelvic region was relatively wide, judging from the long, laterally projecting transverse processes of the sacral vertebrae. The forelimbs were somewhat shorter than the hind limbs, as in related sauropods. Most of the hand and foot bones were not preserved, but "Amargasaurus" probably possessed five digits each as in all sauropods.

Only the rear part of the skull is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout equipped with pencil-like teeth, as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half of the skull, diagonally above the (eye opening), which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (<a href="Skull%23Fenestrae">fenestrae</a>). The , located below the orbit, was long and narrow. Behind the orbit was the , which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other <a href="diapsid">diapsid reptiles</a>, where these openings were directed upwards, thus being visible only in top view. The <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a> would have been located in front of the eye opening, although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside of the skull, the so-called parietal openings or <a href="fontanelle">fontanelle</a>s. In other <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows. Skull features shared with "Dicraeosaurus" but absent in most other sauropods included the fused and the notably long , bony extensions connecting the with the .

The only known skeleton (specimen number <a href="Bernardino%20Rivadavia%20Natural%20Sciences%20Museum">MACN-N</a> 15) was discovered in February 1984 by Guillermo Rougier during an expedition led by the famous Argentine paleontologist <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bonaparte">José Bonaparte</a>. This was the eighth expedition of the project "Jurassic and Cretaceous Terrestrial Vertebrates of South America", which was supported by the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a> and initiated in 1975 to improve on the sparse knowledge of the Jurassic and Cretaceous tetrapod life of South America. The same excursion uncovered the nearly complete skeleton of the horned <a href="theropod">theropod</a> "<a href="Carnotaurus">Carnotaurus</a>". The discovery site is located in the La Amarga <a href="arroyo%20%28creek%29">arroyo</a> in the <a href="Pic%C3%BAn%20Leuf%C3%BA%20Department">Picún Leufú Department</a> of <a href="Neuqu%C3%A9n%20Province">Neuquén Province</a> in northern <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>, south of <a href="Zapala">Zapala</a>. The skeleton stems from <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s of the <a href="La%20Amarga%20Formation">La Amarga Formation</a>, which dates to the <a href="Barremian">Barremian</a> through early <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> stages of the Early Cretaceous, or around 130 to 120 million years ago.

The skeleton is reasonably complete and includes a partial skull. Sauropod skull bones are rarely found, and the "Amargasaurus" skull is only the second skull known from a member of the Dicraeosauridae. Major parts of the skeleton were found in their original anatomical position: the vertebral column of the neck and back, which consisted of 22 articulated vertebrae, was found connected to both the skull and the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>. Of the skull, only the <a href="Temple%20%28anatomy%29">temporal region</a> and the braincase are preserved. The sacrum, despite being partly eroded prior to burial, is fairly complete. Most of the tail is missing, with three anterior, three middle, and one posterior vertebrae being preserved, along with fragments of several others. The shoulder girdle is known from the <a href="scapula">scapula</a> (shoulder blade) and <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> (which sits on the lower end of the scapula), while the pelvis is merely known from the <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> (the uppermost of the three pelvic bones). The limbs are equally fragmentary, with the <a href="Manus%20%28anatomy%29">manus</a> (hand) and most of the <a href="Pes%20%28anatomy%29">pes</a> (foot) missing. The skeleton is currently stored in the collection of the <a href="Bernardino%20Rivadavia%20Natural%20Sciences%20Museum">Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum</a> in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>.

The first, <a href="nomen%20nudum">unofficial</a>, mention of "Amargasaurus" as a new genus of dinosaur was published by Bonaparte in the 1984 Italian book "Sulle Orme dei Dinosauri". Here, the species was designated as "Amargasaurus groeberi", honoring <a href="Pablo%20Groeber">Pablo Groeber</a>, which was changed into "Amargasaurus cazaui" in the official description published several years later. The official description, written in Spanish, was published in 1991 by Leonardo Salgado and Bonaparte in the Argentinian <a href="scientific%20journal">scientific journal</a> "<a href="Ameghiniana">Ameghiniana</a>". The name "Amargasaurus" alludes to the site of discovery, the La Amarga Arroyo. La Amarga is also the name of a nearby town, as well as the <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a> the remains were recovered from. The word "amarga" is <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> for "bitter", while "sauros" is <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> for "lizard". The one <a href="species">species</a> ("A. cazaui") is named in honor of Luis Cazau, a <a href="geologist">geologist</a> with the <a href="YPF">YPF</a> <a href="oil">oil</a> company, which at the time was state-owned. In 1983, Cazau informed Bonaparte's team about the paleontological significance of the La Amarga Formation, leading to the discovery of the skeleton. One year later, Salgado and <a href="Jorge%20O.%20Calvo">Jorge O. Calvo</a> published a second paper focusing on the description of the skull.

"Amargasaurus" is classified as a member of the Dicraeosauridae, a <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Taxonomic%20rank">ranked</a> <a href="clade">clade</a> within the <a href="Diplodocoidea">Diplodocoidea</a>. Currently, this clade consists of nine species belonging to eight genera. These include "<a href="Lingwulong">Lingwulong shenqi</a>" from the Early or Middle Jurassic of China and four species from the Late Jurassic: "Brachytrachelopan mesai" from Argentina; "<a href="Suuwassea">Suuwassea emilieae</a>" from the <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a> of the United States; and "Dicraeosaurus hansemanni" and "Dicraeosaurus sattleri" from the <a href="Tendaguru%20Formation">Tendaguru beds</a> of <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. "Amargasaurus" was the first dicraeosaurid known from the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, although additional dicraeosaurids from the Lower Cretaceous have been described more recently, including "<a href="Pilmatueia">Pilmatueia faundezi</a>", "<a href="Amargatitanis">Amargatitanis macni</a>", and "<a href="Bajadasaurus">Bajadasaurus pronuspinax</a>", which are all from Argentina. An unnamed specimen from Brazil indicates that this group persisted at least until the end of the Early Cretaceous. Most analyses find "Dicraeosaurus" and "<a href="Brachytrachelopan">Brachytrachelopan</a>" to be more closely related to each other than to "Amargasaurus".
"Suuwassea" is generally recovered as the most <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> member of the family. A 2015 analysis by Tschopp and colleagues came to the preliminary result that two poorly known genera from the Morrison Formation, "<a href="Dyslocosaurus">Dyslocosaurus polyonychius</a>" and "<a href="Dystrophaeus">Dystrophaeus viaemalae</a>", might be additional members of the Dicraeosauridae.

Together with the <a href="Diplodocidae">Diplodocidae</a> and the <a href="Rebbachisauridae">Rebbachisauridae</a>, the Dicraeosauridae is nested inside the <a href="Diplodocoidea">Diplodocoidea</a>. All members of the Diplodocoidea are characterized by their box-shaped snout and narrow teeth restricted to the foremost portion of the jaws. Both the Dicraeosauridae and the Diplodocidae are characterized by bifurcated neural spines of the cervical and dorsal vertebra. In the Dicraeosauridae, the bifurcated neural spines were strongly elongated, a trend reaching its extreme in "Amargasaurus".
The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> by Gallina and colleagues (2019) shows the presumed relationships between members of the Dicraeosauridae:

Both the function and the appearance in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte, in 1991, suggested the spines represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. They also could have served for display, perhaps for courtship or to intimidate rivals. Some subsequently published life restorations showed the double row of spines supporting two parallel skin sails. <a href="Gregory%20Paul">Gregory Paul</a>, in 1994, considered this possibility unlikely, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened as is the case in sail-bearing animals. Instead, he found that this shape indicates that the spines supported a keratinous sheath that would have extended the length of the spines in life. The spines could have been used for display or as weapons both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal might have been able to point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that the spines could have been clattered together to generate sound. Keratinous sheats covering the spines were also shown in a 1999 skeletal restoration published by Salgado.

Jack Bailey, in 1997, argued that the spines resembled those of <a href="Neural%20spine%20sail">sail-bearing</a> <a href="pelycosaur">pelycosaur</a>s like "<a href="Dimetrodon">Dimetrodon</a>". According to this author, "Amargasaurus" might also have possessed such a sail, which might have been used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of "Amargasaurus" were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the existence of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Neural spines from the <a href="wikt%3Apenultimate">penultimate</a> dorsal vertebra to the foremost tail vertebrae also were strongly elongated, but different in structure, forming a single row of paddle-shaped projections. According to Bailey, these projections resembled those of modern humped <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s such as the <a href="bison">bison</a>, indicating the presence of a fleshy hump above the hips. Bailey suggested similar humps for other dinosaurs with strongly elongated neural spines, such as "<a href="Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Ouranosaurus">Ouranosaurus</a>".
Daniela Schwarz and colleagues, in 2007, concluded that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an <a href="Bird%20anatomy%23Respiratory%20system">air sac</a>, which would have been connected to the lungs as part of the <a href="respiratory%20system">respiratory system</a>. In "Dicraeosaurus", this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In "Amargasaurus" the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of the spines. A cover of either keratin or skin is indicated striations on the surface of the spines similar to those of bony horn cores of today's <a href="bovid">bovid</a>s. In 2016, <a href="Mark%20Hallett%20%28artist%29">Mark Hallett</a> and <a href="Matt%20J.%20Wedel">Mathew Wedel</a> suggested that the backwards-directed spines might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's <a href="giant%20sable%20antelope">giant sable antelope</a> and <a href="Arabian%20oryx">Arabian oryx</a>, which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking <a href="lion">lion</a>s. Apart from the possible function in defense, the spines may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling. Pablo Gallina and colleagues (2019) described the closely related "Bajadasaurus", which had neural spines similar to those of "Amargasaurus", and suggested that both genera employed them for defense. A defense function would have been especially effective in "Bajadasaurus" as the spines were directed forwards and would have reached past the tip of the snout, deterring predators. The keratinous sheath that likely covered the spines might have extended their length by 50%, as seen in some modern <a href="even-toed%20ungulate">even-toed ungulate</a>s. Such extended sheaths would have made the delicate spines more resistant to damage—likely a critical threat, as the bases of the spines form the roof of the <a href="spinal%20chord">spinal chord</a>.

Paulina Carabajal and colleagues, in 2014, <a href="CT-scan">CT-scan</a>ned the skull, allowing for the generation of three-dimensional models of both the cranial <a href="endocast">endocast</a> (the cast of the brain cavity) and the <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a>. Using these models, the cranial endocast was shown to encompass in volume. The inner ear was tall and wide. The <a href="Lagena%20%28anatomy%29">lagena</a>, the part containing the <a href="hair%20cell">hair cell</a>s for hearing, was rather short, indicating that the sense of hearing would have been poorer in "Amargasaurus" than in other sauropods for which inner ears have been studied.

The first skeletal reconstructions show the skull in a near-horizontal posture. Salgado, in 1999, argued that such a posture would have been anatomically impossible due to the elongated neural spines of the neck vertebrae. Instead, he envisaged the head in a nearly vertical orientation. The habitual orientation of the head is usually reflected by the orientation of the <a href="semicircular%20canals">semicircular canals</a> of the inner ear, which housed the sense of balance (<a href="vestibular%20system">vestibular system</a>). Using their three-dimensional model of the inner ear, Carabajal and colleagues suggested that the snout faced downwards at an angle of roughly 65° relative to the horizontal. A similar value has recently been proposed for the related "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>". The neutral posture of the neck can be approximated based on how the cervical vertebrae attached to each other. According to Carabajal and colleagues, the neck was gently sloping downwards, so that the snout would have rested above the ground in neutral posture. In reality, neck posture would have varied according to the respective activities of the animals. Raising of the neck, e.g. for reaching an alert position, would have been constricted by the elongated neural spines, not permitting heights greater than .

"Amargasaurus" was <a href="quadrupedal">quadrupedal</a> (moved on four legs), and probably was unable to rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte, in 1991, suggested that "Amargasaurus" was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña in 1999, who argued that "Amargasaurus" was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by <a href="bending%20moment">bending moment</a>s, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of "Amargasaurus" were even more sturdy than those of today's <a href="white%20rhinoceros">white rhinoceros</a>, which is adapted to <a href="Horse%20gait">galloping</a>.

"Amargasaurus" stems from <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s of the <a href="La%20Amarga%20Formation">La Amarga Formation</a>, which is part of the <a href="Neuqu%C3%A9n%20Basin">Neuquén Basin</a> and dates to the <a href="Barremian">Barremian</a> and late <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> of the Early Cretaceous. Most vertebrate fossils, including "Amargasaurus", have been found in the lowermost (oldest) part of the formation, the Puesto Antigual Member. This member is approximately in thickness and mainly composed of sandstones deposited by <a href="braided%20river">braided river</a>s. The "Amargasaurus" skeleton itself was recovered from a layer composed of sandy <a href="Conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerates</a>. The sauropod fauna of the La Amarga Formation was diverse and included the basal <a href="Rebbachisauridae">rebbachisaurid</a> "<a href="Zapalasaurus">Zapalasaurus</a>", the <a href="dicraeosaurid">dicraeosaurid</a> "<a href="Amargatitanis">Amargatitanis</a>", and unnamed remains of basal <a href="Titanosauriformes">titanosauriforms</a>. The high diversity suggests that different sauropod species exploited different food sources in order to reduce competition. Basal Titanosauriforms showed proportionally longer necks, longer forelimbs, and broader tooth crowns than Dicraeosaurids and Rebbachisaurids, suggesting greater feeding heights. "Amargasaurus" probably fed above ground level at heights of up to , as evidenced by the anatomy of its neck and inner ear. Rebbachisaurids like "Zapalasaurus" presumably fed at ground-level, while basal Titanosauriforms exploited food sources at higher levels.

Other dinosaurs of the La Amarga Formation include the <a href="Stegosauria">stegosaur</a> "<a href="Amargastegos">Amargastegos</a>"; predatory dinosaurs include the small <a href="Ceratosauria">ceratosaur</a> "<a href="Ligabueino">Ligabueino</a>", and the presence of a large <a href="Tetanurae">tetanuran</a> is indicated by teeth. Other than dinosaurs, the formation is notable for the <a href="cladotheria">cladotheria</a>n mammal "<a href="Vincelestes">Vincelestes</a>", the only mammal known from the Early Cretaceous of South America. <a href="Crocodylomorph">Crocodylomorph</a>s are represented by the <a href="Trematochampsidae">trematochampsid</a> "<a href="Amargasuchus">Amargasuchus</a>" – the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of this genus was found in association with the "Amargasaurus" bones.

Found in <a href="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a> in the 1890s, it was described by <a href="Arthur%20Smith%20Woodward">Arthur Smith Woodward</a> in 1905 as a new specimen of the <a href="species">species</a> "<a href="Cetiosaurus%20leedsi">Cetiosaurus leedsi</a>". This was changed in 1927, when <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Huene">Friedrich von Huene</a> found NHMUK R3078 and the "C. leedsi" <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> to be too different from "<a href="Cetiosaurus">Cetiosaurus</a>", warranting its own genus, which he named "Cetiosauriscus", meaning ""Cetiosaurus"-like". "Cetiosauriscus leedsi" was referred to the sauropod <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Diplodocidae">Diplodocidae</a> because of similarities in the tail and foot, and had the dubious or intermediate species "Cetiosauriscus" "greppini", "C." "longus", and "C." "glymptonensis" assigned to it. In 1980, Alan Charig named a new species of "Cetiosauriscus" for NHMUK R3078 because of the lack of comparable material to the type of "C. leedsi"; this species was named Cetiosauriscus stewarti. Because of the poor state of preservation of the "Cetiosauriscus leedsi" fossil, Charig sent a petition to the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</a> to instead make "C. stewarti" the type species. "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" became the oldest confirmed diplodocid until a <a href="phylogenetic%20analysis">phylogenetic analysis</a> published in 2003 instead found the species to belong to <a href="Mamenchisauridae">Mamenchisauridae</a>, and followed by studies in 2005 and 2015 that found it outside <a href="Neosauropoda">Neosauropoda</a>, while not a mamenchisaurid proper.

"Cetiosauriscus" was found in the marine deposits of the <a href="Oxford%20Clay%20Formation">Oxford Clay Formation</a> alongside many different <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> groups, marine <a href="ichthyosaurs">ichthyosaurs</a>, <a href="plesiosaurs">plesiosaurs</a> and <a href="crocodylians">crocodylians</a>, a single <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>, and various dinosaurs: the <a href="ankylosaur">ankylosaur</a> "<a href="Sarcolestes">Sarcolestes</a>", the <a href="stegosaur">stegosaur</a>s "<a href="Lexovisaurus">Lexovisaurus</a>" and "<a href="Loricatosaurus">Loricatosaurus</a>", the <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a> "<a href="Callovosaurus">Callovosaurus</a>", as well as some unnamed <a href="taxon">taxa</a>. The <a href="theropod">theropod</a>s "<a href="Eustreptospondylus">Eustreptospondylus</a>", "<a href="Metriacanthosaurus">Metriacanthosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>" are known from the formation, although probably not from the same level as "Cetiosauriscus".

The fossil later known as "Cetiosauriscus" was originally ascribed to the genus "<a href="Cetiosaurus">Cetiosaurus</a>"—one of the first sauropods to be named, in <a href="1842%20in%20paleontology">1842</a> by <a href="palaeontologist">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a>, and one with a complicated history due to many unfounded referrals of species and specimens, involving almost all English sauropod specimens. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Cetiosaurus" has changed throughout history because of incomplete remains and the taxon's significance, and many aspects of its anatomy and relationships are still uncertain. "Cetiosaurus" was originally named to include "C. medius", "C. brevis", "C. brachyurus" and "C. longus", which span from the <a href="Middle%20Jurassic">Middle Jurassic</a> to the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> of various localities across England. As none of these species are truly diagnostic, and "Cetiosaurus" is a historically and taxonomically important taxon, the more complete Middle Jurassic species "C. oxoniensis" named by <a href="geologist">geologist</a> <a href="John%20Phillips%20%28geologist%29">John Phillips</a> in <a href="1871%20in%20paleontology">1871</a> became the type species. "C. glymptonensis" was also named in the same publication by Phillips, but is less complete and of a questionable validity.

Another English taxon, "<a href="Ornithopsis%20hulkei">Ornithopsis hulkei</a>", was named in <a href="1870%20in%20paleontology">1870</a> by palaeontologist <a href="Harry%20Govier%20Seeley">Harry Govier Seeley</a> for vertebrae from the Early Cretaceous <a href="Wessex%20Formation">Wessex Formation</a>, younger than the existing species of "Cetiosaurus". Seeley considered "Ornithopsis" to be closely related to "Cetiosaurus", but different due to the internal bone structure. An additional species, "<a href="Ornithopsis">Ornithopsis leedsii</a>" was named in <a href="1887%20in%20paleontology">1887</a> by <a href="John%20Hulke">John Hulke</a> for a <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a>, vertebrae and <a href="rib">rib</a>s collected by <a href="Alfred%20Nicholson%20Leeds">Alfred Nicholson Leeds</a>, an English farmer and amateur <a href="fossil%20collector">fossil collector</a> who throughout his life compiled numerous collections of fossils from the Oxford Clay. "O. leedsii", from the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a>, showed similarities to older "<a href="Cetiosaurus%20oxoniensis">Cetiosaurus oxoniensis</a>" as well as younger "O. hulkei". It was described in more detail by Seeley in <a href="1889%20in%20paleontology">1889</a>, where he considered "O. hulkei", "C. oxoniensis" and "O. leedsii" to all be in the same genus, bearing the name "Cetiosaurus". But <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="Richard%20Lydekker">Richard Lydekker</a> discussed with Seeley, before the publication of Seeley's 1889 paper, that "Cetiosaurus" and "Ornithopsis" were not the same taxon. Lydekker suggested that Wealden fossils (including "O. hulkei") belonged to "Ornithopsis" and the Jurassic remains (including "O. leedsii" and "C. oxoniensis") to "Cetiosaurus". Lydekker in <a href="1895%20in%20paleontology">1895</a> changed his mind and referred the species "O. leedsii" to "<a href="Pelorosaurus">Pelorosaurus</a>" (known already from the species "P. brevis", once named "Cetiosaurus brevis")—as "P. leedsi"—and referred the genus to <a href="Atlantosauridae">Atlantosauridae</a>. Lydekker's classification of the species was not supported by later authors like palaeontologist <a href="Arthur%20Smith%20Woodward">Arthur Smith Woodward</a> in <a href="1905%20in%20paleontology">1905</a>, who followed Seeley's classification scheme.

The sauropod fossil today known as "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" was discovered in May <a href="1898%20in%20paleontology">1898</a> by clay workers in the area around <a href="Fletton">Fletton</a> to the south of <a href="Peterborough">Peterborough</a> and east of the <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Great Northern Railway</a>. Pits in this region expose the fossil-rich <a href="Sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rocks</a> of the <a href="ocean">marine</a> <a href="Oxford%20Clay">Oxford Clay</a>, which is of middle <a href="Callovian">Callovian</a> age and today regarded as one of the classic <a href="geological%20formation">geological formation</a>s of British palaeontology. The sauropod fossil possibly stems from NPBCL pit No. 1, which was the northernmost pit operated by the New Peterborough Brick Company Limited, and which produced the most vertebrate fossils. The discovery was brought to the attention of Leeds, who, after excavation, took the sauropod specimen to Eyebury, the Leeds' family home. In mid-August, after some cleaning and repairing of the specimen, geologist <a href="Henry%20Woodward%20%28geologist%29">Henry Woodward</a> visited Eyebury and produced a life-sized drawing of the remains for presentation at the British Association for the Advancement of Science Meeting. Following this presentation, on 17 August 1898, Henry Woodward returned with American palaeontologist <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, who considered the sauropod to be closely related to the North American taxon "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>". Alfred Leeds offered the sauropod to the <a href="British%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">British Museum of Natural History</a> (BMNH, now abbreviated as NHMUK) for £250, which would equate to about £30,529 in 2017. The NHMUK had earlier in 1890 and 1892 bought the First and Second Collections of Alfred Leeds, respectively. Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the NHMUK, had "great pleasure" to recommend to the Trustees of the NHMUK the fossil be purchased. The purchase was sanctioned on 25 February 1899, along with the purchase of assorted other remains for just over £357 (~£43,596 now), where the Leeds sauropod gained the <a href="accession%20number%20%28library%20science%29">accession number</a> BMNH R3078 (now NHMUK R3078). 

The amount of material made NHMUK R3078 the most complete sauropod specimen from the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, only comparable later to the "<a href="Rutland%20Dinosaur">Rutland Dinosaur</a>" (referred to "Cetiosaurus") discovered in 1967. Known regions of the specimen include the <a href="forelimb">forelimb</a>, <a href="hindlimb">hindlimb</a> and <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>. The forelimb lacks the <a href="manus%20%28anatomy%29">manus</a> (hand) and part of the <a href="radius">radius</a> and <a href="ulna">ulna</a>, although the hindlimb only lacks a few bones in the <a href="Pes%20%28anatomy%29">pes</a> (foot) and fragments of the <a href="tibia">tibia</a>, <a href="fibula">fibula</a> and <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a>. The vertebrae known are four parts of dorsal vertebrae, the neural spines of the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>, multiple <a href="anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23anterior%20and%20posterior">anterior</a> <a href="caudal%20vertebrae">caudal vertebrae</a> (tail bones), and a series of 27 nearly complete vertebrae from the middle of the tail with associated or articulated <a href="Chevron%20%28anatomy%29">chevrons</a> (ribs along the underside of the tail), although the vertebral series is not continuous. A tail tip (NHMUK R1967) from the same locality, but a different individual was thought by palaeontologist <a href="Alan%20Charig">Alan Charig</a> in 1980 to belong to "Cetiosauriscus". The assignment of NHMUK R1967 to "Cetiosauriscus" was considered unlikely in alternate studies by palaeontologists <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Huene">Friedrich von Huene</a>, Paul Upchurch and <a href="Darren%20Naish">Darren Naish</a> because of the lack of overlap and uncertain phylogenetic positions. In <a href="1903%20in%20paleontology">1903</a>, the skeleton was mounted as preserved in the British Museum, so it could be more easily compared with other mounted sauropods from <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. The mount of "Cetiosauriscus" was put on display just prior to the cast skeleton of "Diplodocus", and was displayed with the dorsal vertebrae NHMUK R1984 and some isolated teeth from a <a href="camarasaurid">camarasaurid</a> (possibly referable to "Cetiosauriscus"), making it the first sauropod skeleton mounted in the United Kingdom.

NHMUK R3078 was referred in 1905 by Arthur Woodward to the species "Cetiosaurus leedsi", as it was from the same geologic formation as other specimens that were assigned to "C. leedsii". Woodward also referred the dorsal vertebrae NHMUK R1984 and the tail tip NHMUK R1967 to the species. In <a href="1927%20in%20paleontology">1927</a>, Huene briefly described the anatomy of the species "C. leedsii", where he noted that it shared many similarities with "<a href="Haplocanthosaurus">Haplocanthosaurus</a>" and was most likely between "Cetiosaurus" proper and the former genus. For this reason, Huene proposed the new genus name "Cetiosauriscus" for the species. To the genus he referred the specimens NHMUK R1984–R1988 and NHMUK R3078. Huene based his new name on "Cetiosaurus"—"whale lizard"—by adding the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> suffix "iscus", meaning "like", translating fully to "whale-lizard like".

For a later review of <a href="Saurischia">Saurischia</a>, Huene in <a href="1932%20in%20paleontology">1932</a> reassigned the species "Ornithopsis" "greppini", which he had named in <a href="1922%20in%20paleontology">1922</a>, to the genus "Cetiosauriscus". The known material, discovered in Late Jurassic (<a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a>) deposits in the <a href="Reuchenette%20Formation">Reuchenette Formation</a> of <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, includes dorsal and caudal vertebrae, forelimb bones and a hindlimb and partial pes, from at least two individuals. The long humerus was built like "Cetiosauriscus leedsii", and the two species were originally distinguished from "Cetiosaurus" by having shorter dorsal vertebrae, a shorter forelimb, and a longer lower leg. "Cetiosauriscus greppini" differs from "Cetiosauriscus leedsii" by having caudal <a href="transverse%20processes">transverse processes</a> that are <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Anterior%20and%20posterior">antero-posteriorly</a> flat and have a distinct wing-like upward expansion. It also differs in having posterior <a href="wikt%3Alamina">lamina</a> projecting downwards from the anterior caudal transverse processes, a <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> with a rounded outline and with a notch below the <a href="glenoid">glenoid</a> joint, remarkably straight shafts of humerus and femur, a <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">distal</a> end of the humerus with an inner <a href="condyle">condyle</a> higher than the outer condyle, a more <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">proximally</a> placed <a href="fourth%20trochanter">fourth trochanter</a>, and a longer and straighter <a href="ischium">ischium</a>. These characters suggested that both taxa differ on the generic level, a position supported by Upchurch and John Martin in <a href="2003%20in%20paleontology">2003</a>, <a href="David%20Weishampel">David Weishampel</a> and colleagues in <a href="2004%20in%20paleontology">2004</a>, and John Whitlock in <a href="2011%20in%20paleontology">2011</a>, who considered "C. greppini" to be <a href="Eusauropoda">Eusauropoda</a> "<a href="incertae%20sedis">incertae sedis</a>". The similarities like the anatomy of the caudal vertebrae were suggested by Christian Meyer and Basil Thüring in 2003 to instead support both species being separate, but in the same genus.

The species "Cetiosaurus longus", named in 1842 by Owen, was referred to the genus "Cetiosauriscus" without comment by sauropod palaeontologist John Stanton McIntosh in 1990. Material the species was named for included a dorsal and caudal vertebrae from the <a href="Portland%20Stone">Portland Stone</a> of <a href="Garsington">Garsington</a>, <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, two other caudal vertebrae from the same deposit of nearby <a href="Thame">Thame</a>, and a single vertebra and some <a href="metatarsals">metatarsals</a> originally named "<a href="Cetiosaurus%20epioolithicus">Cetiosaurus epioolithicus</a>" (an invalid "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>"), although the material from Garsington has been lost since its description. One of the vertebrae (OUMNH J13871) may instead be a <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical</a>, as it has one mildly convex and one concave articular face. Characterised as having uniquely elongate vertebral <a href="vertebral%20centrum">centra</a> (body of the vertebra), "C. longus" is not a <a href="autapomorphy">diagnostic</a> taxon. As it lacks any diagnostic features of "Cetiosauriscus", the species should be referred to by its original designation, "Cetiosaurus longus".

"Cetiosaurus glymptonensis", named on the basis of nine middle-distal caudal centra from the <a href="Forest%20Marble%20Formation">Forest Marble Formation</a> of Oxfordshire, England, was referred to "Cetiosauriscus" by McIntosh in 1990. These caudal vertebrae were considered to be more elongate than those of "Cetiosaurus oxoniensis", but caudal length proportions vary significantly throughout the tail and in different taxa, "<a href="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a>", "Diplodocus" and "Cetiosauriscus" having similarly elongate caudal vertebrae. The more anterior caudals have a large ridge two-thirds up the centrum and a smaller ridge one-third up. These ridges are similar to the middle caudals of "Cetiosauriscus", but are absent in caudals of the same size and proportions, and because of this difference the species was concluded to be separate from "Cetiosauriscus" by Upchurch and Martin in 2003. "Cetiosaurus" "glymptonensis" is considered to be Eusauropoda "incertae sedis" by Upchurch and Martin (2003), Weishampel and colleagues (2004) and Whitlock (2011), and is in need of a new genus name because it has a single diagnostic feature, the lateral ridges.

In <a href="1980%20in%20paleontology">1980</a>, Charig described a specimen of indeterminate diplodocid from the Early Cretaceous of England, and re-examined the holotype of "Cetiosauriscus leedsii" to compare its characteristics. In this publication he confirmed that the ilium of the holotype of "C. leedsi", NHMUK R1988, was too incomplete to be compared to the also incomplete ilium of the referred specimen NHMUK R3078. Because of the lack of overlap the referral of NHMUK R3078 to "Cetiosauriscus leedsii" was no longer verifiable, so Charig named the new species "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" for NHMUK R3078. The specific name was chosen to honour Sir Ronald Stewart, the chairman of the London Brick Company that owned the clay pit the fossils had been found in. Furthermore, Charig considered "Cetiosauriscus leedsii" and "Cetiosauriscus greppini" to be <a href="nomen%20dubium">dubious</a> taxa, making "C. stewarti" the only valid species within "Cetiosauriscus". Because of the invalidity of the type species "C. leedsii", Charig made a petition to the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a> (ICZN) in <a href="1993%20in%20paleontology">1993</a> to designate "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" as the type species of its genus, being the taxon containing the specimen Huene had originally named the genus for and distinguished from "Cetiosaurus", and also a taxonomically more stable name. This was accepted by the ICZN in <a href="1995%20in%20paleontology">1995</a>, making "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" the type species of "Cetiosauriscus". The only specimen that can confidently be assigned to "C. stewarti" is the holotype NHMUK R3078, although it is possible that isolated teeth from the Oxford Clay could be from the taxon.

"Cetiosauriscus" was a moderately sized, quadrupedal eusauropod. It had a moderately long tail, and relatively long arms making the shoulders level with the hips. "Cetiosauriscus" was approximately long based on the known skeleton, comparable to possible relatives like long "Cetiosaurus", and long "<a href="Patagosaurus">Patagosaurus</a>". The weight of "Cetiosauriscus" is less certain, depending on its phylogenetic placement. Restored as a diplodocid, "Cetiosauriscus" was estimated by Paul (2010) as , but restored as a cetiosaur it was estimated by Paul (2016) as .

The dorsal vertebrae of NHMUK R3078 are incomplete or fragmentary. A partial anterior dorsal is known from a single centrum, which is about as long as wide, with a strong anterior articular ball (an <a href="wikt%3Aopisthocoelous">opisthocoelous</a> condition). On the <a href="anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23lateral%20and%20medial">lateral</a> surfaces (sides) of the centrum there are deep but small <a href="wikt%3Apleurocoel">pleurocoels</a> (depressions in the sides of vertebrae for <a href="air%20sac">air sac</a>s). A single middle dorsal centrum is preserved, being slightly smaller than the anterior dorsal. The pleurocoel is more elongate, but like the anterior dorsal there is no <a href="anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23dorsal%20and%20ventral">ventral</a> (underside) concavity. A posterior dorsal is also known and is probably the last dorsal before the sacrum (vertebrae between the pelves). It preserves the entire centrum and most of the neural arch, and is significantly shortened in length compared to the other dorsals, although it is about as wide across as tall. A shallow pleurocoel is also present, but is placed higher on the side of the centrum and disappears into the <a href="neural%20arch">neural arch</a>. Unlike the anterior dorsal, the posterior dorsal is only very slightly opisthocoelous. A tall and narrow <a href="hyposphene">hyposphene</a> (thin vertical ridge below the anterior processes of the arch, providing additional vertebral articulation) is present and well expanded off the arch. A single dorsal <a href="neural%20spine">neural spine</a> is also preserved. It is flattened and not tall, with a narrowed tip, and the only noticeable laminae present are the spinopostzygapophyseal laminae running down the rear corners of the spine to the <a href="zygapophyses">postzygapophyses</a>. This is unlike most diplodocoids where there are many laminar running along the length of the spines. Four neural spines of the sacrum are preserved, three of which form a single plate and the fourth of which is separate, like in "Diplodocus".

Of the anterior four caudal vertebrae, the anteriormost two are highly incomplete. Both of the short, but wider-than-tall, centra preserve traces of the sideways projections (<a href="transverse%20process">transverse process</a>es) found in other vertebrae, which are very low on the sides compared to following caudals. The neural spines are very thin, thinning to a single ridge in front (the prespinal lamina), but having two spinopostzygapophyseal laminae like the dorsals. The fourth caudal is the most complete anterior caudal. The centrum is concave in front, but flat behind (<a href="wikt%3Aamphiplatyan">amphiplatyan</a>). There are no pleurocoels unlike the dorsals, and the transverse processes begin in the top half of the centrum. The centrum is long, tall and wide, with the total vertebra being tall. Anterior caudals of the "Cetiosaurus leedsi" specimen NHMUK R1984 are very similar to those of "Cetiosauriscus", but the neural arches are not as tall in "C. leedsi", and the transverse processes lack a prominent ridge along the top of them. Middle and posterior caudals from a nearly continuous series of 27 bones are well preserved in "Cetiosauriscus". The later vertebrae are slightly more elongate than those in front, and slightly less concave in their anterior face. Moving towards the end of the tail the centra reduce in size and the transverse processes shrink until they are completely absent, with the neural spines becoming shorter, thinner, and more slanted. The seventh vertebrae of the series, at tall, is long, only one cm longer than the 21st of the same series that is tall. A distinguishing characteristic of "Cetiosauriscus" is the presence of a front-to-back concavity on the top of the anterior and middle caudal neural spines.

"Cetiosauriscus" preserves a single right scapula (shoulder blade), which is elongate and slender. The scapula is long and wide at the middle, making it very narrow. The inner face is flat across, while the outer face is gently convex. There is no expansion of the far end of the blade. The bone thickens close to the humerus joint, where it also articulates with the coracoid. The coracoid is incomplete, but enough is preserved to show it is rectangular, and longer, at , than it is wide—. A long humerus is known, and complete with minimal crushing. The bone is short and stout, with a robust <a href="deltoid%20tuberosity">crest for the deltoid muscle</a> along the upper half of the bone. The shape of the humerus is similar to the shortness of "<a href="Neuquensaurus">Neuquensaurus</a>", although overall the forelimb is long, as in "Diplodocus" and "Cetiosaurus", being 69% of the femur length. The distal end is <a href="wikt%3Arugose">roughened</a> for a large <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> cap as found in some other eusauropods like "Cetiosauriscus" "greppini". The radius and ulna are broken, but complete they would have been long.

The hindlimb of "Cetiosauriscus" is about 3/2 the length of the forelimb. Both ilia are very fragmentary, but the two sides supplement each other to give a reasonable idea of the proportions of the complete bone. The ilium is long, and has a long and slender pubic <a href="Peduncle%20%28anatomy%29">peduncle</a>. It is proportionally lower than in "Cetiosaurus", being similar in proportions to "Haplocanthosaurus" and the later "<a href="Titanosauridae">Titanosauridae</a>". The left femur is complete, but part of the shaft is eroded away. It is very slender, being tall but only wide at the middle. This very <a href="gracile">gracile</a> femoral morphology is shared with "<a href="Amphicoelias">Amphicoelias</a>", "<a href="Shunosaurus">Shunosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ligabuesaurus">Ligabuesaurus</a>" and a specimen of "Diplodocus", being more gracile than "Cetiosaurus" and most other eusauropods. A prominent fourth trochanter is present, but the remaining shaft is very compressed. The tibia, fibula and pes are also preserved, but are fragmentary and disarticulated making comparisons difficult, the lower hindlimb being about upright. The foot is similar to "Diplodocus" and "<a href="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a>", where the first toes are large and clawed, and the outer ones are small and clawless. Metatarsal III is the longest, followed by metatarsal IV, II, V and I. Metatarsal I is the widest, and the width of the bones decreases numerically.

"Cetiosauriscus" was originally classified by Huene as a genus in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Cetiosauridae">Cetiosauridae</a>, within the <a href="subfamily%20%28biology%29">subfamily</a> <a href="Cardiodontidae">Cardiodontidae</a>. The subfamily, including the other taxa "Cetiosaurus", "Haplocanthosaurus", "<a href="Dystrophaeus">Dystrophaeus</a>", "<a href="Elosaurus">Elosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Rhoetosaurus">Rhoetosaurus</a>", was founded upon the general <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> features of elongate cervicals and shortened dorsals—both opisthocoelous, <a href="wikt%3Aamphicoelous">amphicoelous</a> caudals that are rod-shaped distally, paired <a href="sternum">sternal plates</a>, an ilium lacking the postacetabular process (region of the ilium behind the ischium joint and <a href="acetabulum">acetabulum</a>), a very wide <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubis</a>, wide distal ischium, significantly shorter forelimb than hindlimb, fibula lacking the middle muscle attachment, and long <a href="metacarpal">metacarpal</a>s and short <a href="metatarsal">metatarsal</a>s. This classification was emmended in 1932 when Huene concluded "Cetiosauriscus" was closer to "Haplocanthosaurus" than "Cetiosaurus" in the family, because of forelimb and hindlimb proportions. Conversely, in <a href="1956%20in%20paleontology">1956</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Romer">Alfred Romer</a> synonymised "Cetiosauriscus" and "Cetiosaurus", a position that has not been followed by subsequent studies on the taxon.

Berman and McIntosh in <a href="1978%20in%20paleontology">1978</a> referred "Cetiosauriscus" to the family <a href="Diplodocidae">Diplodocidae</a> along with multiple other genera; "Diplodocus", "Apatosaurus", "Barosaurus", "Mamenchisaurus" "<a href="Dicraeosaurus">Dicraeosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Nemegtosaurus">Nemegtosaurus</a>". Like other members of the family, "Cetiosauriscus" possesses wing-like transverse processes, divided chevrons with forward and backward projections, the tail is "whiplash"-like, the humerus is 2/3 the length of the femur, the <a href="calcaneum">calcaneum</a> is absent, metatarsal III and IV are the longest, and metatarsal I has a process on the bottom back corner. This referral would make "Cetiosauriscus", known from the Callovian, the oldest diplodocid, millions of years older than "Diplodocus", "Barosaurus" or "Apatosaurus". In the paper naming "Cetiosauriscus stewarti", Charig also described the chevrons of a new specimen and created the term "diplodociform" to describe them. This meant that they were robust and double-beamed, as in "Diplodocus" and its relatives like "Mamenchisaurus". Because of the similarly "diplodociform" chevrons, Charig referred "Cetiosauriscus" to the Diplodocidae along with the new specimen. Elaborating upon his earlier paper, McIntosh (1990) weakly referred "Cetiosauriscus" to the subfamily <a href="Diplodocinae">Diplodocinae</a>, characterised by more cervicals and fewer dorsals, tall sacrum neural spines, short forelimbs, no calcaneum, metatarsals III and IV being the longest, and a small process on the distal end of metatarsal I. The subfamily also included "Diplodocus", "<a href="Barosaurus">Barosaurus</a>" and "Apatosaurus". In <a href="2004%20in%20paleontology">2004</a> this placement was followed by Weishampel "et al." without comment.

A <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic analysis</a> of "Cetiosauriscus" was conducted in 2003 by Julia Heathcote and Upchurch, based upon the two most inclusive matrices of the time, those of <a href="Jeffrey%20A.%20Wilson">Jeffrey A. Wilson</a> (2002) and Upchurch (1995), neither of which had included the taxon in the past. Added to the analysis of Upchurch, "Cetiosauriscus" placed as the sister taxon of "<a href="Tehuelchesaurus">Tehuelchesaurus</a>", in a group including "<a href="Mamenchisaurus">Mamenchisaurus</a>", "<a href="Omeisaurus">Omeisaurus</a>" and "<a href="Euhelopus">Euhelopus</a>", and a placement within a group of "Omeisaurus" and "Mamenchisaurus" was also found by using the Wilson matrix. Based on these two results, Heathcote and Upchurch concluded "Cetiosauriscus" was not a diplodocid or even within <a href="Diplodocoidea">Diplodocoidea</a>, instead being a more basal sauropod outside <a href="Neosauropoda">Neosauropoda</a>. The phylogenetic analysis of Rauhut "et al." (2005) resolved "Cetiosauriscus" in a clade with "Omeisaurus", itself in a group with "<a href="Losillasaurus">Losillasaurus</a>" and "Mamenchisaurus", outside of Neosauropoda. The phylogenetic relationships of "Cetiosauriscus" were also tested in <a href="2015%20in%20paleontology">2015</a> by Tschopp "et al.", as a potential diplodocid. Although the genus was found to be within <a href="Diplodocimorpha">Diplodocimorpha</a> with one analysis method, it was also found outside Neosauropoda. In both, "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" was found to be in a clade alone with "<a href="Barosaurus%20affinis">Barosaurus affinis</a>", a dubious species known only from foot bones. Tschopp "et al." concluded that "Cetiosauriscus" was not a diplodocid or a diplodocoid, as forcing it to be outside Neosauropoda was more <a href="maximum%20parsimony%20%28phylogenetics%29">parsimonious</a> than forcing it to be within Diplodocoidea in all analyses. As the paper was only to test relationships within Diplodocidae, more solid conclusions regarding the position of "Cetiosauriscus" could not be made. The results of the favoured <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> of Tschopp "et al." is shown below:

The series of distal caudal vertebrae NHMUK R1967, once referred to "Cetiosauriscus", is similar to the caudals of "Diplodocus", with two convex ends (<a href="wikt%3Abiconvex">biconvex</a>) and a long and thin centrum. These caudals displays signs of injury at two points along the series of 10 vertebrae, where there are signs of breakage in the bone that was later healed. These lesions were identified as the same form of pathologies as found on the tail of "Diplodocus". It has been suggested that the biconvex distal caudal vertebrae in sauropods were used for making whip-like cracking noise, being thin and delicate and not intended for impact, as the joints would be very vulnerable to damage rendering them useless.

"Cetiosauriscus" lived during the Callovian, an <a href="epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a> in the Middle Jurassic, about 166 to 164 mya. 
The single specimen is known from the Lower Member of the Oxford Clay Formation, along with multiple other dinosaur genera and many other groups of animals, in the <a href="biozone">biozone</a> of the <a href="index%20fossil">index fossil</a> "<a href="Kosmoceras%20jason">Kosmoceras jason</a>". The Oxford Clay Formation is a marine deposit of southern and middle England, known for the high-quality preservation of some fossils and the large diversity of taxa. Sediments are generally brownish-grey <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>, organic-rich with plentiful crushed <a href="ammonite">ammonite</a>s and <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s, at most thick. A large diversity of <a href="flora">flora</a> can be seen, preserved in the form of pollen and spores. <a href="Gymnosperms">Gymnosperms</a> are present, along with <a href="pteridophyte">pteridophyte</a>s, unidentifiable wood fragments, other intermediate pollen, and miscellaneous organic plant material.

The intermediate sauropod "<a href="Ornithopsis%20leedsi">Ornithopsis leedsi</a>" is known from the same section of the formation as "Cetiosauriscus", along with the <a href="stegosauridae">stegosaurids</a> "<a href="Lexovisaurus%20durobrivensis">Lexovisaurus durobrivensis</a>" and "<a href="Loricatosaurus%20priscus">Loricatosaurus priscus</a>" (which are possibly synonyms), the basal <a href="ankylosaur">ankylosaur</a> "<a href="Sarcolestes%20leedsi">Sarcolestes leedsi</a>", the <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a> "<a href="Callovosaurus%20leedsi">Callovosaurus leedsi</a>", and a second unnamed ornithopod taxon. Dinosaur eggs that have not yet been assigned to a taxon are also known from the Lower Oxford Clay. The <a href="theropod">theropod</a>s "<a href="Eustreptospondylus">Eustreptospondylus</a>" and possibly "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>" are also known from the Oxford Clay Formation, but slightly younger deposits (the Middle Member). In addition, the theropod "<a href="Metriacanthosaurus">Metriacanthosaurus</a>" is from an unknown level and age in the formation.

Hundreds of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s are known from the marine deposits, including bivalves, <a href="gastropod">gastropod</a>s, <a href="scaphopod">scaphopod</a>s, ammonites, <a href="teuthoidea">teuthoid</a>s, a <a href="nautiloid">nautiloid</a>, <a href="foraminifera">foraminifera</a>, <a href="coelenterate">coelenterate</a>s, <a href="bryozoa">bryozoa</a>ns, <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s, <a href="annelid">annelid</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="ostracod">ostracod</a>s, <a href="cirripede">cirripede</a>s and <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>s.

No. 1 Squadron RAAF

No. 1 Squadron is a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) squadron headquartered at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland. Controlled by <a href="No.%2082%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 82 Wing</a>, it is equipped with <a href="Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet</a> multi-role fighters. The squadron was formed under the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> in 1916 and saw action in the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a>s during World War I. It flew obsolete <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2</a>s, B.E.12s, <a href="Martinsyde%20G.100">Martinsyde G.100</a>s and G.102s, as well as <a href="Airco%20DH.6">Airco DH.6</a>s, <a href="Bristol%20Scout">Bristol Scout</a>s and <a href="Nieuport%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B17">Nieuport 17</a>s, before re-equipping with the <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20R.E.8">R.E.8</a> in October 1917 and finally the <a href="Bristol%20F.2%20Fighter">Bristol Fighter</a> in December. Its commanding officer in 1917–18 was Major <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, later known as the "Father of the RAAF". Disbanded in 1919, No. 1 Squadron was re-formed on paper as part of the RAAF in 1922, and re-established as an operational unit three years later.

During World War II, the squadron flew <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> bombers in the <a href="Malayan%20Campaign">Malayan</a> and <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20campaign">Dutch East Indies campaign</a>s, suffering severe losses before being reduced to <a href="En%20cadre">cadre</a> in 1942. It was re-formed with <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>s the following year, and re-equipped with <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a>s in 1945 for further operations in the Dutch East Indies. Reduced to cadre once more after the war ended, No. 1 Squadron was re-established at Amberley in 1948 as an <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a> heavy bomber unit. From 1950 to 1958 it was based in Singapore, flying missions during the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, where it bore the brunt of the Commonwealth air campaign against communist guerillas. When it returned to Australia it re-equipped with <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> jet bombers. It operated <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">McDonald Douglas F-4E Phantom II</a>s <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II%20in%20Australian%20service">leased from the USAF</a> from 1970 to 1973, as a stop-gap pending delivery of the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a> swing-wing bomber. The F-111 remained in service for 37 years until replaced by the Super Hornet in 2010. In 2014–15, and again in 2017, a detachment of Super Hornets was deployed to the Middle East as part of <a href="Operation%20Okra">Australia's contribution</a> to the <a href="military%20intervention%20against%20ISIL">military intervention against ISIL</a>.

No. 1 Squadron is located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland, and controlled by <a href="No.%2082%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 82 Wing</a>, which is part of <a href="Air%20Combat%20Group%20RAAF">Air Combat Group</a>. Its mission responsibilities include air-to-air and air-to-surface combat. The squadron is nicknamed the "Fighting First". The <a href="blazon">blazon</a> of its crest is "the Australian <a href="Kookaburra">Kookaburra</a> in a diving position superimposed on the <a href="Jerusalem%20cross">cross of Jerusalem</a>", which symbolises the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>-winning action of No. 1 Squadron pilot <a href="Frank%20McNamara%20%28VC%29">Frank McNamara</a> in <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Palestine</a> during World War I. The unit motto is "Videmus Agamus" (""We see and we strike"").

The squadron operates <a href="Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet</a> multi-role fighters, the first of which entered service in March 2010. Nicknamed the "Rhino", its missions include <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a>, fighter escort, land strike, maritime strike, <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a>, and <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>. The Super Hornet is larger than the "classic" <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> operated by the RAAF, carries more <a href="Aircraft%20ordnance">ordnance</a>, and has a greater fuel capacity. It is fitted with a <a href="20%20mm%20caliber">20 mm cannon</a> and can be armed with air-to-air and anti-shipping missiles, as well as a variety of air-to-ground bombs and missiles. Flown by a crew of two, a pilot and an air combat officer (ACO), it is capable of engaging targets in the air and on the surface simultaneously. It can be <a href="aerial%20refueling">refuelled in flight</a> by the RAAF's <a href="Airbus%20A330%20MRTT">Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports</a>. The Super Hornets are serviced at the operating level by No. 1 Squadron technical staff; heavier maintenance is conducted by <a href="Boeing%20Australia">Boeing Defence Australia</a> and other contractors.

No. 1 Squadron was established as a unit of the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, in January 1916 under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> E.H. Reynolds. With a complement of 28 officers, 195 airmen, no aircraft and little training, it sailed for Egypt in mid-March 1916, arriving at <a href="Suez">Suez</a> a month later. There it came under the control of the <a href="No.%205%20Wing%20RAF">5th Wing</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC). After training in England and Egypt, the unit was declared operational at its new headquarters in <a href="Heliopolis%20%28Cairo%20suburb%29">Heliopolis</a> on 12 June, when it took over aircraft belonging to <a href="No.%2017%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 17 Squadron RFC</a>. Its three <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flights</a> were, however, operating in isolation at different bases in the <a href="Sinai%20Desert">Sinai Desert</a>, and the squadron did not reunite until December. Flying primitive and poorly armed <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2</a> two-seat biplanes, its primary roles during this period of the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai Campaign</a> were reconnaissance—including aerial photography—and artillery spotting for the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>. No. 1 Squadron pilots attached to <a href="No.%2014%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 14 Squadron RFC</a> took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Romani">Battle of Romani</a> in July and August. In September and October, B and C Flights, led by Captains <a href="Oswald%20Watt">Oswald Watt</a> and <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a> respectively, undertook bombing and reconnaissance missions in support of the <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Australian Light Horse</a> in northern Sinai.
On 12 September 1916, the British began to refer to No. 1 Squadron as <a href="No.%2067%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 67 (Australian) Squadron</a> RFC. This practice continued until January 1918, when the unit officially became known as No. 1 Squadron AFC. The relationship between airmen and ground crew was less formal than in British units; squadron members recalled that "The CO is the only one who is ever called 'sir and that officers did not demand "saluting and standing to attention and all that rot". The unit received the first of several <a href="Martinsyde%20G.100">Martinsyde G.100</a> single-seat fighters to augment the B.E.2s on 16 October; although considered obsolete, the "Tinsyde" was substantially faster than the B.E.2, and armed with forward-firing machine guns. Shortly before the squadron took part in a bombing raid against <a href="Beersheba">Beersheba</a> on 11 November, Lieutenant <a href="Lawrence%20Wackett">Lawrence Wackett</a> managed to fix a machine gun to the top plane of one of the B.E.2s, using a mount he designed himself. Each flight was also assigned a <a href="Bristol%20Scout">Bristol Scout</a> beginning in December, but it too was obsolete and under-powered, and the squadron ceased operating the type within three months. Other older models issued to the unit included the <a href="Airco%20DH.6">Airco DH.6</a>, Martinsyde G.102 and <a href="Nieuport%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B17">Nieuport 17</a>. On 17 December, the squadron's flights were finally brought together at one base, Mustabig.

March 1917 saw the heaviest bombing campaign carried out by the squadron to date; short of its regular ordnance, the pilots improvised by dropping <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> shells on Turkish forces along the <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a>–Beersheba line. During one such mission on 20 March, Lieutenant <a href="Frank%20McNamara%20%28VC%29">Frank McNamara</a> earned the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for landing his Martinsyde in the desert under enemy fire and rescuing a fellow pilot whose B.E.2 had been forced down. On 26 March, No. 1 Squadron took part in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">First Battle of Gaza</a>; it suffered its first combat death the next day, when one of its B.E.2s was attacked by a German <a href="Rumpler">Rumpler</a>. The unit participated in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Second Battle of Gaza</a> on 19 April; like its predecessor, the attack was a failure for the Allies. Williams, later known as the "Father of the RAAF", assumed command of the squadron in May. Two B.E.12s were delivered the same month; like the Martinsydes, they were armed with a forward-firing machine gun and employed as escorts for the B.E.2s. By June, mechanical issues caused by hot summer weather and the threat from new German <a href="Albatros%20Flugzeugwerke">Albatros</a> scouts were rendering the B.E.2s largely ineffective, and Williams urgently requested newer models. Modern aircraft were eventually delivered, first the <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20R.E.8">Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8</a> in October, and then the <a href="Bristol%20F.2%20Fighter">Bristol F.2 Fighter</a> in December. "Now for the first time," wrote Williams, "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air."

No. 1 Squadron joined the <a href="No.%2040%20Wing%20RAF">40th (Army) Wing</a> of the RFC's <a href="Palestine%20Brigade%20RAF">Palestine Brigade</a> on 5 October 1917. On 22 and 24 November, the squadron bombed Bireh village during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jerusalem%20%281917%29">Battle of Jerusalem</a>. The first of its 29 confirmed aerial victories, over an Albatros, occurred on 3 January 1918. By month's end, its complement of aircraft included five B.E.2s, five Martinsydes, two R.E.8s, and nine Bristol Fighters. The squadron supported the <a href="Capture%20of%20Jericho">Capture of Jericho</a> in February 1918. It carried out air raids and reconnoitred prior to the <a href="First%20Transjordan%20attack%20on%20Amman">First Transjordan attack on Amman</a> in March and prior to the <a href="Second%20Transjordan%20attack%20on%20Shunet%20Nimrin%20and%20Es%20Salt">Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt</a> a month later; it also flew reconnaissance missions during the advance to and fighting near Es Salt and <a href="Jisr%20ed%20Damieh">Jisr ed Damieh</a>. By the end of March, it was equipped with 18 Bristol Fighters, which had replaced all the other types. As well as undertaking offensive operations, the Bristol Fighters served in the photo-reconnaissance role. During the last week of April 1918, the squadron moved its base forward from Mejdel to a new aerodrome outside <a href="Ramla">Ramleh</a>. Williams relinquished command in June to take over 40th Wing.

Beginning in August 1918, members of No. 1 Squadron, including one of its <a href="Flying%20ace">aces</a>, Lieutenant <a href="Ross%20Macpherson%20Smith">Ross Smith</a>, were attached to Colonel <a href="T.E.%20Lawrence">T.E. Lawrence</a>'s Arab army to protect it against German bombing. In September, the squadron began operating a <a href="Handley%20Page%20Type%20O">Handley Page 0/100</a>, the only Allied heavy bomber in the Middle East and the only twin-engined aircraft flown by the AFC. That month it joined the Bristol Fighters in the final offensive of the Palestinian Campaign, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Battle of Armageddon</a>, inflicting what the <a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">Australian official history</a> described as "wholesale destruction" on the Turkish <a href="Seventh%20Army%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29">Seventh Army</a>. By October, the Bristol Fighters had moved forward from Ramleh to <a href="Haifa">Haifa</a> and by the middle of the month were required to patrol and reconnoitre an exceptionally wide area of country, sometimes between , flying over <a href="Rayak%20%28Riyaq%29">Rayak</a>, <a href="Homs">Homs</a>, <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>, <a href="Hama">Hama</a>, <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>, <a href="Kilis">Killis</a> and <a href="%C4%B0skenderun">Alexandretta</a>. They bombed the German aerodromes at Rayak, where 32 German machines had been either abandoned or burnt, on 2 October. On 19 October, the first German aircraft was seen in the air since fighting over <a href="Deraa">Deraa</a> in mid-September, just prior to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sharon">Battle of Sharon</a>. Smith and another pilot forced a <a href="Deutsche%20Flugzeug-Werke">DFW</a> two-seater to land, and destroyed it on the ground by firing a <a href="Flare%20gun">Very light</a> into the aircraft after the German pilot and observer had moved to safety. In the wake of the 31 October armistice with Turkey, the squadron relocated to Ramleh in December, and then in February 1919 to <a href="El-Qantarah%20el-Sharqiyya">Kantara</a>. There its members were personally farewelled by General <a href="Edmund%20Allenby%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Allenby">Sir Edmund Allenby</a>, who congratulated them for achieving "absolute supremacy of the air ... a factor of paramount importance" to the Allied campaign.

No. 1 Squadron returned to Australia on 5 March 1919, and was disbanded. In 1921, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) was established as a separate branch of the military, and on 1 January 1922, the squadron was re-formed on paper. Its planned strength, approved by the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a> in December 1921, was three officers and five airmen, operating four <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a>s. Funding problems for the fledgling Air Force resulted in the disbandment on 1 July of No. 1 Squadron and other units established at the same time, their aircraft and personnel instead forming a single squadron of six flights under the control of <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a> (No. 1 FTS) at Point Cook. No. 1 Squadron was reactivated as an operational unit of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), at Point Cook on 1 July 1925. Its commanding officer was Flight Lieutenant <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>.

Like <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a>, formed the same day at Point Cook but transferred to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Richmond</a>, New South Wales, three weeks later, No. 1 Squadron was a multi-purpose or "composite" unit made up of three flights, each of which had a different role and comprised four aircraft: A Flight operated DH.9s for army cooperation, B Flight operated <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a> fighters, and C Flight operated <a href="Airco%20DH.9A">DH.9A</a> bombers. A third of the squadron's complement of 27 officers and 169 airmen was Permanent Air Force (PAF), and the rest CAF. No. 1 Squadron relocated from Point Cook to nearby <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Laverton</a> on 1 January 1928. The RAAF retired its S.E.5s the same year, and in 1929 took delivery of <a href="Westland%20Wapiti">Westland Wapiti</a> general-purpose aircraft to replace its DH.9s and DH.9As. Through the inter-war years, No. 1 Squadron undertook various tasks including civil aid, flood and bushfire relief, search and rescue, aerial surveys, and air show demonstrations. In October 1930, a <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">de Havilland DH.60 Moth</a> attached to the unit conducted Australia's first crop-dusting operation, at the behest of the Victorian Forestry Commission.
RAAF squadrons began adopting specialised roles in the early 1930s, No. 1 Squadron becoming No. 1 Single-Engined Bomber Squadron. By November 1935 it was made up of two flights of newly delivered <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a> fighter-bombers, and one of Wapitis. In December 1935 it was augmented by No. 1 FTS's Fighter Squadron and its six <a href="Bristol%20Bulldog">Bristol Bulldog</a>s, which were redesignated fighter-bombers. <a href="No.%2021%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 21</a> and <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">22 (Cadre) Squadrons</a> were formed on 20 April 1936 at Laverton and Richmond, respectively, absorbing the CAF personnel of Nos. 1 and 3 Squadrons, which became PAF units. The same day, No. 1 Squadron was renamed No. 1 (Fighter Bomber) Squadron. This reorganisation temporarily denuded No. 1 Squadron of most of its aircraft, leaving only A Flight, with four Bulldogs and a Wapiti, in operation. The Wapiti was transferred to No. 1 FTS in July, and by the end of the month the squadron's complement of aircraft stood at four Bulldogs and one Moth.

No. 1 Squadron began receiving new Demons in November 1936. In January 1937, it relinquished its Bulldogs to No. 21 Squadron, which was to hold them until they could be transferred to the soon-to-be-formed <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>. By the end of February, No. 1 Squadron's strength was 12 Demons and one Moth, 11 officers and 108 airmen. The unit was redesignated No. 1 (Bomber) Squadron in August 1937. Towards the end of the year, it was plagued by several Demon accidents, resulting in a series of inquiries and a review of RAAF procedures in 1938 by Marshal of the RAF <a href="Edward%20Leonard%20Ellington">Sir Edward Ellington</a>; the so-called Ellington Report and its criticism of air safety standards led to the removal of Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams from his position as Chief of the Air Staff, which he had held since the formation of the Air Force. No. 1 Squadron received the RAAF's first three <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s on 10 July 1939. As the likelihood of war increased, the squadron's role was altered to incorporate reconnaissance as well as bombing, resulting in the transfer out of all Demons and Wirraways and the transfer in from other units of nine <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s on 28–29 August 1939; at the end of the month its personnel comprised nine officers and 122 airmen.

Following the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">outbreak of World War II</a>, No. 1 Squadron's Ansons were tasked with maritime patrol and convoy escort duties. In 1940, the squadron became the RAAF's inaugural <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> unit; it received its first Hudson on 30 March, and by the end of May had transferred out the last of its Ansons and was operating 11 of the new aircraft. Deployed to <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a> to conduct maritime reconnaissance, No. 1 Squadron arrived at <a href="Sembawang%20Air%20Base">Sembawang</a>, Singapore, on 4 July 1940. It relocated to <a href="RAF%20Kota%20Bharu">RAF Kota Bharu</a>, near the Malaya–Thailand border, in August 1941. Two days before the <a href="Malayan%20Campaign">attack on Malaya</a>, its Hudsons spotted the Japanese invasion fleet but, given uncertainty about the ships' destination and instructions to avoid offensive operations until attacks were made against friendly territory, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Robert%20Brooke-Popham">Sir Robert Brooke-Popham</a> did not allow the convoy to be bombed. Shortly after midnight, local time, on the night of 7/8 December, the Japanese force started <a href="Battle%20of%20Kota%20Bharu">landing on the beaches at Kota Bharu</a>, close to the airfield, and from about 02:00, No. 1 Squadron launched a series of assaults on the Japanese forces, becoming the first aircraft to make an attack in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>. The Hudsons sank a Japanese transport ship, the <a href="IJN%20Awazisan%20Maru">IJN "Awazisan Maru"</a>, and damaged two more transports, the "Ayatosan Maru" and "Sakura Maru", for the loss of two Hudsons, an hour before the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. By the end of the day, Japanese ground forces had advanced to the outskirts of the airfield, forcing the squadron's remaining airworthy aircraft to be evacuated to <a href="Sultan%20Haji%20Ahmad%20Shah%20Airport">Kuantan</a>, and from there back to Singapore.

By Christmas Eve 1941, No. 1 Squadron had five serviceable aircraft. Together with <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B8%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 8 Squadron RAAF</a>, also equipped with Hudsons, it was tasked with maritime patrols to the east of Singapore. On 26 January 1942, two of the squadron's Hudsons spotted a Japanese convoy heading for <a href="Endau">Endau</a>, on the east coast of Malaya. It was decided to <a href="Battle%20off%20Endau">attack the convoy</a> with all possible strength, including four Hudsons from No. 1 Squadron and five from No. 8 Squadron, together with obsolete <a href="Vickers%20Vildebeest">Vickers Vildebeest</a> and <a href="Fairey%20Albacore">Fairey Albacore</a> biplanes of <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAF">Nos. 36</a> and <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAF">100 Squadrons RAF</a>, and with what little fighter escort could be found. The convoy was strongly defended by Japanese fighters, and although all nine Hudsons returned to Singapore, several were badly shot up. The rest of the strike force did not fare as well; 11 Vildebeests, two Albacores, two Hudsons (of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B62%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 62 Squadron RAF</a>) and three fighters were lost. By the end of the month, No. 1 Squadron had withdrawn to airfield P.2 on <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, along with several other Commonwealth units including No. 8 Squadron. It continued to attack Japanese bases in Malaya and convoys in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, relocating to Semplak, <a href="Java">Java</a>, in mid-February. At Semplak it took over the Hudsons of No. 8 Squadron and No. 62 Squadron RAF, giving it a strength of 25 aircraft; at one stage it was to be renumbered as an RAF squadron, but this never occurred. Heavily outnumbered by Japanese air units, which raided Allied bases with impunity, No. 1 Squadron suffered heavy losses and was ordered to withdraw its four remaining Hudsons to Australia on 2 March 1942, disbanding soon after. Although 120 of the squadron's personnel were evacuated from Java, 160 men including the commanding officer, Wing Commander Davis, were unable to escape and were taken prisoner by the Japanese; less than half survived captivity.

No. 1 Squadron was re-formed with <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>s on 1 December 1943 at <a href="Menangle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Menangle</a>, New South Wales. By March 1944 it had deployed to <a href="Gould%20Airfield">Gould</a>, Northern Territory, where it was controlled by <a href="No.%2079%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 79 Wing</a> under <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area Command</a>. Its strength at the beginning of the month was some 350 officers and men, and 19 Beauforts. The squadron commenced reconnaissance operations on 20 March, and undertook its first bombing mission on 4 April against <a href="Laut%C3%A9m%20District">Lautem</a>, East Timor. It attacked other targets in <a href="Timor">Timor</a> during May, losing two aircraft. Having undertaken 82 <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s in July, the Beauforts concentrated on maritime reconnaissance from August, using air-to-surface radar during operations from Gould and <a href="Gove%20Airport">Gove</a>. After re-equipping with <a href="De%20Havilland%20Mosquito">Mosquito</a> fighter-bombers at <a href="Kingaroy">Kingaroy</a>, Queensland, in January 1945, the squadron deployed to <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> in May and then <a href="Crown%20colony%20of%20Labuan">Labuan Island</a> in June–July. Now part of <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 (Attack) Wing</a>, it flew only a few missions before the end of the war, losing one Mosquito. No. 1 Squadron returned to Australia in December 1945 and was disbanded at <a href="Narromine">Narromine</a>, New South Wales, on 7 August 1946.

No. 1 Squadron was re-formed as a heavy bomber unit on 23 February 1948, when <a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 12 Squadron</a> was re-designated. Operating <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a>s, it was based at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Station Amberley</a>, Queensland, where it formed part of <a href="No.%2082%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 82 (Bomber) Wing</a>. The wing's aircraft were serviced by <a href="No.%20482%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 482 (Maintenance) Squadron</a>. From July 1950 to July 1958—for the first two-and-a-half years under the auspices of <a href="No.%2090%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 90 (Composite) Wing</a>—it was based in Singapore, flying missions against communist guerrillas during the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>. Tasked by <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">RAF Air Headquarters Malaya</a>, the Lincolns generally conducted <a href="area%20bombing">area bombing</a> missions, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. They operated singly and in formations, sometimes in concert with RAF bombers, and often strafed targets with their machine guns and 20 mm cannon after dropping ordnance. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, as well as their firepower and heavy bomb load. Not having to contend with <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft fire</a>, they flew mainly by day, but No. 1 Squadron also operated by night, the only Commonwealth unit to do so.

The squadron carried out its own day-to-day maintenance in Malaya; the Lincolns were rotated back to Australia for major work. Its original complement of six aircraft was increased to eight after the British <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> requested in February 1951 that Australia augment its bomber force to partly offset the imminent withdrawal of the RAF's Lincolns to <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> in Europe. The squadron was awarded the <a href="Gloucester%20Cup">Gloucester Cup</a> for proficiency in 1950–51 and 1954–55. It suffered no casualties during the campaign but two of its aircraft were written off: one that overshot the landing strip at Tengah in November 1951, and another that crashed into the sea off <a href="Johore">Johore</a> after striking trees on takeoff in January 1957.

Although the original purpose of the bombing campaign in Malaya was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving them out of their bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops. Operation Kingly Pile, which involved two sorties by No. 1 Squadron and one by <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> jet bombers of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B12%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 12 Squadron RAF</a> on 21 February 1956, was considered the most successful of the more than 4,000 missions conducted by the Lincolns, killing at least 14 communist troops. By the time it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, the squadron had dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs—85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency. Its service was recognised with the presentation of a <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">Squadron Standard</a> by the Commander-in-Chief <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">Far East Air Force</a>, Air Marshal <a href="Percy%20Bernard%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Bandon">The Earl of Brandon</a>. Until 2014, the Malayan Emergency had marked the last occasion that the unit took part in combat operations.

No. 1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after returning to Australia. The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly manoeuvrable. It had been procured partly for its capacity to deliver <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s, an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium-to-high-altitude area bombing but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics. No. 1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959–60 and 1960–61. As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers. The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a> supersonic bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its <a href="Variable-sweep%20wing">swing-wing</a> technology. In September 1970, as an interim measure while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No. 1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms</a>, which it operated until June 1973. Although the Phantom had a multi-role capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile. One of No. 1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews.
No. 82 Wing accepted its first F-111Cs in June 1973. The <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Marshal <a href="Charles%20Read%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Read</a>, ordered that the new aircraft be flown with great caution initially, well within operational limits, to minimise the possibility of further damage to its reputation through early attrition. No. 1 Squadron was assigned 12 of the initial 24 aircraft delivered. It was No. 82 Wing's lead strike force, while No. 6 Squadron was primarily tasked with <a href="Operational%20conversion%20unit">crew conversion training</a>. The wing employed a centralised servicing regime, whereby all aircraft and maintenance personnel were held by No. 482 Squadron, which released the F-111s in line with Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons' joint flying program. In February 1981, responsibility for operating-level servicing of the F-111s was transferred to the flying squadrons, which for the first time took direct control of their F-111s. No. 482 Squadron continued to provide intermediate-level servicing, while major upgrades and complex maintenance were carried out by <a href="No.%203%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 3 Aircraft Depot</a>. These two organisations merged in 1992 to form No. 501 Wing, which handed over heavy maintenance of the F-111 to <a href="Boeing%20Australia">Boeing Australia</a> in 2001. Between 1977 and 1993, the RAAF lost seven F-111Cs in crashes. Three of the accidents involved aircraft flown by No. 1 Squadron: in August 1979, January 1986 and September 1993, the last two killing both crew members. In July 1996, No. 1 Squadron took responsibility for aerial reconnaissance using specially modified RF-111Cs previously operated by No. 6 Squadron. This gave No. 1 Squadron five mission types: land strike, maritime strike, close air support, long-range air defence, and reconnaissance. In May 1999 the unit was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency.
Along with its revolutionary variable-sweep wings, the F-111 was equipped with <a href="terrain-following%20radar">terrain-following radar</a> and an escape module that allowed the entire cockpit to be jettisoned in an emergency, instead of individual ejection seats. Its top speed was <a href="Mach%20number">Mach</a> 2.5 and its <a href="combat%20radius">combat radius</a> gave it the capability of reaching targets in Indonesia from bases in northern Australia. Upon delivery in 1973 it was fitted with analogue <a href="avionics">avionics</a> and could only drop <a href="unguided%20bomb">unguided ("dumb") bombs</a>. In its 37 years of service with the RAAF the type went through several upgrades, including the <a href="Pave%20Tack">Pave Tack</a> infra-red and laser-guided precision weapons targeting system, <a href="Harpoon%20%28missile%29">Harpoon</a> anti-shipping missiles, and advanced digital avionics. Alan Stephens, in the official history of the post-war Air Force, described the F-111 as "the region's pre-eminent strike aircraft" and the RAAF's most important acquisition. The closest they came to being used in anger, though, was during Australian-led <a href="INTERFET">INTERFET</a> operations in <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> commencing in September 1999. Both F-111 squadrons were deployed to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Tindal">RAAF Base Tindal</a>, Northern Territory, to support the international forces in case of action by the Indonesian military, and remained there until December; six of No. 1 Squadron's aircraft and approximately 100 personnel were involved. From 20 September, when INTERFET forces began to arrive in East Timor, the F-111s were maintained at a high level of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated. As it happened, INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance by RF-111Cs from 5 November through 9 December.
In 2007, the Australian government decided to retire the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 <a href="Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets</a> as an interim replacement, pending the arrival of the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning</a> then being developed. The F-111 fleet was considered to be at risk due to fatigue, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time. No. 1 Squadron ceased operating the F-111 in January 2009, in preparation for converting to the Super Hornet. Former F-111 aircrew, familiar with side-by-side seating and a different performance envelope, found conversion more challenging than pilots experienced in the RAAF's <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> fighters, which shared many characteristics with the newer model. No. 1 Squadron re-equipped between 26 March 2010 and 21 October 2011, making it the first Australian unit, and the first squadron outside the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. It became operational with its new aircraft on 8 December 2011. The multi-role Super Hornet allowed No. 1 Squadron to augment its previous offensive strike role with an air-to-air combat function. The RAAF attained <a href="full%20operational%20capability">full operational capability</a> with the Super Hornet in December 2012.

On 14 September 2014, the Federal government committed to deploying up to eight Super Hornets of No. 1 Squadron to <a href="Al%20Minhad%20Air%20Base">Al Minhad Air Base</a> in the United Arab Emirates, as part of the <a href="Operation%20Okra">Australian Air Task Group</a> joining the <a href="Military%20intervention%20against%20ISIL">coalition against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> (ISIL) forces in Iraq. Aircraft from the squadron conducted their first mission over Iraq on 5 October, and their first strike four days later. According to the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a>, as of 20 December 2014 the Super Hornets had flown over 180 sorties, dropped 113 weapons, and destroyed 36 ISIL targets, damaging another six. In March 2015, having flown almost 3,000 hours in over 400 missions, the detachment was replaced by six F/A-18As from <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 Squadron</a>. A detachment of No. 1 Squadron was again to deployed to Al Minhad as part of the Australian Air Task Group in May 2017, replacing the legacy Hornets of No. 77 Squadron deployed prior. The Super Hornets flew the last strike mission of their rotation, and the last of 2,700 sorties by the Air Task Group Hornets, on 14 January 2018. In April, No. 1 Squadron was awarded the 2017 Gloucester Cup.

In May 2013, the Federal government announced plans to purchase 12 <a href="Boeing%20EA-18G%20Growler">Boeing EA-18G Growler</a>s to supplement the Super Hornet fleet. No. 6 Squadron is expected to begin taking delivery of the Growlers in 2017, at which point its Super Hornets will be transferred to No. 1 Squadron. In April 2014, the government announced the purchase of 58 F-35s in addition to 14 already ordered, for the express purpose of replacing the 71 "classic" Hornets of Nos. 3, 75 and <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">77 Squadrons</a> and <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit</a>. A government decision on whether to purchase a further 28 F-35s, to be based at Amberley, will depend on how long the Super Hornets are to be retained. According to "<a href="Australian%20Aviation%20%28magazine%29">Australian Aviation</a>", continuing delays to the F-35 program have increased the likelihood that the Super Hornets of Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons will, rather than being disposed of early as originally planned, continue to be operated by the RAAF for their full service life of over 20 years.

She subsequently enrolled at the <a href="Indira%20Gandhi%20National%20Open%20University">Indira Gandhi National Open University</a> for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career.
Padukone has admitted to being socially awkward as a child and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, "I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep." Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the <a href="Education%20in%20India">tenth grade</a>, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of <a href="Prasad%20Bidapa">Prasad Bidapa</a>.

Early in her career, Padukone gained recognition with a television commercial for the soap <a href="Liril">Liril</a> and modelled for various other brands and products. In 2005, she made her <a href="runway%20%28fashion%29">runway</a> debut at the <a href="Lakme%20Fashion%20Week">Lakme Fashion Week</a> for designer <a href="Suneet%20Varma">Suneet Varma</a> and won the "Model of the Year" award at the <a href="Kingfisher%20%28beer%29">Kingfisher</a> Fashion Awards. Padukone's fame increased when she appeared in a highly popular print campaign for the 2006 <a href="Kingfisher%20Calendar">Kingfisher Calendar</a>; the designer <a href="Wendell%20Rodricks">Wendell Rodricks</a> commented, "Since <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a>, we haven't had a girl as beautiful and fresh." Rodricks had spotted her at a Ganjam jewellery class he was teaching and signed her up with the Matrix agency. At the age of 21, Padukone relocated to <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> and stayed at her aunt's home. That year, she gained wider recognition by featuring in the music video for <a href="Himesh%20Reshammiya">Himesh Reshammiya</a>'s song "<a href="Aap%20Kaa%20Surroor%20%28album%29%23Naam%20Hai%20Tera">Naam Hai Tera</a>."

Padukone soon began to receive offers for film roles. Believing herself to be too inexperienced as an actor, she instead enrolled for a course at <a href="Anupam%20Kher">Anupam Kher</a>'s film academy. Following much media speculation, the director <a href="Farah%20Khan">Farah Khan</a>, who had noticed her in Reshammiya's music video, made the decision to cast her for a role in "<a href="Happy%20New%20Year%20%282014%20film%29">Happy New Year</a>".

Padukone announced in 2006 that she would make her film debut with "<a href="Aishwarya%20%28film%29">Aishwarya</a>", a <a href="Cinema%20of%20Karnataka">Kannada film</a> directed by <a href="Indrajit%20Lankesh">Indrajit Lankesh</a>. The romantic comedy was a remake of the <a href="Cinema%20of%20Andhra%20Pradesh">Telugu film</a> "<a href="Manmadhudu">Manmadhudu</a>", and she was cast in the title role opposite the actor <a href="Upendra%20%28actor%29">Upendra</a>. The film proved to be a major commercial success. RG Vijayasarathy of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> was appreciative of Padukone's screen presence but added that "she needs to work on her emotional scenes."

By the end of 2006, Farah Khan's "Happy New Year" was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> melodrama "<a href="Om%20Shanti%20Om">Om Shanti Om</a>" (2007). Set against the backdrop of the <a href="Bollywood">Hindi film industry</a>, the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved and is reincarnated to avenge her death. <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual rolesShantipriya, a leading actress of the 1970s, and later as Sandy, an aspiring actress. She said, "I've grown up watching [Shah Rukh] and always admired him so much. To get to work with him ... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him." In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses <a href="Helen%20%28actress%29">Helen</a> and <a href="Hema%20Malini">Hema Malini</a> to study their body language, which she felt "were more graceful" and "completely different from today's actors." However, her voice was dubbed by the voice artist <a href="Mona%20Ghosh%20Shetty">Mona Ghosh Shetty</a>. For one of the songs in the film, "Dhoom Taana,” Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to <a href="Dorling%20Kindersley">Dorling Kindersley</a>, "mesmeriz[ed] audiences" by using "<a href="List%20of%20mudras%20%28dance%29">hasta mudras</a>" (hand gestures). "Om Shanti Om" was a commercial success, and emerged as the <a href="List%20of%20Bollywood%20films%20of%202007">highest-grossing film of the year</a>, with a global revenue of . <a href="Taran%20Adarsh">Taran Adarsh</a> of the entertainment portal <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> reviewed, "Deepika has all it takes to be a top starthe personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too. Standing in the same frame as [Shah Rukh] and getting it right is no small achievement. She comes as a whiff of fresh air!" At the annual <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a> ceremony, Padukone was awarded the <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Female%20Debut%20Award">Best Female Debut Award</a> and received her first nomination in the <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Actress%20Award">Best Actress</a> category.
Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of "Om Shanti Om" proved a <a href="breakthrough%20role">breakthrough</a> for Padukone. She followed this success with the role of Gayatri (one of star <a href="Ranbir%20Kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor</a>'s love interests), a feisty student in Australia who moonlights as a cab driver in <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a>' romantic comedy "<a href="Bachna%20Ae%20Haseeno">Bachna Ae Haseeno</a>" (2008). The film was a financial success, but <a href="Namrata%20Joshi">Namrata Joshi</a> of "<a href="Outlook%20%28magazine%29">Outlook</a>" wrote that Padukone's performance was disappointing; "She is mannequin-like and utterly lacks fire and zing."

Padukone's first release of 2009 came alongside <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> in the <a href="Nikhil%20Advani">Nikhil Advani</a>-directed <a href="Kung%20fu%20film">kung fu</a> comedy "<a href="Chandni%20Chowk%20To%20China">Chandni Chowk To China</a>", in which she portrayed the dual roles of Indian-Chinese twin sisters Sakhi and Suzy. Produced by <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, it had one of the widest international releases ever given to an Indian film. Padukone learned the Japanese martial art form of <a href="jujutsu">jujutsu</a> and performed her stunts without the use of a body double. Despite the hype, "Chandni Chowk To China" emerged as a major financial failure with worldwide earnings of on a budget of . Film critics were generally disappointed with the picture and Padukone's performance; Justin Trout of "<a href="Orlando%20Weekly">Orlando Weekly</a>" noted, "She is so wasted in "Chandni Chowk", my mind often wandered back to "Om Shanti Om" during her scenes, possibly as a defense mechanism."

That same year, Padukone featured in an <a href="item%20number">item number</a> (for a song called "Love Mera Hit Hit") in the drama "<a href="Billu">Billu</a>", following which she appeared alongside <a href="Saif%20Ali%20Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a> in the <a href="romantic%20drama">romantic drama</a> "<a href="Love%20Aaj%20Kal">Love Aaj Kal</a>" from the writer-director <a href="Imtiaz%20Ali%20%28director%29">Imtiaz Ali</a>. The film documented the changing value of relationships among the youth and had Padukone play the part of Meera Pandit, a head-strong <a href="career%20woman">career woman</a>. With a worldwide gross of , "Love Aaj Kal" proved to be the <a href="List%20of%20Bollywood%20films%20of%202009">third highest-grossing film of 2009</a>. Aniruddha Guha of "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" said that Padukone "delivers the best of her four performances so far" and <a href="Nikhat%20Kazmi">Nikhat Kazmi</a> of "The Times of India" mentioned her as "definitive and strong." At the <a href="55th%20Filmfare%20Awards">55th Filmfare Awards</a> Padukone received a nomination for Best Actress.

Padukone had five film releases in 2010. Her first role was in Vijay Lalwani's <a href="psychological%20thriller">psychological thriller</a> "<a href="Karthik%20Calling%20Karthik">Karthik Calling Karthik</a>", where Padukone was cast as the supportive girlfriend of a depressed man (played by <a href="Farhan%20Akhtar">Farhan Akhtar</a>) who goes through a series of changes after receiving mysterious phone calls every morning. Derek Elley of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" found the film to be "thinly plotted" but added that "the uncomplicated ingenuousness of Padukone ... helps make the tall tale convincing." Commercially, the film performed poorly. Her most economically profitable film that year was <a href="Sajid%20Khan">Sajid Khan</a>'s -grossing comedy film "<a href="Housefull%20%282010%20film%29">Housefull</a>" in which she featured alongside an <a href="ensemble%20cast">ensemble cast</a> including Akshay Kumar, <a href="Ritesh%20Deshmukh">Ritesh Deshmukh</a>, <a href="Lara%20Dutta">Lara Dutta</a>, <a href="Arjun%20Rampal">Arjun Rampal</a>, <a href="Jiah%20Khan">Jiah Khan</a>, and <a href="Boman%20Irani">Boman Irani</a>. <a href="Raja%20Sen">Raja Sen</a> described the film as a "festival of bad acting" and attributed Padukone's poor performance to her "plasticky expressions."
<a href="Pradeep%20Sarkar">Pradeep Sarkar</a>'s drama "<a href="Lafangey%20Parindey">Lafangey Parindey</a>" (2010) saw Padukone star opposite <a href="Neil%20Nitin%20Mukesh">Neil Nitin Mukesh</a> in the role of Pinky Palkar, a blind girl determined to win a skating competition. In preparation for her role, she observed the interactions of blind people and rehearsed scenes while blindfolded. Writing for "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", Sudhish Kamath was particularly impressed by Padukone and wrote that she "exercises considerable restraint" in playing her part. Later that year, "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" published that the film helped change people's perception of Padukone, with focus directed on her acting prowess rather than her appearance. Her next role was opposite <a href="Imran%20Khan%20%28Bollywood%20actor%29">Imran Khan</a> in the <a href="Danish%20Aslam">Danish Aslam</a>-directed romantic comedy "<a href="Break%20Ke%20Baad">Break Ke Baad</a>". <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a>'s <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> found the film to be "reasonably engaging" and noted that it was "watchable largely for the performance of its leading lady." Both "Lafangey Parindey" and "Break Ke Baad" underperformed at the box office.

Padukone's final release of 2010 was <a href="Ashutosh%20Gowarikar">Ashutosh Gowarikar</a>'s <a href="Historical%20drama%20film">period film</a> "<a href="Khelein%20Hum%20Jee%20Jaan%20Sey">Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey</a>" opposite <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a>. Based on the book "<a href="Do%20and%20Die">Do and Die</a>" by Manini Chatterjee, the film is a retelling of the 1930 <a href="Chittagong%20armoury%20raid">Chittagong armoury raid</a>. Bachchan featured as the revolutionary leader <a href="Surya%20Sen">Surya Sen</a> and Padukone played <a href="Kalpana%20Dutta">Kalpana Dutta</a>, his confidante. Padukone said that she did not research for the role as there were "hardly ... any reference points as to what Kalpana looked like other than a few photos," and relied completely on Gowarikar's direction. A review published in "<a href="The%20Telegraph%20%28UK%29">The Telegraph</a>" was appreciative of Padukone's portrayal, and the film received a generally positive critical reception. Despite this, it was a major commercial disappointment.

Padukone began 2011 with an item number in <a href="Rohan%20Sippy">Rohan Sippy</a>'s "<a href="Dum%20Maaro%20Dum%20%28film%29">Dum Maaro Dum</a>". The song was a remixed version of the iconic song "<a href="Dum%20Maro%20Dum%20%28song%29">Dum Maro Dum</a>," from the 1971 film "<a href="Hare%20Rama%20Hare%20Krishna%20%281971%20film%29">Hare Rama Hare Krishna</a>", which featured <a href="Zeenat%20Aman">Zeenat Aman</a>. Padukone referred to it as "the wildest song any actress has done;" the song's "suggestive lyrics" and "raunchy moves" attracted controversy including a court case for indecency. Her next film was <a href="Prakash%20Jha">Prakash Jha</a>'s socio-political drama "<a href="Aarakshan">Aarakshan</a>", co-starring <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, Saif Ali Khan, <a href="Manoj%20Bajpayee">Manoj Bajpayee</a> and <a href="Prateik%20Babbar">Prateik Babbar</a>, which dealt with the political issue of <a href="Reservation%20in%20India">caste-based reservations in India</a>. Trade journalists had high expectations for the film which ultimately flopped at the box office. Critical reaction was largely negative, though <a href="Pratim%20D.%20Gupta">Pratim D. Gupta</a> mentioned Padukone as the most "refreshing thing about [the] movie." Her final appearance that year was in Rohit Dhawan's comedy-drama "<a href="Desi%20Boyz">Desi Boyz</a>" alongside Akshay Kumar, <a href="John%20Abraham%20%28actor%29">John Abraham</a> and <a href="Chitrangada%20Singh">Chitrangada Singh</a>, a role that failed to propel her career forward. The series of poorly received films led critics to perceive that Padukone had "[lost] her sparkle."

In an interview for "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>", Padukone said that her starring role in the 2012 <a href="Homi%20Adajania">Homi Adajania</a>-directed romantic comedy "<a href="Cocktail%20%282012%20film%29">Cocktail</a>" marked a significant turning point in her career. Raja Sen of Rediff.com opined that she had successfully proved to be a "stunning girl who can also act." Set in London, "Cocktail" tells the story of a software engineer (played by Saif Ali Khan) and his relationship with two temperamentally different womenan impulsive party girl (Veronica, played by Padukone) and a submissive <a href="girl%20next%20door">girl next door</a> (Meera, played by <a href="Diana%20Penty">Diana Penty</a>). During the script narration, the producer Dinesh Vijan offered Padukone the choice of which woman to play; she decided on Veronica to expand her horizons as an actress. Portraying the role was a creative and physical challenge for her, and to achieve the physical requirements of her character she exercised extensively and followed a rigorous diet. Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but particularly praised Padukone's performance; Devesh Sharma of "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" credited her as the "soul of the film" and wrote that she "excels in every scene, whether as a material girl who enjoys sex, drugs and rock and roll or as the jealousy ridden girl out to destroy herself." "Cocktail" earned Padukone Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Filmfare, <a href="Screen%20Award">Screen</a>, and <a href="IIFA%20Awards">IIFA</a>. The film proved to be a box office hit as well.

In 2013, Padukone established herself as a leading actress of contemporary Hindi cinema by featuring in four of the <a href="List%20of%20Bollywood%20films%20of%202013">top-grossing productions of the year</a>. She collaborated with Saif Ali Khan for the fourth time (alongside John Abraham and <a href="Jacqueline%20Fernandez">Jacqueline Fernandez</a>) in <a href="Abbas-Mustan">Abbas-Mustan</a>'s "<a href="Race%202">Race 2</a>", an ensemble action thriller that served as a sequel to "<a href="Race%20%282008%20film%29">Race</a>" (2008). The film received predominantly negative reviews, but with a total collection of , it proved to be a commercial success. In a scathing review, Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote that both Padukone and Fernandez "strut around like wound-up automatons that are all decked-up but have nowhere to go."
<a href="Ayan%20Mukerji">Ayan Mukerji</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Yeh%20Jawaani%20Hai%20Deewani">Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</a>" was Padukone's next film release. Co-starring opposite Ranbir Kapoor, she was cast as Naina Talwar, a "shy wallflower," which marked a departure from the glamorous characters that she had a reputation for portraying. Film critics praised her performance, though their response to the film was mixed. Raja Sen thought that the film "lacked a good story" but added that Padukone "acts within herself and eschews exaggeration, and the results are impressive ... This may be her most self-aware performance so far". The pairing of Padukone with her former boyfriend was anticipated, and the film emerged as a major commercial success. Her next appearance was opposite Shah Rukh Khan in <a href="Rohit%20Shetty">Rohit Shetty</a>'s action-comedy film "<a href="Chennai%20Express">Chennai Express</a>". She played Meenalochini Azhagusundaram, a <a href="Tamil%20people">Tamil girl</a> on the run from her father (a local <a href="boss%20%28crime%29">don</a>), which required that she adopt a Tamil accent. Critical opinion on her accent was mixed, but her performance received praise; film critic Aseem Chhabra wrote, "Padukone is delightful in the filmbeautiful, smiling, and often a lot more playful and funny than Khan." "Chennai Express" earned over to emerge as Padukone's highest-grossing release to that point, and alongside "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani" it ranks among the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films">highest-grossing Indian films</a> of all time.

Padukone next played opposite <a href="Ranveer%20Singh">Ranveer Singh</a> in "<a href="Goliyon%20Ki%20Raasleela%20Ram-Leela">Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela</a>", an adaptation of the <a href="Shakespearean%20tragedy">Shakespearean tragedy</a> of "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>" from director <a href="Sanjay%20Leela%20Bhansali">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a>. Her role was Leela, a <a href="Gujarati%20people">Gujarati girl</a> based on the character of <a href="Juliet">Juliet</a>. Initially titled "Ram-Leela", the film's title was changed after a court case was registered against Bhansali, Padukone, and Singh for "offending the religious sentiments" of the Hindu community by showcasing sex and violence under a title that referred to the life of <a href="Rama">Rama</a>. "Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela" released among protests across several states in India, but was generally well received by critics. Meena Iyer of "The Times of India" mentioned Padukone as "breathtaking", and writing for "<a href="Deccan%20Chronicle">Deccan Chronicle</a>", <a href="Khalid%20Mohamed">Khalid Mohamed</a> concluded that "it's Deepika Padukone whom the film belongs to. Looking drop dead gorgeous and going at her part with a wallop, she's the prime asset of "Ram-Leela"." The film earned worldwide, making it Padukone's fourth consecutive success of the year. Her performances in "Chennai Express" and "Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela" won her several awards, including the <a href="Screen%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Screen Award for Best Actress</a> for both films and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the latter.

In 2014, Padukone featured opposite <a href="Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a> in the <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil film</a> "<a href="Kochadaiiyaan">Kochadaiiyaan</a>", a period drama that was shot using <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> technology. She was paid for two days worth of work in it. In Homi Adajania's widely praised satire "<a href="Finding%20Fanny">Finding Fanny</a>", Padukone played a young widow who takes a road trip with her dysfunctional friends (played by <a href="Arjun%20Kapoor">Arjun Kapoor</a>, <a href="Naseeruddin%20Shah">Naseeruddin Shah</a>, <a href="Dimple%20Kapadia">Dimple Kapadia</a> and <a href="Pankaj%20Kapur">Pankaj Kapur</a>) in search of a woman named Fanny. The film was screened at the <a href="19th%20Busan%20International%20Film%20Festival">19th Busan International Film Festival</a>; critic Anuj Kumar of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" wrote that Padukone successfully "takes off the fineries of Bollywood and you can sense the freedom from baggage in her performance". Later that year, she starred opposite Shah Rukh Khan for the third time in Farah Khan's renewal of "Happy New Year". She played a bar dancer who trains a group of underachievers for a dance competition. Sanjukta Sharma of "<a href="Mint%20%28newspaper%29">Mint</a>" found her role to be of minimal importance that required her only to be "a pretty thing to be laughed at and pitied", but the film became one of her most successful, earning over worldwide.

Following an appearance in Homi Adajania's online video on <a href="Feminism%20in%20India">feminism</a>, entitled "My Choice", Padukone took on the role of a headstrong <a href="Bengali%20people">Bengali</a> architect who cares for her hypochondriac father (played by Amitabh Bachchan), in <a href="Shoojit%20Sircar">Shoojit Sircar</a>'s comedy-drama "<a href="Piku">Piku</a>" (2015). She was drawn to the depiction of a realistic father-daughter bond, which she thought was rare in Hindi cinema. Reviews for the film were positive; Tanmaya Nanda of "<a href="Business%20Standard">Business Standard</a>" praised the film's feminist tone, and wrote that Padukone proves "what she is capable of when given something more to do than look pretty and be the crazy-dance girl at parties". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee opined that she "holds "Piku" together with a restrained star turn". With a worldwide gross of over , "Piku" emerged as a box office hit, and garnered Padukone several awards, including second Best Actress awards at Filmfare and Screen.

Later in 2015, Padukone played the part of a businessperson who helps Ranbir Kapoor's character overcome his conflicts in Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama "<a href="Tamasha%20%282015%20film%29">Tamasha</a>". Despite poor financial returns, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com named Padukone's performance as the best by an actress that year, writing that she "is so potent in "Tamasha", it's almost as if you can hear her heartbeat across the screen". In her final release of 2015, Padukone reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh in "<a href="Bajirao%20Mastani">Bajirao Mastani</a>", a historical drama about a tragic extramarital affair. Singh was cast as the <a href="maratha">maratha</a> general <a href="Bajirao%20I">Bajirao I</a>, while <a href="Priyanka%20Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> and Padukone featured as his first and second wife, respectively. To play the warrior-princess <a href="Mastani">Mastani</a>, Padukone learnt sword-fighting, horse-riding, and the martial art form of <a href="kalaripayattu">kalaripayattu</a>. With a revenue of over , "Bajirao Mastani" proved to be the <a href="List%20of%20Bollywood%20films%20of%202015">fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year</a>. <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> found Padukone "riveting", but <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> thought that she was "way too subtle and silken, and not steely enough". The film was showcased at the <a href="International%20Film%20Festival%20of%20India">International Film Festival of India</a>; at the <a href="61st%20Filmfare%20Awards">61st Filmfare Awards</a>, "Bajirao Mastani" was named <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">Best Film</a> and Padukone received her second Best Actress nomination in that year.

Critical reception of the film was mixed. Tirdad Derakhshani of "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>" termed the film a "repetitious heap of remarkably tedious CGI-enhanced action scenes" and thought that Padukone's talent was wasted in it. Conversely, Frank Scheck of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" believed that she had successfully "outclassed" Diesel to "practically [steal] the film". The film earned over US$345 million worldwide, a majority of which came from the Chinese box office. Padukone received three nominations at the <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Awards">Teen Choice Awards</a> and followed it with an item number in the romantic drama "<a href="Raabta%20%28film%29">Raabta</a>".

She was challenged by the need to convey her character's courage through silence and considered it to be the most emotionally exhausting role of her career. She read history books on the era and researched the various historical depictions of Padmavati. <a href="Saffron%20terror">Right-wing Hindu groups</a> speculated that the film portrayed a romantic liaison between Padmavati and Khilji; they protested violently and placed a bounty to behead Padukone and Bhansali. Following a deferment in release, the film was cleared for exhibition after several modifications were made to it. <a href="Anna%20M.%20M.%20Vetticad">Anna M. M. Vetticad</a> of "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>" criticised the film's glorification of "jauhar", but credited Padukone for managing to "eke something out of the stereotype-ridden writing". Ankur Pathak of "<a href="HuffPost">HuffPost</a>" too took note of the film's regressive theme but thought that Padukone had played her part with "restrained elegance".

She has also committed to star as the <a href="acid%20throwing">acid attack</a> survivor <a href="Laxmi%20Agarwal">Laxmi Agarwal</a> in "<a href="Chhapaak">Chhapaak</a>", a biopic by <a href="Meghna%20Gulzar">Meghna Gulzar</a>, which will mark Padukone's first production venture.

Padukone shares a close bond with her family, and visits them regularly in her hometown of Bangalore. She lives by herself in <a href="Prabhadevi">Prabhadevi</a>, a neighbourhood in Mumbai, and admits to missing the presence of her family there. She says, "I miss them, but luckily I have a life of my own, which keeps me from getting homesick. I wouldn't want them to uproot their lives from Bengaluru just to be with me." A practicing <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>, Padukone considers religion to be an important aspect of her life and makes frequent visits to <a href="Hindu%20temple">temples</a> and other religious shrines.

While filming "Bachna Ae Haseeno" in 2008, Padukone began a romantic relationship with co-star Ranbir Kapoor. She spoke openly about the relationship and sported a tattoo of his initials on the nape of her neck. She has said that the relationship had a profound effect on her, transforming her into a more confident and social person. The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that this had occurred in November 2008, although Padukone had stated that she had no plans to marry within the next five years. The couple broke up a year later; she professed in an interview to feeling betrayed for a long time. In a 2010 interview, Padukone accused him of infidelity, and Kapoor later admitted to it. They reconciled their friendship while working on "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani". Padukone subsequently became reticent to discuss her personal life, but in 2017, she fondly spoke of her relationship with her frequent co-star <a href="Ranveer%20Singh">Ranveer Singh</a>. In November 2018, the couple married in traditional Konkani and Sindhi ceremonies at <a href="Lake%20Como">Lake Como</a>, Italy.
In addition to acting, Padukone has written opinion columns and has been involved with women's health and fitness magazines. She has also supported charitable organisations, and has performed for stage shows. In 2009, she was hired by "Hindustan Times" to write weekly columns for their lifestyle section; through these columns she interacted with her fans and passed details of her personal and professional life. That year, she participated in the <a href="World%2010K%20Bangalore">World 10K Bangalore</a> marathon, which raised in support of 81 NGOs. In 2010, Padukone adopted the <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtrian</a> village of <a href="Ambegaon">Ambegaon</a> as part of NDTV's Greenathon Campaign, to provide the village with a regular supply of electricity. She visited Indian "<a href="jawans">jawans</a>" (troops) in <a href="Jammu">Jammu</a>, for an <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28India%29">Independence Day</a> special episode of NDTV's reality show "Jai Jawaan".

Padukone took part in the opening ceremony of the <a href="2010%20Indian%20Premier%20League">third season of the Indian Premier League</a> at the <a href="DY%20Patil%20Stadium">DY Patil Stadium</a> in <a href="Navi%20Mumbai">Navi Mumbai</a>. Three years later, she performed alongside Shah Rukh Khan, <a href="Katrina%20Kaif">Katrina Kaif</a>, and <a href="Pitbull%20%28rapper%29">Pitbull</a> for the <a href="2013%20Indian%20Premier%20League">sixth edition</a> of the Indian Premier League. In 2014, she participated in a concert tour across North America, entitled "SLAM! The Tour", in which she performed alongside her co-stars from "Happy New Year". Padukone has also been involved with the <a href="Olympic%20Gold%20Quest">Olympic Gold Quest</a> team, established by her father and <a href="Geet%20Sethi">Geet Sethi</a> to support Indian athletes at the Olympic Games, along with sports personalities such as <a href="Leander%20Paes">Leander Paes</a> and <a href="Viswanathan%20Anand">Viswanathan Anand</a> and several other actors. In 2013, she launched her own line of clothing for women, in association with the retail chain <a href="PVH%20%28company%29">Van Heusen</a>. Two years later, Padukone collaborated with the fashion portal <a href="Myntra">Myntra</a> to launch another line under her brand "All About You". In 2019, she was appointed as the chairperson of the <a href="Mumbai%20Academy%20of%20the%20Moving%20Image">Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image</a>.

Padukone has also been outspoken on issues such as feminism and has said, "New feminism isn't about being aggressive; it's about reaching the top yet being soft. It's about being you — feminine, strong and full of will power.” In a 2015 interview, Padukone spoke about her personal experience of overcoming depression, and in October that year she formed a foundation to create awareness on mental health in India, named <a href="The%20Live%20Love%20Laugh%20Foundation">The Live Love Laugh Foundation</a>. The following year, she launched a campaign named More Than Just Sad to assist general physicians in their treatment of patients suffering from depression or anxiety. Also in 2016, the foundation teamed with Facebook and the <a href="AASRA">AASRA</a> organisation to launch multilingual tools and educational resources in Facebook's networking site to support people with suicidal tendencies. Padukone became the brand ambassador for the NGO <a href="Indian%20Psychiatric%20Society">Indian Psychiatric Society</a> and on her foundation's first anniversary, the two organisations collaborated to launch the video and poster campaign #DobaraPoocho dedicated to victims and survivors of depression.

The journalist <a href="Vir%20Sanghvi">Vir Sanghvi</a>, in 2013, described Padukone as "strong, someone who makes up her own mind, [and] has motivation within herself." She is particularly known in the media as a professional, disciplined performer, whose "work takes precedence over everything else." A reviewer for Rediff.com described her personality as "simple," "grounded," and "accessible," and wrote, "She takes criticism in her stride, acknowledges her limitations and strives to work hard at getting better. She handles praise with equal composure." Ayan Mukerji (the director of "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani") considers her to be "a woman who will flirt with you but you will love to take her home to meet your mom as well." Padukone has maintained a Twitter account since 2010, and launched an official Facebook page in 2013. She is the most followed Asian woman on Twitter.

Padukone is considered among the most popular and high-profile celebrities in India. Analysing her career, <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> published that after making a successful debut with "Om Shanti Om", she featured in a series of films for which critics labelled her as "wooden" and "mocked her accent." "The Indian Express" added, "Not too long ago after a few unwise script calls and the public blow up of her high profile relationship with Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika was written off. Credit to her much touted professionalism, dedication, discipline and perseverance that she bounced back." Following the success of "Cocktail", "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani", and "Chennai Express", several media publications began crediting her as the most successful contemporary actress in India. In 2017, "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" featured her among the nation's 50 most powerful people. The global edition of "Forbes" ranked her as the tenth highest-paid actress in the world in 2016 and in 2018, the magazine ranked her as the highest-earning woman celebrity in India. From 2014–2016 and in 2018, she was the highest ranked woman on the Indian edition of "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" "<a href="Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a>" (a list based on the income and popularity of celebrities), peaking at the fourth position in 2018 with an estimated annual earning of over . Also in 2018, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine named Padukone one of the <a href="Time%20100">100 most influential people in the world</a>, "Variety" featured her in their listing of the 50 most impactful women in the world, and the market research firm <a href="YouGov">YouGov</a> named her the world's thirteenth most admired woman.

Padukone is considered a sex symbol and style icon in India – the media cites her figure, height , smile, and eyes as her distinctive physical features. The actress ranks high on various listings of the most attractive Indian celebrities. In 2008, she topped "<a href="Maxim%20%28India%29">Indian "Maxim"</a>"s "Hot 100" list, and in 2012, she was named "India's Most Beautiful Woman" by the Indian edition of "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine. Padukone has frequently featured in "The Times of India"s listing of the "Most Desirable Woman", topping the list in 2012 and 2013. In 2010 and 2014, she was named the "World's Sexiest Woman" by the Indian edition of "<a href="FHM%20%28India%29">FHM</a>". and she was selected by the UK magazine "<a href="Eastern%20Eye">Eastern Eye</a>" as the "Sexiest Asian Woman" in 2016 and 2018. Taking note of her dress sense, "Filmfare" credited her as one of the "few actresses who experiments with colours, cuts and silhouettes." In the fitness book "The Four-Week Countdown Diet", the actress was cited by Namita Jain as "the ultimate role model for a healthy, fit and active lifestyle."

Padukone is an active celebrity endorser for several brands and products, including <a href="Tissot">Tissot</a>, <a href="Maybelline">Maybelline</a>, <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>, and <a href="L%27Oreal%20Paris">L'Oreal Paris</a>, among others. In 2014, "Business Standard" reported that Padukone earned to per endorsement deal and <a href="TAM%20Media%20Research">TAM AdEX</a> named Padukone the most visible face on television in India that year. In 2016, <a href="Duff%20%26amp%3B%20Phelps">Duff & Phelps</a> estimated her brand value to be US$86 million, the third highest of Indian celebrities.

Padukone has been the recipient of three <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>: Best Female Debut for "Om Shanti Om" (2007), and two Best Actress awards for "Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela" (2013) and "Piku" (2015).

Heterodontosaurus

Heterodontosaurus is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="heterodontosaurid">heterodontosaurid</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived during the <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Early Jurassic</a>, 200–190 million years ago. Its only known member <a href="species">species</a>, Heterodontosaurus tucki, was named in 1962 based on a skull discovered in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. The genus name means "different toothed lizard", in reference to its unusual, <a href="heterodont">heterodont</a> dentition; the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> honors G. C. Tuck, who supported the discoverers. Further specimens have since been found, including an almost complete skeleton in 1966.

Though it was a small dinosaur, "Heterodontosaurus" was one of the largest members of its <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, reaching between and possibly in length, and weighing between . The body was short with a long tail. The five-fingered forelimbs were long and relatively robust, whereas the hind-limbs were long, slender, and had four toes. The skull was elongated, narrow, and triangular when viewed from the side. The front of the jaws were covered in a <a href="keratinous">horny</a> beak. It had three types of teeth; in the upper jaw, small, <a href="incisor">incisor</a>-like teeth were followed by long, <a href="Canine%20tooth">canine</a>-like tusks. A gap divided the tusks from the chisel-like cheek-teeth.

"Heterodontosaurus" is the eponymous and best-known member of the family Heterodontosauridae. This family is considered one of the most primitive or basal groups within the order of <a href="ornithischian">ornithischian</a> dinosaurs. In spite of the large tusks, "Heterodontosaurus" is thought to have been <a href="herbivory">herbivorous</a>, or at least <a href="omnivory">omnivorous</a>. Though it was formerly thought to have been capable of <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedal locomotion</a>, it is now thought to have been <a href="Bipedalism">bipedal</a>. <a href="Polyphyodont">Tooth replacement</a> was sporadic and not continuous, unlike its relatives. At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same <a href="geological%20formation">geological formation</a>s as "Heterodontosaurus".

"Heterodontosaurus" was a small dinosaur. The most complete skeleton, SAM-PK-K1332, belonged to an animal measuring about in length. Its weight was variously estimated at , , and in separate studies. The closure of <a href="vertebral">vertebral</a> <a href="Suture%20%28anatomy%29">sutures</a> on the skeleton indicates that the specimen was an adult, and probably fully grown. A second specimen, consisting of an incomplete skull, indicates that "Heterodontosaurus" could have grown substantially larger – up to a length of and with a body mass of nearly . The reason for the size difference between the two specimens is unclear, and might reflect variability within a single species, <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, or the presence of two separate species. The size of this dinosaur has been compared to that of a <a href="Turkey%20%28bird%29">turkey</a>. "Heterodontosaurus" was amongst the largest known members of the family <a href="Heterodontosauridae">Heterodontosauridae</a>. The family contains some of the smallest known <a href="ornithischian">ornithischian</a> dinosaurs – the North American "<a href="Fruitadens">Fruitadens</a>", for example, reached a length of only .

The neck consisted of nine <a href="cervical%20vertebra">cervical vertebra</a>e, which would have formed an S-shaped curve, as indicated by the shape of the vertebral bodies in the side view of the skeleton. The vertebral bodies of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a <a href="parallelogram">parallelogram</a>, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a <a href="trapezoid">trapezoid</a> shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused sacral vertebrae. The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably consisted of 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified <a href="tendons">tendons</a>, beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of "Heterodontosaurus" lacked ossified tendons, and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> and a <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubis</a> which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians.

The forelimbs were robustly built and proportionally long, measuring 70% of the length of the hind limbs. The <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> of the forearm measured 70% of the length of the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (forearm bone). The hand was large, approaching the humerus in length, and possessed five fingers equipped for grasping. The second finger was the longest, followed by the third and the first finger (the <a href="thumb">thumb</a>). The first three fingers ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth fingers were strongly reduced, and possibly <a href="vestigial">vestigial</a>. The <a href="Phalanx%20bone">phalangeal formula</a>, which states the number of finger bones in each finger starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2.

The hindlimbs were long, slender, and ended in four toes, the first of which (the <a href="hallux">hallux</a>) did not contact the ground. Uniquely for ornithischians, several bones of the leg and foot were fused: the <a href="tibia">tibia</a> and <a href="fibula">fibula</a> were fused with upper <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsal bones</a> (<a href="Talus%20bone">astragalus</a> and <a href="calcaneus">calcaneus</a>), forming a <a href="tibiotarsus">tibiotarsus</a>, while the lower tarsal bones were fused with the <a href="metatarsal%20bones">metatarsal bones</a>, forming a <a href="tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a>. This constellation can also be found in modern birds, where it has <a href="Convergent%20evolution">evolved independently</a>. The tibiotarsus was about 30% longer than the <a href="femur">femur</a>. The <a href="ungual%20bones">ungual bones</a> of the toes were claw-like, and not hoof-like as in more advanced ornithischians.

Following the description of the related "<a href="Tianyulong">Tianyulong</a>" in 2009, which was preserved with hundreds of long, filamentous integuments (sometimes compared to <a href="bristles">bristles</a>) from neck to tail, "Heterodontosaurus" has also been depicted with such structures, for example in publications by American palaeontologists <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> and <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a>. Sereno has stated that a heterodontosaur may have looked like a "nimble two-legged <a href="porcupine">porcupine</a>" in life. The restoration published by Sereno also featured a hypothetical <a href="display%20structure">display structure</a> located on the snout, above the nasal <a href="Fossa%20%28anatomy%29">fossa</a> (depression).

The skull of "Heterodontosaurus" was small but robustly built. The two most complete skulls measured (<a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen SAM-PK-K337) and (specimen SAM-PK-K1332) in length. The skull was elongated, narrow, and triangular when viewed from the side, with the highest point being the <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a>, from where the skull sloped down towards the snout tip. The back of the skull ended in a hook-like shape, which was offset to the <a href="quadrate%20bone">quadrate bone</a>. The <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye opening) was large and circular, and a large spur-like bone, the <a href="palpebral%20%28bone%29">palpebral</a>, protruded backwards into the upper part of the opening. Below the eye socket, the <a href="jugal%20bone">jugal bone</a> gave rise to a sideways projecting boss, or horn-like structure. The jugal bone also formed a "blade" that created a slot together with a flange on the <a href="pterygoid%20bone">pterygoid bone</a>, for guiding the motion of the lower jaw. Ventrally, the antorbital fossa was bounded by a prominent bony ridge, to which the animal's fleshy cheek would have been attached. The proportionally large <a href="Skull%23Temporal%20fenestrae">lower temporal fenestra</a> was egg-shaped and tilted back, and located behind the eye opening. The elliptical upper temporal fenestra was visible only looking at the top of the skull. The left and right upper temporal fenestrae were separated by the sagittal crest, which would have provided lateral attachment surfaces for the jaw musculature in the living animal.

The lower jaw tapered towards the front, and the <a href="dentary%20bone">dentary bone</a> (the main part of the lower jaw) was robust. The front of the jaws were covered by a toothless <a href="keratinous">keratinous</a> beak (or rhamphotheca). The upper beak covered the front of the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> bone and the lower beak covered the <a href="predentary">predentary</a>, which are, respectively, the foremost bones of the upper and lower jaw in ornithischians. This is evidenced by the rough surfaces on these structures. The palate was narrow, and tapered towards the front. The external <a href="nostril">nostril</a> openings were small, and the upper border of this opening does not seem to have been completely bridged by bone. If not due to breakage, the gap may have been formed by <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a> instead of bone. The antorbital fossa, a large depression between the eye and nostril openings, contained two smaller openings. A depression above the snout has been termed the "nasal fossa" or "sulcus". A similar fossa is also seen in "Tianyulong", "<a href="Agilisaurus">Agilisaurus</a>", and "<a href="Eoraptor">Eoraptor</a>", but its function is unknown.

An unusual feature of the skull was the different-shaped teeth (<a href="heterodonty">heterodonty</a>) for which the genus is named, which is otherwise mainly known from mammals. Most dinosaurs (and indeed most <a href="reptiles">reptiles</a>) have a single type of tooth in their jaws, but "Heterodontosaurus" had three. The beaked tip of the snout was toothless, whereas the hind part of the premaxilla in the upper jaw had three teeth on each side. The first two upper teeth were small and cone-shaped (comparable to <a href="incisors">incisors</a>), while the third on each side was much enlarged, forming prominent, <a href="Canine%20tooth">canine</a>-like <a href="tusks">tusks</a>. These first teeth were probably partially encased by the upper beak. The first two teeth in the lower jaw also formed canines, but were much bigger than the upper equivalents. The canines had fine serrations along the back edge, but only the lower ones were serrated at the front. Eleven tall and chisel-like cheek-teeth lined each side of the posterior parts of the upper jaw, which were separated from the canines by a large <a href="diastema">diastema</a> (gap). The cheek-teeth increased gradually in size, with the middle teeth being largest, and decreased in size after this point. These teeth had a heavy coat of <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> on the inwards side, and were adapted for wear (<a href="hypsodonty">hypsodonty</a>), and they had long roots, firmly embedded in their sockets. The tusks in the lower jaw fit into an indentation within the diastema of the upper jaw. The cheek-teeth in the lower jaw generally matched those in the upper jaw, though the enamel surface of these were on the outwards side. The upper and lower teeth rows were inset, which created a "cheek-recess" also seen in other ornithischians.

The holotype specimen of "Heterodontosaurus tucki" (SAM-PK-K337) was discovered during the British–South African expedition to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and <a href="Basutoland">Basutoland</a> (former name of <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>) in 1961–1962. Today, it is housed in the <a href="Iziko%20South%20African%20Museum">Iziko South African Museum</a>. It was excavated on a mountain at an altitude of about , at a locality called Tyinindini, in the district of <a href="Transkei">Transkei</a> (sometimes referred to as <a href="Herschel%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Herschel</a>) in the <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Province</a> of South Africa. The specimen consists of a crushed but nearly complete skull; associated postcranial remains mentioned in the original description could not be located in 2011. The animal was <a href="scientifically%20described">scientifically described</a> and named in 1962 by palaeontologists <a href="Alfred%20Walter%20Crompton">Alfred Walter Crompton</a> from South Africa and <a href="Alan%20J.%20Charig">Alan J. Charig</a> from the United Kingdom. The genus name refers to the different-shaped teeth, and the specific name honors George C. Tuck, a director of <a href="Austin%20Motor%20Company">Austin Motor Company</a>, who supported the expedition. The specimen was not fully prepared by the time of publication, so only the front parts of the skull and lower jaw were described, and the authors conceded that their description was preliminary, serving mainly to name the animal. It was considered an important discovery, as few early ornithischians were known at the time. The preparation of the specimen, i.e. the freeing of the bones from the rock matrix, was very time consuming, since they were covered in a thin, very hard, ferruginous layer containing <a href="haematite">haematite</a>. This could only be removed by a <a href="diamond%20saw">diamond saw</a>, which damaged the specimen.

In 1966, a second specimen of "Heterodontosaurus" (SAM-PK-K1332) was discovered at the Voyizane locality, in the <a href="Elliot%20Formation">Elliot Formation</a> of the <a href="Stormberg%20Group">Stormberg Group</a> of rock formations, above sea level, on <a href="Krommespruit%20Mountain">Krommespruit Mountain</a>. This specimen included both the skull and skeleton, preserved in articulation (i.e. the bones being preserved in their natural position in relation to each other), with little displacement and distortion of the bones. The postcranial skeleton was briefly described by palaeontologists Albert Santa Luca, Crompton and Charig in 1976. Its forelimb bones had previously been discussed and figured in an article by palaeontologists <a href="Peter%20Galton">Peter Galton</a> and <a href="Robert%20T.%20Bakker">Robert T. Bakker</a> in 1974, as the specimen was considered significant in establishing that Dinosauria was a <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> natural group, whereas most scientists at the time, including the scientists who described "Heterodontosaurus", thought that the two main orders <a href="Saurischia">Saurischia</a> and Ornithischia were not directly related. The skeleton was fully described in 1980. SAM-PK-K1332 is the most complete heterodontosaurid skeleton described to date. Though a more detailed description of the skull of "Heterodontosaurus" was long promised, it remained unpublished upon the death of Charig in 1997. It was not until 2011 that the skull was fully described by <a href="David%20B.%20Norman">David B. Norman</a> and colleagues.

Other specimens referred to "Heterodontosaurus" include the front part of a juvenile skull (SAM-PK-K10487), a fragmentary <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (SAM-PK-K1326), a left maxilla with teeth and adjacent bones (SAM-PK-K1334), all of which were collected at the Voyizane locality during expeditions in 1966–1967, although the first was only identified as belonging to this genus in 2008. A partial snout (NM QR 1788) found in 1975 on Tushielaw Farm south of Voyizane was thought to belong to "<a href="Massospondylus">Massospondylus</a>" until 2011, when it was reclassified as "Heterodontosaurus". South African palaeontologist <a href="Robert%20Broom">Robert Broom</a> discovered a partial skull, possibly in the <a href="Clarens%20Formation">Clarens Formation</a> of South Africa, which was sold to the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> in 1913, as part of a collection that consisted almost entirely of <a href="synapsid">synapsid</a> fossils. This specimen (AMNH 24000) was first identified as belonging to a sub-adult "Heterodontosaurus" by Sereno, who reported it in a 2012 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> about the Heterodontosauridae, the first comprehensive <a href="review%20article">review article</a> about the family. This review also classified a partial postcranial skeleton (SAM-PK-K1328) from Voyizane as "Heterodontosaurus". However, in 2014, Galton suggested it might belong to the related genus "<a href="Pegomastax">Pegomastax</a>" instead, which was named by Sereno based on a partial skull from the same locality. In 2005, a new "Heterodontosaurus" specimen was found in a <a href="streambed">streambed</a> near <a href="Grahamstown">Grahamstown</a> in the <a href="Eastern%20Cape%20Province">Eastern Cape Province</a>; it was the most complete individual known to date, but the rocks around it were too hard to fully remove. The specimen was therefore scanned at the <a href="European%20Synchrotron%20Radiation%20Facility">European Synchrotron Radiation Facility</a> in 2016, to help reveal the skeleton, and aid in future research of its anatomy and lifestyle.

In 1970, palaeontologist <a href="Richard%20A.%20Thulborn">Richard A. Thulborn</a> suggested that "Heterodontosaurus" was a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of the genus "<a href="Lycorhinus">Lycorhinus</a>", which was named in 1924 with the species "L. angustidens", also from a specimen discovered in South Africa. He reclassified the type species as a member of the older genus, as the <a href="new%20combination">new combination</a> "Lycorhinus tucki", which he considered distinct due to slight differences in its teeth and its stratigraphy. He reiterated this claim in 1974, in the description of a third "Lycorhinus" species, "Lycorhinus consors", after criticism of the synonymy by Galton in 1973. In 1974, Charig and Crompton agreed that "Heterodontosaurus" and "Lycorhinus" belonged in the same family, Heterodontosauridae, but disagreed that they were similar enough to be considered congeneric. They also pointed out that the fragmentary nature and poor preservation of the "Lycorhinus angustidens" holotype specimen made it impossible to fully compare it properly to "H. tucki". In spite of the controversy, neither party had examined the "L. angustidens" holotype first hand, but after doing so, palaeontologist <a href="James%20A.%20Hopson">James A. Hopson</a> also defended generic separation of "Heterodontosaurus" in 1975, and moved "L. consors" to its own genus, "<a href="Abrictosaurus">Abrictosaurus</a>".

When it was described in 1962, "Heterodontosaurus" was classified as a primitive member of Ornithischia, one of the two main orders of Dinosauria (the other being Saurischia). The authors found it most similar to the poorly known genera "<a href="Geranosaurus">Geranosaurus</a>" and "Lycorhinus", the second of which had been considered a <a href="therapsid">therapsid</a> stem-mammal until then due to its dentition. They noted some similarities with <a href="ornithopods">ornithopods</a>, and provisionally placed the new genus in that group. Palaeontologists <a href="Alfred%20Romer">Alfred Romer</a> and <a href="Oskar%20Kuhn">Oskar Kuhn</a> independently named the family Heterodontosauridae in 1966 as a family of ornithischian dinosaurs including "Heterodontosaurus" and "Lycorhinus". Thulborn instead considered these animals as <a href="hypsilophodontids">hypsilophodontids</a>, and not a distinct family. Bakker and Galton recognised "Heterodontosaurus" as important to the evolution of ornithischian dinosaurs, as its hand pattern was shared with primitive saurischians, and therefore was primitive or <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> to both groups. This was disputed by some scientists who believed the two groups had instead evolved independently from "<a href="thecodontian">thecodontian</a>" <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a> ancestors, and that their similarities were due to convergent evolution. Some authors also suggested a relationship, such as descendant/ancestor, between heterodontosaurids and <a href="fabrosaurids">fabrosaurids</a>, both being primitive ornithischians, as well as to primitive <a href="ceratopsians">ceratopsians</a>, such as "<a href="Psittacosaurus">Psittacosaurus</a>", though the nature of these relations were debated.

By the 1980s, most researchers considered the heterodontosaurids as a distinct family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other groups within the order. By the early 21st century, the prevailing theories were that the family was the <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> of either the <a href="Marginocephalia">Marginocephalia</a> (which includes <a href="pachycephalosaurids">pachycephalosaurids</a> and ceratopsians), or the <a href="Cerapoda">Cerapoda</a> (the former group plus ornithopods), or as one of the most basal <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiations</a> of ornithischians, before the split of the <a href="Genasauria">Genasauria</a> (which includes the derived ornithischians). Heterodontosauridae was defined as a <a href="clade">clade</a> by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between the skeletons of "Heterodontosaurus" and the early <a href="theropod">theropod</a> "Eoraptor" were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called <a href="Ornithoscelida">Ornithoscelida</a>. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with <a href="sauropodomorphs">sauropodomorphs</a> in the group Saurischia.

Many genera have been referred to Heterodontosauridae since the family was erected, yet "Heterodontosaurus" remains the most completely known genus, and has functioned as the primary reference point for the group in the palaeontological literature. The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below shows the interrelationships within Heterodontosauridae, and follows the analysis by Sereno, 2012:

The family Heterodontosauridae persisted from the <a href="Late%20Triassic">Late Triassic</a> until the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> period, and existed for at least a 100 million years. Heterodontosaurids are known from Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas, but the majority have been found in southern Africa. Heterodontosaurids appear to have split into two main lineages by the <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Early Jurassic</a>; one with low-<a href="Crown%20%28dentistry%29">crowned teeth</a>, and one with high-crowned teeth (including "Heterodontosaurus"). The members of these groups are divided <a href="biogeographically">biogeographically</a>, with the low-crowned group having been discovered in areas that were once part of <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a> (northern landmass), and the high-crowned group from areas that were part of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> (southern landmass). In 2012, Sereno labelled members of the latter grouping a distinct <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a>, <a href="Heterodontosaurinae">Heterodontosaurinae</a>. "Heterodontosaurus" appears to be the most derived heterodontosaurine, due to details in its teeth, such as very thin enamel, arranged in an asymmetrical pattern. The unique tooth and jaw features of heterodontosaurines appear to be specialisations for effectively processing plant material, and their level of sophistication is comparable to that of later ornithischians.

The <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a>, or the development of the individual from juvenile to adult, is poorly known for "Heterodontosaurus", as juvenile specimens are scarce. As shown by the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487, the eye sockets became proportionally smaller as the animal grew, and the snout became longer and contained additional teeth. Similar changes have been reported for several other dinosaurs. The morphology of the teeth, however, did not change with age, indicating that the diet of juveniles was the same as that of adults. The length of the juvenile skull was suggested to be . Assuming similar body proportions as adult individuals, the body length of this juvenile would have been . Indeed, the individual probably would have been smaller, since juvenile animals in general show proportionally larger heads.

In 1974, Thulborn suggested that the large tusks of heterodontosaurids represented a <a href="secondary%20sex%20characteristic">secondary sex characteristic</a>. According to this theory, only adult male individuals would have possessed fully developed tusks; the holotype specimen of the related "Abrictosaurus", which lacked tusks altogether, would have represented a female. This hypothesis was questioned by palaeontologist Richard Butler and colleagues in 2006, who argued that the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487 possessed tusks despite its early developmental state. At this state, secondary sex characteristics are not expected. Furthermore, tusks are present in almost all known "Heterodontosaurus" skulls; the presence of sexual dimorphism however would suggest a 50:50 ratio between individuals bearing tusks and those lacking tusks. The only exception is the holotype specimen of "Abrictosaurus"; the lack of tusks in this individual is interpreted as a specialisation of this particular genus.

Much controversy has surrounded the question of whether or not, and to what degree, "Heterodontosaurus" showed the <a href="Polyphyodont">continuous tooth replacement</a> that is typical for other dinosaurs and reptiles. In 1974 and 1978, Thulborn found that the skulls known at that time lacked any indications of continuous tooth replacement: The cheek teeth of the known skulls are worn uniformly, indicating that they formed simultaneously. Newly <a href="Tooth%20eruption">erupted teeth</a> are absent. Further evidence was derived from the wear facets of the teeth, which were formed by tooth-to-tooth contact of the lower with the upper dentition. The wear facets were merged into one another, forming a continuous surface along the complete tooth row. This surface indicates that food procession was achieved by back and forth movements of the jaws, not by simple vertical movements which was the case in related dinosaurs such as "<a href="Fabrosaurus">Fabrosaurus</a>". Back and forth movements are only possible if the teeth are worn uniformly, again strengthening the case for the lack of a continuous tooth replacement. Simultaneously, Thulborn stressed that a regular tooth replacement was essential for these animals, as the supposed diet consisting of tough plant material would have led to quick <a href="abrasion%20%28dental%29">abrasion</a> of the teeth. These observations led Thulborn to conclude that "Heterodontosaurus" must have replaced its entire set of teeth at once on a regular basis. Such a complete replacement could only have been possible within phases of <a href="aestivation">aestivation</a>, when the animal did not feed. Aestivation also complies with the supposed habitat of the animals, which would have been desert-like, including hot dry seasons when food was scarce.

A comprehensive analysis conducted in 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson showed that the wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability in the degree of tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that <a href="X-ray%20images">X-ray images</a> of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.

In 2006, Butler and colleagues conducted <a href="computer%20tomography">computer tomography</a> scans of the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487. To the surprise of these researchers, replacement teeth yet to erupt were present even in this early ontogenetic stage. Despite these findings, the authors argued that tooth replacement must have occurred since the juvenile displayed the same tooth morphology as adult individuals – this morphology would have changed if the tooth simply grew continuously. In conclusion, Butler and colleagues suggested that tooth replacement in "Heterodontosaurus" must have been more sporadic than in related dinosaurs. Unerupted replacement teeth in "Heterodontosaurus" were not discovered until 2011, when Norman and colleagues described the upper jaw of specimen SAM-PK-K1334. Another juvenile skull (AMNH 24000) described by Sereno in 2012 also yielded unerupted replacement teeth. As shown by these discoveries, tooth replacement in "Heterodontosaurus" was episodical and not continuous as in other heterodontosaurids. The unerupted teeth are triangular in lateral view, which is the typical tooth morphology in basal ornithischians. The characteristic chisel-like shape of the fully erupted teeth therefore resulted from tooth-to-tooth contact between the dentition of the upper and lower jaws.

Although most researchers now consider "Heterodontosaurus" a <a href="Bipedalism">bipedal</a> runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedal</a> locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several features of the forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: These include a large <a href="olecranon">olecranon</a> (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the <a href="lever%20arm">lever arm</a> of the forearm. The <a href="medial%20epicondyle%20of%20the%20humerus">medial epicondyle of the humerus</a> was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong <a href="Anatomical%20terminology">flexor</a> muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, <a href="Process%20%28anatomy%29">projections</a> on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, "Heterodontosaurus" was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able to switch to a much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists <a href="Teresa%20Marya%C5%84ska">Teresa Maryańska</a> and <a href="Halszka%20Osm%C3%B3lska">Halszka Osmólska</a> supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that "Heterodontosaurus" might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have <a href="gallop">gallop</a>ed for fast locomotion. <a href="David%20Weishampel">David Weishampel</a> and <a href="Lawrence%20Witmer">Lawrence Witmer</a> in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and <a href="shoulder%20girdle">shoulder girdle</a>. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.

Most studies consider dinosaurs as <a href="endothermy">endothermic</a> (warm-blooded) animals, with an elevated <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> comparable to that of today's mammals and birds. In a 2009 study, Herman Pontzer and colleagues calculated the <a href="aerobic%20exercise">aerobic endurance</a> of various dinosaurs. Even at moderate running speeds, "Heterodontosaurus" would have exceeded the maximum aerobic capabilities possible for an <a href="ectothermy">ectotherm</a> (cold-blooded) animal, indicating endothermy in this genus.

"Heterodontosaurus" is commonly regarded as a <a href="herbivory">herbivorous</a> dinosaur. In 1974, Thulborn proposed that the tusks of the dinosaur played no important role in feeding; rather, that they would have been used in combat with conspecifics, for display, as a visual threat, or for active defence. Similar functions are seen in the enlarged tusks of modern <a href="muntjac">muntjac</a>s and <a href="chevrotain">chevrotain</a>s, but the curved tusks of <a href="warthogs">warthogs</a> (used for digging) are dissimilar.

Several more recent studies have raised the possibility that the dinosaur was <a href="omnivory">omnivorous</a> and used its tusks for prey killing during an occasional hunt. In 2000, Paul Barrett suggested that the shape of the premaxillary teeth and the fine <a href="serration">serration</a> of the tusks are reminiscent of <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> animals, hinting at facultative carnivory. In contrast, the muntjac lacks serration on its tusks. In 2008, Butler and colleagues argued that the enlarged tusks formed early in the development of the individual, and therefore could not constitute sexual dimorphism. Combat with conspecifics thus is an unlikely function, as enlarged tusks would be expected only in males if they were a tool for combat. Instead, feeding or defence functions are more likely. It has also been suggested that "Heterodontosaurus" could have used its jugal bosses to deliver blows during combat, and that the palpebral bone could have protected the eyes against such attacks. In 2011, Norman and colleagues drew attention to the arms and hands, which are relatively long and equipped with large, recurved claws. These features, in combination with the long hindlimbs that allowed for fast running, would have made the animal capable of seizing small prey. As an omnivore, "Heterodontosaurus" would have had a significant <a href="Natural%20selection">selection advantage</a> during the dry season when vegetation was scarce.

In 2012, Sereno pointed out several skull and dentition features that suggest a purely or at least preponderantly herbivorous diet. These include the horny beak and the specialised cheek teeth (suitable for cutting off vegetation), as well as fleshy cheeks which would have helped keeping food within the mouth during <a href="mastication">mastication</a>. The jaw muscles were enlarged, and the jaw joint was set below the level of the teeth. This deep position of the jaw joint would have allowed an evenly spread bite along the tooth row, in contrast to the scissor-like bite seen in carnivorous dinosaurs. Finally, size and position of the tusks are very different in separate members of the Heterodontosauridae; a specific function in feeding thus appears unlikely. Sereno surmised that heterodontosaurids were comparable to today's <a href="Peccary">peccaries</a>, which possess similar tusks and feed on a variety of plant material such as roots, tubers, fruits, seeds and grass. Butler and colleagues suggested that the feeding apparatus of "Heterodontosaurus" was specialised to process tough plant material, and that late-surviving members of the family ("Fruitadens", "Tianyulong" and "Echinodon") probably showed a more generalised diet including both plants and <a href="invertebrates">invertebrates</a>. "Heterodontosaurus" was characterised by a strong bite at small gape angles, but the later members were adapted to a more rapid bite and wider gapes. A 2016 study of ornithischian jaw mechanics found that the relative bite forces of "Heterodontosaurus" was comparable to that of the more derived "<a href="Scelidosaurus">Scelidosaurus</a>". The study suggested that the tusks could have played a role in feeding by grazing against the lower beak while cropping vegetation.

"Heterodontosaurus" is known from fossils found in formations of the <a href="Karoo%20Supergroup">Karoo Supergroup</a>, including the <a href="Upper%20Elliot%20Formation">Upper Elliot Formation</a> and the Clarens Formation, which date to the <a href="Hettangian">Hettangian</a> and <a href="Sinemurian">Sinemurian</a> ages of the <a href="Lower%20Jurassic">Lower Jurassic</a>, around 200–190 <a href="annum">million years ago</a>. Originally, "Heterodontosaurus" was thought to be from the <a href="Upper%20Triassic">Upper Triassic</a> period. The Upper Elliot Formation consists of red/purple <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a> and red/white <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, whereas the slightly younger Clarens Formation consists of white/cream-coloured sandstone. The Clarens Formation is less rich in fossils than the Upper Elliot Formation; its sediments also often form cliffs, restricting accessibility for fossil hunters. The Upper Elliot Formation is characterised by animals that appear to be more lightly built than those of the Lower Elliot Formation, which may have been an adaptation to the drier climate at this time in southern Africa. Both formations are famous for their abundant vertebrate fossils, including <a href="temnospondyl">temnospondyl</a> <a href="amphibians">amphibians</a>, turtles, <a href="lepidosaurs">lepidosaurs</a>, <a href="aetosaurs">aetosaurs</a>, <a href="crocodylomorphs">crocodylomorphs</a>, and non-mammal <a href="cynodonts">cynodonts</a>.

Other dinosaurs from these formations include the genasaur "<a href="Lesothosaurus">Lesothosaurus</a>", the basal sauropodomorph "Massospondylus", and the theropod "<a href="Megapnosaurus">Megapnosaurus</a>". The Lower Elliot Formation shows the largest known heterodontosaurid diversity of any rock unit; besides "Heterodontosaurus", it contained "Lycorhinus", "Abrictosaurus", and "Pegomastax". Yet another member of the family, "Geranosaurus", is known from the Clarens Formation. The high heterodontosaurid diversity have led researchers to conclude that different species might have fed on separate food sources in order to avoid competition (<a href="niche%20partitioning">niche partitioning</a>). With its highly specialised dentition, "Heterodontosaurus" might have been specialised for tough plant material, while the less specialised "Abrictosaurus" might have predominantly consumed softer vegetation. The position of the individual heterodontosaurid specimens within the rock succession is poorly known, making it difficult to determine how many of these species really were <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a>, and which species existed at separate times.

Underwater diving

Underwater diving, as a human activity, is the practice of descending below the water's surface to interact with the environment.
Immersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in <a href="ambient%20pressure">ambient pressure</a> diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types of work to be done.

In ambient pressure diving, the diver is directly exposed to the pressure of the surrounding water. The ambient pressure diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> or <a href="surface-supplied%20diving">surface-supplied diving</a>, and the <a href="saturation%20diving">saturation diving</a> technique reduces the risk of <a href="decompression%20sickness">decompression sickness</a> (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. <a href="Atmospheric%20diving%20suits">Atmospheric diving suits</a> (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed <a href="submersible">submersible</a>s can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.

The environment exposes the diver to a wide range of hazards, and though the risks are largely controlled by appropriate <a href="scuba%20skills">diving skills</a>, <a href="diver%20training">training</a>, types of <a href="diving%20equipment">equipment</a> and <a href="breathing%20gas">breathing gas</a>es used depending on the mode, depth and purpose of diving, it remains a relatively dangerous activity. 
Diving activities are restricted to maximum depths of about for recreational scuba diving, for commercial saturation diving, and wearing atmospheric suits. Diving is also restricted to conditions which are not excessively hazardous, though the level of risk acceptable can vary.

<a href="Recreational%20diving">Recreational diving</a> (sometimes called sport diving or subaquatics) is a popular leisure activity. <a href="Technical%20diving">Technical diving</a> is a form of recreational diving under especially challenging conditions. <a href="Professional%20diving">Professional diving</a> (commercial diving, diving for research purposes, or for financial gain) involves working underwater. <a href="Public%20safety%20diving">Public safety diving</a> is the underwater work done by law enforcement, fire rescue, and <a href="underwater%20search%20and%20recovery">underwater search and recovery</a> dive teams. <a href="Military%20diving">Military diving</a> includes combat diving, clearance diving and <a href="ships%20husbandry">ships husbandry</a>.
"Deep sea diving" is underwater diving, usually with surface-supplied equipment, and often refers to the use of <a href="standard%20diving%20dress">standard diving dress</a> with the traditional copper helmet. "Hard hat" diving is any form of diving with a <a href="Diving%20helmet">helmet</a>, including the standard copper helmet, and other forms of <a href="Diving%20helmet%23Free-flow%20helmets">free-flow</a> and <a href="Diving%20helmet%23Lightweight%20demand%20helmets">lightweight demand helmets</a>.
The history of breath-hold diving goes back at least to classical times, and there is evidence of prehistoric <a href="Hunter-gatherer">hunting and gathering</a> of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and self-contained breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

Immersion in water and exposure to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful work to be done underwater.

Immersion of the human body in water affects the <a href="Circulatory%20system">circulation</a>, <a href="renal%20system">renal system</a>, <a href="fluid%20balance">fluid balance</a>, and breathing, because the external <a href="hydrostatic%20pressure">hydrostatic pressure</a> of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a <a href="blood%20shift">blood shift</a> from the <a href="extravascular">extravascular</a> tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as <a href="immersion%20diuresis">immersion diuresis</a> compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.

The blood shift causes an increased respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but <a href="bradycardia">slowed heartbeat</a> reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly because of the <a href="diving%20reflex">diving reflex</a> in <a href="breath-hold%20diving">breath-hold diving</a>. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and resistance to air flow in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between <a href="pulmonary%20edema">pulmonary edema</a> and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.

<a href="Cold%20shock%20response">Cold shock response</a> is the <a href="physiological">physiological</a> response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, and is a common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.

The <a href="diving%20reflex">diving reflex</a> is a response to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic <a href="reflex">reflex</a>es. It optimises <a href="respiration%20%28physiology%29">respiration</a> by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in <a href="aquatic%20mammal">aquatic mammal</a>s (<a href="pinniped">seals</a>, <a href="otter">otter</a>s, <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s and <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s), and also exists in other mammals, including <a href="human">human</a>s. <a href="Diving%20bird">Diving bird</a>s, such as <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the <a href="spleen">spleen</a>, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.

<a href="Hypothermia">Hypothermia</a> is reduced body temperature that happens when a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn increases the risk of other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.

Breath-hold diving by an air-breathing animal is limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by <a href="hypercapnia">buildup of carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="Lactic%20acid">lactate</a> in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to <a href="hypoxia%20%28medical%29">central nervous system hypoxia</a>. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.

<a href="Freediving%20blackout">Blackouts in freediving</a> can occur when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue towards the end of the dive (<a href="Bohr%20effect">Bohr effect</a>); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.

Ascent-induced hypoxia is caused by a drop in oxygen partial pressure as ambient pressure is reduced. The partial pressure of oxygen at depth may be sufficient to maintain consciousness but only at that depth and not at the reduced pressures nearer the surface.

<a href="Barotrauma">Barotrauma</a>, an example of <a href="dysbarism">dysbarism</a>, is physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in <a href="pressure">pressure</a> between a gas space inside, or in contact with the body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.

The initial damage is usually due to over-stretching the tissues in tension or shear, either directly by expansion of the gas in the closed space, or by pressure difference hydrostatically transmitted through the tissue.

Barotrauma generally manifests as sinus or middle ear effects, DCS, lung overpressure injuries, and injuries resulting from external squeezes. Barotraumas of descent are caused by preventing the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver, resulting in a pressure difference between the tissues and the gas space, and the unbalanced force due to this pressure difference causes deformation of the tissues resulting in cell rupture. Barotraumas of ascent are also caused when the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver is prevented. In this case the pressure difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength. Besides tissue rupture, the overpressure may cause ingress of gases into the tissues and further afield through the circulatory system. This can cause blockage of circulation at distant sites, or interfere with the normal function of an organ by its presence.

Provision of breathing gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong the duration of a dive, but there are other problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as <a href="nitrogen%20narcosis">nitrogen narcosis</a> and <a href="high%20pressure%20nervous%20syndrome">high pressure nervous syndrome</a>, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during <a href="Decompression%20%28diving%29">decompression</a>.

Other problems arise when the concentration of metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the <a href="Oxygen%20toxicity">toxic effects of oxygen</a> at high partial pressure, through <a href="Hypercarbia">buildup of carbon dioxide</a> due to excessive work of breathing, increased <a href="Dead%20space%20%28physiology%29">dead space</a>, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between the interior of the lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased <a href="work%20of%20breathing">work of breathing</a> and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.

<a href="Underwater%20vision">Underwater vision</a> is affected by the clarity and the <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a> of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and <a href="turbidity">turbidity</a> of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, <a href="visual%20acuity">visual acuity</a> is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this is affected by the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.
Water has different <a href="Underwater%20acoustics">acoustic properties</a> from those of air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by bone conduction. Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult. Human hearing underwater, in cases where the diver's ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air. Frequency sensitivity underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher threshold of hearing underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most. The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, hearing sensitivity is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure. Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice <a href="formant">formant</a>s are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it. The increased density of breathing gases under pressure has a similar and additive effect.
Tactile sensory perception in divers may be impaired by the environmental protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to movement by the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.
<a href="Sense%20of%20balance">Balance</a> and equilibrium depend on vestibular function and secondary input from visual, organic, cutaneous, kinesthetic and sometimes auditory senses which are processed by the central nervous system to provide the sense of balance. Underwater, some of these inputs may be absent or diminished, making the remaining cues more important. Conflicting input may result in vertigo, disorientation and <a href="motion%20sickness">motion sickness</a>. The vestibular sense is essential in these conditions for rapid, intricate and accurate movement.<a href="Proprioception">Proprioceptive</a> perception makes the diver aware of personal position and movement, in association with the vestibular and visual input, and allows the diver to function effectively in maintaining physical equilibrium and balance in the water. In the water at neutral buoyancy, the proprioceptive cues of position are reduced or absent. This effect may be exacerbated by the diver's suit and other equipment.
Taste and smell are not very important to the diver in the water but more important to the saturation diver while in accommodation chambers. There is evidence of a slight decrease in threshold for taste and smell after extended periods under pressure.

There are several modes of diving based on the <a href="diving%20equipment">diving equipment</a> used.

The ability to dive and swim underwater while holding one's breath is considered a useful emergency skill, an important part of water sport and Navy safety training, and an enjoyable leisure activity. Underwater diving without breathing apparatus can be categorised as underwater swimming, <a href="snorkeling">snorkelling</a> and freediving. These categories overlap considerably. Several competitive <a href="underwater%20sports">underwater sports</a> are practised without breathing apparatus.

Freediving precludes the use of external breathing devices, and relies on the ability of divers to hold their breath until resurfacing. The technique ranges from simple breath-hold diving to competitive <a href="apnea">apnea</a> dives. Fins and a diving mask are often used in free diving to improve vision and provide more efficient propulsion. A short breathing tube called a snorkel allows the diver to breathe at the surface while the face is immersed. <a href="Snorkelling">Snorkelling</a> on the surface with no intention of diving is a popular water sport and recreational activity.

Scuba diving is diving with a <a href="Scuba%20set">self-contained underwater breathing apparatus</a>, which is completely independent of surface supply. Scuba gives the diver mobility and horizontal range far beyond the reach of an umbilical hose attached to surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE).
Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as <a href="frogmen">frogmen</a>, combat divers or attack swimmers.

Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more <a href="diving%20cylinder">diving cylinder</a>s containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a <a href="diving%20regulator">diving regulator</a>. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas.

Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit <a href="Rebreather%20diving">rebreather</a> scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.

A scuba diver moves underwater by using <a href="Swimfin">fins</a> attached to the feet; external propulsion can be provided by a <a href="diver%20propulsion%20vehicle">diver propulsion vehicle</a>, or a <a href="towboard">towboard</a> pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a <a href="diving%20mask">diving mask</a> to improve <a href="underwater%20vision">underwater vision</a>, a protective <a href="diving%20suit">diving suit</a>, <a href="Buoyancy%20compensator%20%28diving%29">equipment to control buoyancy</a>, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the <a href="Scuba%20skills">procedures and skills</a> appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the <a href="List%20of%20diver%20certification%20organizations">diver certification organisations</a> which issue these <a href="diver%20certification">diver certification</a>s. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment and dealing with the general <a href="List%20of%20diving%20hazards%20and%20precautions">hazards of the underwater environment</a>, and emergency procedures for self-help and <a href="diver%20rescue">assistance</a> of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of <a href="fitness%20to%20dive">fitness and health</a> is required by most training organisations, and a higher level of fitness may be needed for some applications.

An alternative to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases from the surface through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line it is called the <a href="Umbilical%20cable">diver's umbilical</a>, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an <a href="Surface-supplied%20diving%23Airline">airline</a> or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as <a href="snuba">snuba</a>, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.

<a href="Saturation%20diving">Saturation diving</a> lets professional divers live and work under pressure for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, the divers rest and live in a dry pressurised <a href="underwater%20habitat">underwater habitat</a> on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers on the deck of a <a href="diving%20support%20vessel">diving support vessel</a>, <a href="oil%20platform">oil platform</a> or other floating platform at a similar pressure to the work depth. They are transferred between the surface accommodation and the underwater workplace in a pressurised closed <a href="diving%20bell">diving bell</a>. Decompression at the end of the dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent decompressing are reduced. This type of diving allows greater work efficiency and safety.

Commercial divers refer to diving operations where the diver starts and finishes the diving operation at atmospheric pressure as <a href="Surface-supplied%20diving">surface oriented</a>, or bounce diving. The diver may be deployed from the shore or a diving support vessel and may be transported on a diving or in a diving bell. Surface-supplied divers almost always wear <a href="diving%20helmet">diving helmet</a>s or <a href="full%20face%20diving%20mask">full face diving mask</a>s. The bottom gas can be air, <a href="nitrox">nitrox</a>, <a href="heliox">heliox</a> or <a href="Trimix%20%28breathing%20gas%29">trimix</a>; the decompression gases may be similar, or may include pure oxygen. Decompression procedures include in-water decompression or <a href="Decompression%20practice">surface decompression</a> in a <a href="Diving%20chamber">deck chamber</a>.

A <a href="Diving%20bell%23Structure%20of%20a%20typical%20wet%20bell">wet bell</a> with a gas filled dome provides more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress on oxygen at . Small <a href="Diving%20bell%23Structure%20of%20a%20typical%20closed%20bell">closed bell</a> systems have been designed that can be easily mobilised, and include a two-man bell, a handling frame and a chamber for decompression after transfer under pressure (TUP). Divers can breathe air or mixed gas at the bottom and are usually recovered with the chamber filled with air. They decompress on oxygen supplied through built in breathing systems (BIBS) towards the end of the decompression. Small bell systems support bounce diving down to and for bottom times up to 2 hours.

A relatively portable surface gas supply system using high pressure gas cylinders for both primary and reserve gas, but using the full diver's umbilical system with pneumofathometer and voice communication, is known in the industry as "scuba replacement".

<a href="Surface-supplied%20diving%23Compressor%20diving">Compressor diving</a> is a rudimentary method of surface-supplied diving used in some tropical regions such as the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure <a href="air%20compressor">air compressor</a> on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or <a href="Mouthpiece%20%28scuba%29">mouthpiece</a> and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.

<a href="Submersible">Submersible</a>s and rigid <a href="atmospheric%20diving%20suit">atmospheric diving suit</a>s (ADS) enable diving to be carried out in a dry environment at normal atmospheric pressure. An ADS is a small one-person articulated submersible which resembles a <a href="plate%20armour">suit of armour</a>, with elaborate joints to allow bending, while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. An ADS can be used for dives of up to about for many hours. It eliminates the majority of physiological dangers associated with deep diving – the occupant need not decompress, there is no need for special gas mixtures, and there is no danger of <a href="nitrogen%20narcosis">nitrogen narcosis</a> – at the expense of higher cost, complex logistics and loss of dexterity.

<a href="Autonomous%20underwater%20vehicle">Autonomous underwater vehicle</a>s (AUVs) and <a href="remotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle">remotely operated underwater vehicle</a>s (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute part of a larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).

Diving may be performed for various reasons, both personal and professional. <a href="Recreational%20diving">Recreational diving</a> is purely for enjoyment and has several specialisations and <a href="technical%20diving">technical disciplines</a> to provide more scope for varied activities for which specialist training can be offered, such as <a href="cave%20diving">cave diving</a>, <a href="wreck%20diving">wreck diving</a>, <a href="ice%20diving">ice diving</a> and <a href="deep%20diving">deep diving</a>.

There are various aspects of <a href="professional%20diving">professional diving</a> that range from part-time work to lifelong careers. Professionals in the recreational dive industry include instructor trainers, dive instructors, assistant instructors, <a href="divemaster">divemaster</a>s, dive guides, and scuba technicians. Commercial diving is industry related and includes <a href="civil%20engineering">civil engineering</a> tasks such as in <a href="oil%20exploration">oil exploration</a>, <a href="offshore%20construction">offshore construction</a>, dam maintenance and harbour works. Commercial divers may also be employed to perform tasks related to marine activities, such as <a href="naval%20diving">naval diving</a>, including the repair and inspection of boats and ships, <a href="marine%20salvage">marine salvage</a> or <a href="aquaculture">aquaculture</a>.

Other specialist areas of diving include <a href="military%20diving">military diving</a>, with a long history of military <a href="frogmen">frogmen</a> in various roles. They can perform roles including direct combat, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines, <a href="bomb%20disposal">bomb disposal</a> or engineering operations.

In civilian operations, police forces keep <a href="police%20diving">police diving</a> units to perform search and rescue operations, and to recover evidence. In some cases <a href="diver%20rescue">diver rescue</a> teams may also be part of a <a href="fire%20department">fire department</a>, paramedical service or <a href="lifeguard">lifeguard</a> unit, and this may be classed as <a href="public%20safety%20diving">public safety diving</a>. There are also professional divers such as <a href="Underwater%20photography">underwater photographers</a> and <a href="Videography">videographers</a>, who record the underwater world, and <a href="scientific%20diving">scientific divers</a> in fields of study which involve the underwater environment, including <a href="Marine%20biology">marine biologists</a>, <a href="Geology">geologists</a>, <a href="Hydrology">hydrologists</a>, <a href="Oceanography">oceanographers</a> and <a href="Underwater%20archaeology">underwater archaeologists</a>.

The choice between scuba and surface-supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface-supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.

<a href="Freediving">Freediving</a> as a widespread means of hunting and gathering, both for food and other valuable resources such as <a href="pearl%20diving">pearls</a> and <a href="precious%20coral">coral</a>, dates from before 4500 BCE. By <a href="Classical%20Greece">classical Greek</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> times <a href="commercial%20diving">commercial diving</a> applications such as <a href="sponge%20diving">sponge diving</a> and <a href="marine%20salvage">marine salvage</a> were established. Military diving goes back at least as far as the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>, with recreational and <a href="underwater%20sport">sporting</a> applications being a recent development. Technological development in <a href="ambient%20pressure">ambient pressure</a> diving started with stone weights (<a href="skandalopetra">skandalopetra</a>) for fast descent. The diving bell is one of the earliest types of equipment for underwater work and exploration. Its use was first described by <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in the 4th century BCE. In the 16th and 17th centuries CE, <a href="diving%20bell">diving bell</a>s became more useful when a renewable supply of air could be provided to the diver at depth, and progressed to <a href="surface-supplied%20diving">surface-supplied diving</a> helmets – in effect miniature diving bells covering the diver's head and supplied with compressed air by <a href="diving%20air%20pump">manually operated pumps</a> – which were improved by attaching a waterproof suit to the helmet. In the early 19th century these became the <a href="standard%20diving%20dress">standard diving dress</a>, which made a far wider range of marine civil engineering and salvage projects practicable.

Limitations in mobility of the surface-supplied systems encouraged the development of both <a href="open%20circuit%20scuba">open circuit</a> and <a href="rebreather%20diving">closed circuit scuba</a> in the 20th century, which allow the diver a much greater autonomy. These became popular during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> for <a href="frogman">clandestine military operations</a>, and post-war for <a href="scientific%20diving">scientific</a>, search and rescue, <a href="media%20diving">media diving</a>, recreational and <a href="technical%20diving">technical diving</a>. The heavy free-flow surface-supplied copper helmets evolved into <a href="diving%20helmet%23Lightweight%20demand%20helmet">lightweight demand helmets</a>, which are more economical with breathing gas, important for deeper dives using expensive <a href="Heliox">helium based breathing mixtures</a>. <a href="Saturation%20diving">Saturation diving</a> reduced the risks of DCS for deep and long exposures.

An alternative approach was the development of the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of <a href="remotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle">remotely operated underwater vehicle</a>s in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and <a href="autonomous%20underwater%20vehicle">autonomous underwater vehicle</a>s, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface-supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface-supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.

By the late 19th century, as salvage operations became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in <a href="caisson%20%28engineering%29">caissons</a> and was initially called "caisson disease"; it was later renamed "the bends" because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to <a href="Grecian%20bend">stoop</a>. Early reports of the disease had been made at the time of <a href="Charles%20Pasley">Charles Pasley</a>'s salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.

French <a href="physiology">physiologist</a> <a href="Paul%20Bert">Paul Bert</a> was the first to understand it as DCS. His work, "La Pression barométrique" (1878), was a comprehensive investigation into the physiological effects of air pressure, both above and below the normal. He determined that inhaling pressurised air caused <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> to dissolve into the <a href="bloodstream">bloodstream</a>; rapid depressurisation would then release the nitrogen into its gaseous state, forming bubbles that could block the <a href="blood%20circulation">blood circulation</a> and potentially cause paralysis or death. Central nervous system <a href="oxygen%20toxicity">oxygen toxicity</a> was also first described in this publication and is sometimes referred to as the "Paul Bert effect".

<a href="John%20Scott%20Haldane">John Scott Haldane</a> designed a <a href="decompression%20chamber">decompression chamber</a> in 1907, and he produced the first <a href="decompression%20tables">decompression tables</a> for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in 1908 after extensive experiments with animals and human subjects. These tables established a method of decompression in stages – it remains the basis for decompression methods to this day. Following Haldane's recommendation, the maximum safe operating depth for divers was extended to .

The US Navy continued research into decompression, and in 1915 the first <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a> decompression tables were developed by French and Stilson. Experimental dives were conducted in the 1930s, forming the basis for the 1937 US Navy air decompression tables. Surface decompression and oxygen use were also researched in the 1930s. The US Navy 1957 tables were developed to correct problems found in the 1937 tables.

In 1965 <a href="Hugh%20LeMessurier">Hugh LeMessurier</a> and <a href="Brian%20Andrew%20Hills">Brian Andrew Hills</a> published their paper, "A <a href="Thermodynamic%20model%20of%20decompression">thermodynamic approach</a> arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques", which suggested that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops before it can be eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression.

<a href="M.P.%20Spencer">M.P. Spencer</a> showed that Doppler ultrasonic methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and Dr Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the <a href="Varying%20Permeability%20Model">Varying Permeability Model</a>, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other <a href="Decompression%20theory%23Bubble%20models">bubble models</a> followed. The pathophysiology of DCS is not yet fully understood, but <a href="decompression%20practice">decompression practice</a> has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by <a href="therapeutic%20recompression">therapeutic recompression</a> and <a href="hyperbaric%20oxygen%20therapy">hyperbaric oxygen therapy</a>. Mixed <a href="breathing%20gas">breathing gas</a>es are used to reduce the effects of the hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers.

The diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and <a href="ballast%20tank">ballast tank</a>s of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, <a href="underwater%20vision">visibility</a> and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.

Benign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas.

Open water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or <a href="Scuba%20diving%20quarry">flooded quarry</a>, where the diver has direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. <a href="Open%20water%20diving">Open water diving</a> implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. Wall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference.

An overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. <a href="Cave%20diving">Cave diving</a>, <a href="wreck%20diving">wreck diving</a>, <a href="ice%20diving">ice diving</a> and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.

<a href="Night%20diving">Night diving</a> can allow the diver to experience a different <a href="underwater">underwater</a> environment, because many <a href="marine%20animal">marine animal</a>s are <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>. <a href="Altitude%20diving">Altitude diving</a>, for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure.

The recreational diving depth limit set by the EN 14153-2 / ISO 24801-2 level 2 "Autonomous Diver" standard is . The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from for PADI divers, (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), specified by <a href="Recreational%20Scuba%20Training%20Council">Recreational Scuba Training Council</a>, for divers of the <a href="British%20Sub-Aqua%20Club">British Sub-Aqua Club</a> and <a href="Sub-Aqua%20Association">Sub-Aqua Association</a> breathing air, and for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air.

For technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with <a href="IANTD">IANTD</a> or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with <a href="Technical%20Diving%20International">TDI</a>. is the world record depth on scuba (2014). Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed , but they are also limited by physiological constraints. <a href="Compagnie%20maritime%20d%27expertises">Comex</a> Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of in 1988. ADS are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to in one.

The common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised <a href="recreational%20dive%20sites">recreational dive sites</a> which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.

Due to the inherent risks of the environment and the necessity to operate the equipment correctly, both under normal conditions and during incidents where failure to respond appropriately and quickly can have fatal consequences, a set of <a href="standard%20procedure">standard procedure</a>s are used in preparation of the equipment, preparation to dive, during the dive if all goes according to plan, after the dive, and in the event of a reasonably foreseeable contingency. The standard procedures are not necessarily the only course of action that will have a satisfactory outcome, but they are generally those procedures which have been found by experiment and experience to work well and reliably when applied in response to the given circumstances. All formal diver training is based on the learning of standard skills and procedures, and in many cases the <a href="over-learning">over-learning</a> of the skills until the procedures can be performed without hesitation even when distracting circumstances exist. Where reasonably practicable, <a href="checklist">checklist</a>s may be used to ensure that preparatory procedures are carried out in the correct sequence and that no steps are inadvertently omitted.

Some procedures are common to all manned modes of diving, but most are specific to the mode of diving and many are specific to the equipment in use. Diving procedures are those which are directly relevant to diving safety and efficiency, but do not include task specific skills. Standard procedures are particularly helpful where communication is by hand or rope signal – the <a href="Diver%20communications%23Hand%20signals">hand</a> and <a href="Diver%20communications%23Line%20signals">line signals</a> are examples of standard procedures themselves – as the communicating parties have a better idea of what the other is likely to do in response. Where <a href="Diver%20communications%23Voice%20communication">voice communication</a> is available, <a href="Diver%20communications%23Voice%20communication%20protocol">standardised communications protocol</a> reduces the time needed to convey necessary information and the error rate in transmission.

Diving procedures generally involve the correct application of the appropriate diving skills in response to the current circumstances, and range from selecting and testing equipment to suit the diver and the dive plan, to the rescue of oneself or another diver in a life-threatening emergency. In many cases, what might be a life threatening emergency to an untrained or inadequately skilled diver, is a mere annoyance and minor distraction to a skilled diver who applies the correct procedure without hesitation. Professional diving operations tend to adhere more rigidly to standard operating procedures than recreational divers, who are not legally or contractually obliged to follow them, but the prevalence of diving accidents is known to be strongly correlated to human error, which is more common in divers with less training and experience. The <a href="Doing%20It%20Right%20%28scuba%20diving%29">Doing It Right</a> philosophy of <a href="technical%20diving">technical diving</a> is strongly supportive of common standard procedures for all members of a <a href="Doing%20It%20Right%20%28scuba%20diving%29%23Unified%20team">dive team</a>, and prescribe the procedures and equipment configuration which may affect procedures to the members of their organisations.

The terms "diving skills" and "diving procedures" are largely interchangeable, but a procedure may require the ordered application of several skills, and is a broader term. A procedure may also conditionally branch or require repeated applications of a skill, depending on circumstances. Diver training is structured around the learning and practice of standard procedures until the diver is assessed as competent to apply them reliably in reasonably foreseeable circumstances, and the certification issued limits the diver to environments and equipment that are compatible with their training and assessed skill levels. The teaching and assessment of diving skills and procedures is often restricted to registered <a href="Diving%20instructor">instructors</a>, who have been assessed as competent to teach and assess those skills by the <a href="Diver%20certification%20agencies">certification or registration agency</a>, who take the responsibility of declaring the diver competent against their <a href="Educational%20assessment">assessment</a> criteria. The teaching and assessment of other task oriented skills does not generally require a diving instructor.

There is considerable difference in the diving procedures of professional divers, where a diving team with formally appointed members in specific roles and with recognised competence is required by law, and recreational diving, where in most jurisdictions the diver is not constrained by specific laws, and in many cases is not required to provide any evidence of competence.

Underwater diver training is normally given by a qualified <a href="Diving%20instructor">instructor</a> who is a member of one of many <a href="List%20of%20diver%20certification%20organizations">diver training agencies</a> or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables. <a href="Diver%20communications">Diving hand signals</a> are used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.

An entry level diver must learn the techniques of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at a high risk of drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.

To avoid injury during descent, divers must be competent at equalising the <a href="Ear%20clearing">ears</a>, sinuses and mask; they must also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good <a href="Scuba%20skills%23Buoyancy%20control">buoyancy control</a> and <a href="diver%20trim">trim</a> also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using <a href="swimfins">swimfins</a> for propulsion.

Some knowledge of physiology and the <a href="diving%20physics">physics of diving</a> is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand the effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, <a href="buoyancy">buoyancy</a>, heat loss, and <a href="light">light</a> underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of <a href="barotrauma">barotrauma</a>, DCS, gas toxicity, <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>, <a href="drowning">drowning</a> and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.

The medical aspects of diving and hyperbaric exposure include examination of divers to establish medical fitness to dive, diagnosis and treatment of <a href="diving%20disorders">diving disorders</a>, treatment by recompression and <a href="hyperbaric%20oxygen%20therapy">hyperbaric oxygen therapy</a>, toxic effects of gases in a hyperbaric environment, and treatment of injuries incurred while diving which are not directly associated with depth or pressure.

Medical <a href="fitness%20to%20dive">fitness to dive</a> is the medical and physical suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a <a href="Diving%20medicine%23Education%20and%20registration%20of%20practitioners">medical examiner of divers</a> following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes.

<a href="Psychological%20fitness%20to%20dive">Psychological fitness to dive</a> is not normally evaluated before recreational or commercial diver training, but can influence the safety and success of a diving career.

<a href="Diving%20medicine">Diving medicine</a> is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. <a href="Hyperbaric%20medicine">Hyperbaric medicine</a> is another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, <a href="decompression%20sickness">DCS</a> and <a href="air%20embolism%23Decompression%20illness">arterial gas embolism</a>.

Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of <a href="diving%20disorders">diving disorders</a>, treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness. The field includes the effect on the human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of <a href="occupational%20medicine">occupational medicine</a> and <a href="sports%20medicine">sports medicine</a>, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education.

Risk is a combination of hazard, vulnerability and likelihood of occurrence, which can be the probability of a specific undesirable consequence of a hazard, or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of an activity.

The presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident.

Commercial diving operations may expose the diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational health and safety legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.

Statistics on injuries related to commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the <a href="Health%20and%20Safety%20Executive">Health and Safety Executive</a> (HSE) is responsible for the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the <a href="Petroleum%20Safety%20Authority%20Norway">Petroleum Safety Authority Norway</a> (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year. The risks of dying during <a href="recreational%20diving">recreational</a>, <a href="scientific%20diving">scientific</a> or <a href="commercial%20diving">commercial diving</a> are small, and for <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a>, deaths are usually associated with poor <a href="Scuba%20skills%23Breathing%20gas%20management">gas management</a>, poor <a href="Scuba%20skills%23Buoyancy%20control%2C%20trim%20and%20stability">buoyancy control</a>, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. According to a North American 1972 analysis of calendar year 1970 data, diving was, based on man hours, 96 times more dangerous than driving a car. According to a 2000 Japanese study, every hour of recreational diving is 36 to 62 times riskier than driving.

<a href="Scuba%20diving%20fatalities">Scuba diving fatalities</a> have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in <a href="open%20circuit%20scuba">open circuit scuba</a>, and when the cause of death is recorded as <a href="drowning">drowning</a>, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed <a href="Scuba%20skills%23Ascents%20and%20descents">ascent</a>, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data are poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.

Artisanal fishermen and gatherers of marine organisms in less developed countries may expose themselves to relatively high risk using diving equipment if they do not understand the physiological hazards, particularly if they use inadequate equipment.

Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include <a href="List%20of%20diving%20hazards%20and%20precautions%23The%20aquatic%20environment">the aquatic environment</a>, the use of <a href="List%20of%20diving%20hazards%20and%20precautions%23Use%20of%20breathing%20equipment%20in%20an%20underwater%20environment">breathing equipment in an underwater environment</a>, <a href="List%20of%20diving%20hazards%20and%20precautions%23Exposure%20to%20a%20pressurised%20environment%20and%20pressure%20changes">exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes</a>, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. <a href="List%20of%20diving%20hazards%20and%20precautions%23Failure%20of%20diving%20equipment%20other%20than%20breathing%20apparatus">Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus</a> is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of <a href="List%20of%20diving%20hazards%20and%20precautions%23The%20specific%20diving%20environment">the specific diving environment</a>, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include <a href="List%20of%20diving%20hazards%20and%20precautions%23Pre-existing%20physiological%20and%20psychological%20conditions%20in%20the%20diver">pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20diving%20hazards%20and%20precautions%23Diver%20behaviour%20and%20competence">personal behaviour and competence</a> of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional <a href="List%20of%20diving%20hazards%20and%20precautions%23Hazards%20of%20the%20dive%20task%20and%20special%20equipment">hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment</a> associated with the task.

The major factors influencing diving safety are the environment, the diving equipment and the performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.

<a href="Human%20factors">Human factors</a> are the physical or <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a> properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems as well as human-environment equilibrium. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, and the consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors are more likely to have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. <a href="Human%20error">Human error</a> and <a href="panic">panic</a> are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The <a href="safety">safety</a> of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.

Only 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.

<a href="Risk%20management">Risk management</a> is obtained by the usual measures of <a href="engineering%20controls">engineering controls</a>, <a href="administrative%20controls">administrative controls</a> and procedures, and <a href="personal%20protective%20equipment">personal protective equipment</a>, including <a href="hazard%20identification">hazard identification</a> and <a href="risk%20assessment">risk assessment</a> (HIRA), <a href="protective%20equipment">protective equipment</a>, <a href="Screening%20%28medicine%29">medical screening</a>, <a href="training">training</a> and <a href="Standard%20operating%20procedure">standardised procedures</a>. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they are an important part of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, <a href="alternative%20air%20source">alternative air source</a>, buddy checks, <a href="Buddy%20diving">buddy or team diving</a> procedures, <a href="dive%20planning">dive planning</a>, <a href="Diver%20communications">underwater hand signals</a>, and carrying <a href="first%20aid">first aid</a> and <a href="Oxygen%20therapy">oxygen administration</a> equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.

Inshore and inland commercial and military diving is regulated by legislation in many countries. Responsibility of the employer, client and diving personnel is specified in these cases; offshore commercial diving may take place in international waters, and is often done following the guidelines of a voluntary membership organisation such as the <a href="International%20Marine%20Contractors%20Association">International Marine Contractors Association</a> (IMCA), which publishes codes of accepted best practice which their member organisations are expected to follow.

Recreational diver training and dive leading are industry regulated in some countries, and only directly regulated by government in a subset of them. In the UK, HSE legislation includes recreational diver training and dive leading for reward; in the US and South Africa industry regulation is accepted, though non-specific health and safety legislation still applies. In Israel recreational diving activities are regulated by the Recreational Diving Act, 1979.

The legal responsibility for recreational diving service providers is usually limited as far as possible by <a href="waiver">waiver</a>s which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational <a href="Buddy%20diving">buddy divers</a> is unclear and has been the subject of considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, buddy diving is recommended by <a href="List%20of%20diver%20certification%20organizations">recreational diver training agencies</a> as safer than <a href="solo%20diving">solo diving</a>, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs.

Cynna Kydd (<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a> Neele; born 18 September 1981 in <a href="Kyabram%2C%20Victoria">Kyabram</a>, <a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia">Victoria</a>) is a former <a href="Australia">Australia</a>n professional <a href="netball">netball</a> player. Kydd achieved some success in netball and swimming in her early life, and played in the <a href="Dairy%20Farmers%20State%20League">Dairy Farmers State League</a> at the age of 16. She was also selected for the national under-21 team in 1999 and was accepted by the <a href="Australian%20Institute%20of%20Sport">Australian Institute of Sport</a>, before launching her professional career.

Kydd was a goal shooter for the <a href="Melbourne%20Kestrels">Melbourne Kestrels</a> in the <a href="Commonwealth%20Bank%20Trophy">Commonwealth Bank Trophy</a> from 2000 to 2006, serving as club captain for the last two years. An accurate and high-scoring shooter, she was one of the league's top players of that era, winning the competition's Most Valuable Player award for 2004. She was also a frequent member of the <a href="Australian%20national%20netball%20team">Australian national netball team</a> from 2003 to 2005. Her career was hampered by injury and poor form in later years, and she struggled after being dropped from the national side in early 2005 and missing out on a return in time for the <a href="2006%20Commonwealth%20Games">2006 Commonwealth Games</a> after sustaining a serious concussion late in the year.

Kydd made the surprise decision at the beginning of the 2006 season to transfer from the Kestrels, where she had been captain, to the club's more successful rival, the <a href="Melbourne%20Phoenix">Melbourne Phoenix</a>, but she lasted only one season before walking away from the club to travel overseas. She subsequently signed with <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> club <a href="Canterbury%20Flames">Canterbury Flames</a> for the 2007 <a href="National%20Bank%20Cup">National Bank Cup</a> season, but withdrew her services before playing a game due to injury. She subsequently moved to England, where she played mixed minor grade netball.

Kydd was born in the <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victorian</a> regional town of <a href="Kyabram%2C%20Victoria">Kyabram</a>, and began playing competitive netball at age nine. Though also a talented swimmer, she was forced to make a choice between the two sports, and ultimately chose netball. She played for local and <a href="Goulburn%20Valley">Goulburn Valley</a> representative teams as a teenager and, in 1998 at the age of 16, was selected to play for the dominant <a href="Eastside%20Netball%20Club">Eastside Netball Club</a> in the state <a href="Dairy%20Farmers%20State%20League%20%28Victoria%29">Dairy Farmers State League</a> competition, alongside three national league players. Despite a regular three-hour commute and having to juggle sporting commitments with studies at <a href="Kyabram%20Secondary%20College">Kyabram Secondary College</a>, she played an integral role in Eastside's premiership that year. She was subsequently named in the state under-21 squad for the annual <a href="Australian%20National%20Netball%20Championships">Australian National Netball Championships</a> and in the <a href="Melbourne%20Kestrels">Melbourne Kestrels</a> squad for the 1999 season.

Despite never having played a national league game, Kydd was selected in the national under-21 (U-21) team in 1999, which, as a result of reforms made that year, automatically saw her admitted to the <a href="Australian%20Institute%20of%20Sport">Australian Institute of Sport</a> (AIS). She spent the 1999 season playing for the AIS team in the Victorian state league, before switching to their <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n counterparts for the 2000 season. Kydd, at 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) tall, established a reputation as an effective shooter, and despite often missing matches as a result of her national U-21 team was a key part of the team.

Kydd made her debut for the Melbourne Kestrels in April 2000 but, because of her relative inexperience, was asked to play only two games for them over the season. She earned selection in the U-21 national squad to tour <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> in May, followed by a successful stint with the team as part of the squad for the Youth World Cup in Wales. At season's end Kydd was named in the state open team for the national championships and, while remaining in the U-21 squad, was also named in the initial national open squad, despite having only played two national league games. However, the national squad was at the time enjoying an unusual glut of shooters, and she was cut amidst fierce competition from six other prominent players, all aiming at just three positions in the final team. Her disappointment was, however, partly offset when she won the Commonwealth Bank Trophy's Best New Talent award, worth <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>5,000, in February 2001.

Kydd graduated from high school at the end of 2000, and moved to <a href="Kensington%2C%20Victoria">Kensington</a>, an inner suburb of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, in February 2001 to study tourism and hospitality at <a href="Victoria%20University%2C%20Australia">Victoria University</a>. At the beginning of the 2001 season, two of the Kestrels' main stars, <a href="Shelley%20O%27Donnell">Shelley O'Donnell</a> and <a href="Janine%20Ilitch">Janine Ilitch</a>, both announced that they would be sidelined for most or all of the season because of pregnancy, and Kydd was called upon to fill the vacancy. She became a core player instantly, and although the Kestrels struggled, Kydd formed an effective combination with goal shooter <a href="Amanda%20Burton%20%28netballer%29">Amanda Burton</a> (who she had previously played with in the interstate competition). Kydd was among the team's standout performers and was frequently praised in the media for both her accuracy and consistency, coming away at season's end with 390 goals and the fifth highest scoring average in the competition. She continued to represent Australia in under-21 competition, being selected for several home matches against <a href="England%20national%20netball%20team">England</a> and a tour of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and was again selected in the national open squad in the lead-up to the <a href="2002%20Commonwealth%20Games">2002 Commonwealth Games</a>, but was once again cut from the final team.

Though she had missed out on Commonwealth Games selection, Kydd had established a reputation as a particularly difficult opponent by the beginning of the 2002 Commonwealth Bank Trophy season. She was consistently among the league's top goalers, particularly after she was again paired with Burton, due to the axing of struggling new recruit <a href="Kristy%20Doyle">Kristy Doyle</a>. She scored her 500th goal with the Kestrels in the middle of the season, and excelled against some particularly difficult opponents, including then-Australian captain <a href="Kathryn%20Harby-Williams">Kathryn Harby-Williams</a>. She was integral in helping the Kestrels make the semifinals for the first time since 1999, and was the third-highest scorer in the league. Kydd was again named in the extended national squad at the end of the season, and finally survived the cut, being named in the squad to tour Jamaica in early 2003, beating rival shooters <a href="Jane%20Altschwager">Jane Altschwager</a> and <a href="Megan%20Dehn">Megan Dehn</a> (née Anderson) for the vacancy caused by the retirement of veteran player <a href="Jacqui%20Delaney">Jacqui Delaney</a>.

At only 21 Kydd was the youngest player on the tour of Jamaica and, while she toured with the remainder of the team, was overlooked for a Test position. She finally made her full début against <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20netball%20team">South Africa</a> not long afterwards, and managed to cement her position with a superb performance, managing an accuracy rate of 94% in the third Test. This performance, along with similar form in the national league, led to her selection in the starting squad for the <a href="2003%20Netball%20World%20Championships">2003 Netball World Championships</a>. She played every game in the world championships in July at the expense of ageing veteran <a href="Eloise%20Southby-Halbish">Eloise Southby</a>, a decision which was the cause of some controversy. She subsequently helped the Kestrels to the elimination final and, at the end of the season, was named as the team's new vice-<a href="captain%20%28sports%29">captain</a>, with predecessor Janine Ilitch assuming the captaincy. She also won the coveted Commonwealth Bank Trophy Player's Player Award, and tied for third in the <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> count.

With the experience gained from several seasons in the national league, Kydd reached her peak in 2004. She was rarely troubled in the national league all year, scoring 436 goals at an average accuracy of 79%; statistics among the best in the league. Although Burton had retired, creating a supporting void that the Kestrels struggled to fill, she again played a vital role in the team reaching the finals series. She also established her place as a regular member of the national team, playing in Test series against South Africa and New Zealand and a practice match against England. Though she struggled initially against the <a href="Silver%20Ferns">Silver Ferns</a>, Kydd improved over the space of the series and was awarded player of the match in the third Test. At the end of the tour, she was given some praise for being among Australia's best in what had been an otherwise disastrous series. She was rewarded for her form when she was a surprise choice for the 2004 Commonwealth Bank Trophy Most Valuable Player Award, being selected over favourite veteran internationals <a href="Catherine%20Cox">Catherine Cox</a> and <a href="Sharelle%20McMahon">Sharelle McMahon</a>. When captain Ilitch was ruled out for 2005 because of pregnancy, Kydd was the natural choice to replace her, and she was soon announced as the Kestrels' new leader.

Kydd graduated from university at the end of 2004, but had significant difficulty finding employment as her netball commitments scared off prospective employers. She also became engaged to <a href="Garth%20Kydd">Garth Kydd</a>, a member of the Australian men's netball team, whom she married in April 2006. Kydd was widely expected to again feature among the league's best, however, she was disappointing against South Africa in February. She also struggled in the opening games of the national league season, a result largely attributed to nerves associated with the captaincy. She began to recover her form, but in May broke her finger. She continued to play but the injury severely inhibited her performance for four weeks. In June she was dropped from the national team for the first time in two years as a result of poor form and injury, with national coach <a href="Norma%20Plummer">Norma Plummer</a> stating that she was "very disappointed that [Kydd had] let it drop" and that she "never thought she would have to [cut her from the team]". The ageing Southby-Halbish was brought in to replace her and Kydd admitted that her accuracy had been well below ideal levels. She improved markedly over the following two rounds, but on 23 July suffered major <a href="concussion">concussion</a> after being hit hard in the head during a match against the <a href="Adelaide%20Thunderbirds">Adelaide Thunderbirds</a>, which required her to be taken to hospital. A brilliant performance against the <a href="Perth%20Orioles">Perth Orioles</a> the following week seemed to suggest a quick recovery, however she was dogged with complications for the remainder of the season.

In an attempt to regain her position in the national squad, Kydd attended the extended squad's first training camp in September 2005, but was one of several players forced out after succumbing to a virus. She was subsequently left out of the team for a practice tour of Jamaica and New Zealand in the lead-up to the <a href="2006%20Commonwealth%20Games">2006 Commonwealth Games</a>, but continued her efforts to make the team for the Games. Finally, on 10 December 2005, she voluntarily withdrew her name from selection, noting ongoing complications from the earlier concussion (team doctors stated that she had probably attempted to return too quickly) and low motivation.

After withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games squad, Kydd took a four-month hiatus from the sport in order to recover from injury and regain motivation. She married fiancée Garth in April 2006, and though widely known by her maiden name, decided to take on her husband's surname. Kydd began the process of re-signing with the Kestrels for the 2006 season, and returned to training with the club with March 2006, but stunned the team when she defected to more successful rival <a href="Melbourne%20Phoenix">Melbourne Phoenix</a> only three weeks before the start of the season. The defection caused notable antagonism between the traditional rivals with Kydd's former coach, <a href="Jane%20Searle">Jane Searle</a> and several teammates expressing shock at the suddenness of the switch.

After six years at the Kestrels, the defection saw Kydd forced to adapt to a new shooting combination with veteran international <a href="Sharelle%20McMahon">Sharelle McMahon</a>. As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team before the opening of the season, the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other's style. After a tenuous start, however, the pair found form, and were able to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006–07 season.

In October 2006, Kydd announced that she was leaving the Phoenix after just one season, a move that stunned coach <a href="Julie%20Hoornweg">Julie Hoornweg</a>. Kydd said that she was travelling overseas with her husband, leading to speculation she would play in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Hoornweg said that if she had known that Kydd would not keep her long term commitment, then she would have rather invested in young talent, referring to Kydd as a "player at risk". In November, New Zealand's <a href="Canterbury%20Flames">Canterbury Flames</a> announced Kydd in their squad for the 2007 <a href="National%20Bank%20Cup">National Bank Cup</a>. Her contract was to start in February 2007, so that she could fulfil work commitments with Youth Hostels Association, Victoria. However, Kydd withdrew her services to the Flames without playing a match, citing medical advice, due to a concussion incident. In late 2007, Kydd was playing mixed netball in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in the PIM Mixed A competition.

Opisthocoelicaudia

Opisthocoelicaudia is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> of the <a href="late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous Period</a> discovered in the <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a> of <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. The type <a href="species">species</a> is Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii. A well-preserved skeleton lacking only the head and neck was unearthed in 1965 by Polish and Mongolian scientists, making "Opisthocoelicaudia" one of the best known sauropods from the Late Cretaceous. Tooth marks on this skeleton indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs had fed on the <a href="wikt%3Acarcass">carcass</a> and possibly had carried away the now-missing parts. To date, only two additional, much less complete specimens are known, including a part of a <a href="pectoral%20girdle">shoulder</a> and a fragmentary tail. A relatively small sauropod, "Opisthocoelicaudia" measured about in length. Like other sauropods, it would have been characterised by a small head sitting on a very long neck and a barrel shaped trunk carried by four column-like legs. The name "Opisthocoelicaudia" means "posterior cavity tail", alluding to the unusual, <a href="Vertebral%20column%23Classification">opisthocoel</a> condition of the anterior tail vertebrae that were <a href="wikt%3ASpecial%3ASearch/concave">concave</a> on their posterior sides. This and other skeletal features lead researchers to propose that "Opisthocoelicaudia" was able to rear on its hindlegs.

Named and described by Polish paleontologist <a href="Maria%20Magdalena%20Borsuk-Bia%C5%82ynicka">Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Białynicka</a> in 1977, "Opisthocoelicaudia" was first thought to be a new member of the <a href="Camarasauridae">Camarasauridae</a>, but is currently considered a <a href="derived%20trait">derived</a> member of the <a href="Titanosaur">Titanosaur</a>ia. Its exact relationships within Titanosauria are contentious, but it may have been close to the North American "<a href="Alamosaurus">Alamosaurus</a>". All "Opisthocoelicaudia" fossils stem from the <a href="Nemegt%20Formation">Nemegt Formation</a>. Despite being rich in dinosaur fossils, the only other sauropod from this <a href="formation%20%28geology%29">rock unit</a> is "<a href="Nemegtosaurus">Nemegtosaurus</a>", which is known from a single skull. Since the skull of "Opisthocoelicaudia" remains unknown, several researchers have suggested that "Nemegtosaurus" and "Opisthocoelicaudia" may represent the same species. Sauropod footprints from the Nemegt Formation, which include skin impressions, can probably be referred to either "Nemegtosaurus" or "Opisthocoelicaudia" as these are the only known sauropods from this formation.

Like other sauropods, "Opisthocoelicaudia" had a small head on a long neck, a barrel-shaped body on four columnar limbs, and a long tail. It was relatively small for a sauropod; the <a href="holotype">type specimen</a> was estimated at to from the head to the tip of the tail. The body mass has been estimated at , , , and in separate studies.
The skull and neck are not preserved, but the reconstruction of the <a href="nuchal%20ligament">nuchal ligament</a> indicates the possession of a neck of medium length of roughly . As in other titanosaurs, the back was quite flexible due to the lack of accessory vertebral joints (<a href="hyposphene-hypantrum%20articulation">hyposphene-hypantrum articulation</a>s), while the pelvic region was strengthened by an additional sixth <a href="sacrum">hip vertebra</a>. The anterior vertebrae of the tail were <a href="Vertebral%20column%23Classification">opisthocoelous</a>, which means they were convex on their anterior sides and concave on their back sides, forming <a href="ball-and-socket%20joint">ball-and-socket joint</a>s. These opisthocoelous tail vertebrae lend "Opisthocoelicaudia" its name and serve to distinguish the genus from all other titanosaurs. Other titanosaurs were usually characterised by strongly procoelous anterior tail vertebrae, which were concave on their anterior sides and convex on their back sides. Another unique feature can be found in the back vertebrae, which show bifurcated <a href="spinous%20process">spinous process</a>es, resulting in a double row of bony projections along the top of the spine. While unique in titanosaurs, this feature can be found in several other unrelated sauropods, including "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>" and "<a href="Euhelopus">Euhelopus</a>", where it evolved independently.

As in the hips of other titanosaurs, the <a href="ischium">ischium</a> was relatively short, measuring only two-thirds the length of the <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubis</a>. The left and right ischium bones as well as the left and right pubis bones were <a href="ossification">ossified</a> with each other over most of their length, closing the gap that in other sauropods is normally present between these bones. The limbs were proportionally short, as seen in other titanosaurs. The forelimbs measured in height in the nearly complete specimen, approximately two thirds the length of the hindlimbs, which were reconstructed at height. As in other titanosaurs, the limbs were slightly spread outwards rather than standing vertically under the body, while the forelimbs were more flexible and mobile compared to other sauropods.

The <a href="manus%20%28anatomy%29">manus</a> was composed merely of the five <a href="metacarpalia">metacarpalia</a>, which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle. <a href="Carpus">Carpal bones</a> were missing, as in other titanosaurs. <a href="Phalanges%20of%20the%20hand">Finger bones</a> and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs, these bones were still present though extremely <a href="Vestigiality">reduced</a> in size. In the foot, the <a href="talus%20bone">talus bone</a> was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the <a href="calcaneus">calcaneus</a> was probably completely absent in "Opisthocoelicaudia". In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The <a href="Phalanx%20bone%23Phalangeal%20formula">phalangeal formula</a>, which states the number of phalanges (digit bones) beginning with the innermost digit, is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides "Opisthocoelicaudia", completely preserved examples are known only from "<a href="Epachthosaurus">Epachthosaurus</a>" and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur, whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, "Ophistocoelicaudia" was the most <a href="derived%20trait">derived</a> while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution. The claw of the first digit was not larger than that of the second digit, as in other sauropods, but roughly equal in size.

<a href="Osteoderm">Osteoderm</a>s (bony plates formed in the skin) have been found with at least 10 titanosaur genera. The lack of osteoderms in the nearly complete "Opisthocoelicaudia" skeleton might indicate that they are absent in this genus. However, the closely related "Alamosaurus" was found to have osteoderms nearly a century after its discovery, in addition to several other closely related titanosaurs, thus raising the possibility that "Ophistocoelicaudia" had them as well.

The type specimen was discovered between the 10th and 23 June 1965, during a joint Polish-Mongolian paleontological expedition led by Polish paleontologist <a href="Zofia%20Kielan-Jaworowska">Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska</a>. The largest of a series of expeditions carried out in 1963–1971, this expedition involved 21 members, which at times were supported by additional hired Mongolian workers. The site of discovery is located in <a href="%C3%96mn%C3%B6govi%20Province">Ömnögovi Province</a> in southern Mongolia in the "<a href="Altan%20Uul">Altan Uul</a>" area, which exposes some 100 km² of <a href="badlands">badlands</a>. The sediments exposed at Altan Uul belong to the <a href="Nemegt%20Formation">Nemegt Formation</a>, the youngest of the three <a href="Formation%20%28stratigraphy%29">geological formations</a> of the <a href="Nemegt%20Basin">Nemegt Basin</a>. "Opisthocoelicaudia" was the first of several important dinosaur discoveries made by the 1965 expedition. The other finds, made at different localities, include several skeletons of the <a href="Tyrannosauridae">tyrannosaurid</a> "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>" as well as the type specimens of the giant <a href="Ornithomimosauria">ornithomimosaur</a> "<a href="Deinocheirus">Deinocheirus</a>", the sauropod "Nemegtosaurus", and the <a href="Pachycephalosauria">pachycephalosaur</a> "<a href="Homalocephale">Homalocephale</a>".

On the fifth day of fieldwork, Ryszard Gradziński, the <a href="geologist">geologist</a> of the expedition, found a concretion of well-preserved bones which promised to belong to a fairly complete skeleton. Excavation started on the next day, revealing a nearly complete skeleton lacking only the head and neck. Until today, this specimen remains by far the most complete find of this dinosaur. The transport of the specimen out of rough terrain caused major technical problems. Stone blocks containing the fossils had to be moved some 580 m on improvised metal sledges made out of petrol drums before they could be loaded onto trucks. Because the skeleton was embedded in very hard <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> layers, several blocks weighed over a ton. On the 9th of July, the packing of the skeleton into 35 crates started for transportation to <a href="Dalanzadgad">Dalanzadgad</a>; together, the crates weighed about 12 tons.

The type specimen belonged to an aged individual. Its <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> is unusual as it was found lying on its back – in contrast, most other nearly complete dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation usually are found lying on their sides. The specimen was found encased in <a href="cross-bedding">cross-bedded</a> sandstone deposited by a river. Most of the discovered vertebrae were still connected together, forming a continuous series that consisted of 8 dorsal, 6 sacral and 34 caudal vertebrae. An additional 3 vertebrae were found isolated from the series and may belong to the transitional area between back and neck. The remaining parts of the skeleton were shifted slightly out of their original anatomical position. Both the left limb and rib bones were found on the right side of the body, while conversely the right limb and rib bones were found on the left side. Bite marks have been identified on the skeleton, particularly in the pelvis and the thigh bone, showing that <a href="predator%20%28biology%29">predators</a> had fed on the carcass. The skull and neck are missing, indicating that the carnivores might have carried away these body parts. The completeness of the remains indicate that the individual had died near the discovery site. A flooding event might have transported the carcass a short distance and subsequently covered it with sediment, even before the soft tissue had decayed entirely.
In 1977, Polish paleontologist <a href="Maria%20Magdalena%20Borsuk-Bia%C5%82ynicka">Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Białynicka</a> published her comprehensive description of the skeleton and named "Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii" as a new genus and species. The genus name, hinting at the unusual opisthocoel condition of the tail vertebrae, means "posterior cavity tail". It is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> ὄπισθεν, "opisthen" [behind, at the back], κοῖλος, "koilos" [hollow], and <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "cauda" [tail]. The specific name honors Wojciech Skarżyński, the person who prepared the type specimen. "Opisthocoelicaudia" was only the third sauropod from Asia known from a postcranial skeleton, after "Euhelopus" and "<a href="Mamenchisaurus">Mamenchisaurus</a>". After its discovery, the holotype skeleton became part of the collection of the Institute of Paleobiology in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, but later was handed back to its country of origin, now being housed at the Institute of Geology of the <a href="Mongolian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Mongolian Academy of Sciences</a> in <a href="Ulaanbaatar">Ulaanbaatar</a> under the catalog number MPC-D100/404. Besides the type specimen, Borsuk-Białynicka described a <a href="scapula">shoulder blade</a> and <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> (ZPAL MgD-I/25c) from the same locality. These bones were not yet fused to each other, indicating a juvenile individual.

By 2017, sauropod fossils had been recovered from a total of 32 localities within the Nemegt Formation, and possibly belong to either "Opisthocoelicaudia" or "Nemegtosaurus". At least two finds from the Nemegt locality — a fragmentary tail (<a href="Mongolian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">MPD</a> 100/406) and a pair of claws – show features diagnostic for "Opisthocoelicaudia" and can be referred to the latter. Field crews led by <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip Currie</a> attempted to relocate the "Opisthocoelicaudia" holotype quarry in 2006 and 2008, but became successful only in 2009 thanks to additional data provided by Gradziński. Although a prospection for additional bone material was not possible as the quarry had been filled by windblown sand, the quarry could be determined to fall within the lower portion of the Nemegt Formation.

The Nemegt Formation was deposited within the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a>, although its exact age is unknown as it has never been <a href="Radiometric%20dating">dated radiometrically</a>. According to different authors, the formation is late <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> to early <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a>, early Maastrichtian, or middle Maastrichtian in age. The sediments of the Nemegt Formation were deposited in a plain crossed by rivers. The climate was warm and <a href="Holdridge%20life%20zones">subhumid</a> with seasonal droughts, and the soils were relatively dry. Nevertheless, the Nemegt Formation was more humid than the underlying (and thus older) <a href="Barun%20Goyot%20Formation">Barun Goyot</a> and <a href="Djadochta%20Formation">Djadochta Formation</a>s, which show a <a href="semiarid">semiarid</a> climate.

The fauna of the Nemegt Formation includes aquatic or amphibious animals such as fish, turtles, and crocodiles as well as birds and the abundant medium to large sized dinosaurs, while smaller <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a> vertebrates like lizards and mammals are rare. <a href="Theropoda">Theropod dinosaurs</a> are very diverse in the Nemegt and include the abundant tyrannosaur "Tarbosaurus", which might have preyed upon "Opisthocoelicaudia". The only other known sauropod is "Nemegtosaurus", which is known from a single skull. <a href="Ornithischia">Ornithischia</a>ns are represented by the "duck-billed" <a href="Hadrosauridae">hadrosaurids</a> (including the very common "<a href="Saurolophus">Saurolophus</a>"), the thick-skulled <a href="Pachycephalosauria">pachycephalosaurs</a>, and the heavily armored <a href="Ankylosauria">ankylosaurs</a>. <a href="Neoceratopsia">Neoceratopsia</a>ns are absent, despite being present in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations. Other important dinosaur finds from the same locality as "Opisthocoelicaudia" include the <a href="Troodontidae">troodontid</a> "<a href="Borogovia">Borogovia</a>" and the <a href="Ankylosauria">ankylosaur</a> "<a href="Tarchia">Tarchia</a>".

Originally, "Opisthocoelicaudia" was classified as a member of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Camarasauridae">Camarasauridae</a>, together with "<a href="Camarasaurus">Camarasaurus</a>" and "Euhelopus". This classification was based on several shared features of the skeleton, most importantly the forked neural spines of the back vertebrae. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka considered "Opisthocoelicaudia" closer to "Euhelopus" than to "Camarasaurus", placing it in the subfamily <a href="Euhelopodinae">Euhelopodinae</a>. A 1981 study by Walter Coombs and <a href="Ralph%20Molnar">Ralph Molnar</a>, on the other hand, considered it a member of the subfamily <a href="Camarasauridae">Camarasaurinae</a> and therefore a close relative of "Camarasaurus". Today, both "Euhelopus" and "Opisthocoelicaudia" are classified outside the Camarasauridae. In 1993, Leonardo Salgado and <a href="Rodolfo%20Coria">Rodolfo Coria</a> showed "Opisthocoelicaudia" to represent a titanosaur and classified it within the family <a href="Titanosauridae">Titanosauridae</a>. The name Titanosauridae is currently considered <a href="Valid%20name%20%28zoology%29">invalid</a> by many scientists; instead, the name <a href="Lithostrotia">Lithostrotia</a> is often used as an equivalent.
Within the Lithostrotia, "Opisthocoelicaudia" has been found to be closely related to the genera "Alamosaurus", "<a href="Neuquensaurus">Neuquensaurus</a>", "<a href="Rocasaurus">Rocasaurus</a>" and "<a href="Saltasaurus">Saltasaurus</a>", together forming the family <a href="Saltasauridae">Saltasauridae</a>. Interrelationships of these genera are contested. Many scientists considered "Opisthocoelicaudia" to be most closely related to "Alamosaurus", with both genera forming a <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> group, the <a href="Opisthocoelicaudiinae">Opisthocoelicaudiinae</a>. Other scientists came to the conclusion that the Opisthocoelicaudiinae is <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> (not forming a natural group). Contradicting most other studies, Upchurch and colleagues in 2004 argued that "Alamosaurus" has to be placed outside the Saltasauridae as a close relative of "<a href="Pellegrinisaurus">Pellegrinisaurus</a>", and therefore is not related to "Opisthocoelicaudia" at al.

The following cladogram is based on Calvo and colleagues (2007), showing a monophyletic "Opisthocoelicaudiinae":

Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, "Nemegtosaurus", is known only from a skull. "Opisthocoelicaudia", on the other hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct comparison and leading to suspicions that it may represent a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of "Nemegtosaurus". According to the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a> (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if "Opisthocoelicaudia" would be shown to be a synonym of "Nemegtosaurus", the name "Nemegtosaurus" would remain valid while "Opisthocoelicaudia" would become invalid.

Both "Opisthocoelicaudia" and "Nemegtosaurus" where discovered during the 1965 joint Polish-Mongolian expedition. Before the remains were prepared and described, the expedition crew believed both finds to belong to the same species of sauropod. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka deemed "Opisthocoelicaudia" and "Nemegtosaurus" to represent separate genera because "Nemegtosaurus" was at this time considered to be a member of the <a href="Dicraeosauridae">Dicraeosauridae</a>, while "Opisthocoelicaudia" seemed to be a representative of a different group, the Camarasauridae.

Currently, both "Opisthocoelicaudia" and "Nemegtosaurus" are classified within the Titanosauria, and Jeffrey Wilson stated in 2005 that synonymy cannot be ruled out. Currie and colleagues, in 2003 and 2017, argued that a synonymy is very probable in the light of new fossil discoveries in the Nemegt Formation. After relocating the original "Nemegtosaurus" quarry, these researchers excavated postcranial bones of the "Nemegtosaurus" holotype including the centrum of a caudal vertebra and hind limb bones, which allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison between the "Nemegtosaurus" and "Opisthocoelicaudia" type specimens based on overlapping elements. These postcranial elements were found to be very similar to the corresponding parts of the "Opisthocoelicaudia" holotype. Most importantly, the discovered caudal centrum is opisthocoelous – a diagnostic feature of "Opisthocoelicaudia" – suggesting that both genera were either closely related or synonymous. Furthermore, these authors noted that none of the 32 known sauropod localities of the Nemegt Formation revealed evidence for the presence of more than one species of sauropod. In her first description, Borsuk-Białynicka (1977) argued that different sauropod genera sharing the same habitat is nothing unusual, as is evident in the North American <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a>. Currie and colleagues, however, stressed that the dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was fundamentally different, as larger dinosaurs were present with only few species per clade, indicating a harsh and geographically restricted habitat. Definitive proof for the suggested synonymy is, however, still missing, and additional overlapping elements would be required before "Opisthocoelicaudia" and "Nemegtosaurus" can be formally declared synonyms.

Originally, Borsuk-Białynicka assumed that in <a href="Anatomical%20position%23Standard%20anatomical%20position">standard position</a> the neck was horizontal or slanted slightly downward. This was based on the reconstruction of the <a href="nuchal%20ligament">nuchal ligament</a>, which runs atop of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae and serves to support the weight of the head and neck. Although an S-curved, swan-like ascending neck was envisaged in several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions of better known sauropods, recent studies argue that sauropod necks were relatively straight and were carried more horizontally.

The back was also reconstructed in a more or less horizontal orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.

"Opisthocoelicaudia" may have been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several skeletal features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the <a href="Acetabulum%23Perforate%20Acetabulum">acetabulum</a>, the flaring <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilia</a>, and the fused <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubic symphysis</a>, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.

Heinrich Mallison in 2011 argued that "Opisthocoelicaudia" may have been able to angle the anterior part of the tail against the posterior part, producing a buckle in midsection. Thus, the anterior part would have been more straight during rearing than in other sauropods. In 2005, Wilson assumed that rearing was an innovation not only of "Opisthocoelicaudia" but also of related genera within the subfamily Saltasaurinae. Common features of these genera, such as the shortened tail, may have evolved as adaptations to rearing.

Footprints from the Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when several examples had been described from the Nemegt locality by Currie and colleagues. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably "Saurolophus"), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably "Tarbosaurus") and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to "Opisthocoelicaudia", which, according to these authors, showed a matching hind foot morphology and was probably the only known sauropod (and, thus, the only potential trackmaker species) from the Nemegt Formation when "Nemegtosaurus" is regarded a synonym. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away. The best-preserved footprint measures across, so it was probably created by an individual larger than the type specimen. Although the surface of the underside is hard to obtain, the vertical surfaces are very well preserved, making this track one of the best preserved sauropod tracks known. Four digital impressions can be distinguished, with two or three showing claw impressions. The toes were almost perpendicular. Even a skin impression has been preserved above the impression of the first toe, which shows the non-overlapping scales, each with an average diameter of . The foot of the track creator was probably a little longer than wide. The second track is much shallower than the first, but shows well-preserved digit impressions with a high degree of detail, including at least two deep claw impressions that are rotated outwards, and a well-preserved impression of a fleshy toe pad behind the middle claw.

Although number of additional sauropod tracks were reported in subsequent accounts, they continued to be rare in relation to the much more common hadrosaurid and theropod tracks. Brennan Stettner and colleagues, in 2017, reported on footprints discovered during a 2007 expedition to the Nemegt locality. The best preserved of these, a very large, long impression of a hindfoot, features a very well preserved underside showing digital pads and four outwards directed digits, the first three of which showing claws. Also in 2017, Judai Nakajima and colleagues described a kidney-shaped impression as the first sauropod manus (forefoot) impression discovered in the formation.

SMS Weissenburg

SMS "Weissenburg" was one of the first ocean-going <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>. She was the third <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> of the , which also included her sister ships , , and . "Weissenburg" was laid down in 1890 in the <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> dockyard in <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a>, launched in 1891, and completed in 1894. The "Brandenburg"-class battleships were unique for their era in that they carried six large-caliber guns in three twin turrets, as opposed to four guns in two turrets, as was the standard in other navies.

"Weissenburg" served with the I Division during the first decade of her service with the fleet. This period was generally limited to training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, especially under the direction of <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>. "Weissenburg", along with her three sisters, saw only one major overseas deployment during this period, to China in 1900–1901, during the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>. The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904–1905.

In 1910, "Weissenburg" was sold to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and renamed Turgut Reis, after the famous 16th century <a href="Turgut%20Reis">Turkish admiral</a>. The ship saw heavy service during the <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a>, primarily providing artillery support to Ottoman ground forces. She also took part in two naval engagements with the <a href="Greek%20Navy">Greek Navy</a>—the <a href="Battle%20of%20Elli">Battle of Elli</a> in December 1912, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lemnos%20%281913%29">Battle of Lemnos</a> the following month. Both battles were defeats for the <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a>. After the Ottoman Empire entered World War I, she supported the fortresses protecting the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> through mid-1915, and was decommissioned from August 1915 to the end of the war. She served as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> from 1924 to 1933, and a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a> until 1950, when she was <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a>.

"Weissenburg" was the third of four s, the first <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s of the "Kaiserliche Marine" (Imperial Navy). Prior to the ascension of <a href="Kaiser">Kaiser</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a> to the German throne in June 1888, the German fleet had been largely oriented toward defense of the German coastline and <a href="Leo%20von%20Caprivi">Leo von Caprivi</a>, chief of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Naval Office), had ordered a number of <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a>s in the 1880s. In August 1888, the Kaiser, who had a strong interest in naval matters, replaced Caprivi with "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Alexander%20von%20Monts">Alexander von Monts</a> and instructed him to include four <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s in the 1889–1890 naval budget. Monts, who favored a fleet of battleships over the coastal defense strategy emphasized by his predecessor, cancelled the last four coastal defense ships authorized under Caprivi and instead ordered four battleships. Though they were the first modern battleships built in Germany, presaging the <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Tirpitz</a>-era <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, the authorization for the ships came as part of a construction program that reflected the strategic and tactical confusion of the 1880s caused by the "<a href="Jeune%20%C3%89cole">Jeune École</a>" (Young School).

"Weissenburg" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of which was increased to with the addition of torpedo nets, and had a <a href="draft%20%28nautical%29">draft</a> of forward and aft. The ship <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at its designed weight, and up to at full combat load. She was equipped with two sets of 3-cylinder <a href="triple-expansion%20engine">triple-expansion</a> <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>s that provided and a top speed of ; steam was provided by twelve coal-fired, transverse cylindrical <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. "Weissenburg" had a cruising range of at . Her crew numbered 38 officers and 530 enlisted men.

The ship was unusual for its time in that it possessed a <a href="broadside">broadside</a> of six heavy guns in three twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, rather than the four guns typical of contemporary battleships. The forward and after turrets carried 28 cm (11 in) K L/40 guns, while the <a href="amidships">amidships</a> turret mounted a pair of 28 cm guns with shorter L/35 barrels. Her secondary armament consisted of eight <a href="10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/35">SK L/35</a> quick-firing guns mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s and eight <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>, also casemate mounted. "Weissenburg"s armament system was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all in above-water swivel mounts. Although the main battery was heavier than other <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s of the period, the secondary armament was considered weak in comparison to other battleships.

"Weissenburg" was protected with nickel-steel <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a>, a new type of stronger steel. Her main <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick in the central section that protected the ammunition <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and machinery spaces. The deck was thick. The main battery <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s were protected with thick armor.

"Weissenburg" was the third of four ships of the "Brandenburg" class. Ordered as battleship "C", she was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> at the <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> shipyard in Stettin in May 1890 under construction number 199. The third ship of the class to be <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a>, "Weissenburg" slid down the <a href="slipway">slipway</a> on 30 June 1891. She was informally <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> for <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a> on 28 August 1894, which lasted until 24 September. The ship formally entered service on 10 October, under the command of then-"<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" with "<a href="Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n">Korvettenkapitän</a>" <a href="Eduard%20von%20Capelle">Eduard von Capelle</a> as the <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a>. "Weissenburg" then underwent further trials, which ended on 12 January 1895, after which she was assigned to the I Division of the Maneuver Squadron, where she was initially occupied with individual training. Toward the end of May, more fleet maneuvers were carried out in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, concluding with a visit by the fleet to <a href="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a> in <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>. The squadron returned to Kiel in early June, where preparations were underway for the opening of the <a href="Kiel%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a>. Tactical exercises were carried out in <a href="Kiel%20Bay">Kiel Bay</a> in the presence of foreign delegations to the opening ceremony.

On 1 July, the German fleet began a major cruise into the Atlantic; on the return voyage in early August, the fleet stopped at the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> for the <a href="Cowes%20Regatta">Cowes Regatta</a>. The fleet returned to <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> on 10 August and began preparations for the autumn maneuvers that would begin later that month. The first exercises began in the <a href="Helgoland%20Bight">Helgoland Bight</a> on 25 August. The fleet then steamed through the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> to the Baltic; heavy storms caused significant damage to many of the ships and the <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> capsized and sank in the storms—only three men were saved. The fleet stayed briefly in Kiel before resuming maneuvers, including live-fire exercises, in the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> and the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a>. The main maneuvers began on 7 September with a mock attack from Kiel toward the eastern Baltic. Subsequent maneuvers took place off the coast of <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a> and in <a href="Danzig%20Bay">Danzig Bay</a>. A fleet review for Kaiser Wilhelm II off <a href="Jaros%C5%82awiec%2C%20West%20Pomeranian%20Voivodeship">Jershöft</a> concluded the maneuvers on 14 September. The year 1896 followed much the same pattern as the previous year. Individual ship training was conducted though April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May. This included a visit to the Dutch ports of <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> and <a href="Nieuwediep">Nieuwediep</a>. Additional maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters. The ships visited <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a> from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy <a href="Li%20Hongzhang">Li Hongzhang</a> observed a fleet review off Kiel. On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training.

"Weissenburg" and the rest of the fleet operated under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court at <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a>; both divisions of the I Squadron were sent to accompany the Kaiser. They returned to <a href="Neufahrwasser">Neufahrwasser</a> in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 15 August, where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. These exercises reflected the tactical thinking of the new State Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt" (RMA—Imperial Navy Office), "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" Alfred von Tirpitz, and the new commander of the I Squadron, "Vizeadmiral" <a href="August%20von%20Thomsen">August von Thomsen</a>. These new tactics stressed accurate gunnery, especially at longer ranges, though the necessities of the <a href="line-ahead">line-ahead</a> formation led to tactical rigidity. Thomsen's emphasis on shooting created the basis for the excellent German gunnery during World War I. During the firing exercises, "Weissenburg" won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellent accuracy in the I Squadron. On the night of 21–22 August, the torpedo boat accidentally rammed and sank one of "Weissenburg"s barges, killing two men. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. In early December, the I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, though they were cut short due to crew shortages.
From 20 to 28 February, "Weissenburg" briefly served as the divisional <a href="flagship">flagship</a>. The fleet followed the normal routine of individual and fleet training in 1898 without incident, and a voyage to the British Isles was also included. The fleet stopped in <a href="Cobh">Queenstown</a>, <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>, and Kirkwall. The fleet assembled in Kiel on 14 August for the annual autumn exercises. The maneuvers included a mock blockade of the coast of <a href="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg</a> and a pitched battle with an "Eastern Fleet" in the Danzig Bay. A severe storm, striking the fleet as it steamed back to Kiel, caused significant damage to many ships and sank the torpedo boat . The fleet then transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and continued maneuvers in the North Sea. Training finished on 17 September in Wilhelmshaven. "Weissenburg" again won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" during the maneuvers. In December, the I Division conducted artillery and torpedo training in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a>, followed by divisional training in the Kattegat and Skagerrak. During these maneuvers, the division visited <a href="Kungsbacka">Kungsbacka</a>, Sweden, from 9 to 13 December. After returning to Kiel, the ships of the I Division went into dock for their winter repairs.

On 5 April 1899, the ship participated in the celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Eckernf%C3%B6rde">Battle of Eckernförde</a> during the <a href="First%20Schleswig%20War">First Schleswig War</a>. In May, the I and II Divisions, along with the Reserve Division from the Baltic, went on a major cruise into the Atlantic. On the voyage out, the I Division stopped in <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and the II Division went into <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Cornwall">Falmouth</a> to restock their coal supplies. The I Division then joined the II Division at Falmouth on 8 May, and the two units then departed for the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>, arriving at <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> on 12 May. There, they met the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> of eight battleships and four <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s. The German fleet then departed for Germany, stopping again in Dover on 24 May. There they participated in the <a href="Fleet%20review%20%28Commonwealth%20realms%29">naval review</a> celebrating <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s 80th birthday. The fleet returned to Kiel on 31 May.

In July, the fleet conducted squadron maneuvers in the North Sea, which included coast defense exercises with soldiers from the <a href="X%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">X Corps</a>. On 16 August, the fleet assembled in Danzig once again for the annual autumn maneuvers. The exercises started in the Baltic and on 30 August the fleet passed through the Kattegat and Skagerrak and steamed into the North Sea for further maneuvers in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>, which lasted until 7 September. The third phase of the maneuvers took place in the Kattegat and the Great Belt from 8 to 26 September, when the maneuvers concluded and the fleet went into port for annual maintenance. The year 1900 began with the usual routine of individual and divisional exercises. In the second half of March, the squadrons met in Kiel, followed by torpedo and gunnery practice in April and a voyage to the eastern Baltic. From 7 to 26 May, the fleet went on a major training cruise to the northern North Sea, which included stops in the <a href="Shetlands">Shetlands</a> from 12 to 15 May and in Bergen from 18 to 22 May. On 8 July, "Weissenburg" and the other ships of the I Division were reassigned to the II Division.

During the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> in 1900, Chinese nationalists laid siege to the foreign embassies in <a href="Peking">Peking</a> and murdered Baron <a href="Clemens%20von%20Ketteler">Clemens von Ketteler</a>, the German minister. The widespread violence against Westerners in China led to an alliance between Germany and seven other Great Powers: the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, and Japan. Those Western soldiers in China at the time were too few in number to defeat the Boxers; in Peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from the armies of the eight European powers. At the time, the primary German military force in China was the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">East Asia Squadron</a>, which consisted of the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>s , , and , the small cruisers and , and the gunboats and . There was also a German 500-man detachment in Taku; combined with the other nations' units, the force numbered some 2,100 men. Led by the British Admiral <a href="Edward%20Hobart%20Seymour">Edward Seymour</a>, these men attempted to reach Peking but were forced to stop in <a href="Tianjin">Tientsin</a> due to heavy resistance. As a result, the Kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to China to reinforce the East Asia Squadron. The expedition included "Weissenburg" and her three sisters, six <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, ten freighters, three torpedo boats, and six regiments of marines, under the command of "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" (General Field Marshal) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Waldersee">Alfred von Waldersee</a>.

On 7 July, "Konteradmiral" <a href="Richard%20von%20Gei%C3%9Fler">Richard von Geißler</a>, the expeditionary force commander, reported that his ships were ready for the operation, and they left two days later. The four battleships and the <a href="aviso">aviso</a> transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and stopped in Wilhelmshaven to rendezvous with the rest of the expeditionary force. On 11 July, the force steamed out of the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade Bight</a>, bound for China. They stopped for coal at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 17–18 July and passed through the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> on 26–27 July. More coal was taken on at <a href="Perim">Perim</a> in the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, and on 2 August the fleet entered the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. On 10 August, the ships reached <a href="Colombo%2C%20Ceylon">Colombo, Ceylon</a>, and on 14 August they passed through the <a href="Strait%20of%20Malacca">Strait of Malacca</a>. They arrived in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> on 18 August and departed five days later, reaching <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> on 28 August. Two days later, the expeditionary force stopped in the outer <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> at <a href="Wusong">Wusong</a>, downriver from <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. By the time the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from other members of the Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers.

Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to either Hong Kong or <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; "Weissenburg" went to Hong Kong, with the work lasting from 6 December 1900 to 3 January 1901. From 8 February to 23 March, she stopped in German <a href="Qingdao">Tsingtau</a>, where she also conducted gunnery training. On 26 May, the German high command recalled the expeditionary force to Germany. The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June. The ships stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo, where they stayed from 22 to 26 June. Steaming against the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>s forced the fleet to stop in <a href="Mah%C3%A9%2C%20Seychelles">Mahé, Seychelles</a>, to take on more coal. The ships then stopped for a day each to take on coal in <a href="Colony%20of%20Aden">Aden</a> and <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>. On 1 August they reached <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>, and then met with the I Division and steamed back to Germany together. They separated after reaching Helgoland, and on 11 August, after reaching the Jade roadstead, the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral von Koester, who was now the <a href="Generalinspekteur%20der%20Marine">Inspector General of the Navy</a>. The following day the expeditionary fleet was dissolved. In the end, the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks.

Following her return from China, "Weissenburg" was taken into the drydocks at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven for an overhaul. In late 1901, the fleet went on a cruise to Norway. The pattern of training for 1902 remained unchanged from previous years; I Squadron went on a major training cruise that started on 25 April. The squadron initially steamed to Norwegian waters, then rounded the northern tip of Scotland, and stopped in Irish waters. The ships returned to Kiel on 28 May. Before the start of the annual fleet maneuvers in August, "Weissenburg" was involved in an accident that damaged her <a href="naval%20ram">ram bow</a>; to ready the ship for the exercises, wooden reinforcement beams were installed in the bow. After the maneuvers, she was <a href="ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> on 29 September, with the new battleship taking her place in the division.

The four "Brandenburg"-class battleships were taken out of service for a major reconstruction. During the modernization, a second conning tower was added in the aft superstructure, along with a <a href="wikt%3Agangway">gangway</a>. "Weissenburg" and the other ships had their boilers replaced with newer models, and also had their superstructure amidships reduced. The work included increasing the ship's coal storage capacity and adding a pair of 10.5 cm guns. The plans had initially called for the center 28 cm turret to be replaced with an armored battery of medium-caliber guns, but this proved to be prohibitively expensive. On 27 September 1904, "Weissenburg" was recommissioned, and replaced the old coastal defense ship in the II Squadron. The two squadrons of the fleet ended the year with the usual training cruise into the Baltic, which took place uneventfully. The first half of 1905 similarly passed without incident for "Weissenburg". On 12 July, the fleet began its annual summer cruise to northern waters; the ships stopped in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> from 20 to 24 July and <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> from 2 to 7 August. The trip ended two days later, and was followed by the autumn fleet maneuvers later that month. In December, the fleet took its usual training cruise in the Baltic.

The fleet conducted its normal routine of individual and unit training in 1906, interrupted only by a cruise to Norway from mid-July to early August. The annual autumn maneuvers occurred as usual. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, "Weissenburg" had her crew reduced on 28 September and she was transferred to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. She participated in the 1907 fleet maneuvers, but was decommissioned on 27 September, though she was still formally assigned to the Reserve Formation. She was reactivated on 2 August 1910 to participate in the annual maneuvers with the III Squadron, though the sale of "Weissenburg" and "Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm" to the Ottoman Empire was announced just a few days later. On 6 August, she left the squadron and departed Wilhelmshaven on the 14th in company with "Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm". They arrived in the Ottoman Empire on 1 September.

In late 1909, the German military attache to the Ottoman Empire had begun a conversation with the <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a> about the possibility of selling German warships to the Ottomans to counter Greek naval expansion. After lengthy negotiations, including Ottoman attempts to buy one or more of the new <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s , , and , the Germans offered to sell the four ships of the "Brandenburg" class at a cost of 10 million marks. The Ottomans chose to buy "Weissenburg" and "Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm", since they were the more advanced ships of the class. The two battleships were renamed after the famous 16th-century Ottoman admirals, <a href="Turgut%20Reis">Turgut Reis</a> and <a href="Hayreddin%20Barbarossa">Hayreddin Barbarossa</a>, respectively. They were transferred on 1 September 1910, and on 12 September the German "Reichsmarineamt" formally struck them from the <a href="naval%20register">naval register</a>, backdated to 31 July. The Ottoman Navy, however, had great difficulty equipping "Turgut Reis" and "Barbaros Hayreddin"; the navy had to pull trained enlisted men from the rest of the fleet just to put together crews for them. Both vessels suffered from condenser troubles after they entered Ottoman service, which reduced their speed to .

A year later, on 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire to seize <a href="Libya">Libya</a>. "Turgut Reis", along with "Barbaros Hayreddin" and the obsolete <a href="Central%20battery%20ship">central battery ironclad</a> had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. The day before Italy declared war, the ships had left <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, bound for the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>. Unaware that a war had begun, they steamed slowly and conducted training maneuvers while en route, passing southwest of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. While off the island of <a href="Kos">Kos</a> on 1 October, the ships received word of the Italian attack, prompting them to steam at full speed for the safety of the Dardanelles, arriving later that night. The following day, the ships proceeded to Constantinople for a refit after the training cruise. "Turgut Reis" and "Barbaros Hayreddin" sortied briefly on 4 October, but quickly returned to port without encountering any Italian vessels. During this period, the Italian fleet laid <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s at the entrance to the Dardanelles in an attempt to prevent the Ottoman fleet from entering the Mediterranean. Maintenance work was completed by 12 October, at which point the fleet returned to Nagara inside the Dardanelles.

Since the fleet could not be used to challenge the significantly more powerful Italian "<a href="Regia%20Marina">Regia Marina</a>" (Royal Navy), "Turgut Reis" and "Barbaros Hayreddin" were primarily kept at Nagara to support the coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in the event that the Italian fleet attempted to force the straits. On 19 April 1912, elements of the Italian fleet bombarded the Dardanelles fortresses, but the Ottoman fleet did not mount a counterattack. The negative course of the war led many naval officers to join a <a href="1912%20Ottoman%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup against the Young Turk government</a>; the officers commanding the fleet at Nagara threatened to bring the ships to Constantinople if their demands were not met. With tensions rising in the Balkans, the Ottoman government signed a peace treaty on 18 October, ending the war.

After watching Italy successfully seize Ottoman territory, the <a href="Balkan%20League">Balkan League</a> declared war on the Ottoman Empire in October 1912 to seize the remaining European portion of the Empire, starting the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a>. By this time, "Turgut Reis", as with most ships of the Ottoman fleet, was in a state of disrepair. Her <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s and ammunition hoists had been removed, the pipes for her pumps were corroded, and the telephone lines no longer worked. On 7 October, the day before the Balkan League attacked, "Turgut Reis" and "Barbaros Hayreddin" were anchored off <a href="Haydarpa%C5%9Fa">Haydarpaşa</a>, along with the cruisers and and several torpedo boats. Ten days later, the ships departed for <a href="%C4%B0%C4%9Fneada">İğneada</a> and the two battleships bombarded Bulgarian artillery positions near <a href="Varna">Varna</a> two days thereafter. The ships were still suffering from boiler trouble. Both battleships took part in gunnery training in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a> on 3 November, but stopped after firing only a few salvos each, as their main battery mountings were not fully functional.

On 7 November, "Turgut Reis" shelled Bulgarian troops around <a href="Tekirda%C4%9F">Tekirdağ</a>. On 17 November, she supported the Ottoman III Corps by bombarding the attacking Bulgarian forces. The ship was aided by artillery observers ashore. The battleship's gunnery was largely ineffective, though it provided a morale boost for the besieged Ottoman army dug in at <a href="%C3%87atalca">Çatalca</a>. By 17:00, the Bulgarian infantry had largely been forced back to their starting positions, in part due to the psychological effect of the battleships' bombardment. On 22 November, "Turgut Reis" sortied from the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a> to cover the withdrawal of "Hamidiye", which had been torpedoed by a Bulgarian torpedo boat earlier that morning.

In December 1912, the Ottoman fleet was reorganized into an armored division, which included "Barbaros Hayreddin" as flagship, two destroyer divisions, and a fourth division composed of warships intended for independent operations. Over the next two months, the armored division attempted to break the Greek naval blockade of the Dardanelles, which resulted in two major naval engagements. The first, the Battle of Elli took place on 16 December 1912. The Ottomans attempted to launch an attack on <a href="Imbros">Imbros</a>. The Ottoman fleet sortied from the Dardanelles at 09:30; the smaller craft remained at the mouth of the straits while the battleships sailed north, hugging the coast. The Greek flotilla, which included the armored cruiser and three s, sailing from the island of <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a>, altered course to the northeast to block the advance of the Ottoman battleships.

The Ottoman ships opened fire on the Greeks at 09:50, from a range of about . Five minutes later, "Georgios Averof" crossed over to the other side of the Ottoman fleet, placing the Ottomans in the unfavorable position of being under fire from both sides. At 09:50 and under heavy pressure from the Greek fleet, the Ottoman ships completed a <a href="points%20of%20the%20compass">16-point turn</a>, which reversed their course, and headed for the safety of the straits. The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Around this time, "Turgut Reis" received several hits, though they inflicted only minor damage to the ship's <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> and guns. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the <a href="hospital%20ship">hospital ship</a> <a href="Ottoman%20hospital%20ship%20Resit%20Pa%C5%9Fa">"Resit Paşa"</a>.

The Battle of Lemnos resulted from an Ottoman plan to lure the faster "Georgios Averof" away from the Dardanelles. The protected cruiser "Hamidiye" evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean Sea; the assumption was that the Greeks would dispatch "Georgios Averof" to hunt down "Hamidiye". Despite the threat to Greek lines of communication posed by the cruiser, the Greek commander refused to detach "Georgios Averof" from its position. By mid-January, the Ottomans had learned that "Georgios Averof" remained with the Greek fleet, and so <a href="Ship-of-the-line%20captain">"Kalyon Kaptanı"</a> (Captain) <a href="Ramiz%20Numan%20Bey">Ramiz Numan Bey</a>, the Ottoman fleet commander, decided to attack the Greeks regardless. "Turgut Reis", "Barbaros Hayreddin", and other units of the Ottoman fleet departed the Dardanelles at 08:20 on the morning of 18 January, and sailed toward the island of Lemnos at a speed of . "Barbaros Hayreddin" led the line of battleships, with a flotilla of torpedo boats on either side of the formation. "Georgios Averof", with the three "Hydra"-class ironclads and five destroyers trailing behind, intercepted the Ottoman fleet approximately from Lemnos. At 10:55, "Mecidiye" spotted the Greeks, and the fleet turned south to engage them.

A long-range artillery duel that lasted for two hours began at around 11:55, when the Ottoman fleet opened fire at a range of . They concentrated their fire on "Georgios Averof", which returned fire at 12:00. At 12:50, the Greeks attempted to <a href="Crossing%20the%20T">cross the T</a> of the Ottoman fleet, but the Ottoman line led by "Barbaros Hayreddin" turned north to block the Greek maneuver. The Ottoman commander detached the old ironclad "Mesudiye" after she received a serious hit at 12:55. After "Barbaros Hayreddin" suffered several hits that reduced her speed to , "Turgut Reis" took the lead of the formation and Bey decided to break off the engagement. By 14:00, the Ottoman fleet reached the cover of the Dardanelles fortresses, forcing the Greeks to withdraw. Between "Turgut Reis" and "Barbaros Hayreddin", the ships fired some 800 rounds, mostly of their main battery 28 cm guns but without success. During the battle, barbettes on both "Turgut Reis" and her sister were disabled by gunfire, and both ships caught fire.

On 8 February 1913, the Ottoman navy supported an amphibious assault at <a href="%C5%9Eark%C3%B6y">Şarköy</a>. "Turgut Reis" and "Barbaros Hayreddin", along with two small cruisers provided artillery support to the right flank of the invading force once it went ashore. The ships were positioned about a kilometer off shore; "Turgut Reis" was the second ship in the line, behind her sister "Barbaros Hayreddin". The Bulgarian army resisted fiercely, which ultimately forced the Ottoman army to retreat, though the withdrawal was successful in large part due to the gunfire support from "Turgut Reis" and the rest of the fleet. During the battle, "Turgut Reis" fired 225 rounds from her 10.5 cm guns and 202 shells from her 8.8 cm guns.

In March 1913, the ship returned to the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> to resume support of the Çatalca garrison, which was under renewed attacks by the Bulgarian army. On 26 March, the barrage of 28 and 10.5 cm shells fired by "Turgut Reis" and "Barbaros Hayreddin" assisted in the repelling of advance of the 2nd Brigade of the Bulgarian 1st Infantry Division. On 30 March, the left wing of the Ottoman line turned to pursue the retreating Bulgarians. Their advance was supported by both field artillery and the heavy guns of "Turgut Reis" and the other warships positioned off the coast; the assault gained the Ottomans about by nightfall. In response, the Bulgarians brought the 1st Brigade to the front, which beat the Ottoman advance back to its starting position. On 11 April, "Turgut Reis" and "Barbaros Hayreddin", supported by several smaller vessels, steamed to <a href="%C3%87anakkale">Çanakkale</a> to provide distant cover for a light flotilla conducting a sweep for Greek warships. The two sides clashed in an inconclusive engagement, and the main Ottoman fleet did not sortie before the two sides disengaged.

In the summer of 1914, when World War I broke out in Europe, the Ottomans initially remained neutral. In early November, the <a href="Black%20Sea%20Raid">Black Sea Raid</a> of the German battlecruiser "Goeben", which had been transferred to the Ottoman navy and renamed "Yavuz Sultan Selim", resulted in declarations of war by Russia, France, and Great Britain. By this time, "Turgut Reis" was <a href="%3Awikt%3Alaid%20up">laid up</a> off the <a href="Golden%20Horn">Golden Horn</a>, worn out from heavy service during the Balkan Wars. Admiral , the head of the German naval mission to the Ottoman Empire, sent her and "Barbaros Hayreddin" to Nagara to support the Dardanelles forts. They remained on station from 14 to 19 December, before returning to Constantinople for repairs and gunnery training. On 18 February 1915, they departed for the Dardanelles and anchored in their firing positions. During this period, their engines were stopped to preserve fuel, but after the threat of British <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s increased, they kept steam up in their engines to preserve their ability to take evasive action; the steamer was moored in front of the battleships as a floating <a href="%3Awikt%3Abarrage">barrage</a>. By 11 March, the high command decided that only one ship should be kept on station at a time, alternating every five days, to allow the ships to replenish stores and ammunition.

On 18 March, "Turgut Reis" was on station when the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> attempted to force the straits. She did not engage the Allied ships, as her orders were to open fire only in the event that the defenses were breached. This was in part due to a severe shortage of shells. On 25 April, both "Turgut Reis" and "Barbaros Hayreddin" were present to bombard the Allied troops that had <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">landed at Gallipoli</a> that day. At 07:30 that morning, the Australian submarine fired several torpedoes at "Turgut Reis" but failed to score any hits. "Turgut Reis" returned to Constantinople later that day as planned. While she was bombarding Allied positions on 5 June, one of "Turgut Reis"s forward guns exploded; four men were killed and thirty-two were wounded. She returned to Constantinople for repairs, and the navy suspended bombardment operations—"Barbaros Hayreddin" having suffered a similar accident on 25 April. On 12 August, "Turgut Reis" was laid up at the Golden Horn after "Barbaros Hayreddin" was torpedoed and sunk by a British submarine. At some point in 1915, some of "Turgut Reis"s guns were removed and employed as coastal guns to shore up the defenses protecting the Dardanelles.

On 19 January 1918, "Yavuz" and the light cruiser , which had also been transferred to Ottoman service under the name "Midilli", sailed from the Dardanelles to attack several British <a href="Monitor%20%28warship%29">monitors</a> stationed outside. The ships quickly sank and before turning back to the safety of the Dardanelles. While en route, "Midilli" struck five mines and sank, while "Yavuz" hit three mines and began to list to port. The ship's captain gave an incorrect order to the helmsman, which caused the ship to run aground. "Yavuz" remained there for almost a week, until "Turgut Reis" and several other vessels arrived on the scene on 22 January; the ships spent four days trying to free "Yavuz" from the sand bank, including using the turbulence from their propellers to clear sand away from under the ship. By the morning of 26 January, "Yavuz" came free from the sandbank and "Turgut Reis" escorted her back into the Dardanelles.

"Turgut Reis" was laid up again on 30 October 1918, and was refitted at the <a href="G%C3%B6lc%C3%BCk%20Naval%20Shipyard">Gölcük Naval Shipyard</a> from 1924 to 1925. After returning to service, she served as a stationary <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> based at Gölcük. At the time, she retained only two of her originally six 28 cm guns. Two main turrets were removed and installed as a part of the heavy coastal battery Turgut Reis, situated at the Asian coast of the Dardanelles Strait. Both turrets are preserved with its guns (two L/40 and two L/35). She was decommissioned in 1933 and was thereafter used as a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a> for dockyard workers, a role she filled until 1950, when she began to be <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> at Gölcük. By 1953, the ship had been broken down into two sections, and these were sold to be dismantled abroad. Demolition work was finally completed between 1956 and 1957.

Leek Town F.C.

Leek Town Football Club is an English <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Leek%2C%20Staffordshire">Leek</a>, <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>, currently playing in the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> Division One West. The team, nicknamed "The Blues", play their home games at <a href="Harrison%20Park%20%28Leek%29">Harrison Park</a>.

The club was founded in 1946 and played in a variety of local leagues including the <a href="Staffordshire%20County%20League">Staffordshire County League</a>, <a href="Manchester%20Football%20League">Manchester League</a>, <a href="Mid-Cheshire%20League">Mid-Cheshire League</a> and <a href="Cheshire%20County%20League">Cheshire County League</a>, before becoming a founder member of the <a href="North%20West%20Counties%20Football%20League">North West Counties League</a> in 1982 and from there progressing to the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> in 1987. In 1997 they were Northern Premier League champions and gained promotion to the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a>, the highest level of English <a href="non-league%20football">non-league football</a>, spending two seasons at that level before being relegated.

Leek Town reached the final of the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a> in 1990, having progressed all the way from the first qualifying round, but lost in the final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> 3–0 to <a href="Barrow%20A.F.C.">Barrow</a>.

Football was played in Leek from at least 1876, with an earlier side called simply <a href="Leek%20F.C.">Leek F.C.</a> having been part of <a href="The%20Combination">The Combination</a> in the 1890s, but the current Leek Town club traces its lineage to the formation of a team called Leek Lowe Hamil in 1946 (although the club's official history does not mention it, some sources state that the club was initially known as Abbey Green Rovers before adopting the Lowe Hamil name).

The club began life playing in the local Leek and Moorlands League, playing on a field adjoining a <a href="pub">pub</a>, before joining the <a href="Staffordshire%20County%20League">Staffordshire County League</a> in 1947. In <a href="1949%E2%80%931950%20in%20English%20football">1949–50</a> Lowe Hamil were champions of this league, becoming the first (and to date only) team to win the title without losing a single match (some sources state this title win occurred in <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20in%20English%20football">1950–51</a>). In 1951 the team switched to the <a href="Manchester%20Football%20League">Manchester League</a>, adopting the name Leek Town at the same time, and won the championship at the first attempt, after which the team relocated once more to the <a href="Mid-Cheshire%20League">Mid-Cheshire League</a>, where again they played for just one season. In 1954 the team joined the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League">Birmingham & District League</a> but resigned in the middle of the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57</a> season due to financial difficulties, after which they had another brief spell in the Manchester League, which was also curtailed due to monetary problems, before eventually returning to the <a href="Staffordshire%20County%20League">Staffordshire County League</a>.

In 1968 a new committee was formed, under which the club emerged from the doldrums. Manager <a href="Paul%20Ogden">Paul Ogden</a> took over in 1969 and led the club to two Staffordshire County League championships, followed in quick succession by two Manchester League titles. After the second Manchester League win, Leek joined the <a href="Cheshire%20County%20League">Cheshire County League</a>, where they were league champions at the second attempt in the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75</a> season, but after Ogden left in 1975 to take over as manager of <a href="Northwich%20Victoria%20F.C.">Northwich Victoria</a> a series of managers came and went in quick succession without being able to maintain this level of success.

In 1982 the Cheshire County League merged with the <a href="Lancashire%20Combination">Lancashire Combination</a> to form the new <a href="North%20West%20Counties%20Football%20League">North West Counties League</a>, where Leek spent five relatively unsuccessful seasons. During their spell in this league former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> player <a href="Mike%20Pejic">Mike Pejic</a> took over as manager, Leek's most high-profile appointment to date, but he had only a short reign before moving to <a href="Northwich%20Victoria%20F.C.">Northwich Victoria</a>. Following Kevin Lewis' brief reign Neil Baker took over in 1986 and was to lead the club to some of its greatest successes to date.

Leek were chosen to be among the founder members of the new <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> Division One in 1987 and in <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1989–90</a> won the Division One title to gain promotion to the Premier Division, the highest level at which they had ever played. In the same season they progressed through eight rounds of the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a>, including a quarter-final win over <a href="Darlington%20F.C.">Darlington</a>, that season's <a href="Football%20Conference">Conference</a> champions, to reach the final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> but were defeated 3–0 by <a href="Barrow%20F.C.">Barrow</a>.

In <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94</a> Leek finished second in the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League%20Premier%20Division">Northern Premier League Premier Division</a>, which should have been sufficient for promotion to the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a>. However, they were refused promotion due to financial irregularities. To compound their problems, they were shifted from the Northern Premier League to the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>; the resulting travel costs proved a severe drain on the club. After one season the club was allowed to return to the Northern Premier League.
In <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1996–97</a> Leek claimed the Northern Premier League title by ten points and were this time granted promotion to the Conference. In their first season at this level they narrowly managed to avoid relegation but could not repeat the feat the following year and were relegated back to the Northern Premier League Premier Division. In <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a> the Blues were relegated to Division One, but regained their place in the Premier Division when the league was restructured due to the formation of <a href="Conference%20North">Conference North</a> in 2004. The club achieved several mid-table finishes in the league but struggled off the pitch. On 21 June 2006 it was announced that the club was in such severe financial peril that it was facing a winding-up order, but on 11 June the following year it was confirmed that a new consortium had taken over the club and secured its future. In the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08</a> season Leek finished in the bottom four, resulting in relegation to <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League%20Division%20One%20South">Division One South</a>. Between the <a href="2011%26amp%3Bndash%3B2012%20in%20English%20football">2011–2012</a> and <a href="2014%26amp%3Bndash%3B15%20in%20English%20football">2014–15</a> seasons the club qualified for the play-offs for promotion back to the Premier Division three times, but missed out each time. In 2011–12 Leek lost in the final to <a href="Ilkeston%20F.C.">Ilkeston</a>. Two seasons later the team lost at the semi-final stage to <a href="Belper%20Town%20F.C.">Belper Town</a>, and in 2015–16 Leek lost in the final to <a href="Sutton%20Coldfield%20Town%20F.C.">Sutton Coldfield Town</a>.

Leek's home colours have traditionally been all blue, and their away colours all yellow, both colours which reflect the town's coat of arms, which is predominantly blue and gold. The club has also used a blue and white kit similar to that of <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, and a red and black away kit.
Since 1997, the team's shirts have been sponsored by butter manufacturer Kerrygold, whose headquarters are in the town.

The club's crest features a <a href="Charge%20%28heraldry%29%23Plants">garb</a> and a <a href="Stafford%23The%20Stafford%20knot">Staffordshire knot</a>, both of which are elements of the town's arms, as well as a <a href="caduceus">caduceus</a>, a symbol which appears on <a href="token%20coin">token coin</a>s issued in Leek in the 18th century.

Harrison Park lies on the outskirts of Leek and has been the team's home since 1948, when the club purchased what was then called Hamil Park for £1,250. Changing rooms were constructed in the 1950s (previously the players had been obliged to change in a nearby pub), along with the first covered accommodation for spectators, and floodlights (which had previously belonged to the defunct <a href="Rugby%20Town%20F.C.">Rugby Town</a>) were erected in 1972, soon after which the stadium was renamed Harrison Park after former club chairman Geoff Harrison.

The ground currently has a seated stand along one side of the pitch, which was constructed in 1992, three covered terraces and a small amount of uncovered terracing. In 1998 the ground was flooded when a nearby reservoir overflowed and the river which runs alongside the ground burst its banks.

<a href="Leek%20CSOB%20F.C.">Leek County School Old Boys</a>, when they were in the <a href="North%20West%20Counties%20Football%20League">North West Counties Football League</a>, shared the ground between the early 1990s and 2014.

In the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20in%20English%20football">2016-17</a> season Leek's average attendance was 244, placing them fourth out of twenty two teams in the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League%20Division%20One%20South">Northern Premier League Division One South</a>. In Leek's final season in the <a href="Conference%20National">Conference National</a>, <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1998–99</a>, the club's average home attendance was 607.

Leek's best ever league finish was a 19th-place finish in <a href="Conference%20National">Conference National</a> (level 5 of the overall <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>) in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a>, the first of two seasons the team played at that level. The Blues have only twice progressed as far as the rounds proper of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, reaching the first round in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94</a> and the second round in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1990–91</a>, when they held <a href="Chester%20City%20F.C.">Chester City</a> to a draw at home but lost 4–0 in the replay.

Leek reached the final of the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a> in <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1989–90</a> but lost 3–0 to <a href="Barrow%20F.C.">Barrow</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>.

The highest attendance figure recorded at Harrison Park came when the club played near-neighbours <a href="Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.">Macclesfield Town</a> in an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> 2nd qualifying round match in the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20in%20English%20football">1973–74</a> season in front of a crowd of 3,512.

 

"N.B. The Northern Premier League does not use a squad numbering system"

Despite their relatively short history, over 30 men have managed The Blues. <a href="Paul%20Ogden">Paul Ogden</a> has had six separate spells in charge.

"As of May 2018"

Leek's main local rivals are <a href="Buxton%20F.C.">Buxton</a>, the two sides having been historic <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> rivals throughout the 1990s. <a href="Matlock%20Town%20F.C.">Matlock Town</a> and <a href="Kidsgrove%20Athletic%20F.C.">Kidsgrove Athletic</a> are also considered local rivals to the Blues.

Broad-billed parrot

The broad-billed parrot or raven parrot ("Lophopsittacus mauritianus") is a large <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="parrot">parrot</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Psittaculidae">Psittaculidae</a>. It was <a href="endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to the <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> island of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> east of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. It is unclear what other <a href="species">species</a> it is most closely related to, but it has been classified as a member of the <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> <a href="Psittaculini">Psittaculini</a>, along with other Mascarene parrots. It had similarities with the <a href="Rodrigues%20parrot">Rodrigues parrot</a> ("Necropsittacus rodricanus"), and may have been closely related.

The broad-billed parrot's head was large in proportion to its body, and there was a distinct crest of feathers on the front of the head. The bird had a very large beak, comparable in size to that of the <a href="hyacinth%20macaw">hyacinth macaw</a>, which would have enabled it to crack hard seeds. <a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> bones indicate that the species exhibited greater <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in overall size and head size than any living parrot. The exact colouration is unknown, but a contemporary description indicates that it had multiple colours, including a blue head, and perhaps a red body and beak. It is believed to have been a weak flier, but not flightless.

The broad-billed parrot was first referred to as the "Indian raven" in Dutch ships' journals from 1598 onwards. Only a few brief contemporary descriptions and three depictions are known. It was first scientifically described from a subfossil mandible in 1866, but this was not linked to the old accounts until the rediscovery of a detailed 1601 sketch that matched old descriptions. The bird became extinct in the 17th century owing to a combination of <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, predation by introduced <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>, and probably hunting as well.

The earliest known descriptions of the broad-billed parrot were provided by Dutch travellers during the <a href="Second%20Dutch%20Expedition%20to%20Indonesia">Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia</a>, led by the Dutch Admiral <a href="Jacob%20Cornelis%20van%20Neck">Jacob Cornelis van Neck</a> in 1598. They appear in reports published in 1601, which also contain the first illustration of the bird, along with the first of a <a href="dodo">dodo</a>. The Dutch sailors who visited <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> categorised the broad-billed parrots separately from parrots, and referred to them as "Indische ravens" (translated as either "Indian <a href="raven">raven</a>s" or "Indian <a href="crow">crow</a>s") without accompanying useful descriptions, which caused confusion when their journals were studied.

The British naturalist <a href="Hugh%20Edwin%20Strickland">Hugh Edwin Strickland</a> assigned the "Indian ravens" to the <a href="hornbill">hornbill</a> genus "<a href="Buceros">Buceros</a>" in 1848, because he interpreted the projection on the forehead in the 1601 illustration as a horn. The Dutch and the French also referred to South American <a href="macaw">macaw</a>s as "Indian ravens" during the 17th century, and the name was used for hornbills by Dutch, French, and English speakers in the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>. The British traveller <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Herbert">Sir Thomas Herbert</a> referred to the broad-billed parrot as "Cacatoes" (<a href="cockatoo">cockatoo</a>) in 1634, with the description "birds like Parrats, fierce and indomitable", but naturalists did not realise that he was referring to the same bird. Even after subfossils of a parrot matching the descriptions were found, the French <a href="zoologist">zoologist</a> <a href="Emile%20Oustalet">Emile Oustalet</a> argued in 1897 that the "Indian raven" was a hornbill whose remains awaited discovery. The Mauritian ornithologist <a href="France%20Staub">France Staub</a> was in favour of this idea as late as 1993. No remains of hornbills have ever been found on the island, and apart from an extinct species from <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, hornbills are not found on any <a href="oceanic%20island">oceanic island</a>s.

The first known physical remain of the broad-billed parrot was a <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> mandible collected along with the first batch of dodo bones found in the <a href="Mare%20aux%20Songes">Mare aux Songes</a> swamp. The British biologist <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> described the mandible in 1866 and identified it as belonging to a large parrot species, to which he gave the binomial name "<a href="Psittacus">Psittacus</a> mauritianus". This <a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen is now lost. The <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "broad-billed parrot" was first used by Owen in a 1866 lecture. In 1868, shortly after the 1601 journal of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> ship "Gelderland" had been rediscovered, the German ornithologist <a href="Hermann%20Schlegel">Hermann Schlegel</a> examined an unlabelled pen-and-ink sketch in it. Realising that the drawing, which is attributed to the artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, depicted the parrot described by Owen, Schlegel made the connection with the old journal descriptions. In 1875, because its bones and crest are significantly different from those of "Psittacus" species, the British zoologist <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a> assigned it to its own genus, which he called "Lophopsittacus". "Lophos" is the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word for crest, referring here to the bird's frontal crest, and "psittakos" means parrot. 

In 1973, based on remains collected by the French amateur naturalist Louis Etienne Thirioux in the early 20th century, the British ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak placed a small subfossil Mauritian parrot in the same genus as the broad-billed parrot and named it "<a href="Lophopsittacus%20bensoni">Lophopsittacus bensoni</a>". In 2007, on the basis of a comparison of subfossils, correlated with 17th and 18th century descriptions of small grey parrots, Hume reclassified it as a species in the genus "<a href="Psittacula">Psittacula</a>" and called it Thirioux's grey parrot. In 1967, the American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> had speculated that reports of grey Mauritian parrots referred to the broad-billed parrot.

The taxonomic affinities of the broad-billed parrot are undetermined. Considering its large jaws and other <a href="osteological">osteological</a> features, the British ornithologists <a href="Edward%20Newton">Edward Newton</a> and <a href="Hans%20Gadow">Hans Gadow</a> thought it to be closely related to the <a href="Rodrigues%20parrot">Rodrigues parrot</a> ("Necropsittacus rodricanus") in 1893, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.

Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are derived from South Asian ancestors, and the British <a href="palaeontologist">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Julian%20Hume">Julian Hume</a> has proposed that this may be the case for all the parrots there as well. Sea levels were lower during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced <a href="Pectoralis%20major%20muscle">pectoral</a> bones, and robust leg bones. Hume has suggested that they have a common origin in the <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiation</a> of the <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> Psittaculini, basing this theory on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> features and the fact that "Psittacula" parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on <a href="hotspot%20island">hotspot island</a>s before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.

The broad-billed parrot possessed a distinct frontal <a href="crest%20%28feathers%29">crest</a> of feathers. Ridges on the skull indicate that this crest was firmly attached, and that the bird, unlike cockatoos, could not raise or lower it. The 1601 "Gelderland" sketch was examined in 2003 by Hume, who compared the ink finish with the underlying pencil sketch and found that the latter showed several additional details. The pencil sketch depicts the crest as a tuft of rounded feathers attached to the front of the head at the base of the beak, and shows long primary <a href="covert%20feathers">covert feathers</a>, large <a href="secondary%20feathers">secondary feathers</a>, and a slightly bifurcated tail. Measurements of sub-fossils known by 1893 show that the mandible was in length, in width, the femur was in length, the tibia was , and the metatarsus . Unlike other Mascarene parrots, the broad-billed parrot had a flattened skull.

Subfossils show that the males were larger, measuring to the females' and that both sexes had disproportionately large heads and beaks. The <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in size between male and female skulls is the largest among parrots. Differences in the bones of the rest of the body and limbs are less pronounced; nevertheless, it had greater sexual dimorphism in overall size than any living parrot. The size differences between the two birds in the 1601 sketch may be due to this feature. A 1602 account by the Dutch sailor Reyer Cornelisz has traditionally been interpreted as the only contemporary mention of size differences among broad-billed parrots, listing "large and small Indian crows" among the animals of the island. A full transcript of the original text was only published in 2003, and showed that a comma had been incorrectly placed in the English translation; "large and small" instead referred to "field-hens", possibly the <a href="red%20rail">red rail</a> and the smaller <a href="Sauzier%27s%20wood%20rail">Sauzier's wood rail</a>.

There has been some confusion over the colouration of the broad-billed parrot. The report of van Neck's 1598 voyage, published in 1601, contained the first illustration of the parrot, with a caption stating that the bird had "two or three colours". The last account of the bird, and the only mention of specific colours, was by the German preacher Johann Christian Hoffman in 1673–75:

In spite of the mention of several colours, authors such as the British naturalist <a href="Walter%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a> claimed that the "Gelderland" journal described the bird as entirely blue-grey, and it was restored this way in Rothschild's 1907 book "<a href="Extinct%20Birds%20%28Rothschild%20book%29">Extinct Birds</a>". Later examination of the journal by Julian Hume has revealed only a description of the dodo. He suggested that the distinctively drawn facial mask may represent a separate colour. The British ecologist <a href="Anthony%20S.%20Cheke">Anthony S. Cheke</a> suggested in 1987 that in addition to size dimorphism, the sexes may have had different colours, which would explain some of the discrepancies in the old descriptions. The head was evidently blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, and the rest of the plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini.

In 2015, a translation of the 1660s report of the Dutch soldier Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius (from 1666 to 1669) was published, wherein he described the bird as "very beautifully coloured". Hume accordingly reinterpreted Hoffman's account, and suggested the bird may have been brightly coloured with a red body, blue head, and red beak; the bird was illustrated as such in the paper. Possible <a href="iridescent">iridescent</a> or glossy feathers that changed appearance according to angle of light may also have given the impression that it had even more colours. The Australian ornithologist <a href="Joseph%20M.%20Forshaw">Joseph M. Forshaw</a> agreed in 2017 that the bill was red (at least in males), but interpreted Hoffman's account as suggesting a more subdued reddish-brown colouration in general, with a pale bluish-grey head, similar to the <a href="Mascarene%20parrot">Mascarene parrot</a>.

Pretorius kept various now-extinct Mauritian birds in captivity, and described the behaviour of the broad-billed parrot as follows:
Though the broad-billed parrot may have fed on the ground and been a weak flier, its <a href="tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a> was short and stout, implying some <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was <a href="flightless">flightless</a>, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 "Gelderland" sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the <a href="alula">alula</a> appears large, a feature of slow-flying birds. Its sternal <a href="Keel%20%28bird%29">keel</a> was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying "<a href="Cyanoramphus">Cyanoramphus</a>" parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless <a href="kakapo">kakapo</a>, with its <a href="vestigial">vestigial</a> keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree, an improbable position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct <a href="Norfolk%20Island%20kaka">Norfolk Island kaka</a>.

Sexual dimorphism in beak size may have affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the <a href="palm%20cockatoo">palm cockatoo</a> and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20kaka">New Zealand kaka</a>. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference between male and female head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though it is impossible to determine how.

In 1953, the Japanese ornithologist <a href="Masauji%20Hachisuka">Masauji Hachisuka</a> suggested the broad-billed parrot was <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>, like the kakapo and the <a href="night%20parrot">night parrot</a>, two extant ground-dwelling parrots. Contemporary accounts do not corroborate this, and the <a href="orbits">orbits</a> are of similar size to those of other large <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> parrots. The broad-billed parrot was recorded on the dry <a href="leeward">leeward</a> side of Mauritius, which was the most accessible for people, and it was noted that birds were more abundant near the coast, which may indicate that the fauna of such areas was more diverse. It may have nested in tree cavities or rocks, like the <a href="Cuban%20amazon">Cuban amazon</a>. The terms "raven" or "crow" may have been suggested by the bird's harsh call, its behavioural traits, or just its dark plumage. The following description by the Dutch bookkeeper Jacob Granaet from 1666 mentions some of the broad-billed parrot's co-inhabitants of the forests, and might indicate its demeanour:
Many other endemic species of Mauritius were lost after the arrival of man, so the <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, almost all of which have since been lost to <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. The surviving endemic <a href="fauna">fauna</a> is still seriously threatened. The broad-billed parrot lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the <a href="Mascarene%20grey%20parakeet">Mascarene grey parakeet</a>, the <a href="Mauritius%20blue%20pigeon">Mauritius blue pigeon</a>, the <a href="Mauritius%20owl">Mauritius owl</a>, the <a href="Mascarene%20coot">Mascarene coot</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20shelduck">Mauritian shelduck</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20duck">Mauritian duck</a>, and the <a href="Mauritius%20night%20heron">Mauritius night heron</a>. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the <a href="saddle-backed%20Mauritius%20giant%20tortoise">saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="domed%20Mauritius%20giant%20tortoise">domed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20giant%20skink">Mauritian giant skink</a>, and the <a href="Round%20Island%20burrowing%20boa">Round Island burrowing boa</a>. The <a href="small%20Mauritian%20flying%20fox">small Mauritian flying fox</a> and the snail "<a href="Tropidophora%20carinata">Tropidophora carinata</a>" lived on Mauritius and Réunion but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as "<a href="Casearia%20tinifolia">Casearia tinifolia</a>" and the <a href="palm%20orchid">palm orchid</a>, have also become extinct.

Species that are morphologically similar to the broad-billed parrot, such as the <a href="hyacinth%20macaw">hyacinth macaw</a> and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. "<a href="Anodorhynchus">Anodorhynchus</a>" macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. The Brazilian ornithologist Carlos Yamashita suggested in 1997 that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a> the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from <a href="cassowary">cassowary</a> droppings. Yamashita also suggested that the abundant "<a href="Cylindraspis">Cylindraspis</a>" tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including "<a href="Latania%20loddigesii">Latania loddigesii</a>", "<a href="Mimusops%20maxima">Mimusops maxima</a>", "<a href="Sideroxylon%20grandiflorum">Sideroxylon grandiflorum</a>", "<a href="Diospyros%20egrettorium">Diospyros egrettorium</a>", and "<a href="Pandanus%20utilis">Pandanus utilis</a>".
On the basis of <a href="radiograph">radiograph</a>s, Holyoak claimed that the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> of the broad-billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested that it would have fed on soft fruits rather than hard seeds. As evidence, he pointed out that the internal <a href="trabeculae">trabeculae</a> were widely spaced, that the upper bill was broad whereas the <a href="Palatine%20bone">palatines</a> were narrow, and the fact that no preserved upper <a href="Rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a> had been discovered, which he attributed to its delicateness. The British ornithologist George A. Smith, however, pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of "strong jawed" parrots based on radiographs, "Cyanorhamphus", "<a href="Melopsittacus">Melopsittacus</a>", "<a href="Neophema">Neophema</a>" and "<a href="Psephotus">Psephotus</a>", actually have weak jaws in life, and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength. Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad-billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot, the hyacinth macaw, which cracks open palm nuts with ease. It is therefore probable that the broad-billed parrot fed in the same manner.

Though Mauritius had previously been visited by <a href="Arab">Arab</a> vessels in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, they did not settle on the island. The Dutch Empire acquired the island in 1598, renaming it after the Dutch stadtholder <a href="Maurice%20of%20Nassau">Maurice of Nassau</a>, and it was used from then on for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company. To the Dutch sailors who visited Mauritius from 1598 and onwards, the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary standpoint. Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the <a href="echo%20parakeet">echo parakeet</a> ("Psittacula echo") of Mauritius has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation.

Because of its poor flying ability, large size and possible <a href="island%20tameness">island tameness</a>, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests would have been extremely vulnerable to <a href="predation">predation</a> by introduced <a href="crab-eating%20macaque">crab-eating macaque</a>s and rats. Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, which may explain why it held out so long against introduced animals after all. The bird is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as <a href="Companion%20parrot">pets</a> by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of the <a href="Social%20stigma">stigma</a> associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.

No. 77 Squadron RAAF

No. 77 Squadron is a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) squadron headquartered at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a>, New South Wales. It is controlled by <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a>, and equipped with <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> multi-role fighters. The squadron was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">RAAF Station Pearce</a>, Western Australia, in March 1942 and saw action in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">South West Pacific theatre of World War II</a>, operating <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk%20variants">Curtis P-40 Kittyhawks</a>. After the war, it re-equipped with <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>s and deployed to Japan as part of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a>. The squadron was about to return to Australia when the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> broke out in June 1950, after which it joined <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> forces supporting South Korea. It converted from Mustangs to <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a> jets between April and July 1951 and remained in Korea until October 1954, claiming five <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-15">MiG-15</a>s and over five thousand buildings and vehicles destroyed during the war for the loss of almost sixty aircraft, mainly to ground fire.

The squadron re-equipped with <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a>s at Williamtown in November 1956. Two years later it transferred to <a href="RMAF%20Butterworth">RAAF Butterworth</a> in <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a> to join the air campaign against communist guerrillas in the last stages of the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Emergency</a>. The squadron remained at Butterworth during the 1960s, providing regional air defence during the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">"Konfrontasi"</a> between Indonesia and Malaysia. It returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Dassault Mirage III</a> supersonic jet fighters. No. 77 Squadron began converting to Hornets in June 1987. It supplied a detachment of four aircraft to the American base on <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a> in 2001–02, supporting the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">war in Afghanistan</a>, and deployed to the Middle East as part of the <a href="military%20intervention%20against%20ISIL">military intervention against ISIL</a> in 2015–16. Along with its Hornets, the squadron briefly operated <a href="Pilatus%20PC-9">Pilatus PC-9</a>s in the <a href="forward%20air%20control">forward air control</a> role in the early 2000s. The RAAF plans to replace its Hornets with <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II</a> fighters commencing in 2018, and No. 77 Squadron is scheduled to convert to the new type in 2021.

No. 77 Squadron is located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a>, New South Wales, and controlled by <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a>, which is part of <a href="Air%20Combat%20Group%20RAAF">Air Combat Group</a>. No. 81 Wing maintains three fighter squadrons for <a href="Offensive%20counter%20air">offensive and defensive counter-air</a> operations. As well as air-to-air combat, No. 77 Squadron is tasked with land strike, <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> and maritime strike missions. Its staff includes maintenance, supply and other support personnel. The unit motto is "Swift to Destroy" and the crest features an <a href="Chinese%20guardian%20lions">oriental temple lion</a>, a legacy of No. 77 Squadron's role in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Nicknamed the "grumpy monkey", the lion represents "a defender of peace, which, when disturbed, is swift to destroy".

The squadron operates <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> multi-role fighters, the first of which was delivered in June 1987. The twin-engined Hornet is armed with a <a href="20%20mm%20caliber">20 mm cannon</a> and can carry short- and medium-range air-to-air missiles and a variety of guided and unguided air-to-surface ordnance. It can be <a href="aerial%20refueling">refuelled in flight</a> by the RAAF's <a href="Airbus%20A330%20MRTT">Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports</a>. No. 77 Squadron primarily operates the single-seat F/A-18A Hornet; each Hornet squadron also operates one or two F/A-18Bs, a two-seat model used for pilot conversion. Squadron staff are responsible for day-to-day servicing and some heavy maintenance tasks. Other heavy maintenance is carried out by an industry coalition contracted through <a href="Boeing%20Australia">Boeing</a>. No. 77 Squadron regularly undertakes exercises with air forces from South-East Asia, New Zealand and the United States.

As the Japanese advanced in the South West Pacific during early 1942, the RAAF hurriedly established three fighter units—<a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 75</a>, <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">76</a> and 77 Squadrons—equipped with <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk%20variants">Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawks</a> recently delivered from the United States. No. 77 Squadron was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">RAAF Station Pearce</a>, Western Australia, on 16 March, with a complement of three officers and 100 men. Temporarily commanded by <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> D. F. Forsyth, the unit was initially responsible for the defence of <a href="Perth">Perth</a>. Squadron Leader <a href="Dick%20Cresswell">Dick Cresswell</a> assumed command on 20 April. The squadron transferred to <a href="Batchelor%20Airfield">Batchelor Airfield</a> near <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, in August, the first RAAF fighter unit to be stationed in the area. Until this time, air defence over Darwin had been provided by the P-40s flown by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">USAAF</a>'s <a href="49th%20Operations%20Group">49th Fighter Group</a>. No. 77 Squadron moved to another of Darwin's satellite airfields, <a href="Livingstone%20Airfield">Livingstone</a>, in September. Among its pilots was <a href="John%20Gorton">John Gorton</a>, future <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>. No. 77 Squadron saw action defending Darwin from Japanese air raids and claimed its first aerial victory just after 5 a.m. on 23 November 1942, when Cresswell destroyed a <a href="Mitsubishi%20G4M">Mitsubishi "Betty"</a> bomber. It was the first "kill" for an Australian squadron over the mainland, and the first night victory over Australia. As of 24 December, the unit's strength was twenty-four Kittyhawks.

In February 1943, concurrent with <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 1 Wing</a> and its three <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> squadrons becoming operational in the Darwin area, No. 77 Squadron was transferred to <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> in New Guinea. Along with <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 6</a>, 75 and <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAAF">100 Squadrons</a> it came under the control of the newly formed <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 71 Wing</a>, which was part of <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group</a>, the RAAF's main mobile formation in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a>. No. 77 Squadron registered its first daytime victory on 11 April, when a Kittyhawk shot down a <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi Zero</a> taking part in a raid on Allied shipping near <a href="Buna%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buna</a>. Three days later the Japanese attacked Milne Bay; the squadron claimed four bombers and a fighter for the loss of one Kittyhawk. By this time, Allied headquarters had finalised plans for a drive north to the Philippines involving heavy attacks on <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> and the occupation of territory in New Guinea, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a> and the Solomon Islands.
No. 77 Squadron began moving to <a href="Vivigani%20Airfield">Goodenough Island</a> in May 1943, and was fully established and ready for operations by 15 June. As Japanese fighter opposition was limited, the squadron took part in several ground-attack missions in New Britain, armed with <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiary</a> and general-purpose bombs, a practice that had been employed by Kittyhawk units in the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a>. During one such raid on 2 August, Cresswell's designated successor as commanding officer, <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> Daryl Sproule, was forced to crash-land on a beach and was captured and executed by the Japanese. Cresswell remained in command until Squadron Leader "Buster" Brown took over on 20 August. Japanese fighter strength in New Britain and New Guinea increased in September and October, and eight of No. 77 Squadron's Kittyhawks were briefly detached to <a href="Lae%20Nadzab%20Airport">Nadzab</a> as escorts for the <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a>s of <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron</a>, which were supporting the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Australian Division</a>.

In January 1944, No. 77 Squadron took part in the two largest raids mounted by the RAAF to that time, each involving over seventy aircraft attacking targets in New Britain. It was subsequently assigned to <a href="Momote%20Airport">Los Negros</a> in the <a href="Admiralty%20Islands">Admiralty Islands</a>, joining Nos. 76 and <a href="No.%2079%20Squadron%20RAAF">79 Squadrons</a> under <a href="No.%2073%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 73 Wing</a>. No. 77 Squadron's ground party went ashore at Los Negros on 6 March, in the middle of a firefight with Japanese forces. Fourteen of the squadron's Kittyhawks arrived a week later, and another ten on 28 March. Their primary duty was providing air cover for Allied shipping, though no Japanese aircraft were encountered; they also flew ground-attack missions in support of US troops on <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus Island</a>. Following the capture of the Admiralties, which completed the isolation of Rabaul, No. 77 Squadron remained with No. 73 Wing on garrison duty at Los Negros from May to July 1944.

Between 13 August and 14 September 1944, the squadron transferred to <a href="Noemfoor">Noemfoor</a> in western New Guinea to join Nos. 76 and <a href="No.%2082%20Squadron%20RAAF">82 Squadrons</a> as part of <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a> under No. 10 Operational Group (later the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a>), which had taken over the mobile role previously performed by No. 9 Group and was supporting the American landings along the north coast of New Guinea. Cresswell, now a <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, arrived for his second tour of duty as commanding officer on 26 September. Operating P-40N Kittyhawks, No. 77 Squadron bombed Japanese positions on the <a href="Vogelkop%20Peninsula">Vogelkop Peninsula</a> in October and on <a href="Halmahera">Halmahera</a> in November. Cresswell handed over command in March 1945. The squadron moved to <a href="Leo%20Wattimena%20Airport">Morotai</a> on 13 April and conducted ground-attack <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s over the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> until 30 June, when it redeployed with No. 81 Wing to <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Labuan">Labuan</a> to support the <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Australian Division</a> in <a href="North%20Borneo">North Borneo</a> until hostilities ended in August 1945. The squadron's tally of aerial victories during the war was seven aircraft destroyed and four "probables", for the loss of eighteen pilots killed.

No. 77 Squadron began re-equipping with <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>s at Labuan in September 1945. In the wake of Japan's surrender, No. 81 Wing became part of Australia's contribution to the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> (BCOF). No. 77 Squadron was the last of the wing's three flying units to deploy to Japan, arriving at <a href="H%C5%8Dfu%2C%20Yamaguchi">Bofu</a>, a former <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> base, on 21 March 1946. No. 481 (Maintenance) Squadron provided technical service for the Mustangs. Occupation duties proved uneventful, the main operational task being surveillance patrols, but units maintained an intensive training regime and undertook combined exercises with other Allied forces. Many RAAF personnel were accompanied to Japan by their families.

No. 81 Wing transferred to <a href="Iwakuni%2C%20Yamaguchi">Iwakuni</a> in April 1948, the same month that the Federal government decided to reduce Australia's contribution to BCOF, retaining only No. 77 Squadron in Japan. Wing headquarters and No. 481 Squadron disbanded in November 1948, and No. 77 Squadron came under the aegis of a new organisation called RAAF Component. The squadron was now the largest operational unit in the RAAF, with a strength of 299 officers and men, forty Mustangs, three <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s, two <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a> and two <a href="Auster">Auster</a>s. The Dakotas and Austers formed the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight. In December 1949, the Mustangs competed in a gunnery competition against three groups of Mustangs and two groups of <a href="Lockheed%20P-80%20Shooting%20Star">F-80 Shooting Star</a> jets belonging to the US <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28United%20States%29">Far East Air Force</a> (FEAF). No. 77 Squadron's Flight Lieutenant "Bay" Adams achieved the highest individual score of the competition, earning the personal congratulations of Lieutenant Generals <a href="George%20E.%20Stratemeyer">George E. Stratemeyer</a>, commander of FEAF, and <a href="Horace%20Robertson">Horace Robertson</a>, commander of BCOF. The RAAF personnel were preparing to return to Australia when, on 25 June 1950, they were placed on standby for action in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, which had just broken out.

Led by Wing Commander <a href="Lou%20Spence">Lou Spence</a>, No. 77 Squadron was committed to action over Korea as part of <a href="United%20Nations%20Command">United Nations Command</a>, and came under the operational control of the US <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>. The Australian unit was specifically requested by General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, commander of UN forces; the Mustang was considered the best long-range ground-attack aircraft in the theatre, and Stratemeyer contended that No. 77 Squadron was the best Mustang outfit in Japan. The squadron flew its initial escort and patrol sorties from <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Iwakuni">Iwakuni</a> on 2 July 1950, becoming the first non-American UN unit to commence operations. Several Australian families were still living at Iwakuni pending their repatriation from what had become an operational theatre, and could watch the Mustangs depart for missions over Korea.

A <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> incident occurred on 3 July 1950, when No. 77 Squadron attacked a train full of US and South Korean troops on the main highway between <a href="Suwon">Suwon</a> and <a href="Pyongtaek">Pyongtaek</a>, inflicting many casualties, twenty-nine of them fatal. Spence had raised concerns before the mission that the North Koreans could not have penetrated so far south, but was assured by Fifth Air Force controllers that the target was correct; the incident was widely reported in US newspapers but a public statement by Stratemeyer cleared the RAAF of any blame. No. 77 Squadron did not encounter enemy aircraft in the opening phase of the war but often faced intense ground fire. It suffered its first fatality on 7 July when its deputy commander, Squadron Leader Graham Strout, was killed during a raid on <a href="Samcheok">Samchok</a>. He was also the first Australian, and the first non-American UN serviceman, to die in Korea.

For the next two months, equipped with bombs, rockets and <a href="napalm">napalm</a>, No. 77 Squadron supported UN troops retreating before the North Korean advance. To expedite turnaround times between missions, the Mustangs, which were still based at Iwakuni, often refuelled and rearmed at <a href="Daegu%20International%20Airport">Taegu</a> near the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pusan%20Perimeter">Pusan Perimeter</a>, where UN forces made a last-ditch stand on the southern tip of Korea. One of the squadron's Dakotas regularly flew between Iwakuni and Taegu carrying ordnance and spare parts. According to the official history of the Air Force in 1946–71, the squadron's part in the victory at Pusan earned recognition "not only for the RAAF but also Australia at the highest political levels in the United States". During a visit to Japan in August 1950, Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> presented the <a href="Gloucester%20Cup">Gloucester Cup</a> to No. 77 Squadron as the RAAF's most proficient unit of the past year. That month, the squadron claimed thirty-five tanks, 212 other vehicles, eighteen railway engines or cars, and thirteen fuel or ammunition dumps destroyed.
On 3 September 1950, <a href="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> Bill Harrop was forced down behind enemy lines and executed by the North Koreans. Six days later, Spence was killed when his Mustang failed to pull out of a dive during a napalm attack on <a href="Angang-eup">Angang-ni</a>. His death was a serious blow to the squadron, and the RAAF despatched Cresswell on his third tour as commanding officer to replace him. Cresswell arrived at Iwakuni on 17 September and set about restoring morale, undertaking four sorties on his first day of operations three days later. MacArthur had meanwhile launched an <a href="Battle%20of%20Inchon">amphibious landing</a> behind North Korean lines at <a href="Incheon">Inchon</a>, forcing the communists to retreat from the Pusan Perimeter. No. 77 Squadron was transferred from Iwakuni to <a href="Pohang%20Airport">Pohang</a>, South Korea, on 12 October, to support UN forces advancing northwards. On 20 October, the squadron became a component of the RAAF's newly established <a href="No.%2091%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 91 (Composite) Wing</a>, which also included <a href="No.%20391%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 391 (Base) Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%20491%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 491 (Maintenance) Squadron</a>, and <a href="No.%2030%20Transport%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 30 Communications Flight</a>, formerly the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight. The wing and all units except No. 77 Squadron, which came under the operational control of the US <a href="35th%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Group">35th Fighter-Interceptor Group</a>, were headquartered at Iwakuni.

China entered the war in mid-October 1950, as advancing UN troops closed in on the <a href="Yalu%20River">Yalu River</a>. No. 77 Squadron undertook its first sorties against Chinese ground forces on 1 November. The squadron flew its first missions supporting the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> on 5 November, when it attacked Chinese troops opposing the <a href="3rd%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BBattalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a>, at <a href="Pakchon%20County">Pakchon</a>. No. 77 Squadron personnel were housed in tents in freezing conditions at Pohung; two pilots died from burns after a fire in their quarters on 14 November. Two days later the Australians began moving forward with the 35th Group to <a href="Yonpo%20Airfield">Yonpo Airfield</a>, near <a href="Hamhung">Hamhung</a>. North Korea's counter-attack, supported by Chinese forces, led to the squadron being withdrawn to <a href="Pusan">Pusan</a> on 3 December 1950. The communists operated a Russian-designed swept-wing jet fighter, the <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-15">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15</a>, that was far superior to all other fighters in the theatre except the new <a href="North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre">North American F-86 Sabre</a>. Although the MiGs carried Chinese or North Korean markings, they were frequently operated by seasoned <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Forces">Russian air force</a> pilots, whose deployment was unofficial, as the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> was not a combatant in the Korean War.
The RAAF attempted to procure Sabres to replace No. 77 Squadron's Mustangs, but the priority being given to re-equipping the USAF meant that deliveries would not be possible until 1954. The Australian government agreed to purchase <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a> straight-wing jet fighters from Britain as the only viable alternative; the initial order included thirty-six single-seat Mk.8 interceptors and four two-seat Mk.7 trainers. No. 77 Squadron completed its last Mustang mission on 6 April 1951 and returned to Iwakuni the next day to begin converting to Meteors. It subsequently transferred to <a href="Gimpo%20International%20Airport">Kimpo</a>, South Korea, and commenced operations with its new aircraft on 29 July. The squadron deployed twenty-two Meteors at Kimpo, and came under the control of the USAF's <a href="4th%20Fighter%20Wing">4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing</a>. Although it had operated effectively as a ground-attack unit with its Mustangs, No. 77 Squadron's primary role in the RAAF was interception, and it was expected that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as by this stage the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in the theatre.

Wing Commander <a href="Gordon%20Steege">Gordon Steege</a> succeeded Cresswell on 16 August 1951, by which time No. 77 Squadron's Meteors had conducted offensive sweeps up the Yalu River with USAF Sabres, and escorted <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a>es on bombing missions. MiG-15s had appeared on several occasions without engaging the Meteors; it was speculated at the time, and subsequently confirmed, that they had been observing the performance of the newly arrived RAAF jets. No. 77 Squadron's first Meteor fatalities occurred on 22 August, when two aircraft collided in mid-air as they returned to Kimpo after a sweep. The Meteors first engaged MiG-15s on 25 August, but scored no hits. Four days later, eight Meteors and sixteen Sabres fought twelve MiGs; one RAAF pilot ejected when his aircraft was shot down, and a second Meteor was badly damaged. One week later another Meteor suffered severe damage in a dogfight with MiGs. As a result of these clashes, Steege became convinced that the Meteor was outclassed as a fighter. Following discussions with the Fifth Air Force, he decided to take No. 77 Squadron out of its air-to-air combat role and curtail its operations in "<a href="MiG%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BAlley">MiG Alley</a>", the area between the Yalu and <a href="Chongchon%20River">Chongchon River</a>s on North Korea's border with <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>. This caused controversy among those who believed that proper tactics exploiting the Meteor's manoeuvrability and heavy armament would have allowed it to remain competitive as a fighter; for the Australian pilots the change of role amounted to a loss of prestige. The <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, backed the decision, which relegated the squadron mainly to escort duty and local air defence. Morale suffered and it was not until Wing Commander Ron Susans succeeded Steege on 26 December 1951 that the Meteors were once more assigned an offensive role, namely ground attack.
In the intervening period, Flight Lieutenant "Smoky" Dawson registered No. 77 Squadron's first jet combat claim when he damaged a MiG during an escort mission near <a href="Anju%2C%20South%20Pyongan">Anju</a>, North Korea, on 26 September 1951. On 27 October, Flying Officer Les Reading was credited with damaging another MiG while covering B-29s over <a href="Sinanju">Sinanju</a>; it was subsequently confirmed as having been destroyed, making it the squadron's first MiG "kill". The squadron was awarded the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea%20Presidential%20Unit%20Citation">Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation</a> for "exceptionally meritorious service & heroism" on 1 November. On 1 December 1951, <a href="Battle%20of%20Sunchon%20%28air%29">over Sunchon</a>, at least twenty Soviet-piloted MiGs from the <a href="176th%20Guards%20Fighter%20Aviation%20Regiment">176th Guards Fighter Air Regiment</a> ("176 GvIAP") attacked a formation of fourteen Meteors. Both sides apparently overestimated the scale of the battle and the damage inflicted to their opponents: three Meteors—one flown by Pilot Officer <a href="Vance%20Drummond">Vance Drummond</a>—were lost, but Soviet pilots claimed nine destroyed; Australian pilots claimed one MiG shot down and another damaged, from a formation of at least forty, though Russian sources suggest that all the MiGs returned to base and less than twenty-five were available to "176 GvIAP" at the time.

On 8 January 1952, Susans led the squadron on its first ground-attack mission in Meteors, which were armed with eight rockets under the wings as well as their four internal 20 mm cannon, at <a href="Chongdan%20County">Chongdan</a>. They continued to operate mainly in the ground-attack role until the end of the war, but registered two more victories over MiGs near <a href="Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a> on 4 and 8 May 1952. The squadron took part in a mass air strike on 29 August, when 420 UN aircraft attacked Pyongyang. One Meteor was shot down and another damaged by MiGs following a ground-attack mission on 2 October 1952. The squadron played a leading role in the destruction of a large North Korean convoy on 16 March 1953: two Meteors discovered a line of some 140 vehicles in a mountain pass south of <a href="Wonsan">Wonsan</a>, halted it by destroying trucks at the front and rear of the convoy, and then called in further support from Kimpo and the USAF. The Australian aircraft eventually claimed twenty-four trucks out of a total of ninety vehicles destroyed or damaged by UN forces. No. 77 Squadron was credited with downing its last MiG southeast of Pyongyang on 27 March. Squadron Leader Len McGlinchey became its final wartime fatality when his Meteor crashed while taking off from Kimpo on 16 July.

Following the armistice on 27 July 1953, the squadron remained in South Korea on garrison duties—initially at Kimpo, later at <a href="Kunsan%20Air%20Base">Kunsan</a>—until transferring to Iwakuni on 12 October 1954. It departed for Australia on 19 November and arrived in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on 3 December, having been based overseas for eleven years, a record for an RAAF unit. Its performance in the early days of the war has been cited as a factor in the United States' decision to ratify the <a href="ANZUS">ANZUS</a> treaty in September 1951. The squadron's casualty rate in Korea was twenty-five percent killed or captured. Forty-one pilots died, thirty-five from the RAAF and six on exchange from the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. A further seven pilots became prisoners of war. Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty, including over forty Meteors, mostly to ground fire. The squadron flew 18,872 sorties, including 3,872 in Mustangs and 15,000 in Meteors. It was credited with shooting down five MiG-15s and destroying 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, ninety-eight railway engines and carriages, and sixteen bridges.

No. 77 Squadron became operational at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a>, New South Wales, on 4 January 1955. On 21 March, it joined <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 3</a> and 75 Squadrons as part of <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 Wing</a>, which had recently been reorganised following garrison duty in Malta. No. 77 Squadron ceased Meteor operations in August 1956 and re-formed on 19 November equipped with <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a>s. Between October 1958 and February 1959, Nos. 3 and 77 Squadrons deployed with No. 78 Wing to <a href="RMAF%20Butterworth">RAAF Butterworth</a> in <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a>, to support Commonwealth forces in the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Emergency</a>. The Sabres were among the first to wear the RAAF's recently introduced "leaping kangaroo" roundel. No. 478 (Maintenance) Squadron provided servicing for the aircraft. No. 77 Squadron undertook its first mission dive-bombing communist guerrillas on 13 August 1959, and flew two more ground-attack sorties on 10 June 1960. The RAAF pilots also sometimes tried to startle the communists by diving their jets through the sound barrier to create <a href="sonic%20boom">sonic boom</a>s that simulated the sound of artillery fire. Two No. 77 Squadron Sabres collided in mid-air on 22 July, but both pilots ejected safely. The Emergency was declared officially over on 31 July 1960.

The RAAF squadrons remained at Butterworth as part of Australia's contribution to the <a href="Far%20East%20Strategic%20Reserve">Commonwealth Strategic Reserve</a>. Eight Sabres, along with their pilots and ground crew, were detached from No. 77 Squadron in May 1962 to re-form No. 79 Squadron at <a href="Ubon%20Royal%20Thai%20Air%20Force%20Base">Ubon</a>, Thailand. The Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore to give the appearance that they were not drawn from the Strategic Reserve, thus preserving Malaysia's neutrality. Personnel and equipment from Nos. 3 and 77 Squadrons continued to rotate through No. 79 Squadron on a regular basis. The Butterworth-based Sabres, armed with <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">Sidewinder missiles</a>, were responsible for regional air defence during the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">"Konfrontasi"</a> between Indonesia and Malaysia from July 1963 until August 1966, though no combat took place. From 26 October until 27 November 1965, a detachment of six Sabres from No. 77 Squadron was based at Labuan to conduct combat patrols over the Indonesian–Malaysian border on Borneo. Following the disbandment of No. 78 Wing in November 1967, No. 77 Squadron became an independently operating unit under the command of Headquarters RAAF Butterworth.

No. 77 Squadron returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Dassault Mirage III</a> supersonic fighters, undertaking its initial flights on 7 July. The Mirages were charged with interception, high- and low-angle bombing, close air support, and photo reconnaissance; their armament included <a href="30%20mm%20caliber">30 mm cannon</a>, Sidewinder missiles and conventional bombs. No. 77 Squadron's prime role was ground attack, although none of the RAAF's Mirages ever saw combat. No. 481 Squadron was responsible for day-to-day servicing, as well as most heavy maintenance. No. 77 Squadron suffered its first fatal Mirage accident on 3 April 1973, when an aircraft crashed during a training flight at low altitude. Another pilot was killed when his Mirage hit the water during formation flying at night on 24 June 1976.
The squadron began training with <a href="laser-guided%20bomb">laser-guided bomb</a>s in October 1980. As of March 1984, its aircraft complement was nineteen Mirages. Two pilots died following a mid-air collision at low level on 9 April that year.
On 1 January 1985, in preparation for the introduction of the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> to Australian service, No. 77 Squadron took over all Mirages and <a href="Aermacchi%20MB-326">Macchi MB-326s</a> of <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit</a>, assuming responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses. The transfer swelled the squadron's strength to fifty-six aircraft—forty Mirages and sixteen Macchis—and over 500 officers and men, making it the largest operational unit in the RAAF. Along with a heavily expanded training program, and its existing Australian Army close support role, No. 77 Squadron's fleet support commitment was increased to take up the slack resulting from the diminution of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>'s fixed-wing capability. Its last fatal accident with the Mirage occurred on 2 May 1986; the aircraft crashed into water during air-to-air gunnery practice.

The squadron began phasing out the Mirage in July 1986, and took delivery of its first Hornet on 29 June 1987. It had come under the control of a newly re-formed No. 81 Wing that February. No. 77 Squadron's last Mirage departed Williamtown on 27 November 1987. Hornet maintenance at Williamtown was the responsibility of No. 481 Wing, which had evolved from No. 481 Squadron. One of No. 77 Squadron's Hornets crashed near <a href="Rockhampton">Rockhampton</a>, Queensland, on 19 May 1992, killing the pilot and his passenger, a <a href="Defence%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Organisation">defence scientist</a>. In September that year, the squadron undertook a proving exercise over <a href="Halifax%20Bay">Halifax Bay</a> in <a href="Far%20North%20Queensland">Far North Queensland</a>, when four of its Hornets—refuelled in flight on the round trip from Williamtown by a <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a> tanker—became the first jet aircraft in Australia to drop <a href="aerial%20mine">aerial mine</a>s. No. 481 Wing was reorganised as No. 402 Wing in July 1996; the latter transferred its functions to No. 81 Wing's flying squadrons in July 1998.
No. 77 Squadron operated a detachment of <a href="Pilatus%20PC-9">Pilatus PC-9</a> aircraft in the <a href="forward%20air%20control">forward air control</a> role from 2000 until 2003; this role was subsequently filled by the <a href="Forward%20Air%20Control%20Development%20Unit%20RAAF">Forward Air Control Development Unit</a>. Four Hornets from No. 77 Squadron were deployed to protect the US base at <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> between November 2001 and February 2002, during the early phase of the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">war in Afghanistan</a>. In March 2006, the squadron sent a detachment of aircraft to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">RAAF Base East Sale</a>, Victoria, to assist with security for the <a href="2006%20Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth Games</a> being held in Melbourne. No. 77 Squadron deployed to the Middle East in September 2015 as part of <a href="Operation%20Okra">Operation Okra</a>, Australia's contribution of the <a href="military%20intervention%20against%20ISIL">military intervention against ISIL</a>; it handed over to the next rotation, from <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron RAAF</a>, in April 2016.

The Australian government plans to replace the Hornet force with seventy-two <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II</a> fighters. Under the <a href="Defence%20Materiel%20Organisation">Defence Materiel Organisation</a>'s Project AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B, the first Lightnings will be delivered to the RAAF in late 2018. Each of No. 81 Wing's three fighter squadrons will operate sixteen of the new aircraft. No. 77 Squadron is scheduled to begin conversion in 2021; RAAF Hornet operations are expected to cease the following year. In December 2017, No. 77 Squadron received all of No. 3 Squadron's Hornets and most of its personnel when that unit was re-formed as an F-35 unit. The aircraft and personnel were assigned to a newly established "C" Flight within No. 77 Squadron.

Design A-150 battleship

Design A-150, popularly known as the "Super Yamato" class, was a planned <a href="ship%20class">class</a> of <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. In keeping with the Navy's long tradition, they were designed to be qualitatively superior to battleships that might be faced in battle, such as those from the United States or Great Britain. As part of this, the class would have been armed with six guns, the largest weapons carried aboard any warship in the world. Design work on the A-150s began after the preceding in 1938–1939 and was mostly finished by early 1941, when the Japanese began focusing on <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s and other smaller warships in preparation for the coming conflict. No A-150 would ever be <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a>, and many details of the class' design were destroyed near the end of the war.

In the 1930s, the Japanese government began a shift towards <a href="ultranationalist">ultranationalist</a> militancy. Planners envisioned an empire stretching from Japan to the resource-rich European colonies in Southeast Asia, and defensible islands in the Pacific Ocean (the <a href="Greater%20East%20Asia%20Co-Prosperity%20Sphere">Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</a>). The extensive distances involved, and the likelihood of this expansion leading to a confrontation with the United States, led the Japanese to build and maintain a large fleet that could seize and hold onto these territories. The U.S. posed a particular problem for Japan, as it possessed significantly greater industrial power, and several leading members of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> had pledged "to outbuild Japan three to one in a naval race".

The Imperial Japanese Navy had recognized since at least 1896 that the country could not outproduce its potential opponents, and therefore insisted that its ships had to be more powerful than foreign equivalents. It established this qualitative lead at various times over the next 40 years, with the s just before World War I, the s at the end of that war, and the s in the 1930s. The A-150s were designed according to that doctrine to continue their qualitative superiority in battleships over their mostly likely opponents, the United States and Great Britain.

Early conceptions for what would become the A-150 battleships called for eight or nine 51-centimeter guns in double or triple turrets, as the successful construction of a gun in 1920–1921 made the Japanese confident that such a large weapon could be built. The designers hoped to give the ships a top speed of , which would give them a comfortable margin over the American s. However, these grand specifications were curtailed when tests culminated in a ship that had a <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a> of some ; it was felt that ships of this size would be "too large and too expensive".

Formal design studies began in 1938–1939. They initially focused on a ship closer to the displacement of the preceding , on which plans had just been completed, albeit one mounting six 51-centimeter guns. As the Japanese expected that the Americans would ascertain the true characteristics of the "Yamato" class—especially its primary armament of guns, which would become the largest naval weapons in use in the world—they hoped that the 51-centimeter guns would outperform any American response to the "Yamato"s' smaller guns.

Plans for the A-150s were finished in early 1941, for most intents and purposes. However, these were destroyed at the end of the war, along with most of the other documentation relating to the class. The general destruction of records and Japan's extensive efforts (before and during the war) to keep any information about the ships out of the hands of foreign nations severely limited the amount of information on the ships available to historians. This is, for example, why the A-150's exact specifications are up to some debate. The displacement was to be similar to the "Yamato" class, which was around , and the <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was probably going to be 46 centimeters thick. This was so large that steel mills in Japan were incapable of manufacturing it. Instead, two layers of armor plates would have been used, despite its reduced effectiveness as compared to a single plate of the same total thickness.

The design of the A-150s called for a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of six 45-<a href="caliber%23Caliber%20as%20measurement%20of%20length">caliber</a> 51-centimeter guns in three twin <a href="gun%20turret">turrets</a>. These would have been the largest ever fitted to a <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>, dwarfing the 46-centimeter guns mounted on the "Yamato" class, and were a key factor in historians William H. Garzke and Robert O. Dulin's argument that the A-150s would have been the "most powerful battleships in history". By 1941, one—possibly two—of the 51-centimeter guns were being constructed at the <a href="Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal">Kure Naval Arsenal</a> and detailed designs of their turrets were drawn up. The turrets would have weighed and each gun would have massed . They would have had a total length of and the <a href="gauge%20%28bore%20diameter%29">bore</a> length was to have been around . The <a href="armor-piercing%20shell">armor-piercing shell</a>s would have weighed .

The composition of the A-150's <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> is not fully known. Historians Eric Lacroix and Linton Wells have written that Japanese designers were considering mounting a large number of 65-caliber <a href="10%20cm/65%20Type%2098%20naval%20gun">Type 98</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s, though this was not final. These guns had a maximum elevation of +90°, which gave them an effective ceiling of and a horizontal range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , although resulting wear on the barrels reduced their designed lifespan to only about 350 <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a>. They were able to fire 15–19 rounds per minute.

As war with the United States became increasingly likely over the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>, and particularly after the Japanese <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20French%20Indochina">seizure of French Indochina</a> in mid-1940, all design work on battleships was diverted in early 1941—even though the A-150's design was nearly complete—in order to focus on higher-priority warships like <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s and <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s. Two A-150s, provisionally designated as Warships Number 798 and 799, were projected in a 1942 building program. Under this plan, 798 would have been built in the same dock as , while 799 would be built in <a href="Kure">Kure</a> in the same dock as after a fourth "Yamato"-class ship was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a>. The ships would have then have been finished in 1946–1947, but the war's turn against the Japanese after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> meant that the need for ships other than battleships never abated.
